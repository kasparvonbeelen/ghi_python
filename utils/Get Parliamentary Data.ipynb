      "[['uk.proc.d.1978-02-21.10.1.2', 1639, 'uk.m.16771', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i beg to move, that leave be given to bring in a bill to make further provision with respect to the protection of the life of a viable foetus; to amend section 4 of the abortion act 1967; to regulate the provision of payment for consultation and advice in relation to the termination of pregnancy; and to make provision with respect to bodies corporate. i rise to ask leave to introduce this short bill to amend the abortion act 1967 by implementing three of the most important recommendations of the select committee of this house appointed in february 1975. in so doing i am providing the house with an opportunity to assert its will in a manner of major social and parliamentary importance.\\n           as hon. members know, on every occasion that the issue of abortion law has been raised in recent years a majority has signified its wish for the law to be clarified and amended, only to find itself frustrated by procedural or other considerations. that is no way to deal with so grave a matter. yet it is natural enough for all hon. members in their hearts to wish to still the controversy which continues to surround this subject. the modest measure i now propose is advanced sincerely with that wish in mind.\\n           the house will recall that the bill introduced by the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) was given a second reading on 7th february 1975 by a substantial majority. it will recall, too, that in that debate the right hon. member for plymouth, devonport (dr. owen), who was then the minister of state for health, defended the government\\'s proposal to refer the bill to a select committee on the ground that this was the best way to make progress in \"a difficult area\". the house will recall his advice that the bill might be delayed if left to the normal procedure and was likely to reach the statute book more quickly if it were to go to a select committee.\\n           the house agreed with him, and the select committee was set up. but while the government accepted its interim recommendations for administrative action in october 1975, they failed to do anything about the recommendation for legislation which the committee, reestablished in the next session by yet another overwhelming vote, made in its report in july 1976. in its report the committee asserted that it was six years since the lane committee was set up. it was invited to recommend changes in the law and it did so. to allay the disquiet which occasioned its appointment, and to fulfil the expectations of government action which accompanied the publication of the lane report, we believe that the government is under an obligation to introduce legislation without delay. we … therefore, recommend that legislation to implement this report be introduced by the government forthwith. that report and a later one dealing with research into the after effects of abortion and the question of conscientious objection were both ignored by the government. the house gave its answer to that by giving a second reading on 25th february last year to a bill introduced by my hon. friend the member for buckingham (mr. benyon). that bill sought to introduce most of the recommendations of the select committee and it completed its committee stage last july. but no further time was made available for it, despite the view of many of us that the government were morally committed to providing time.\\n           the house may care to reflect on the fact that new zealand, a country which pioneered enlightened health and social legislation, set up a royal commission dealing with abortion which has been strongly influenced by the work of our own select committee. it is ironic, is it not, mr. speaker, that the new zealand royal commission has just proposed the adoption of a number of recommendations of our select committee, although these have not been implemented here?\\n           i turn briefly to my proposed bill. i wish to make it plain that it will not interfere in any way with the criteria for lawful abortion laid down in the 1967 act. it is limited solely to three important matters of principle.\\n           the first concerns the upper time limit for abortions. it is now widely accepted in all civilised countries that abortion should not be lawful after the stage when a child may be viable, that is, capable of [...] outside the womb. in this country the upper limit is 28 weeks as a result of a presumption in the infant life (preservation) act 1929.\\n           sir john peel, former president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, told the select committee that within recent years there were quite a number of well-documented cases where a foetus of less than 28 weeks had survived, two within his personal experience.\\n           the lane committee recommended a 24-week limit, but the bma told the lane committee and the select committee that it favoured a 20-week limit. in its comments on the lane report it said: even with the reduction from 28 to 24 weeks … the position still exists that owing to an error in the calculation of date a foetus intended for destruction could be born alive and be capable of functioning as a self-sustaining whole independent of any connection with the mother. the report of the peel advisory group also recommended that 20 weeks should be regarded as prima facie proof of viability. sir stanley clayton, then president of the royal college, advocated a 20-week limit when he appeared before the committee, but rightly said that there should be a safeguard in situations of medical risk of abnormality in the child, in which case later abortions should be permitted.\\n           a gallup poll last year among gynaecologists showed 87 per cent. in favour of a 20-week limit or less. my bill will reflect these views. in short, it will end the destruction of a baby capable of survival under 28 weeks.\\n           the second purpose of the bill is to strengthen and clarify the provision in section 4 of the 1967 act regarding conscientious objection to taking part in an abortion. my object here is to ensure that the original intentions of the 1967 act are clearly understood and respected. they are not clearly understood and respected at present.\\n           the select committee received evidence that in particular some nurses were distressed by having to take part in abortions, and that while the position of catholic nurses was well understood, that of non-catholic nurses sometimes was not. the royal college of nursing indicated in evidence to the select committee its concern over the problem.\\n           the select committee also considered that the proviso in the 1967 act that the burden of proof of conscientious objection should rest on the person claiming to rely on it was ureasonable. my bill will give statutory clarification of the grounds on which conscientious objection can be based. this is essential, in my view, if nursing is to continue to attract and to hold young people of a caring and dedicated nature.\\n           the third purpose of my bill is to require that all pregnancy advisory bureaux which charge fees should be licensed by the secretary of state, as proposed by the lane committee. a condition of licensing should be that these bureaux must have no financial connections with abortion clinics. this was recommended by the select committee in view of the evidence it received about financial abuses and the importance placed by many witnesses on unbiased counselling.\\n           the department of health and social security gave the select committee a list of financial links between abortion clinics and pregnancy advisory bureaux. i give just two examples. first, the directors of the company running the metropolitan pregnancy control centre are also the directors of the raleigh nursing home. therefore, any woman who goes to the centre and after counselling decides to go on with her pregnancy is likely to represent a loss of profit to the directors.\\n           secondly, the pregnancy advisory service is a registered charity which has a business arrangement with the fairfield nursing home in return for its exclusive use of the home for its patients, half the profits being remitted to the pas. therefore, every woman referred to the nursing home after counselling by the pas means more money for that organisation. significantly, in 1975, 90 per cent. of the women counselled by pas were referred for abortion.\\n           the select committee considered that such obvious conflicts of interest were clearly undesirable and recommended against exemption from the severance requirement for charities.\\n           until such time as the national health service can provide proper facilities for all lawful abortions—and that is what should happen—my sponsors and i would be prepared to consider exemption for bona fide charities, provided, first, that there were regulations to ensure that abortion on request, which was never intended by the 1967 act, did not take place, and, secondly, that there was ultimate parliamentary control permitting revocation of a licence.\\n           i am, of course, aware that unless the government provide time for my bill, if the house gives me leave to introduce it, it is unlikely to make progress. my purpose today, therefore, is to give the house an opportunity to reassert its will with regard to amending the 1967 act and to persuade the government to provide the necessary time.\\n           but the bill is an opportunity for something more. while on both flanks of this controversy there will always be those who believe that no abortion should be available, save where the mother\\'s life is at risk, and those who believe that abortion should be available on demand, the overwhelming majority of people want a middle way conducted responsibly within a framework of humane law. i believe that my bill will help to strengthen that framework.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1978, 2, 21, 0, 0),

bill to restrict the operation of the 1967 act, and because it is in the teeth of medical opinion.\\n           i supported the bill that preceded the 1967 act throughout its committee stage, and i have since defended the act whenever it has come under attack. the purpose of the motion is to serve as the opening shot in a public campaign to put pressure on the government to give time on the floor of the house for a restrictive amendment of the 1967 act.\\n           i greatly respect my hon. friend the member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine) and his right to his strong views on this subject, made clear over many years. but i beg leave to dispute the claim that he is not opposed to the act and that he is, as it were, the moderate man in the middle.\\n           in 1967, my hon. friend opposed the third reading of the bill. in 1976 he is reported in his local press to have spoken of the wanton killing of unborn infants\", thus using the emotive language of the anti-abortion organisation, the society for the protection of unborn children, whose rally he was attending. my hon. friend has consistently supported attempts to restrict and disrupt the work of the two charities, the british pregnancy advisory service and the pregnancy advisory service—of which more in a moment.\\n           i should like to deal shortly with three main aims of the bill so far as i can judge them, in the absence of any text from the press reports and statements by my hon. friend.\\n           i begin with the time limit. it is only in the most exceptional cases that abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy are sanctioned. eighty per cent. are performed before the twelfth week and 99 per cent. before the twentieth week whilst arguments are being advanced for reducing the upper limit below the 28 weeks fixed by the infant life (preservation) act 1929, we believe that consideration must be given to those women who find, from foetal diagnosis late in pregnancy, that their child will be born with a congenital deformity and who will wish to have the opportunity of deciding whether to continue that particular pregnancy.\\n           before legislation is embarked upon to fix a lower limit, it would be as well to wait and see what further advances may be made in pre-natal diagnosis, which will have a bearing on the upper limit for abortion.\\n           there is another important factor. until, in certain areas, the restrictions of the abortion service under the nhs are removed, and with them the risk of delay, it would, in my view, be too soon to change the existing time limit.\\n           there is no need for new legislation. the exceptional cases over 20 weeks are permitted only where there is dire need and on medical judgment. the law must leave some room for medical judgment by those who are responsible for dealing with these problems as part of their day-to-day work. the medical profession itself can see no reason for a change at this stage.\\n           as to conscience, the 1967 act gives rights of conscience in this matter to the medical profession. my hon. friend seeks to widen that conscience clause. here i shall make only this point. my hon. friend wishes, against medical opinion, to extend the rights of conscience, but he says nothing of extending the rights of women in distress to know whether they are being refused a termination by a doctor, not on medical grounds but because of his conscientious objection to abortion. surely women in such cases have a right to know such grounds and a right to be advised to seek another doctor who will be prepared to advise not on his personal conscience but on medical grounds. there is a special difficulty when the only consultant available in an area refuses an abortion on grounds of conscience. dangerous delays can follow. i repeat: the representative organisations of the medical profession see no need for a change.\\n           the most important practical effect of the bill, however, so far as we can judge its intentions, would be to hinder the operations of the two charitable agencies, the british pregnancy advisory service and the pregnancy advisory service, london. these have grown up to provide a service under the act in areas in which either the national health service has not yet developed its own services for women needing an abortion or such a service has been denied by local consultants. to disrupt the services of these two charities would once again drive women in such areas to back street abortions.\\n           fears about abuses, expressed three years ago, have been dispelled, either be because the administrative controls imposed by the dhss have been improved and more widely publicised, or as a result of investigations revealing that there was no truth in the allegations in the first place. the most notorious of these were contained in the book \"babies for burning\", which shocked the public and shocked parliament. the authors have since withdrawn their allegations and imputations against the bpas in a statement in open court on 18th january this year. they apologise for any distress and damage which their allegations have caused and recognise that bpas exercises the greatest care in the employment of qualified medical practitioners, and in selecting and training its counsellors. the two charities were set up initially to help women in certain areas where senior medical staff made clear their objections to legal powers for other than strictly medical reasons. this attitude has meant that women have far more chance of obtaining an nhs abortion in some parts of the country than in others. for example, in hartlepool 96 per cent. of the women who have abortions obtain them through the national health service, while in wolverhampton only 7 per cent. have national health service abortions. the charitable services exist to level out this imbalance.\\n           when the british pregnancy advisory service and the pregnancy advisory service were set up in 1968, their founders hoped that the need for their services would be short-lived. but 10 years later 50 per cent. of abortions are still having to be carried out in the private sector. wrecking the charitable services can only lead to the exploitation on a grand scale of women who would be forced to resort to back street abortions, pay large fees or be compelled to continue with an unwanted pregnancy.\\n           the sponsor of the motion said over the radio this morning: my view is that all abortions ought to be caried out within the nhs. so do the two charitable organisations which i have just described. but it would, in my judgment, be wrong to disrupt their work until the needs of women for abortion under the law can be fully met by the nhs.\\n           we should, i believe, listen to what the british medical association has to say—and on other matters in the past, and publicly, the sponsor of the motion has paid great regard to that body. at its annual conference in july 1977, the bma voted against any amendment of the 1967 act. in a letter dated 17th february 1978 about the motion that we are now debating, the british medical association reaffirmed that view. it stated: we do not, therefore, see the necessity for a further amendment bill as now proposed. i hope, mr. speaker, that in view of this medical opinion and the need of women in distress, the motion will be given very little support.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1978, 2, 21, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1978-02-21.10']]\n"

      "[['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.3', 1101, 'uk.m.17903', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i beg to move, that the bill be now read a second time.\\n           this is the second occasion on which i have had the privilege of finding my name included in the list of successful candidates in the ballot for private members\\' bills. as i have had the experience once before, it may be thought that i should be prepared for what will happen today. on the last occasion, shortly after my bill had been published, i was sent for by the under-secretary of state for the home department. my bill related to firearms in the countryside, and i was told that it was quite unacceptable to the government. another ten days went by and i was sent for by the minister of state, who told me in no uncertain terms that the first opinion which i had had from the government had been reinforced by subsequent thought.\\n           i went away at the christmas recess in a state of despondency. before i came back, there was a little difficulty regarding some policemen who had been shot in london. the government had had a quick change of mind. i was told that, if i were minded to withdraw my bill, it would be incorporated in a government measure which would be larger and better than mine. that is what, in fact, happened.\\n           on this occasion, when i selected the present bill as the one which i wished to introduce, i heard nothing from the government. i hope that that means that there is as favourable a brief as may be in the hands of the hon. gentleman the joint under-secretary of state for the department of health and social security, whose versatility in the subjects with which he has to deal we all admire, and that we shall be able to proceed with the matter in that way.\\n           when i found my name in the successful list, i was subjected to the usual bombardment by people who had bills which they thought would be suitable for me to introduce. the reason why i selected this one was that it had the backing of the two responsible professional organisations. i thought that, if they wanted the bill, it was something to which i should lend my support. the bill is simple. it has a second clause, but the material part is in clause 1.\\n           just to have it on the record, perhaps i should say that the abortion act, 1967, section 1(1), provides that …a person shall not be guilty of an offence under the law relating to abortion when a pregnancy is terminated by a registered medical practitioner if two registered medical practitioners are of the opinion, formed in good faith \"— and then the qualifications are set out.\\n           my bill would substitute for the words, \"by a registered medical practitioner if two registered medical practitioners\", the following: by or under the supervision of a consultant gynaecologist in the national health service or a medical practitioner of equivalent status approved by the secretary of state for social services for the purpose of this act, if the medical practitioner carrying out or supervising the operation and another medical practitioner\"— and then the words following as before— are of the opinion, formed in good faith…\". that is a short, easily understood and simple amendment of the act, and, as i have said, it is sought by the two responsible professional organisations. i have no doubt that hon. members will have seen the letter in the times yesterday signed by the chairman of the council of the british medical association and the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, in which the purpose of the bill was concisely set out. i shall adopt the explanation which they gave in commending the bill to the house. at the end of their letter they said: a number of motives have been ascribed to the bill, but we would like to make it absolutely clear that in giving effect to our views it seeks only to safeguard the interests of the health of the women concerned … that is the point to which i shall direct my observations today.\\n           there have been suggestions that the medical profession is not behind the bill. in two large organisations it is impossible to achieve 100 per cent. unanimity. but the principles of the bill were set out in the annual report of the council in the british medical journal of 6th may, 1967. they were considered and approved by the annual representative meeting of the association in july, 1967. they have been approved in each subsequent year, and only this week the two responsible officers of the two organisations concerned reinforced the view that that is what the profession wants.\\n           i find it somewhat difficult, therefore, to understand why there are people who suggest that this would not be a desirable course to take. one of my hon. friends—fortunately, i do not see him present at the moment—came to me and said that he was in favour of abortion on demand. that is an understandable view, and, if that be the view which should be taken, i can fully understand why he would not wish the amendment to be accepted. but for those who accept the more responsible approach to the matter, i commend the remarks of the hon. gentleman the member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. david steel) on 21st july 1966—reported in col. 1075 of the official report that it was not the intention of the promoters of what became the abortion bill to leave a wide open door for abortion on demand. i hope, therefore, that he will take the view that this is a helpful and desirable amendment and that i shall have his support. i am not entirely convinced that i shall, but i can at least express the hope.\\n           i have noticed that the hon. gentleman has from time to time claimed that certain things had flowed from the passage of his bill. i shall say a word about one of them in a moment, but i wish to tell the house at this point that when i was in hong kong two or three months ago i picked up the newspaper which was delivered to my bedroom in the morning, the south china morning post, and saw the headline there, sydney rivalling london as abortion capital\". is that something for which the hon. gentleman wishes to take credit? i have no doubt that it has been a direct result of the act he introduced.\\n           shortly after that i was in denmark—\\n

has been signed by some general practitioners and sent to some hon. members. i have received two copies. one came from three doctors in a partnership in my constituency, and one was sent by a general practitioner. but the one to which i particularly want to refer was sent to one of my hon. friends and signed by one of his general practitioners. the original draft reads as follows: the abortion act, as it stands at present, is a good law and generally works effectively for my patients' welfare. i strongly oppose any amendment to the act which would limit my choice of surgeon and the patient's chance of obtaining a legal abortion with the minimum of delay. i therefore urge you to oppose any such restrictive measure. this document was signed by a general practitioner in my hon.

pleading. the irvine bill is intended to limit the more blatantly commercial exploitation of the new law which is largely carried out in london. that is the view which i hope will commend itself to the house. i am sure that it is accepted by the vast majority of the medical profession.\\n           for the benefit of the general practioner who is anxious about the position, may i refer again to the wording of the bill, which makes it clear that the general practitioner is the person to whom a girl will originally go, and it will be he who passes her on to a consultant gynaecologist.\\n           as regards consultants, i am advised that this is a designation which technically arises only under the national health service, but that in fact many national health service consultants hold part-time appointments, so that it is quite possible to consult them outside the service.\\n           the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. david steel) claimed outside the house last night, i think, and did so in the house as recently as last 15th july, that: the limited evidence we are able to gather —for example, from the london emergency bed centre figures—shows that we are achieving the objective of reducing criminal abortions. the figures given by that centre show that in the first quarter of 1966 there were 1,363 emergency admissions for spontaneous or incomplete abortions, whereas during the first quarter of this year the figure was down to 870. this is a very satisfactory development.\"—[official report. 15th july, 1969; vol. 787, c. 414–15] there was a letter in the new, statesman on 6th february on behalf of the abortion law reform association, answering a letter which had asked whether there was any good reason for support for the abortion act. the letter said: here is one…in 1966, the emergency bed service, london, handled more than 5,000 abortions, which formed more than 11 per cent. of its total cases. in 1967 the abortion act was passed. by 1969 the total of abortions had fallen to some 3,300 and now form only 6·7 per cent. of all emergencies. this striking result probably explains why some of the more extremist opponents of reform are so anxious to wreck the abortion act without giving it a fair chance. the hon. member for roxburgh, sal-kirk and peebles and the abortion law reform association have conveniently omitted figures, giving only those for the past year or two. the facts are that from april, 1964 to april, 1965 there were 5,816 admissions. the figures for the following years were as follows: 1965–66, 5,670; 1966–67, 4,932; 1967–68, 4,619; and 1968–69, 3,631. the hon. gentleman claims for the act the whole credit for the reduction in the years after its introduction. he omits to say that, for reasons i cannot explain, the figures have been declining rapidly over a period of five years. i quote those five years only because they happen to be the years quoted in the report to which my attention was directed.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.10', 46, 'uk.m.17989', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'the hon. gentleman used the

figure was 269. i think that with very little difficulty the minister would be able to select some or all of those people who would be in a position to give specialised attention to girls who required it. the fact is that 1,877 people with specialised training are available, which means a total of four operations a week. even allowing for conscientious objections, if one divides the number of operations by the number of people available to do them, i think that one comes to a very satisfactory figure.\\n           there are, however, other people whom i suggest the secretary of state should consider. there are professors and their deputies at various universities who are specialising in gynaecology. i am told that there are 50 or more such people. in addition there are people who have retired from service overseas, people who, at 65, after a lifetime of service as gynaecologists, would be capable of going on sessional fees to look at some of the cases. if the minister has a brief which says that this is something which the ministry would not wish to undertake, i ask him to look at the mental health act, 1959, where a similar arrangement was made, and at the cremation acts, where the same thing happens.\\n           there is a suggestion that because of the shortage of consultants there is a long waiting list, my inquiries show that there is no evidence whatever of a waiting list for women requiring abortions. i suggest to the minister that he should have no difficulty in getting over the problem of finding an adequate number of people to deal with this problem.\\n           i commend to the minister the remarks of the hon. member for lichfield and tamworth (mr. snow) who then occupied the exalted position now occupied by the minister. when discussing an amendment, not precisely in the terms of the amendment to the law which i am suggesting, but the same sort of arguments were being used, the hon. gentleman said: but i am advised that the procedure is not without risk, and that the requirements of this amendment would reduce the risk to the lowest possible level. i am sure that this is something we would all wish. the safest circumstances for the termination of a pregnancy are those in which the staff are experienced in operative gynaecological procedures and the facilities are suitable for carrying out those procedures. i believe that responsible medical opinion would expect such precautions to be taken. that is what i am asking the minister to say. that is what the amendment asks him to say, and that is what i hope he will say.\\n           the hon. member for lichfield and tamworth went on to say: equally, it would not be possible under these particular powers regarding approved places for the minister to stop racketeering. it would not be proper for him to seek to control the fees charged by the nursing home itself, nor could he in any way control the fees charged by doctors coming in to conduct operations. the hon. member the sponsor of the bill said that he believed that the twin provisions of control over the place and notification give precisely the kind of control which we require…\" —[official report. standing committee f, 8th march, 1967; c. 398–9.] that was rejected by the then parliamentary secretary, and i hope that the minister will today feel that my bill will enable him to exercise the control which he otherwise might find it difficult to do.\\n           a little later in the committee proceedings the then minister said: it seems to me that it is for the committee to decide whether or not the average patient would prefer to put up with some inconvenience in return for the knowledge that the operation would be in the hands of someone about whose competence there could be no doubt.\"—[official report, standing committee f, 8th march. 1967; c. 403.] that is what i am asking the minister to do.\\n           since i announced that i was going to adopt this bill as my own, i have had a number of cases reported to me. some of them have been reported in the press and some have not. one girl came to see me last week. after three hours in a clinic she was sent home, and two days later she had to go into a national health service hospital, where she was desperately ill for six weeks. another girl, about whom i heard yesterday, was in a clinic for one hour, and subsequently had to spend 13 days in a national health service hospital because of the problems which had arisen. another girl said that the conditions in the place to which she went were rather like piccadilly circus. only this morning a consultant telephoned me to say that during the last six weeks three cases of severe septicaemia had come to him for care after visiting one of these clinics.\\n           those are conditions which we do not want to perpetuate. i think that the whole house should do something to deal with them. a girl who goes into a clinic of that sort needs to be cared for after she has left. she requires something more than one hour there, and then to be sent out and left to her own devices. she needs to be under observation for three days. she needs to be in a place where proper antiseptic precautions are taken, and not in a piccadilly circus type of organisation. i want to see that humanity is offered to girls in this condition, and that they get proper medical care, and i therefore commend the bill to the house.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.34', 132, 'uk.m.22552',

see it improved so that it is easier for women to get terminations. a similar public opinion poll carried out among doctors showed that 66 per cent. of general practitioners in the united kingdom thought that the act should be left as it is or should be changed to make it easier to obtain legal abortions, and only 28 per cent. thought that it should be changed to make it more difficult. it therefore appears that the majority of doctors who are in the closest contact with their patients, namely, the general practitioners, are satisfied with the bill or want to see it improved, to the extent that women can obtain legal abortions more easily. that is an effective counter to the letter printed in the tunes which the hon. member quoted.\\n           in my view it is rather early to make any sort of definitive proposal to change the act. it has been in operation for only 18 months. i agree with what sir george godber said at a lecture in london last june, namely—i hope that the hon. member for rye is listening; i can waste the time of the house if he wants me to. i am going to quote what sir george godber said. i take it that the hon. member knows who he is. at a public lecture in london last june—when the act had been in operation for about 15 months—he said: the most important effect of the act—the saving in human misery—cannot be expressed in statistical terms. that is a very important comment on the act, coming from that quarter.\\n           the hon. member told us the number of legal terminations which are now being carried out, but i do not think that he distinguished between the number of terminations being carried out in national health service hospitals and in the private sector, respectively. what has been most encouraging since the act was passed is the fact that the percentage of terminations carried out under excellent conditions in national health service hospitals is steadily increasing. over 65 per cent. are now carried out in national health service hospitals under the supervision of gynaecologists and senior people with constant practice in this kind of work.\\n           the number of patients being treated by private clinics, which now have to be licensed by my right hon. friend before they can obtain permission to carry out terminations, is increasing at a much slower rate. we have no reason to believe that as gynaecological opinion becomes more educated and progressive the proportion of patients treated in national health service hospitals will not continue to increase, possibly at an even more rapid rate. there will probably be a decline in the number of patients ultimately going to private clinics.\\n           the hon. member for rye quoted some hair-raising and terrible case histories, but he did not give the names of the clinics responsible. he could have done this, protected by the privilege of the house, so that all of us would have known where those clinics were. he must know that my right hon. friend has recently inspected again all the clinics licensed when the act was introduced, and has introduced rather more stringent regulations and is now insisting that patients should stay in at least one night after the operation has been performed. i suggest that in the interests of women who are concerned about the operation of the abortion act he should give this information to my right hon. friend so that he can investigate the clinics concerned and see whether their licences should be revoked. no one wants to see women treated in this way.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2,

abortions, and the number of admittances to hospital. it is important to realise, now that the act has been passed and we can see how it is operating in different parts of the country, that fewer terminations are being carried out than there were before the act was introduced. in 1967 the total number of admissions for abortions of any kind, including therapeutic abortions, criminal cases and spontaneous abortions, was 79,600—nearly 80,000. this year the figure is running at about 54,000 altogether. we know that this figure is accurate because the abortions are all registered with my right hon. friend. the number includes private clinics and national health services cases.\\n           in 1967 in national health service hospitals only 9,700 therapeutic abortions were carried out. this shows the change in the climate of opinion, and the effect that this has had since the act was introduced. it was estimated that in 1967 about 17,000 therapeutic abortions were carried out by private doctors. i would also remind the house of a change in practice that has occurred since the act was introduced. before the act it was common practice for general practitioners to carry out abortions in their private surgeries and to send the patient home immediately afterwards. nothing was said about keeping them in bed overnight. that is now illegal. terminations can be carried out now only in licensed premises which have been inspected by my right hon. friend's department. that risk, in the private sector, has been removed as a result of the passing of the act. all hon. members—certainly women hon. members—should be grateful for that.\\n           the hon. member for rye also told us the number of gynaecologists and other doctors who had had training in gynaecology—which is a different thing. many people have training in different specialities, but abortion is not a matter where the bungler and the fumbler can work successfully.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13,

called in to help in appointing doctors by the regional hospital board and in appointing consultants and senior men in other hospitals, and of course his influence can spread not only in his own department in his own hospital but throughout his hospital region. he could have considerable influence, as my hon. friend said, in the appointment of doctors with a similar point of view to his own.\\n           this will be denied, but we have seen this in several areas. the worst regions for percentage of abortions since the act came in are sheffield, liverpool and birmingham. that is in the first year. in these areas, it was known that the consultant gynaecologists in the teaching hospitals had campaigned actively against the passage of the act. what is even more interesting—we can gain encouragement from this—is that, in the first half of the second year, which is as far as we can go, the percentage has almost doubled in all those areas. in sheffield, liverpool and birmingham there are now almost twice as many legal terminations in national health service hospitals. this seems to prove what i said earlier about the education and the evolvement of a more progressive attitude among gynaecologists.\\n           the areas in which the consultants are unwilling or unable to carry out abortions which are now legal under the act have of course seen the growth of self-help organisations. pregnancy advisory organisations have been set up in london, and there is one in birmingham. the reason is that a large percentage of women dealt with by this service in birmingham are working-class women who should be going to national health service hospitals, the kind of women who find it very difficult to pay to go to harley street and to private nursing homes. this shows the growing need in these areas for the act\\'s help. where it has been possible for advisory services and nursing homes to be started, which, again, are registered by my right hon. friend and inspected by his inspectors, they are fulfilling a useful service.\\n           the hon. member for rye should not feel too despondent about the development of the act in due course, because doctors are proving more willing to operate the act, it appears. one of the interesting features of the public opinion poll among general practitioners was that doctors in the west midlands, the area with which i am much concerned, think that the facilities for legal abortion in the whole area are inadequate, and they want more. if i were to make any criticism of my right hon. friend—i have made this frequently in the house—it is that he has not seen fit, so far, to make additional provision in those regions where the n.h.s. facilities are not proving adequate because of the attitude of the consultant gynaecologists. any development must be along these lines.\\n           the hon. member mentioned what happens in other countries where there are terminations and quoted the headline in some obscure paper in the far east, saying that london was now the \"abortion capital of the world\". that stupid and irresponsible statement, the kind of statement to encourage foreign women to come here if anything could, gained currency from a statement made by the hon. gentleman\\'s hon. friend the member for birmingham, edgbaston (mrs. knight) who, i believe, said this in america. my right hon. friend commented on this in the house on an earlier occasion.\\n           the figures are that, of all the terminations carried out in a year\\'s working, only between 6 and 7 per cent. were carried out on foreign women. this does not make london the abortion capital of the world. of that six or 7 per cent., some were on foreign women domiciled here for a time— au pair girls and so on—so

of the discussion on the bill has been very ill informed, exaggerated and irresponsible. we should allow the act to continue. the figures for the second year's working of it will not be available until towards the end of the year. therefore, my hon. friend the joint under-secretary of state is not in a position to give any processed figures today. the act has brought enormous benefit to the women of this country. more and more doctors are operating it. more and more people are aware of the benefits which it has brought to women.\\n           the fall in the illegitimate birth rate is germane to this argument. before the act, illegitimate births were over 70,000 a year. this is a matter of great concern in a world situation, and particularly a european situation, where the expansion of the human race has been almost of epidemic proportions. those people who are concerned with conservation and who heard upstairs a most interesting discussion organised by the parliamentary and scientific committee only this week will know that the position which faces us is very serious. therefore, we should welcome anything which reduces the number of illegitimate births. as sir george godber said, the great benefit which is brought to women by the removal of the fear of unwanted pregnancy cannot be quantified in statistics.\\n           i hope that the house will throw out the bill if it has a chance to vote on it. it will not be we on this side of the house who prevent a vote from being taken.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0),

in the national health service. that is not news; everyone who has studied this subject knows it. but there are well over 20,000 abortions a year being carried out in private clinics. that is a high and significant number. in view of that figure, we are naturally concerned with what is happening in the private sector. we cannot therefore dismiss the argument behind the bill as though the private sector is of no importance. it is not as important as the national health service, but it is a very important sector.\\n           the hon. lady then passed to the question over which she got into a great muddle and was helped out by various of her hon. friends, namely, how long was spent having an abortion in a national health service hospital and how long was spent in a private clinic. she was corrected in a helpful way by one of her hon. friends. the standard of care in the private sector is not as high as it is in the national health service. that is why the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists and the b.m.a. are so concerned about the situation.\\n           on the question of the time spent in hospital having an abortion, may i quote to the hon. lady from the evidence given by sir john peel, who was then president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, and which was mentioned when we last debated this matter in the house a few months ago? he pointed out that during a three-month period 52 women were treated under the national health service and discharged from hospital in 24 hours and that during the same period the number of women discharged after 24 hours in the private sector was over 5,000. one can see from those figures that it is not possible to have the standard of after-care which is needed with an abortion if one is running a mill in which people simply pass in and out, are seen for 24 hours and are never seen again. that is the point about which the medical profession is so concerned. i hope that that answers what the hon. lady said.\\n           then we had the jargon about the medical profession and educating them into adopting progressive attitudes.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0),

attitudes, what she means is brainwashing them into accepting her own particular theological view of the right of women to have abortions on demand. that is the truth of the matter; that is what she means. i do not mind her being rude to me—i have forgiven her now, i have got over it—but i do object to her being so offensive and patronising to the medical profession.\\n           the hon. lady described the number of foreign women who came over to this country for abortions as minute, and she used a percentage figure of 6 to 7 per cent. but if one looks at the absolute figure, that represents over 3,000 abortions being carried out on foreign women per year. that is not a minute figure; it is a large figure. it may be made to sound minute by putting it in percentage form, but it is in fact a large, and, i suspect, a minimum, figure. i know returns are sent in, but i doubt whether they are entirely accurate and whether the addresses which are given always indicate the place of origin of the patient. now i have finished with the hon. lady and will pass on to develop my own argument.\\n           there are strong feelings and deep anxiety throughout the country about the working of the act. my correspondence shows that the worry about the bill is widespread amongst those with strong religious views and those with none. my correspondence is not confined to letters from roman catholics, and it is unfortunate that an attempt is made to dismiss the protest against the abortion act as a religious lobby. it is not. it is a protest from people of all religions and of none who are concerned about our public morality and state of health after the passing of the act. abortions have now reached 54,000 a year. one cannot be definite about figures, because one does not know the number of illegal abortions before the act came into operation, but there has probably been a three-fold increase. it is furthermore a steadily rising graph. if the graph is projected as it is going at present, within a measurable time we shall be faced with an abortion rate of 100,000 a year.\\n           one effect of the bill may be to reduce the number of abortions, and one should face that. if one thinks that rackets are operating under the present law, one wants to get rid of them, and one effect will be to reduce the number of abortions. i face that, and it is something which, all things being equal, i should welcome; but that does not mean that the bill is specifically aimed at reducing the number of abortions and nothing else. it is aimed at getting rid of these legalised rackets, which my right hon. and learned friend the member for st. marylebone (mr. hogg) warned the house in a prescient speech would rise up if the bill passed into law unamended. on this matter i

person who does not hold that position. that is my argument.\\n           we know of the rackets, and we read about them from time to time. they can be exaggerated in the popular press and by individuals, but they exist. there is evidence, i have it here, for instance, of the foreign women coming here, and the touting going on at london airport. this is not the fabrication of sensation-seeking journalists. we know of the package deals that have been arranged in the united states—the combination holiday and abortion. we know too, that there are a number of doctors who, whilst observing the strict letter of the law, are completely ignoring its spirit. so there are these rackets.\\n           my second point is that of the medical conditions. i stress here that in many cases abortion can be a most serious operation. here i rely not on my expertise but on that of the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, mr. jeffcoate, who in a speech earlier this week said: there is evidence to show that even in experienced hands recognised rupture of the uterus occurs at least once in every 200 abortion operations. in others the accident can pass unnoticed. rupture of the uterus not only offers a considerable threat to life and may require major surgery, it leaves the uterine walls so weakened that rupture is likely to occur spontaneously in a subsequent pregnancy and labour, again threatening the life of mother and child. we should also note the statistic of the death rate after abortion, which was 15 in the last

appalling state—bleeding and in intense pain—and had to be treated as an emergency case.\\n           i want at this stage to make a correction to what i previously said of the case. i referred to it as having taken place at the calthorpe abortion clinic in birmingham, and i wish to be fair even to the calthorpe abortion clinic in birmingham. i mixed up the cases. the case to which i referred at the calthorpe clinic was another case but, in a way, it was almost as bad. it took place in november, whereas the most recent case took place in december. there, again, there were medical complications and an emergency operation had to take place in birmingham under the national health service. therefore, the record of the calthorpe clinic, although i was, i think, unfair to it, is not unblemished though i welcome this opportunity to put the record right.\\n           these cases are occurring. how can one improve the situation? one can do it by having an effective check. one can only do that in two ways; either by having a definition or by having a responsible person intervening in the process. definitions can always be got round, so i think that my hon. friend is right in insisting that a responsible person—namely, a consultant gynaecologist in the national health service—should be involved.\\n           the argument about numbers is very important in relation to the bill. the figure given by the president of the royal college, which i prefer to that given by the hon. lady, is 555 consultant gynaecologists. it must be remembered, however, that in the majority of cases consultant gynaecologists do not themselves carry out the operation. they have working under them registrars and other people who do the operations. that means that we have nearly three times as many people, namely, about 2,000 people, competent to carry out these abortion operations. it is not a question of creating areas where a service would not be available. even in areas like plymouth and elsewhere where there is a shortage of gynaecologists, my hon. friend has provided for the appointment of doctors from panels supplied by the royal college of gynaecologists so that nobody shall be denied their right under the law. i agree with that and i know that he is sincere in putting it forward.\\n           my hon. friend dealt cogently with the question of the reduction in the number of those admitted to hospital under the emergency bed service. i will not go into the statistics again, but he was challenged by the hon. member for wandsworth, central (dr. david kerr) who said that the total number of abortions was going up and therefore this represented a higher rate of decrease than before. but he could not possibly make that statement unless he knew the number of illegal

the situation. the then minister had already abandoned his duties in regard to the medical profession. he had not taken their views sufficiently into account and the fact that, whatever the rights or wrongs of abortion, it is in the end the members of the medical profession who carry out the operation.\\n           i hope that the house will give a second reading to the bill. it is not a bill which totally accords with my views, but it strikes a more reasonable balance between the needs of women, the rights of the foetus or the unborn child and the requirements of public morality. i congratulate my hon. friend on seeking to improve the law in a reasonable and sincere way and i hope that he will be successful in his object.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0),

Department of Health and Social Security', 'government', \"i will try to be brief because i appreciate, mr. speaker, that many hon. members still desire to speak. however, i wish to refer to a number of points that have been made.\\n           the abortion act is an important piece of social legislation and discussion of it arouses strong feelings among its opponents and supporters. at the outset i wish to tell the hon. member for rye (mr. bryant godman irvine) that i feel a certain sympathy with him, and while i believe that his proposed amendment is misdirected. i am grateful to him for giving us this opportunity to discuss the problem again.\\n           as the house will be well aware, a number of amendments were tabled during the passage of the measure which subsequently became the abortion act, 1967, seeking subsequently a limitation on the doctors empowered to perform terminations of pregnancy. to introduce such a limitation is, of course, the primary object of the hon. gentleman's bill.\\n           in committee, for example, amendments were tabled, including one pro- posed by my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse), which sought to limit operations to a consultant holding an appointment involving the practice of gynaecology or to a practitioner holding such an appointment and nominated by the consultant. however, parliament rejected that and other amendments mainly because of the difficulty of finding a generally acceptable formula which would not seriously limit the number of doctors available to perform abortions.\\n           an amendment of the kind which the hon. member for rye proposes would have the effect of reducing the numbers of abortions carried out in approved places by doctors without specialist qualifications. a likely effect of such an amendment might be a decrease in private abortions and a consequent increased demand on gynaecological departments in national health service hospitals, which are already under considerable pressure.\\n           it could, perhaps, be argued that this would lead to improved care for the women concerned, but in practice there would be a number of serious objections. for example, by limiting the number of doctors available to perform legal abortions, we could also produce an increase in illegal backstreet abortions. again, by introducing a requirement that the secretary of state should approve practitioners for the purpose of undertaking abortions, it would impose on him an unrealistic obligation and require him to undertake the most difficult and invidious responsibility, which he would find quite unacceptable, of making distinctions between individual doctors.\\n           it is fair to say that the hon. gentleman's bill is directed at the private sector and, by implication, criticises private practice in this field. for this reason, i will at this stage say something about the actions which my right hon. friend has taken to raise the standard of places approved for the purpose of the act.\\n           there are at present 56 private establishments functioning under his approval and they are all nursing homes registered with the appropriate local authority under the public health act, 1936. the question of the standards to be demanded of these homes is a matter which has occupied a great deal of our attention during the last year.\\n           with one exception—and here an inspection will be carried out within the next month—every one of these approved places has now been inspected by a departmental inspecting team of medical and nursing officers, in co-operation with the registering local authority. in the case of those approved places with a high turnover of abortions in the north west metropolitan region, two and sometimes three inspections have now been made. all proprietors of these establishments have been told that approval and renewal of approval will be dependent on their satisfying my right hon. friend that the standard of their premises, of their facilities, of their conduct and their staffing are all adequate.\\n           among the steps which he has required to be taken to ensure that deficiencies revealed by these inspections are remedied are structural alterations to premises to ensure safe post-operative management; reorganisation of booking arrangements to ensure that the number of women operated on for abortion in any one day does not exceed the number of beds available on the same night; and the installation of suitable autoclaves.\\n           while it is not possible to lay down precise criteria for approval, because of the variety of circumstances, of these places the question of ensuring adequate standards is something which is under constant review. as an illustration, we have now considerably expanded the form of application which each home is required to complete when seeking approval or renewal of approval. i should make it clear that for the present in no circumstances is the secretary of state prepared to grant approval for a period in excess of one year. indeed, in some instances approval has been for a much shorter period.\\n           the form of application is extremely detailed and lays particular emphasis on facilities required to ensure that the patients are safeguarded in emergencies. the form also sets out the secretary of state's requirement which i mentioned earlier, that the number of patients booked for termination of pregnancy on any given day should not exceed the number of beds available for such patients on the same night. it calls for written evidence of arrangements entered into with suppliers of blood and of the agreement of doctors who will be respon- sible for providing medical cover in an emergency.\\n           immediately a completed application form is received within my department the registering local authority concerned is contacted and asked to check the information given on the form and to let the secretary of state know as soon as practicable whether there are any circumstances or, in the case of applications for renewal of approval, whether any new factors have arisen since approval was last given, which indicate that approval should be refused or withdrawn.\\n           when sending the completed form to local authorities the secretary of state emphasises his concern that the facilities should be such as to safeguard the life and health of the patients. to this end he asks authorities to pay particular attention in carrying out their investigation into the arrangements at the home in question for dealing with emergencies which may arise. he also asks the authorities to make full use of their statutory powers of inspection under the public health act. they are further asked to bring to his notice immediately anything which, in their view or that of their medical officer of health, might make continued approval of a particular establishment undesirable. my department maintains close contact with registering authorities and has, in fact, met representatives of the local authorities most concerned.\\n           whatever measures may be taken by the secretary of state to improve standards at approved places, it must be remembered that the use which doctors operating in approved places make of the facilities provided at these establishments is a matter for their own clinical judgment. this is not something in which my right hon. friend has any power, or wish, to intervene. he refers any cases of alleged professional misconduct to the general medical council which is, of course, fully alive to the need to complement the government's efforts by ensuring that they take whatever action is proper to them.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1970,

criticism to make of the medical profession, there are avenues open to that patient. it is not the role of government to interfere in questions involving clinical judgment.\\n           i turn now to the questions which have been raised about the adequacy of provision for abortions in national health service hospitals. i think it is significant that the latest figures show that over 70 per cent. of all abortions notified in respect of women with addresses in england and wales are being carried out in national health service hospitals. no one denies that there are considerable variations in the numbers of abortions carried out in national health service hospitals from one region to another, and further that within individual regions one can find variations from town to town and unevenness in the extent to which the needs of the community are being met locally.\\n           there are a number of factors which contribute, in varying degrees, to the unevenness of the service across the country. one is the conscientious objection which some doctors and other staff have to participation in abortion operations. the right of any person to opt out of participation in the treatment authorised under the act, except when he has a duty to help save the life or prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of a pregnant woman, has been debated at great length in this house, and i am sure that it would be quite contrary to the wishes of the house and of the public at large if this right of conscientious objection were to be withdrawn.\\n           other factors bearing on regional variations within the national health service include the availability of facilities for examination, assessment and treatment of patients seeking abortions. such patients in hospitals are normally seen first in the out-patient department, and generally speaking it seems that those seeking abortion take up more time than others in the gynaecology department. so there are limits on the numbers of additional abortion patients who can be fitted into clinic lists without additional staff or detriment to the treatment of other patients en the gynaecology list. it has been suggested that one solution to this problem and also to the problem of fitting these cases into gynaecological lists in the hospitals is that we should set up special out-patient clinics specifically for patients seeking abortion. this has been done in some hospitals, and with some success, but there must be sessions available and the staff to provide the service.\\n           some of our hospitals are short of operating theatre space and time. additional operations involve more theatre time and this is not always easy to find, since surgeons aim, quite rightly, to make the best possible use of the resources available. theatre sessions tend therefore to be fully taken up some time ahead. the development of \"day surgery\" where patients are discharged after minor general surgery the same day is providing more operating theatre time and this will help with other surgical operations including abortion.\\n           the other main area in which availability of resources limits the work that can be done is in the wards. the majority of patients who have abortions in national health service hospitals are admitted to hospital beds and occupy them for a few days. broadly speaking the longer the pregnancy has continued the longer the period of in-patient treatment which may be necessary.\\n           suggestions have been made that special abortion units should be set up in the health service to cope with this demand. i am sure that it would be wrong to set up isolated units to undertake this work. abortion, like any other surgical procedure in the health service, should take place in a general hospital with full pathological and gynaecological facilities and a blood bank for use in emergencies. fragmentation of limited hospital resources is most undesirable. but even if it were considered appropriate to set up separate units of this kind i doubt whether sufficient hospital doctors and nurses could be found who would be willing to spend all their time doing this work. most people like to use the full range of their skills, and repeated abortions do not offer this opportunity for surgeons, nurses, social workers and all who would be involved in the treatment of those cases. it could result in the other skills falling because of their disuse in treating abortion alone.\\n           there may be scope for improvement in hospital services for termination of pregnancy. it is now possible to identify those hospitals where very few abortions, or none at all, are being done, and to consider what additional staff, resources and facilities might be needed to get adequate services established. where a service is already being given it may be posible to make improvements in the arrangements for patients seeking abortions. where an adequate service is not possible at present, i hope that hospital boards and committees will be able to make arrangements for it to be provided. i am conscious that the difficulties in some localities are severe. but i do not see the problems as insoluble if they are tackled with imagination and good-will on all sides.\\n           facilities for abortion in the national health service cannot be considered in isolation. they form an integral part of all the other health services for the community. the health service has developed considerably over the last 20 years and a great deal has been achieved. it remains true however that there are many fields in which improvements still have to be made to bring standards up to those which we should all like to see. against this background one sees the difficulty of providing a uniform service throughout the country for patients needing abortion less than two years after the abortion act came into operation. i should like now to turn to the inquiries into the act which are being undertaken.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.99', 53, 'uk.m.17165', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN',

are falling slightly but they are still very long—for routine surgery of various kinds, and the difficulties experienced in finding hospital beds for mentally handicapped children, and so on. this is not a problem confined to one part of the service.\\n           there are some grounds for dissatisfaction about the operation of the abortion act as far as private practice is concerned, and we are watching the situation in the private sector closely. a very small number of doctors operating in the private sector are doing things of which neither my colleagues in the medical profession nor we in the house would approve. but there is reason to believe that, in relation to provision within the national health service, the act is working reasonably well. certainly, it is not possible to arrive at a considered assessment of the overall working of the act until current inquiries are complete. these include the inquiry being carried out by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists on the basis of a questionnaire sent to its members asking for detailed information about their experience of the workings of the act. we hope that the findings of this inquiry will be available shortly and that they will provide valuable information on current practice.\\n           apart from the inquiry being carried out by the royal college, we are ourselves in the department carefully studying the detailed analyses of information deriving from the forms of notification prepared by the general register office in respect of 1969. they include information about many aspects of the operation of the act, including the method of termination, the length of stay in hospital or nursing home, and complications arising from abortion. we are also continuing the confidential inquiry into maternal deaths, which include deaths arising from abortion. until current inquiries into the working of the act are complete, it would not be advisable, in the government's view, to give support to any particular amendment such as proposed in this bill.\\n           i have mentioned the problems which, i think, we face in certain respects in the private sector. i assure the hon. gentleman the member for rye that, if he has any evidence which concerns him about poor conditions, i shall be only too pleased to look into it if he will let me have it. the same offer is open to all hon. members. we should welcome any information which they might feel to be of use.\\n           i assure hon. members that we shall continue to investigate very carefully all the reports which come to us containing prima facie evidence of contravention of the act, and we shall seek the assistance of the home office and police authorities wherever appropriate. there have been references to a report in the press earlier this week about a particular clinic, in connection with which a tape recording was sent to my department. i have read the transcript of the tape recording. this is a case which we have under urgent consideration at present.\\n           this process of investigation—and a very time-consuming process it is—is something on which we are constantly engaged. i reiterate the view expressed several times lately by my right hon. friend the secretary of state that, while there may be some grounds for dissatisfaction about the operation of the act in the private sector, we must not concentrate our attention exclusively on unfavourable features of its working. indeed, some of the discussion about the act is exaggerated and ill-informed.\\n           this is a subject which arouses strong emotions and prejudices which make rational consideration difficult. but it must be our aim in the house to debate the question reasonably and sensibly and arrive at a balanced conclusion. our task today is to survey dispassionately the workings of the act since the house passed it 18 months ago. i believe, on the basis of our experience over these 18 months, that the abortion act is generally operating satisfactorily.\\n           i believe that most people would agree that it has brought advantages. the rate of emergency admissions to hospital for abortion is falling. i have the figures here for the last three years in respect of the emergency bed service: about 4,300, about 3,700, and about 3,200. i do not put too much weight on these figures, and i do not suggest that the act would be the only factor. i do not even go so far as to say that it would necessarily be the main factor, but there is a definite decline in the rate of emergency admissions for abortion.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.101', 26, 'uk.m.22530', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'do not those figures relate

reduction of admissions. in the same way, there has been a reduction in the mortality rate consequent on abortions. in 1968 there were 50 deaths from abortions. in the first 10 months of last year there were 28. again, i would not put too much weight on that, but these are perhaps encouraging trends. i think that we have in them some evidence of the way in which the act is causing a real

to some of the minister\\'s points about the unsatisfactory working of the act in the private sector in one or two clinics.\\n           but i would like to begin by congratulating the hon. member for rye (mr. bryant godman irvine) on the manner in which he introduced the bill. in the two or three years during which the subject of abortion has been sometimes a heated subject of debate in both houses of parliament, it has been a pleasure to listen to a moderate and well-reasoned speech such as that which the hon. gentleman made in introducing the bill.\\n           the hon. member for chelmsford (mr. st. john-stevas), on the last occasion he chose to introduce a similar bill, said that it was a pity he was not an agnostic mother of nine. at least this afternoon he appeared in the guise of a protestant father or two, which was no doubt a step of some significance.\\n           i have no doubt that the hon. member for rye introduced the bill with the best of intentions, but its results and consequences have not been fully understood by him. and since the hon. member for chelmsford is a sponsor of the bill, and was so critical of the drafting of my act, i am surprised that he has not noticed a major drafting error in the bill, which gives the secretary of state for social services a sovereignty over health services in scotland that exists in no other field. that would have to be put right if the bill went beyond second reading.\\n           some of the main arguments for and against the measure have been debated twice in full here and in another place. constantly the point is made that because the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists and the b.m.a. are pressing for this change, as they pressed for it during the passage of my act, we must accept it. i cannot accept that argument. the house must take into account representations from a wide spectrum of opinion, knowledge and expertise on the subject. of course, we must give special weight to their views, and 95 per cent. of their views, i would say, were incorporated in the main act. but they cannot dictate to parliament what should be the provisions of an abortion act.\\n           one very serious result of the bill\\'s being passed would be that the tendency would grow for abortion to be delayed because of the limited number of people who, even if one appointed others and extended the phrase \"under the supervision of\" would be qualified to sign the certificate. because they would have to sign it, whereas at present they do not, this limited number of people would have to be involved not just in the operation but in the diagnostic process. that is a factor which has not been brought out fully, and there would inevitably be delays.\\n           the figures i have show that 63 per cent. of abortions have been carried out up to and including the twelfth week of pregnancy and 35 per cent. after the twelfth week. i consider that 35 per cent. to be too high. if abortions have to be carried out, they should be carried out at the earliest possible time, from both a medical and ethical point of view. therefore, any red tape, any restriction, any queue-forming, would be very undesirable.\\n           second, it would have the effect of encouraging a restrictive practice on abortions in certain parts of the country. it is all very well for the hon. member for chelmsford—i think that it was the hon. gentleman, but if i have attributed somebody else\\'s remark to him i apologise—to say that in addition to consultants there are registrars and other people who can do this work. we know that if a consultant at a hospital takes the view, which he is entitled to do, that he is opposed to a liberal practice on abortions there is no question of registrars and others on his staff taking a different view. the effect of an amendment of of this kind would be to encourage a restrictive practice on abortions.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0),

edition of the lancet, one of the most authoritative journals says in its editorial: … mr. irvine's bill is out of place. what difference can it really make? few of the abusing doctors will be excluded from the market by legislation which requires a government department to pronounce that they are, or are not, of 'equivalent status'. perhaps, under cover of this device some supporters of the bill are now reviewing a long-rooted opposition to reform. that is the case, whatever may have been the laudable intentions of the sponsor of the bill. the hon. lady the member for wolverhampton, north east (mrs. renée short) quoted a national opinion polls survey of general practitioners which showed that 66 per cent. are either satisfied with the existing law or want to see it amended so that it is easier, and not more difficult, to get a legal abortion.\\n           finally, in considering medical opinion, an editorial in yesterday's medical news-tribune strongly came out against the act and said: the only motive which we can realistically ascribe to the perpetrators of this amendment is to wreck the abortion act by drastically reducing the number of abortions performed. it would be a mistake fundamentally to alter a piece of legislation when we still have comparatively little knowledge of its consequences. i have here a letter which a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology in aberdeen sent to a member of this house asking him to be present to vote today. he says: we have in aberdeen for the past 18 months been running an interdepartmental study into the way in which women react either to having a pregnancy terminated or having to carry on with the pregnancy for which they have requested termination. it will probably be another year before the final results of the study are available, but until such results are available, and aso fuller analysis of the workings of the abortion act throughout the country have been made it seems premature to make any alterations in the act. we have to consider the fact that this is a very wide bill, a point which hon. members might consider before voting. the long title merely says that its purpose is to amend the abortion act, but all sorts of clauses could be added in committee.\\n           we have to consider the effects of the present act as it has operated in the country. the figure which i have for the first year of its operation is that the death rate for abortions was 21 per 100,000, whereas the death rate in respect of child births was 24 per 100,000 in the same year. at the time of the passage of my bill i should never have dared to predict that the death rate from abortions would be lower than the death rate from childbirth, and that is a very satisfactory conclusion. this is not statistically significant, but there have been more deaths in national health service hospitals than in private practice clinics.\\n           we can say from the provisional evidence available that there has been a reduction in criminal abortions. i do not want to go into the mathematical argument again about the london emergency bed centre figures, but they show a certain definite trend in the right direction. the death rate given by the minister just now showed that from an average of 50 from abortions, both criminal and medical, for many years, the figure fell last year to 28 in the first ten months, and that was a very significant and welcome drop.\\n           nobody has quoted precise figures, but the house should notice that the illegitimacy rate had been on the increase. in 1955 it was about 4 per cent., and rose by 1968 to more than 8 per cent. for the first six months of 1969, which is the latest period for which i have figures, there was a small, but nevertheless significant down-turn in the illegitimacy rate which i think can be credited to the act.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.109', 19,

the illegitimacy figures. however, we have seen for the first time—this in the first full calendar year since the abortion act came into operation—the illegitimacy figures decrease. can it be described as only a coincidence that the first downturn should have occurred at this time?\\n           to get the arithmetic correct, one should note the rates of abortion in this country compared with the rates in other countries. i deplore the use of headlines such as: london: the abortion capital of the world\". that is not true. the rate since the operation of the abortion act has been 6·8 per cent. per 100 live births. that compares with 8·3 per cent. in denmark and 10 per cent. in sweden. in countries which do not have adequate family planning provision the figures are horrifying, such as 38 per cent. in japan and 34 per cent. in czechoslovakia. i hope that those figures are never reached here.\\n           the hon. member for chelmsford referred to 3,000 foreign women having had abortions in this country during the last year. presumably that number includes a substantial number of foreign women who are, in any event, resident here. i do not know what the percentage of foreigners here is at a given time. what about the 30,000 danes who, we were told, would be coming here for abortions? they have not appeared. what about the american package tours of which we read? not one has arrived. these things may make good newspaper copy but they bear very little relationship to the facts of how the abortion act is working.\\n           the other day i read an interesting conservative central office pamphlet about abortion. i confess that conservative pamphlets are not among my normal staple reading, but this one suggested that it might be worth considering establishing abortion clinics in certain parts of the country. i have never found that an attractive idea, but i appreciate that if there is a restrictive practice operating in certain parts of the country it may be necessary for the ministry to consider this matter.\\n           it is true that private clinics as a whole have a good record, as the death figures show. there is no doubt, however, that one or two clinics in london—and there are only one or two such clinics—have been abusing the spirit and, perhaps, the letter of the abortion act.\\n           i was interested to hear the minister say that an inquiry was going on and i welcomed his remarks about the instructions which he had given. there is a case, in the light of our experience of the working of the abortion act, for changing the ministerial regulations applying to private practice. i see no reason why the same notification forms—which are, in essence, simple—should not be used for both national health service and private patients. more information might also be required from private clinics about each case. for example, we might require the signature of the patient on discharge from the clinic saying that she was satisfied that she had received proper medical attention. the dates of entry and discharge should also be included on the notification form.\\n           i would go further and say that there should be no objection to including on the notification form the amount of fee charged because there is a suggestion that no receipts are given, that cash is always demanded, and that the inland revenue is being defrauded.\\n           one clinic—the minister referred to this case—has aroused considerable interest, and it is the case of the tape recording. i believe that the hon. member for chelmsford had this case in mind. i have made inquiries into the matter following the publicity which the case received last week. i spoke to the person in the pregnancy advisory service in birmingham who first met this applicant for an abortion.\\n           the first thing to remember is that the girl came from birmingham. she was referred to the pregnancy advisory service by her own family doctor. i suggest that if she had lived in newcastle, aberdeen or many other places she would not have been in a clinic in london to start with; and that is the first lesson to be drawn from this case.\\n           the girl was aged 18 and went to the pregnancy advisory service accompanied by her father. this service is a voluntary body and not a money-making organisation. it is a charitable body, providing a social service. the woman who interviewed this girl gave her services voluntarily, as a social worker in the evenings in this centre. as for the charge of providing abortion on demand, about 30 per cent. of the women going there for abortions are refused. those are the centre\\'s figures. it was untrue, as suggested in the tape recording, that the first thing said was, \"how much can you pay?\" or \"it will be £125.\" the normal particulars were taken and the father of the girl in question then asked how much it was likely to cost if it were carried out in a private clinic.\\n           i should like to know why this case, which occurred in november, was not referred to the general medical council by the national health service people who took it over. i should like to know why they kept it in cold storage until a week before the bill was introduced.\\n           the most important fact of all was that the doctor who carried out this operation in the clinic was an f.r.c.s. and a member of the royal college of obstreticians and gynaecologists who, under the bill, could not be regarded as other than of equivalent status. therefore, the bill would have provided no safeguard in respect of the case that has received so much publicity during the past week.\\n           we would all welcome a reduction in the figures for abortion, but i believe that that reduction must be achieved not by denying a facility that is badly needed for women in unfortunate circumstances but, rather, by reducing the need for resort to abortion at all. a great debate is now going on about sexual responsibility and sexual education. i welcome this, and also the steps that the secretary of state for social services has taken to encourage local authorities to use their powers under the family planning act to set up local authority family planning clinics. it is disgraceful that the secretary of state for scotland should have issued instructions preventing this in scotland.\\n           the slogan that should go out from this house should be, \"no unwanted pregnancies\", which is a very much better slogan than, \"no unwanted babies\". i hope that the house will divide on the bill, and will reject it.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.112', 1173, 'uk.m.17849', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'it is many years since i spoke in a debate on abortion. throughout that time, however, i have been a strong supporter of a change in the cruel offences against the person act of 1861. the hon. member for rye (mr. bryant godman irvine) seemed to be unaware of the full implications of what he was doing. the house knows him, and we all know that he would never have any intention of introducing a bill which might have heartless and cruel effects, but i am sure that this bill would have.\\n           in introducing the bill the hon. member relied mainly upon the opinion of the two medical bodies that are asking for statutory limitations to be placed upon the activities of gynaecologists and others outside the national health service. as the parliamentary secretary pointed out, and as the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. david steel) has just mentioned, these views were expressed in the house when the abortion bill was under consideration; they were fully debated in committee upstairs, and later on the floor of the house; they were debated in another place—and they were rejected all the time. the house will realise that medical bodies—important as they are, and having influential opinions as they do—are not the last word in what should be written into the law of the land. this house is in charge of the law and having decided—as it did less than three years ago—on the form of the law in this case, it would be unwise to make a change at this stage.\\n           the bill proposes to place a statutory limitation upon operations done by gynaecologists and other qualified people. it seeks to restrict the lawful conduct of these operations to consultant gynaecologists in the national health service, or persons acting under their supervision. a statutory limitation of this kind can be justified only if it can be shown that it is in the interests of the community. it is a surprise to me that an hon. member opposite should seek to restrict the freedom of choice of the citizen in the matter of medical care. neither the b.m.a. nor the royal college would wish to see this freedom eroded in other fields of medicine and surgery. why, then, do they want it eroded in this? is it because there is some special risk attaching to this operation?\\n           certainly that is not proved by the mortality rate of abortion operations. in fact, there is, unfortunately, a higher proportionate death rate in the national health service than there is in the private sector, but this is no reflection on the health service. it usually gets the bad cases, the cases which have been too long delayed by the time that they reach it. there is no evidence from the mortality rate that it is necessary to restrict this operation to gynaecologists and others acting within the national health service.\\n           what other considerations, then, can there be? is it a matter of skills? there are skills outside the national health service as well as inside. some gynaecologists in the national health service have done few, if any, terminations. some, quite properly, holding the views that they do, have refused to do them. it cannot be a question of skill, because skill is not the monopoly of the national health service.\\n           is it suggested that ethical standards are higher inside the national health service than outside? if so, is that a view which the b.m.a. and the royal college accept? is it their view that it takes the national health service to make upright doctors? are we to regard ethical standards as one of the great reforms of the national health service?\\n           what do the two medical bodies think of the proposal implicit in the bill that if a gynaecologist who did not hold a consultative appointment in the health service were to perform a termination outside the national health service he would be committing an offence for which the penalty is imprisonment for life? this is what we are talking about. the penalties were never interfered with when we reformed the original act in 1967.\\n           is it suggested that a termination is lawful if it is done by a consultant gynaecologist in the health service and near murder if it is done by a gynaecologist outside it? is that the distinction which the law should make? is it suggested that the health service can now take all the terminations which would come to it under the bill? no evidence which the hon. gentleman produced, except the law of averages, would justify such a conclusion. have we reached the stage, in this field and in none other, to force people into the national health service? is this a new monopoly in state medicine being suggested from the benches opposite? this is the astonishing thing. is this a new tyranny coming from the opposition?\\n           the hon. member for rye, in dealing with the average of terminations which might be spread over the available gynaecologists, had little to say about the regional variations which are the great mischief of the working of the abortion act. it is a strange thing that if the national health service can cope with the terminations which are now needed it is necessary for pregnancy advisory services to deal with so many referrals from general practitioners, hospital doctors and family planning association doctors. fifty-four per cent. of all the referrals to the london pregnancy advisory service in the first year came from general practitioners, and 42 per cent. were by hospital doctors, family planning association doctors and others.\\n           in fact, some of the cases that went to it had been refused under the national health service. two girls under 14 were refused, as were five girls under 15 and 40 women over 40. another patient, a girl of 17, pregnant by her father, was refused a termination under the national health service. four married women with five or more children and 10 unmarried women with two or more illegitimate children were all refused, and all were sent to the london pregnancy advisory service to see whether a termination could be made available elsewhere. so long as the national health service cannot meet the demand and there are these regional variations, the time is not right to change the law.\\n           the real problem in abortion is the difficulty of getting people to consider it and discuss it rationally. it is so full of emotion and offers so much scope for headlines, drama and exaggeration. it is almost impossible to get good publicity on abortion, because the good that the abortion act is doing is not news, while the mischief and abuses under it are. we hear nothing of all the thousands of women who have been relieved of suffering, whose health has been improved, whose families have been safeguarded, whose children have been safeguarded against ill treatment, neglect, and even cruelty, where these considerations were taken into account when the decision on termination was reached.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1970, 2, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1970-02-13.6.1.113', 5, 'uk.m.22068', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', ' mr. peter mahon  rose —\\n

association with my right hon. friends the secretaries of state for scotland and wales, a statement on abortion. since march of this year a select committee has been considering the abortion (amendment) bill of my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white). the committee made nine recommendations in its third special report to the house on 5th august, most of which follow up proposals made last year by the lane committee on the working of the abortion act. i am glad to tell the house that the government accept in principle all the select committee's recommendations.\\n           my intentions, announced earlier this year, to strengthen the safeguards which apply to abortion in the private sector are similar to those recommended by the select committee. action has already been taken following consultation with the medical profession with a view to requiring private nursing homes which concentrate on abortion to give me an assurance concerning the total fees charged to patients. assurances have also been sought from all approved nursing homes about financial arrangements with referral agencies. only those private nursing homes with adequate facilities will be authorised to carry out terminations of pregnancy after the twentieth week.\\n           i have also written to those nursing homes which concentrate on abortion asking for information on the number of foreign patients treated during the 18 months to 30th june 1975 and i shall be seeking such information from all approved nursing homes at quarterly intervals in future. i am reviewing the arrangements which are made by the nursing homes for the reception, counselling and after-care of foreign patients on the lines proposed by the select committee and i will require changes in these arrangements where necessary.\\n           the committee recommended that the health ministers should produce a list of approved bureaux and refuse to approve clinics which accepted patients from unlisted bureaux. we are proposing to implement this change shortly, and application forms have been issued to bureaux and agencies. i am, moreover, concerned to ensure that adequate counselling facilities are available for all women who indicate that their pregnancies are unwanted, and a draft paper as proposed by the select committee giving guidance on counselling will be circulated for consultation to bodies representing the medical, nursing and social work professions.\\n           in the national health service the select committee's recommendation that terminations after the twentieth week of pregnancy should be carried out only in hospitals possessing appropriate facilities, including resuscitation equipment, have been accepted, and discussions have been held with regional medical officers who will be responsible for the implementation of the recommendations. i have issued a circular to health authorities on the report of the peel advisory group on the use of fetuses and fetal material for research asking for the adoption of its recommended code of practice where not already in use and i put a similar requirement on private nursing homes.\\n           some of the other recommendations of the select committee will require amendment of the abortion regulations 1968. my department is undertaking a study of the procedures and forms set out in the regulations as proposed by the select committee, and in the light of its report i shall be considering the whole question of the procedure for the certification and notification of abortions. another recommendation which would require amending the regulations is to allow the disclosure to the general medical council of information taken from the notification to the chief medical officers of the health departments. this recommenda- tion is accepted, and the regulations will be amended to permit disclosure to the president of the general medical council at his request.\\n           a further change in the regulations recommended by the select committee is designed to ensure that the doctors who certify that the condition of the abortion act are met in a particular case should examine the patient. the regulations will be amended to ensure that a question asking whether the patient has been seen and an examination has been carried out will be put on all forms.\\n           i think the house will be glad to know that action is being or has already been taken on all the recommendations made by the select committee in its third report and on many of the major recommendations of the lane committee. i have issued guidance on day care systems to health authorities and hope to authorise day-care services in some private clinics with a record of high standards. the most important preventive action which the government have taken is to introduce as part of the nhs a comprehensive family planning service which started to function fully this summer. i can only regret that this was not introduced a decade or more ago.\\n           during the second reading of the abortion (amendment) bill in february 1975, a commitment was given by the government that if the bill were withdrawn the government would propose the establishment of a select committee to examine and report on the proposals contained in the bill and would also propose its re-establishment for the 1975–76 session if this were necessary. in the event, the house did not allow the bill to be withdrawn but instead committed the bill itself to a select committee. under this procedure the bill and the select committee lapse at the end of this session. the government feel that the house, in the light of the committee's reports already published and of this statement, should be given an opportunity to decide whether the select committee should be re-established as the committee itself has requested, and a motion will be tabled early in the next session.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 10, 21,

bill, supported by hon. members of all parties in the house, that would put into statutory form what is now established case law on abortion, and would provide that a registered medical practitioner might lawfully terminate a pregnancy at the request of a patient or her guardian when it was necessary for preserving the health or life of the woman; when there was serious risk of a defective child being born, and when the pregnancy resulted from a sexual offence.\\n           reform of this kind has been advocated over many decades by many organisations, including the british medical association, the magistrates' association, the townswomen's guild, the women's co-operative guild, the family planning association, the abortion law reform association, rotary clubs, the federation of university women and many other progressive and enlightened bodies.\\n           the medical termination of pregnancy is legal on these grounds in very many countries where it is done easily and without risk to the patient in the early stages of pregnancy. new techniques make it possible for it to be accomplished without surgical intervention, and in some of these countries the back street abortionist has either largely or entirely disappeared. contrary to what many opponents of my bill claim, there has been no increase in promiscuity there. i have visited hospitals in those countries, where this practice is carried out simply and swiftly. for many years i have observed in this country, as a member of a hospital management committee, the cost in human life, in misery, in unhappiness and in money that the present unsatisfactory and confused legal position causes.\\n           i pay tribute as a woman to those countless devoted campaigners—laymen as well as members of the medical and legal professions, some of whom are in this house today—who, for many decades, have been striving for a reform of the statute law on this subject. the law up to 1803 permitted the medical termination of pregnancy. the law enacted in 1861 has remained unchanged since that time, 104 years ago, and makes it a felony unlawfully to administer drugs or to use instruments to procure an abortion. for a long time the termination of pregnancy for the purpose of saving the life of the mother has been regarded as the exception to this rule by the courts.\\n           in 1939, that case law was extended to include the mother's health as well as her life. this arose from the celebrated bourne judgment and was later reinforced in 1948 in the case of rex v. bergman and ferguson. however, many cases have occurred which demonstrate the confusion and uncertainty which exists. in 1949, for example, a husband living in distressing conditions with his wife and two children attempted to abort his wife who died as a result. he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. mercifully, lord justice goddard, in the court of criminal appeal, discharged the defendant. but in 1961 a doctor whom the trial judge described as clever and not slovenly in the attention he bestowed on those who sought his help was sent to prison for six years.\\n           there are variations in judicial attitudes in ordinary crimes, but these appear to be accentuated in abortion cases, depending on the outlook of the judge. while some lawyers may feel that the present case law based on rex v. bourne is quite clear, evidence shows without doubt that the medical profession, those most involved, is by no means equally clear about its members' position. the result is that inevitably different interpretations of case law are made in different hospitals and practices to the severe detriment of women and children. a minority of gynaecologists will terminate in the hospital without subterfuge and in accordance with recognised procedures of the profession, but most doctors are too apprehensive of the legal position to perform the operation at all. there is no doubt that the medical profession requires the clarification which a bill of the kind i seek to introduce would bring and that the majority would support it.\\n           the abortion law reform association carried out a most valuable survey at the beginning of this year among doctors in the london area. of those replying, 53 per cent. said it was difficult or uncertain to know when termination was legal, 89 per cent. said they approved the changes in the law proposed by the association which i am supporting today, 84 per cent. said it would be quite safe, 57 per cent. thought that to compel a woman to bear a child against her will causes more psychological harm than hospital termination.\\n           these figures show a considerable shift in medical opinion during recent years and should be given considerable weight by hon. and right hon. members in this house. my hon. friend the member for wandsworth, central (dr. david kerr) drew the attention of the house recently to the rise in illegitimate births from 60,000 in 1962 to 68,000 in 1964. the department of education and science gives the number of illegitimate births to girls under the age of 16 at 220 in 1941 and 1,131 in 1963, a fivefold increase in 20 years. if we accept that this situation is the responsibility of society as a whole, as surely we must, it must also be wrong to expect them alone to bear the penalty of a blighted life.\\n           it has been estimated that there are about 100,000 illegal abortions a year, a terrible pool of human misery and unhappiness. the figure may well be higher, for there is a considerable amount of camouflage on medical certificates. some of these abortions are brought about by women themselves using terrifying instruments to bring abortion about. can the house stand a recital of the desperate lengths to which frightened women will go to prevent the continuation of an unwanted pregnancy? i quote from a report published in 1939 by the government abortion committee: things inserted in the womb, often with disastrous consequences, included knitting and darning needles, crochet and button hooks, pencils, scissors and hairpins, disinfectants, washing soda and other irritants, drugs which frequently damage the foetus without killing it, and other violent methods. then there are those women who go to back-street abortionists and who have similar terrifying interference carried out in ghastly and dirty conditions. damage is done to the unborn child, deformed babies often result, and sterility, and very frequently death. then there are those fortunate women who can have a termination carried out properly in aseptic conditions either because they have found a sympathetic surgeon in hospital, or because they know where to go and have the money for secret, expensive termination in a private clinic or nursing home. after two or three days that woman can return home and resume her normal life.\\n           the results of self-induced or backstreet abortions come to our hospitals for the damage to be put right. it can take two or three weeks and it costs about £33 per patient per bed per week. the house can work out the comparative cost between two or three days and two or three weeks. with the septic cases there is a disproportionate strain on scarce medical and nursing skill. they need more nursing, more drugs, more blood transfusions. in 1962, the london emergency bed service was asked to find beds for 5,734 abortion cases, an increase of 40 per cent. over the past eight years. the consultant gynaecologist at one of our most famous teaching hospitals told me only last week that in 1959 his department cared for 138 abortion cases. by 1963, that figure had risen to 274. it had doubled in four years and 192 of those were probably self-induced or criminal abortions.\\n           abortion is the second most common cause of maternal death; 61 per cent. are procured by the patient herself, 22 per cent. of deaths from this cause occur among women with four or more children—think what happens to those children—and almost 90 per cent. of women having abortions are married. since my right hon. friend the minister of health attempted to introduce his own private member's bill in 1961, the thalidomide tragedy has occurred. this adds urgency to the need for reform. it caused a great shift in public opinion.\\n           as recently as last march a national opinion poll carried out in depth on abortion law showed that almost three-quarters of the people of this country—just over 72 per cent.—are in favour of reform on the lines i have suggested. seventy-five per cent. of church of england people interviewed were in favour, 68 per cent. of nonconformists, 75 per cent. of presbyterians and 60 per cent. of catholics were all in favour. seventy per cent. of those interviewed thought there should be no punishment at all for doctors who carried out abortions which they believed morally justified.\\n           the religious divisions on this question were equally interesting. seventy per cent. of church of england members, 68 per cent. of nonconformists, 73 per cent. of presbyterians, and 63 per cent. of catholics thought there should be no punishment of the doctor. if one believed catholic writers to the press, one would get a very different impression of catholic opinion. i believe that the house, too, must give considerable weight to this shift in public opinion.\\n           i have had very many letters from individuals and from organisations welcoming the reform which i hope to initiate. i have not had one letter of protest, either from an individual or from an organisation. i was greatly heartened by the resolution which was carried recently by the annual conference of the townswomen's guild in favour of reform. the conference represented over 200,000 women. it is my belief, therefore, that only a very small minority of people would oppose reform on religious grounds, but that small minority can no longer be permitted to impose its views on the majority. this would be the negation of democracy.\\n           if a foetus can be aborted spontaneously up to the 28th week of pregnancy without the church or state being concerned, without a birth having to be registered, without a burial service having to be held, if that seven-month foetus can be buried in the back garden or burned in a hospital incinerator, why should there be opposition to the safe termination of pregnancy up to 13 weeks on properly defined grounds? i therefore hope that the house, with its great tradition of humanitarianism and reform, will allow the bill to be presented and will facilitate its passage.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1965, 6, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1965-06-15.14']]\n"

harassment of, any person using an abortion clinic or any person employed therein, and the obstruction of access to such premises; to provide remedies for persons affected by such acts; to require information on counselling services to be given to persons seeking an abortion; and for connected purposes. the activities referred to in the bill should be written into our law as a clear criminal offence. when it boils down to it, such activity is another form of violence towards women, in this case women who are already in an anxious state.\\n           abortion is legal. it is outrageous that, after making a painful and difficult decision, perhaps after careful counselling and discussion with their partner, women attending clinics for treatment should be the subject of abuse and harassment and placed in fear of violence. the same goes for clinical workers.\\n           seven weeks ago, rescue america despicably forced several women to run the gauntlet of its abuse and intimidation. a report of that appeared in the guardian on 2 april. one woman said: i couldn\\'t believe the way they just descended on me. they swarmed around me and i was very frightened. when she arrived at the clinic, she burst into tears. she said: having an abortion is not an easy decision and i was already feeling emotionally unstable. these people just took advantage of that. i was shaking and crying and had to go and sit in a room to calm myself down …they are not going to achieve anything like this. women think very carefully about having abortions and these people are not going to change anybody\\'s mind. i think they are all sick and very intimidating. i believe that everyone has the right to hold an opinion but these people hounded me. i felt like a criminal and am still very disturbed by what happened … it was very distressing and occurred at a time when i have enough to worry about already. those were the words of a woman who was harassed by rescue america.\\n           the activities of rescue america and rescue outreach are becoming increasingly violent in the united states. the groups do not merely block access. they have undertaken fire bombings, arson attacks and acid attacks on clinics. they have stormed hospital theatres. there have been shootings. a florida doctor was shot dead outside his clinic earlier this year. the director of rescue america, don treshman, called it \"unfortunate\" and added chillingly: had he not been killed, many more babies would have died at his hands. last year marked a record for violence against clinics in the united states. there were 1,107 acts of serious violence such as bombing, arson, chemical contamination, invasion and vandalism. it cost almost $50 million. special camps were set up to train members to read licence plates, follow people and harass them at home, and illegally enter schools to leaflet children with pictures of foetuses.\\n           with such fanaticism, there must be a real danger of harm to women arriving at abortion clinics and to the workers there. the people involved are trying to export this intimidation and violence to the united kingdom. they have set up rescue uk, and training courses have been organised by their american counterparts. these include instruction on how to intervene physically, with violence. james morrow, the founder of rescue uk, has been arrested more than a dozen times, and in 1989 he was convicted of assault on a pregnant clinic manager.\\n           i believe that, for infamy and ignominy, the demonstrations that took place outside abortion clinics seven weeks ago were on a par with those of the racist dockers in the 1960s. the rights of women should be protected by law, yet the role of the police was far from satisfactory. they did not ensure complete freedom of access or freedom from intimidation. they put the demonstrators first and the women second. at some demonstrations, they refused to allow women to go through on their own, despite the fact that these women were engaging in lawful personal business, and, on grounds of public order, they also refused to allow escorts, such as those from the national abortion campaign, to accompany the women.\\n           with such tactics, the police were, in effect, doing operation rescue\\'s job for it. it is also known that some of the police officers involved expressed their support for operation rescue. policing tactics were inconsistent, being down to individual police officers. that is most unsatisfactory. the home office should produce some consistent guidelines and ensure that women\\'s rights are paramount.\\n           in our democracy, anti-abortion groups have the right to demonstrate. they can lobby parliament and march through london or any other town. however, they should not be allowed to abuse individual women who, having made an often painful and difficult decision, are attending clinics for treatment that they are, by law, allowed to have. threatening individual women who are seeking treatment is cowardly. my bill puts the women\\'s rights and their safety first. it creates a clear criminal offence where there is intimidation or where people\\'s access is blocked.\\n           it is necessary to give women a choice at an earlier stage, when they are considering what to do. that is why my bill puts on general practitioners an onus to inform women what sort of counselling is available and might be helpful to them. violent demonstration and intimidation should be no part of the process. the home secretary was right to have don treshman of rescue america arrested and deported on the grounds that his activities were not conducive to the public good. however, that was not a satisfactory mechanism. in any case, we have our own home-grown intimidation and women bashers. nor are obstruction laws the right ones to use in these circumstances. we saw how the police implemented those laws: they prevented women from securing their legal rights. we need a clear-cut law making it illegal to block access to abortion clinics.\\n           it is ironic that one outcome of these incidents is that demonstrations in the royal parks are not acceptable. in the interests of the women and clinic workers, demonstrations outside abortion clinics should not be acceptable. we should have this law in place before these dangerous fanatics return in september, as they have vowed to do.\\n           the bill is supported by the national abortion campaign and the abortion law reform group. last week, one anti-abortion hon. member tabled a motion on obscenity. it urges the government to balance freedom of speech with their responsibility to protect children, women and men from degradation and violence. i similarly seek to protect women who are lawfully using abortion clinics from this latest form of violence by anti-abortion extremists. an editorial on this issue in the independent concluded with these words: women should know that they can have abortions within the law without fear of intimidation or more distress than they will in any case experience. my bill enshrines that.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1993, 5, 19, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1993-05-19.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1993-05-19.4.1.2', 834, 'uk.m.10646', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', \"i wish to oppose the motion. the hon. member for leyton (mr. cohen) raised a number of important issues on which opinions in the house and outside are deeply held and strongly felt.\\n           i share the hon. gentleman's concern about the recent scenes that we have witnessed outside both abortion clinics and the administrative headquarters of those who advocate abortion. those of us who are members of the all-party parliamentary pro-life group have no truck whatever with those individuals or organisations, whatever their views or philosophy, who advocate violence, intimidation or the flouting of the law as a means of furthering their ends.\\n           that rejection of violence and intimidation applies to those from the socialist workers party and the national abortion campaign who have turned up with the deliberate intention of disrupting peaceful demonstrations, rallies and religious services. it applies equally to those who share our abhorrence of abortion but adopt methods with which we have no sympathy and to which we give no support.\\n           our opposition to the criminal destruction of property in abortion clinics is as strong as our opposition to the destruction of property that took place during the debate on the bill introduced some time ago by the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton), when the headquarters of the society for the protection of unborn children was ransacked by pro-abortion extremists. our opposition to assaults on any person seeking or advocating an abortion is as strong as our opposition to the sort of cowardly attack which was perpetrated some time ago on the then father of the house and right hon. member for castle point, sir bernard braine, who was assaulted by a gang of pro-abortion thugs outside a prayer meeting at the royal albert hall.\\n           i hope that i have shown that there is some common ground between myself and the hon. member for leyton, but despite our common rejection of violence as a means of achieving political change within our parliamentary democracy, i cannot support his appeal. violence and intimidation are already illegal in this country, as indeed are crimes against property. there already exists a wide range of powers available to the courts to deal with such activities, whether they take place outside abortion clinics or outside factories.\\n           i wonder whether the hon. gentleman would be so keen to ask for tougher action against those on the timex picket line? the law surely must be applied firmly, but fairly and equally, to protect all who seek to exercise their right to demonstrate peacefully, and to prevent violence and intimidation wherever it arises.\\n           the hon. member for leyton seeks also to liberalise still further the abortion act 1967 by creating a new requirement to provide information and counseling services, which suggests that there is a right under present legislation to have an abortion. that is not the case. the legislation merely provides a defence against prosecution if abortion is performed under one of a given set of circumstances. it does not provide for a right of access to abortion.\\n           that is an important legal point, because it is now common practice to interpret the legislation differently, with many doctors openly operating a policy of abortion on demand. the result is that more than 90 per cent. of abortions are performed for reasons of social convenience. a staggering 3·7 million abortions have now been performed under the terms of the abortion act. of those, only 151—or 0·004 per cent.—were performed in emergency to save the life of the mother.\\n           the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale (sir d. steel), when he promoted the legislation 25 years ago, told us that abortion would liberate women and make every child a wanted child. the opposite has been the effect. abortion has allowed society to sweep under the carpet the very problems for which it was hailed as a panacea.\\n           abortion has failed abysmally. it allows the continuing exploitation of women and their health and, as the inexorable increase in child abuse has shown, the devaluation of human life before birth has altered society's attitudes to children after birth. the hon. member for leyton and those who profess their faith in the nostrum of liberal abortion laws can now look back on 25 years of failure, of the exploitation of women, and of the slaughter of unborn children.\\n           for those reasons, we should not give the hon. member leave to bring in his bill. those listening to what is said today should take note of the fact that a decision not to divide the house should not be taken to mean support for this measure. it is simply a sign that there are many important issues on today's order paper—issues on which hon. members want to make progress without wasting time by dividing the house over an issue which is little more than a stunt to enable those who share the hon. gentleman's extremist views to curry favour with their supporters in the pro-abortion lobby outside the house.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1993, 5, 19, 0, 0),

miller, sir george sinclair, mr. david steel, mr. james white, and mr. frederick willey be members of the select committee on the abortion (amendment) bill. the motion refers to the setting up of a select committee to consider the abortion (amendment) bill so that it can proceed with its work without any delay.\\n           as has been said, i move the motion in the terms of standing order no. 13, which, as far as i can establish, is a procedure rarely used in the commons but i believe was designed for the kind of situation which has been created by the repeated objections of a small group of hon. members to the membership of the select committee proposed by the treasurer of her majesty\\'s household, which coincides with my choice.\\n           hon. members will recall that on friday 7th february the abortion (amendment) bill presented by the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) and sponsored by hon. members of all parties, including myself, was given a second reading by a substantial majority—203 in favour and 88 against.\\n           thereafter, the house unanimously agreed, without a vote and without any dissenting voice, that the matter should be referred to a select committee. these were clear decisions of the house, one by a massive majority and the other unanimous. therefore, the will and the intention of the house were clearly established.\\n           i understand that shortly afterwards there were discussions through the usual channels which led to the government putting down the motion on the order paper proposing the names of a number of hon. members to serve on the select committee. the membership proposed, in my view, and, i believe, in the view of the vast majority of the house, included respected and fair-minded members. the proposed membership also reflected the opinion of the house on the merits of the bill: some supporters, some opponents, and some who did not vote on 7th february. four of the proposed members were women, two of whom had voted against the bill and the other two had not voted on 7th february.\\n           however, as must have been obvious to everyone who has stayed late in the commons in recent nights, the motion nominating the members to serve on the select committee has been blocked by a small minority of hon. members, all of whom, so far as i am aware—[an hon. member: \"women.\"]—are bitter opponents of the bill, which, as i said, was approved in the house by a substantial majority. in my view, these blocking tactics are frustrating the will of the house that a select committee be established and allowed to get on with its work. it has been clear that there were these feelings. we must not allow such tactics to continue. the list of amendments to the membership of the select committee despite points which have been made to me about disagreements on its composition, are frivolous and demonstrate the real intentions of the objectors to delay and frustrate the setting up of the committee.\\n           i will give one example. the amendments propose that all the male members on the committee be removed, including the promoter of the bill. i suggest that, while there might be disagreements about the right persons to serve on the committee, it is frivolous on a bill of this nature to suggest that not only the pro- moter of the bill but all the male members be taken off it.\\n           although it is distinctly unwise these days for any conservative to minimise the contribution that ladies can make to the political progress of britain, i cannot believe that the house would consider it appropriate that a bill of this kind should be considered by a select committee consisting entirely of women members and effectively packed with opponents of the bill which the house approved by a substantial majority. it cannot be right that minorities within this house should be able to ignore the will of the house and impose their will on it. that is what is happening. we might as well propose that the finance bill committee should consist only of chartered accountants and that the coal bill committee should consist only of miners.\\n           the working of the abortion act has caused grave disquiet in the nation. that was reflected by the attendance in the house of commons on 7th february and the clear decision that was taken on that day. the house agreed that a select committee should be appointed. the only issue now remaining concerns who should serve on it. as a result of consultations, a list of hon. members has been proposed. i believe that the vast majority of reasonable hon. members will agree with the choice that has been made. if not, we must come to a decision so that the committee, of whatever membership, can get on with its job.\\n           the object of the motion is to enable the house to express a view on the membership of this proposed select committee so that it can get on with its work. i believe that is the intention of the vast majority of the house and that that intention is being frustrated.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 26, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-26.8'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-26.8.1.11', 620, 'uk.m.17922',

women of this country, to the men who care for those women, and to their families. the use of the word \"frivolous\" nullifies any serious attention that the house should give to this preposterous motion.\\n           i do not oppose the use of standing order no. 13. it is a very good standing order because it protects the rights of this house. i regret that we have fallen into a habit of thought which accepts that the usual channels shall appoint members to select committees. in fact, according to the rules of the house, the whole house selects members. that is the origin of the term \"select committee\".\\n           in the course of my brief researches, i discovered that up to about 1817 it was not unusual for members of select committees to be chosen by ballot. had we done that on this occasion, we might have had a better result. but let us cherish the rights of the house to have some say in these appointments.\\n           it is in some ways invidious for hon. members to discuss the nominations to the committee, but we must do so as a matter of duty. if it is said that the number of women—four out of 15—on the committee represents the proportion of women members, i must confess that my rather inadequate arithmetic suggests that we should have only 4½ per cent. of one woman on the committee. i therefore submit that we cannot appoint the membership of committees on the basis of that kind of arithmetic. it is not our fault that there are so few of us here to represent the women of this country, who are more than half the population.\\n           our request for more women on the committee was represented by the hon. member for cathcart and some of his hon. friends as part of the pro-abortion lobby. we reject that entirely. we are exposing ourselves by asking—[hon. members: \"hear, hear.\"] how cheap, how vulgar. by asking for more women members on the committee we might, god forbid, find ourselves joined by the hon. member for dunbartonshire, east (mrs. bain) and the hon. member for birmingham, edgbaston (mrs. knight). but they have a point of view which should be represented on the committee.\\n           i am not making this speech on the basis of a pro-or anti-abortion stand but on the basis that there should be more women members representing a wide range of the opinions of women in this country. i know that there is a big division among women, but let us have women on the committee to put these points of view.\\n           when i first came to the house, the late herbert morrison said to me \"you will do all right, girl, so long as you stick to women\\'s questions.\" i was so angry about that that i made my maiden speech on foreign affairs. he said to me afterwards \"i am sorry that you did not take my advice.\" i said \"i did—i was trying to speak about peace.\" throughout my 20 years in this house i have taken the view that there are very few questions which should be pigeonholed as \"women\\'s\" questions. i do not believe that prices is a women\\'s question or that the care of children is a woman\\'s question. that suggests that fathers do not care about their children. very few matters can be specifically defined in that way.\\n           however, not one hon. gentleman in this house has ever had an abortion or has had to contemplate having one.

later i shall go into those particular points.\\n           my original point was that on the 1966 bill there was a quite overwhelming majority in favour of its second reading. but the proponents of the bill, the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) and his hon. friends, of whom i numbered myself one, quite generously, in the interests of a proper debate taking in every aspect of the abortion argument, decided that they would not insist on anything like a numerical balance in the membership or the standing committee in 1966 which corresponded proportionately to the vote on second reading.\\n           in fact, the proponents of the bill, through all the usual channels—it went through somewhat more smoothly in those days than it seems to go nowadays—gave what one might call very loosely the anti-abortion lobby quite considerable representation on that committee, which, as the hon. member for essex, south-east will remember, they used to the full throughout long days and, later, long nights of 1966 and 1967. it was only because in 1966–67 we had a unique and extraordinarily long session, running from the spring of one year to the autumn of the next, that the bill ever passed through parliament.\\n           the house of commons works on precedent. we respect precedent. we accept that, having done a thing in one particular way once, there is a very good argument for following roughly those lines when next we come upon the question. here we came to a situation in which, as my hon. friend the member for bethnal green and bow (mr. mikardo) has pointed out, we had a substantial second reading vote supporting the bill of the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white). those who supported that bill did so for a variety of reasons. some supported it because they were against abortions altogether. others supported it because they were against abortions except in a very small number of medical cases where the life of the mother was in jeopardy. others supported it in relation to looking after physical health but had grave doubts about the mental health aspects. others supported it on health grounds but had great objection to the eugenic clause—and vice versa.\\n           a vast number of those who went into the lobby to support the bill of my hon. friend the member for pollok, whom i am glad to see to my left this afternoon, did so for the very good reason that some quite scandalous abuses were taking place in the private sector and they wanted those matters cleaned up, and in no way did they support the various other parts of the bill which purported to introduce such words as \"grave\" and \"serious\" into the bill, and which put upon the doctor the onus of proving before a jury that his actions had been in good faith and properly undertaken. there was, therefore, a sort of balance.\\n           what happened after that? there was a certain amount of to-ing and fro-ing and, of course, the usual channels are very complicated in terms of private members\\' bills of this kind. in fact, one of the troubles about the government refusing to take on board the clearing up of abuses such as exist in the private sector of abortion is that—if i may use the phrase—we get our parliamentary knickers in the sort of twist that they are in today. if either of the previous governments had decided to clear up these

want to reply at the moment, although i am sure that there are on the benches behind me other hon. members who are thinking of the sort of thing they might be able to say in this debate and who may well take up the various accusations with which i do not for a moment agree.\\n           as i was saying before the hon. gentleman intervened, after the second reading, the usual channels set to work to select a select committee, set up in rather unusual circumstances, in order to consider this bill. as i understand it, the usual channels were the official usual channels—the two-party usual channels—and the unofficial usual channels—that is to say, my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok and his most able lieutenant, or perhaps major-general-—i do not know which rank in this matter i ought to give him—who represents pontypool.\\n           as a result of this discussion, after some to-ing and fro-ing and lifting the numbers from 11 to 12, and then to 14 and then 15, the balance came out, on the kind of precedent to which this house is accustomed, fairly according to precedent.\\n           what i am saying about the committee is that we have here in our abortion precedents a far more proper precedent whereby the virulent opponents of abortion and the virulent proponents of abortion on occasions such as this can come together to produce a select committee which properly balances all the very fiercely held divisions of opinion within this house without getting too mathematical and neurotic about percentages and proportions, in the way that it seems is permitted by the usual channels, prompted perhaps by the hon. member for pontypool—i do not know; i was not privy to any of those usual channel discussions—and prompted perhaps by a feeling on the part of the official usual channels that these things should be done strictly according to precedent. whatever the reason, it came out as it has done. the point i am making is that since we have this precedent of the generosity of the proponents of making abortion rather more free in 1966, there was a very good case on this committee also for that same spirit of generosity, with a precedent to which this house so often generously responds.\\n           i should like to come to what might be called the sex imbalance on this committee. i do so with some trepidation because i am surrounded by a host of female witnesses who may be able to put this point a good deal better than i can, but i have some qualifications. i have some right to do so since my very brief speech—you will remember, mr. deputy speaker, that it lasted for no more than three minutes, as i promised—on second reading was devoted solely to this topic.\\n           it is rather grotesque for 600 grown men—some of them very elderly, or at least getting on a bit—solemnly to pronounce on what women should do with their bodies. the difficulties that we are having with this committee, i believe, were reflected in the selection of people to speak during the second reading. of course, i make no criticism whatsoever of the selection of speakers, but as it turned out in the second reading on the abortion bill the women's voice in this house was sadly quashed. many women wished to speak in that debate but did not succeed because of the shortness of time on a friday. if the pattern of membership on the select committee is to reflect that trend again, not only will the select committee be unbalanced from the point of view of the proper proportions of opinion in the house, but it will also have far too small a voice from the women in this house for all the reasons of which we are fully apprised, having listened to my hon. friend the member for holborn and st. pancras, south (mrs. jeger) in her very able speech this afternoon.\\n           i should like to respond, if i may do so without trespassing on the rules of order—because i think this is pertinent to the balance of the committee—to the point made by the hon. member for essex, south-east. he put to me the point that we should not be in this procedural difficulty today were is not for the fact of the abuses in the private sector, and i very much agree with him. i wish that the administrative matters which the minister of state announced on second reading had been put into effect seven or eight years ago.\\n           but, even more than that, we had a bill introduced into parliament by the hon. member for surrey, north-west (mr. grylls) in the february-october parliament—the 1974 rump parliament, if i may so describe it—which had the support of the government and could have gone through this house had it not been killed by the most virulent supporters of the anti-abortion lobby. it was not the pro-abortion lobby which killed that excellent bill, which could have gone through this house; it was the memebrs of the anti-abortion lobby, led by the hon. member for birmingham, edgbaston (mrs. knight), who is not in the chamber and does not seem to have been here for some time, and we have missed her in the debate. it is pertinent that it was that lobby, the violent, virulent, anti-abortion lobby, which was responsible for the fact that there are these abuses in the practice of abortion, which are quite rightly objected to by hon. members on all sides of the house.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 26, 0, 0),

constituents and i am the representative of mine, and all hon. members represent their constituents, whatever their sex.\\n           it would be a gross perversion of parliamentary practice if we said that merely because an issue concerned a particular section of the community, that section of the community alone should be represented on the committee. only this past week we had debates on,

last night was in any way due to me. there was some talk that there would be a filibuster so that today\\'s business would not take place. i am sincerely happy that that did not occur.\\n           more important, i humbly and sincerely apologise to the house for the late publication of the bill. i realise that that caused problems to hon. members on both sides of the house. that was in no way meant as a discourtesy to the house.\\n           i found it a complicated matter to try to amend the abortion act 1967, which in turn must be read in conjunction with the infant life (preservation) act 1929, which in its turn does not cover scotland. i was working with scottish lawyers, and we encountered difficulties. i apologise to the house. i regret that the bill is now in its present form, due to circumstances beyond my control. any drafting errors can be corrected at a later date.\\n           i am well aware that this is a highly emotional subject. i make one point clear at the outset. in my election campaigns i always strongly supported the strengthening of the 1967 act. i did so because of a personal conviction, because of the way in which i felt about the matter, and not because numerous organisations outside the house supported my view. the fact that we have the same view is beside the point.\\n           any legislation that has attracted so much attention since it went on the statute book cannot be right in the eyes of the house or in those of the public. there is the other side of the coin. while i want to tighten up the regulations, the national abortion campaign wants them relaxed. that organisation supported the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) when he sponsored the 1967 measured. it wants abortion on demand by a doctor, a nurse or any other woman. to me that it is totally wrong.\\n           this subject has been well debated, but no conclusion has ever been reached. there was a long sitting of and a report from the lane committee, which took evidence from many bodies and individuals. that did nothing to quieten the outcry against the 1967 bill. that was followed by a bill introduced by the hon. member for dunbartonshire, west (mr. campbell). that went to a select committee. that was followed by bills from my hon. friends the members for buckingham (mr. benyon) and for essex, south-east (sir b. braine). back in 1970 there was an attempt by the right hon. member for chelmsford (mr. st. johnstevas) to change the law. for all that, i make no apology for once again bringing this matter before the house. the issue will not go away until it has been resolved and some of the existing anomalies tightened up.\\n           my bill has been criticised for containing too much, but it is a wise counsel that puts in something that can be given away. others have criticised the bill for not having enough in it. at the end of the 1967 debate the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles said that it was not the intention of the promoters of the bill to leave a wide open door for abortion on request. sadly, that is exactly what happened. many right hon. and hon. members who supported the 1967 act are now deeply and sincerely worried about its effects. now we must decide whether we continue to support that act.\\n           as far back as 21 july 1971 professor peter huntingford first stated in the daily telegraph that he was practising abortion on request. he said: i have no qualms about this at all, and i am quite certain that it does not contravene the abortion act. he added that the act allowed abortion when the risk of permitting the pregnancy to continue was greater than the risk of the abortion. the simple fact is that when an abortion is carried out in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it is safer than allowing the pregnancy to go to full term. he said that he was certain that no legal or disciplinary action could be taken against him and that the hospital governors were aware of his policy and had no objection. a working party of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, in its report on unplanned pregnancies in 1972, stated: those doctors who feel that abortion on demand is correct are able to apply that belief to their practice. it is not surprising that there has been some dismay at the interpretation of that act. the whole area of statistical risk must be looked at.\\n           it seems to me that those are not the criteria that the 1967 act tried to lay down. this matter was much discussed in committee. the lane committee declared that the criteria should be left alone. however, the select committee recommended in its conclusions that a decision must be left to the individual consciences of members. that can be done only if a change in the criteria is offered in the bill. that is why i included the wording of the original bill. if that had not been done, it would have been unfair to the house. the other place changed the wording of clause 1 of the 1967 bill and inserted the statistical risk provision.\\n           there have been many complaints that the words \" grave \", \" substantial \" and \" serious \" cannot be defined. the words of section 1(1) (b) of the 1967 act are: that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped \". two of those words are already used in the bill. i accept that \" grave \" is not, but in a recent poll 78 per cent. of the gynaecologists asked said that they were perfectly happy with the word \" grave \" and would be able to define it.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4.1.3', 24, 'uk.m.10171',

also an interesting statistic that 43 per cent. of all women who have terminations of pregnancy are pregnant again within one year. many of the women who have telephoned me over the last three weeks

unhappy women. many of them bitterly regret having had their abortion and express in their letters the importance of counselling. if only they had known what it all entailed, they would not have gone through with the abortion.\\n           it is against that background that i looked at the select committee's recommendations. having studied them all, i decided that the most important issues were, first, the criteria which i have mentioned; secondly, the reduction of the upper time limit from 28 weeks to 20 weeks; thirdly, the strengthening of the conscience clause in favour of nurses, orderlies and ancillary workers; fourthly, a clause to encourage better counselling, because i think that this is at the heart of the matter; and fifthly, an escape clause concerning possible damage to the foetus.\\n           i felt at that time that licensing should not be included because i was in the process of having talks with the minister and had high hopes that some arrangement could be made in this area. unfortunately, due to the tight schedule, and because there was not time to explore all the possible avenues, i was left at the last moment with the choice of leaving licensing out and hoping for some satisfaction about it from the minister today, or, if that was not forthcoming, inserting it in the bill in committee.\\n           i feel that it would have been grossly misleading the house if i had left out licensing and tried to put it in at the committee stage. it is too important a matter. i therefore put it in. i hope that today the minister will be able to

they now openly advertise in the tube stations, in large letters, \" abortion help \" or \" abortion advice \", and they claim almost a 100 per cent. success rate. it seems to me that pregnancy advice has gone out of the window and that these agencies have now simply become referral agencies for those who want abortions. if that is the situation, it is very sad indeed. what these girls want when they go to agencies is counselling on how they can be helped out of the difficult situation into which they have got themselves. many of these girls do not necessarily want to have the abortion. a large number of them probably do, but they really must get that sort of counselling.\\n           i question how ethical these agencies are, and i ask the minister to comment. surely, if these

committee once again. perhaps i may quote what the select committee said: those giving evidence to last session\\'s committee and your committee have generally been agreed that the upper limit should be less than 28 weeks but have not all agreed about what the limit should be. sir john peel, in evidence, repeated the view of his committee that it should be 20 weeks. the british medical association, as they had done to the lane committee, supported the peel recommendation. the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecology said that \\' to terminate pregnancies at 20

exactly what i have done in the bill. i have certainly not proposed that section 4(2) should be taken out, as the bma suggested in its letter of yesterday.\\n           this is a very difficult area. large numbers of doctors, midwives and nurses have written to me—if the hon. member for barking (miss richardson) wants proof of this, she can come to see me—saying that their chances of promotion in gynaecological work are nil because of their beliefs. the choice in many cases seems to be one of doing the work in cleaning up after abortions, or getting out of the gynaecological wards. that should not be the choice.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4.1.26', 68, 'uk.m.10181', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'will the hon. gentleman

hope that the house will not today support, the second reading of a bill that would make abortion more difficult.\\n           as secretary of state, i honestly sought to tackle some of the abuses that existed. there is no doubt that there were abuses, and i believe that the effective licensing system to which the hon. gentleman referred, and other administrative measures in response to the recommendations of the lane committee, changed the situation.\\n           i agree entirely with dr. marks, deputy chairman of thg british medical association's representative body, in the statement that he made the day before yesterday. the house will not be surprised to know that the bma and i have not always been in agreement, but on this we are. dr. marks says: the policy of the association is made by the representative body, comprising 600 elected members from all branches of medicine. dr. marks goes back to minute 82 of a meeting in 1977 and he quotes it, as follows: this representative body opposes the present abortion (amendment bill) and reaffirms its view that the difficulties arising from the 1967 abortion act can be remedied by appropriate changes in the regulations and that amendments to the act itself are not required. dr. marks goes on: the necessary changes were made and the following year the representative body resolved ' that this meeting deplores the persistent attacks on the 1967 abortion act and reaffirms its belief that it is a practical and humane piece of legislation.' … those of us who are privileged to practise medicine have seen many advances in the last few years. the elimination of the septic abortion, a direct result of the abortion act, is one of the greatest. if this bill is passed it will put the clock back and do untold physical and emotional harm to many poor women who will again seek ' help ' under exceptional circumstances. it is known from backstreet abortionists. i read that out because that is the view of the british medical association. let there be no misunderstanding that that is where the bma stands.\\n           there have been many benefits from this bill because of the action that has been taken since 1967. only one death was recorded in 1976 after an illegal abortion, compared with 22 in 1968. septic abortions were referred to by dr. marks. the number of hospital discharges after treatment for septic abortion, a common result of botched illegal abortion, fell from more than 3,000 to 610 in 1975. i could quote many other statistics but i do not want to take up the time of the house.\\n           for two or three minutes, i want to deal with clause 1(1) (a) and (3) (c) which deal with the proposed change from 28 weeks to 20 weeks, which, of course, is the nub of the bill, as the hon. member for bute and north ayrshire accepted. happily—the hon. gentleman admitted this—the proportion of abortions carried out after 20 weeks is minute. it is still less than 1 per cent. the vast majority are carried out before 12 weeks from gestation, and it is an increasing proportion.\\n           no doctor wants to undertake a late abortion, but there are exceptional circumstances. perhaps i may touch upon four, because they are very crucial and affect the upper limit. first, there is the teenage girl or the mentally handicapped girl who has been hiding her pregnancy through fear or ignorance; secondly, there is the woman with irregular periods; and, thirdly, there is the woman whose pregnancy has been wrongly diagnosed and, fourthly, older women who mistake the symptoms of pregnancy for those of menopause.\\n           there are other exceptional circumstances in which a doctor can, using his clinical judgment and the rights provided by the 1967 act, under those very special circumstances, take action after 20 weeks.\\n           evidence was given by what was my department—the department of health and social security—to the select committee on 12 may 1975. it was as follows: the fact that less than 1 per cent. of all abortions are at present undertaken at 20 or more weeks gestation appears to indicate that doctors are prepared to perform them only that some of the women who present late for an abortion are those with a most pressing case—some of the mentally subnormal, and the under 16's. the clause would deny abortions to such women. again, while special provision is made for those likely to give birth to a disabled child, even a limit of 24 weeks might not always allow definite diagnosis of disability to be made and acted upon. on the other hand, it might lead to a decision to terminate within the legal time limits and in advance of conclusive evidence being available. that is the reason why so many doctors believe that if the terms of the bill were to be carried through we might well find that more pregnancies were terminated later than at present.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0),

their licences. there is now an approved list of 35 bureaux that are regularly and thoroughly inspected.\\n           i took my responsibilities very seriously indeed. having followed the debates and

and rational atmosphere, because the matter that we are discussing today, while emotional, is also serious. i believe that the right hon. member for norwich, north (mr. ennals) appreciates that point as well. i am sure that he will agree that in the interests of this debate and in the interests of the house coming to a rational and considered opinion, we should try to keep our tempers.\\n           abortion affects two areas of human life, and both of these should be the priority in our minds during this debate. first, abortion affects the woman who undergoes it. her health, well-being and protection from exploitation must be of paramount importance in considering the bill. secondly, it affects the child—a foetus, may be, but a putative human being for whom we cannot and would not deny responsibility and concern. i hope that on these two aspects we shall draw our conclusions today. in short, we are discussing the interests, welfare and scrupulous care of pregnant women and their unborn offspring.\\n           this bill is an amending measure. it does not seek to innovate or abolish. it sets out to regulate existing legislation. it sets out to regulate the workings of the 1967 act, which have created sufficient anxiety and disquiet to warrant rectification.\\n           very few hon. members can truly sit back and say that they are totally happy with the working of the 1967 act. indeed, the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel)—i am sorry that he is not here today but i have given him notice that i intend to refer to him—has, over the past few months, made it clear that he believes that the foetal age limit of 28 weeks is too high and should be reviewed.\\n           as recently as 5 july the right hon. member wrote to a constituent in very much the same terms as the statement that he put out on tuesday, in which he said that he would support a bill that implemented the peel committee\\'s recommendation on the foetal age limit. however, when he discovered that the peel committee\\'s recommendation was for an age limit of 20 weeks, he decided, in a statement issued this morning, that he was in error, and that he meant the lane committee.\\n           it is relevant to remind hon. members of the peel committee\\'s report on this matter. i shall read a statement issued by sir john peel yesterday in the light of the statement of the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles. sir john said: i am puzzled by what mr. steel says when he states that he would support a bill implementing the peel committee recommendations, and then goes on to say that there is no authoritative recommendation by the peel committee for a 20-week limit, and that this is why he would not support such a recommendation. paragraph 31 of the peel report states that \\' for ethical, medical and social reasons we recommend that for human foetuses evidence of a period of gestation of 20 weeks (140 days which corresponds to a weight of approximately 400–500 grammes) should be regarded as prima facie proof of viability at the present time.\\' that statement by the peel committee was in 1972. sir john went on to say that the next paragraph in the report reads: this date (20 weeks) should be reviewed regularly to take account of the rapid changes taking place in medical knowledge. accordingly, consideration should be given to the amendment of acts providing for registration and notification of births and deaths, also the infant life preservation act 1929, and analogous legislation in scotland and northern ireland. that is what this bill sets out to do. i hope that when he considers that fact the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles, who was the author of the original act, will find that he is able to support this bill in its later stages.\\n           in effect, the bill looks at abortion from four aspects. the first is the viable age of the foetus—the limit that was set by the 1929 legislation and carried on in the 1967 act. the second is the criteria for abortion. the third is the conscience clause and the fourth is the proper control over the agencies and clinics involved in providing abortions.\\n           the hon. member for edinburgh, east (mr. strang), in an intervention, said that he thought there was too much in this bill. it could be argued that there is too little. there are other aspects which might well have been put in—aspects such as the practice of carrying out medical experiments upon live aborted foetuses which, because of the uncertainty of the definition of the law at present—[hon. members: \" there is none.\"] there is more than evidence of this. if hon. members on the opposition benches will listen i shall try to provide that evidence.\\n           in 1970 the medical news tribune published a photograph of a baby in a tank. the description that was given of it was \" an artificial uterus \". the research at cambridge university\\'s department of experimental medicine was shown, and in an article accompanying the published photograph the situation was described as \" keeping the foetus alive for experiments \".\\n           in april 1978 the scottish newspapers published reports of experiments being carried out on foetuses, minutes after the operation. at the time this was confirmed by top scottish gynaecologists and the scottish home and health department. this is the kind of evidence that should raise the possibility in the minds of hon. members on both sides of the house that this is a matter that could, had the bill set out to alter the structure of the act, have been included.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4.1.59', 128, 'uk.m.17319',

can assess results and consequences as well as any other lay person, and i, too, can try to find out what the effects are.\\n           i refer the hon. lady to an extract from appendix 1 of the first report of the select committee on abortion in the session 1975–76, a note by dr. r. d. t. farmer and miss sally o'brien. in the note, based on a study carried out in three adjoining areas of london of young people who had taken an overdose of drugs in an attempt at self-poisoning, they stated: of the overdose group, 29 per cent. had had abortions compared to 13 per cent. of the control group … the investigation suggests that either abortion and self-poisoning occur in the same type of individual, or that abortion increases the likelihood of subsequent self poisoning. i am not using this evidence within the context of the bill as part of the argument against abortion. what i believe it emphasises—and i beileve sincerely that the hon. lady will agree—is the need for scrupulous and objective counselling and scrupulous medical care in dealing with people who are having abortions. i do not believe that any hon. member can disagree with that need. any situation in which women who find themselves pregnant can be, or are, exploited should be equally repugnant to us all.\\n           it is for that reason that a large part of the bill is concerned with the standard of control of the facilities available to women seeking pregnancy advice and treatment. if labour members look at clause 4 they will find the conditions for the licensing of clinics and referral agencies, many of which conditions i am sure they would not dispute. they cover medical standards, amenity standards, and so on.\\n           it amazes me how much antagonism there was, before the debate, to the proposals to separate counselling and referral agencies from the abortion clinics. surely, if a woman seeks advice on her pregnancy, she wishes that advice to be considered and objective. how can an advising or counselling agency be totally objective when a proportion of its income depends on the carrying out of abortions for cash at its associated clinics?\\n           i am making no imputations; i am stating the obvious. where there is a financial incentive to advise in a particular way, the objectivity of that advice must be suspect. it is like a house buyer asking the person from whom he is buying the house to do the survey and the valuation. the incentive to advise in a particular way is too strong to risk. most house buyers in those circumstances would seek an independent valuation and an independent survey.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4.1.73', 10, 'uk.m.10464', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN',

way can the risk of the exploitation of women, often in tragic circumstances, be completely avoided. if, as is apparently already happening, the national health service is beginning to farm out abortions to cash clinics, it is even more vital from the government's point of view that those institutions be seen to be above the possibility of exploitation and commercial activity.\\n           the whole clause is designed to protect the pregnant woman. her welfare, and not the welfare of the clinic, is what is important to us here today. i do not believe that any objective woman who studies this part of the bill can in her heart object to it.\\n           few women, in the knowledge that abortion can harm them, will want one unless it is both necessary and advisable. a woman must be able

intangible theme, a commonality of interest, which seems to have brought together many strange bedfellows. they include practitioners, purveyors of contraceptives, and humanists. i hope, although i

appeared a couple of days later—said that the reason for its lateness was partly to prevent the abortion campaign launching an attack upon it. it is a new principle of legislation that a sponsor

how many committees the hon. gentleman has served, but i ask him to think carefully about this matter. it is not all that easy to put things right in committee. i was a member of the standing committee on the previous abortion bill, which sat, in total, for 75 hours. we tried very hard to put that bill right and to make it more liberal. it was very difficult to get changes through the committee. although the sponsor of the bill may consider himself to be a liberal reformer of the 1967 act, i believe that some of the people behind him and around him may not be quite so liberal. once

facilities for abortion, preferably moving towards day care clinics, which are now emerging, he would have earned the respect and support of the whole house.\\n           the percentage of abortions performed in different parts of the country is most revealing. hon. members should examine some of the statistics. for example, a woman can obtain an abortion provided that she has the necessary certificates, but whether the operation is performed in an nhs hospital depends on where she lives. in the north-east of england, parts of wales and parts of the south-west, more than 90 per cent. of women have their abortions in nhs hospitals. that is as it should be. i believe that the figure of abortions should be 100 per cent. in nhs hospitals, but 90 per cent. is not a bad figure. however, at the other end of the scale the position is horrific. in the west midlands, for example in dudley, only 6 per cent. of women are able to obtain abortions in nhs hospitals, in north birmingham only 7 per cent., and in wolverhampton only 8 per cent. it is disgraceful that that should happen in this day and age.\\n           if we had to have such a bill, it should have corrected that kind of abuse

this—and rightly so. however, the redbridge and waltham forest area health authority—an aha that i know well—has confirmed that the foetus was never alive outside the womb and that resuscitation equipment was not used because the foetus was too young to inflate its lungs. it is interesting that that case took place in the summer of 1978 yet it did not come to light until the very beginning of the general election campaign.\\n           in the case of the whiston foetus, the then minister of state, department of health and social security, wrote to the hon. member for liverpool, edge hill

against their will. one nurse may take that point of view, and that is her right. however, according to those distinguished bodies, there is no evidence that nurses are being leaned on in any way.\\n           there has been an attack on the referral agencies and charities. i was asked what the cost would be if national health service hospitals were able to perform the tasks of those agencies and charities. the department should be able to give that figure. if the bill is passed, an enormous gap will be created by the destruction of the charitable sector. by separating the referral agencies and the charities the british pregnancy advisory service and the pregnancy advisory service will be destroyed because it will not be possible for them to own and control both advisory service centres

well over 50 per cent. of abortions because the national health service is unable, because of a lack of facilities, to carry out more than 50 per cent. women who now go to bpas and pas will be forced not on the national health service but on to the back streets. the knitting needle is no joke. before the 1967 act was passed i worked in an office where there was a young junior of 15. she came in

behind other countries in research and in the way in which we treat subsequent pregnancies after abortion. this is of the utmost importance. if only we could rectify that problem, a great many abnormal births and a great deal of misery would be avoided in the future.\\n           i make the much more controversial claim that the bills that have been introduced following the 1967 act have made those who would not otherwise have thought about the issue consider the ethics of abortion. there have always been two extreme camps. the first camp consists of those who want no abortion. the second consists of those who want no restrictions. they want abortion freely available on demand or request. in between lie the great majority. they are worried and uncertain. they wish the issue would go away. many more of those who lie between the two camps have now grasped the true issues that are involved in the controversy.\\n           every thinking person now appreciates the absurd values of a society that protests passionately against any infringements of human rights, against capital punishment, imprisonment and torture where it is found and yet quite quietly destroys more than 100,000 of its own kind every year. that is the negative side.\\n           there is a strong positive side. there has been a far greater positive attempt to help those who are worried or distressed by an impending pregnancy, to show them that there are alternatives to abortion and to help them through pregnancy and subsequent care of their children. that has been one of the most encouraging developments of recent years. we should not lose sight of that.\\n           my hon. friend is right to include a criteria clause. the select committee suggested that the house should be given the opportunity to make its decision. my hon. friend has made provision for that suggestion. he has done no more and no less. he is again putting into the bill the words that were there originally and were subsequently removed by those in another place. however, i suspect that the changes that he suggests will not make very much difference. the new zealand experience has been quoted with a certain amount of justification. i do not think that any more prosecutions would result.\\n           my argument for wanting the criteria changed is the same as the argument advanced for the race relations acts and sex discrimination act—namely, that although we cannot change people\\'s attitudes and prejudices by law we can make plain the state\\'s point of view. that is especially important. i believe strongly that the future of this issue will be decided by education and the attitude of members of the rising generation. they will decide what happens. they will decide whether we have far freer abortion or whether it is restricted. from my experience of discussing the matter in schools and universities, i think that there has been a tremendous change. the matter is now considered much more carefully and reasonably than before. undoubtedly a considerable change has taken place.\\n           it is right for parliament to give a lead. the house cannot stand aside from such a major issue, any more than it can stand aside from the question of capital punishment. in essence, we must say what value we put on human life. that is the basis of the criteria clause. parliament should be given the opportunity to make its decision.\\n           there is little that i can add to what has been said on time limits and the conscience clause. both proposals have been tempered in the fire of previous discussion. there has been a great deal of discussion and we have been round and round the course. therefore, the issue is extremely clear.\\n           the separation clause is causing the greatest amount of concern among the opponents of the bill. i find myself in two minds after my experience with my own bill and the consideration that i have since been able to give to these matters. i accept entirely that it must be wrong for there to be any financial inducement for those counselling a pregnant woman to recommend an abortion at a certain clinic. however, i question whether the clause that appeared in my bill, and the clause that my hon. friend the member for bute and north ayrshire has put into his bill—i thank him for the compliment—would overcome the risk of financial inducement. the clause would be too easy to circumvent even it were passed.\\n           i favour much more a form of parliamentary control over the licensing process. i should like to see licences laid before parliament at regular intervals—for example, every three years—so that they could be considered and prayed against under the negative procedure, either individually or collectively. that would provide a far greater measure of control than that proposed either in my bill or the bill before us. that form of parliamentary control would make organisations far more open in their operation. the hon. member for barking must accept that.\\n           i am familiar with the british pregnancy advisory service operation in birmingham. i know how it is run. i know that certain aspects of it are beyond reproach. however, in a sense it is secretive. i appreciate that the essence of the counselling is that it must be sec- retive. nobody knows what goes on in the counselling room except the counsellor and the woman concerned. therefore, it is extremely difficult to introduce controls in any event. if there were parliamentary control, the charities in particular would be far more anxious to prove to members of parliament that they were giving a proper independent counselling service.\\n           if the bill were a government measure it would contain far more than is it it now. there are a number of features to which hon. members have referred which would be in the bill if it had been introduced by the government. many of the select committee\\'s recommendations have been omitted from my hon. friend\\'s bill. my hon. friend made that clear. however, i think that he will find that he has attempted too much. the fact that there is exploitation of women in the private sector and the fact that the balance has been tilted too far against the child in our current legislation are the factors that matter. those are the two basic wrongs that need to be rectified. the bill deserves the support of the house because it gives the house an opportunity to do so. for those reasons alone i believe that the bill should be supported.\\n           in conclusion i make a genuine plea. i am sure that it is the ardent desire of most hon. members to see the issue settled once and for all. having spoken to my colleagues, i am certain of that. i know that the opponents of the bill are sincere in their opposition. it is right that they oppose the bill as strongly as possible. however, i hope that their opposition, especially if the bill goes into committee, will be constructieve and not destructive. if they manage to stop—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'],

the house returned after the general election. i wanted to speak in the budget debate but i found myself sufficiently at variance with the view being expressed by opposition front bench speakers to have departed from the tradition of the house and been controversial. therefore i did not speak at that time.\\n           i am aware of the labour men and others who have sat here before me, perhaps even on this bench, since the turn of the century. there was mr. tommy cape, who was elected in 1918. on 24 february 1919 he spoke about the government\\'s proposals on the coal industry commission bill. tommy cape, who was elected by the miners, was able to set a clear objective for himself in the time that he was a member of the house. he sought the nationalisation of the mining industry, the six-hour day for the miner, and the improvement of miners\\' working conditions throughout this land. indeed, the objectives that tommy cape set for himself in his lifetime were realised when the mines were taken into public ownership in 1947.\\n           in 1945, the young lieutenant peart, fresh from the battlefields of europe, came to this place. on 20 august he made his maiden speech on the occasion of the gracious speech. he set for himself other objectives, one of which was to see peace develop in this country and in europe. his objective was international peace. certainly, with the elevation of fred peart to the house of lords in january 1976, it could be said that he saw some of his objectives realised. in 1945, referring to the prospective legislation mentioned in the gracious speech, he said: the success of that legislation depends on sound and healthy international relations … in conjunction with … all nations we must plan a new world.\"—[ official report, 20 august 1945; vol. 413, c. 357, 360.] that was a fine objective. fred peart was subsequently to become the minister or agriculture, fisheries and food in two governments, the leader of the house, and lord president of the council and leader of the house of lords. i am sure that he now feels that he has seen his objectives realised.\\n           in 1976 a new member of parliament was elected, following a highly important by-election in the workington constituency. i refer to mr. richard page. on 30 november he rose, as a conservative member of parliament, to make his maiden speech in the debate on the economy. he proposed the regeneration of british industry through reductions in taxation and the restoration of a free market. although i was unable to agree with much of what he said in the house, let me take this opportunity of wishing him the best of luck in all his future endeavours.\\n           that brings me to this debate. i, too, come to the house with clear objectives. i have been able to establish them for myself within the confines of the philosophy that i hold and that i hope is held by members of the opposition in common with me. i refer to the philosophy of socialism.\\n           in his book \" in place of fear \", dealing with democratic socialism, aneurin bevan said: the capacity for emotional concern for individual life is the most significant quality of a civilised human being. the problem is that the civilised human being is permanently and regularly being confronted by challenges of our time that cheapen life—the challenge of advertisement and the world of advertisement that has glamourised materialism at a cost to human life; the challenge of advancing technology that is inclined to discard the value of the human contribution and renders human effort too often superfluous; the challenge presented by the economics of the free market that turns one man against another, one creed against another, and one nation against another.\\n           those are all challenges. yet it is in a climate of those challenges that we, as socialists—and i in the light of my objectives—must try to raise the threshold of respect for life in this generation. that is the principal reason why i support the bill.\\n           at the root of the socialism that is held in common by the opposition, we have a belief that incites and inspires us to campaign on the international platforms of human rights. when we stand in our constituencies or move into the lobbies as a result of our commitment to vote against the reintroduction of hanging—i feel sure that all members of the opposition will refuse to support a bill to reintroduce hanging—we shall do so in the light of our understanding of our responsibilities to human, indeed, all, life.\\n           when we stand on platforms in our constituencies and demand that people feel with us against blood sports and cruel sports, we do so because we understand that these are real issues, they are moral issues, and they are inseparable from the very great and important issue that is being put before us today.\\n           when i think that earlier this week there were labour members who had considered banding together perhaps even to obstruct the bill as it was put before the house, i am saddened, because i believe that comfort and the convenience of some forms of abortion are being put before the moral issue of the preservation of human life in this society.\\n           when i think that the mighty labour conference—which a few of us on the labour benches believe must play a more important part in the minds of those who sit in the parliamentary labour party—was responsible for carrying a resolution which, in my view, would have liberalised even more the principle of abortion in this country, i am saddened again. i hope that one day in the labour conference we shall be able to reverse such resolutions.\\n           before the debate is closed at, perhaps, 4 p.m. today, i think that what happens during an abortion—particularly one that takes place after 20 weeks—should be brought to the attention of this house. instead of going to the lobbies which have a vested interest on each side, over the last 36 hours i have telephoned numbers of people in the medical profession in london in order to ask them what were their personal views on abortion.\\n           i was surprised to have referred to me stories of children—foetuses—that were born live after 22 weeks and that had lain on the slab after a caesarean section operation. i was told that if the bag were left unopened it would be 10 or 15 minutes before the heartbeat would stop. i was also told that, in the event of the bag being opened, the child—the foetus—could be seen to breathe and heard to cry.\\n           i would say, mr. deputy speaker, that this cannot be right, and that some of the operations that have been described to me during the last 36 hours cannot be permissible in a reasonable and civilised society. the law has become an ass, and i call upon my colleagues on the labour benches to join with others in the lobby today in asking that the bill be given the second reading that it so preciously requires.\\n           if there are aspects of the bill that some hon. members feel they are not able to swallow today, let them be willing to participate in the machinery of the committee, which, if we are fortunate, will review it, so that it can come before the house at some time in the future in a form that is acceptable to what i believe to be the great majority of the british people.\\n           i believe that it is the objective of the generation of people, particularly younger people, who are today taking their place in this house, to set down new markers for the future. those new markers are about creating a new threshold of respect for human life.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0),

like to intervene in the debate at this stage.\\n           i should like, first, very sincerely to congratulate the hon. member for workington (mr. campbell-savours) on his maiden speech. i found it a very eloquent and thoughtful maiden speech. it certainly moved me. if the hon. gentleman has any information on the kinds of cases to which he referred, i should be very glad to have it, because there is something there that i should want to look into. the whole house listened with great interest to what he said. he reminded us of his predecessors, the most recent of whom was richard page, who is missed by a great many of us on each side of the house. we shall all look forward with interest and anticipation to any further speeches from the hon. member.\\n           i should like also to congratulate my hon. friend the member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) on having come first in the ballot and for choosing this subject for his bill.\\n           i have been following the debate with great care and could not fail to note the many deep and sincere feelings of members on each side of the house. it has been a good and ample example of the need for the debate. if i may say so, abortion by any standards is—it must be—a very unpleasant and sometimes deeply unhappy subject.\\n           this is not an easy debate, and one of the features of it has been the way in which some of the best characteristics of the house have come out as we have discussed matters of such deep emotional significance. there are, indeed, very strong emotional feelings on each side. it is not surprising, for underneath the debate there is a very fundamental issue. in what circumstances is it right to take away the life of an unborn child? that is a point to which i keep returning.\\n           i am, of course, speaking as a member of the government. a predecessor of mine, in a similar debate, said that he was giving not a government view but a personal one. i do not know what the view of the house will be on this, but i do not see how, in the circumstances, i could possibly speak only on a personal basis, and therefore i hope that what i have to say will be along the line of considering whether the government have any additional information or any views which would assist hon. members to make up their minds.\\n           let us have no misunderstanding on this. from the government\\'s point of view, and from all our points of view, this issue is one for the house of commons to decide. it is a matter on which every member must and will follow his own conscience. anything that i say is not intended to influence that conscience in any particular direction. of course, i also have a personal view. with my background i could hardly avoid it.\\n           i have had to make recommendations for abortions. i have seen the advantages, but i have also seen the terrible stresses that it can cause both for a mother and for those advising her. i found myself agreeing very strongly with the remarks made by my hon. friend the member for edinburgh, south (mr. ancram) when he was talking about the emotional hazards, the later consequences, for some mothers when they have had an abortion.\\n           i have known mothers who have demanded an abortion. they have had very good grounds. afterwards, they have deeply regretted it, and said so. they have said that it was wrong that the abortion was carried out. but then, of course, i have known the reverse. in a previous debate i mentioned the poignant comment of a gynaecological colleague, a surgeon, who said to me \" it is all very well for you to fill in the form, but i actually have to do the job.\" that is a point of view that we have to bear in mind.\\n           however, i suggest to the house that we are not discussing today the merits of legal abortion. a number of hon. members have talked as though they were doing so. we in this house and this country decided in favour of legal abortion when we passed the abortion act 1967. that has been the law for some 11 years. with the greatest respect, i suggest that it is important that we should bear in mind that we are not discussing that today. what we are discussing today is a bill which is aimed at reducing the abuses which some people sincerely believe still continue under the present abortion act. i noted the remarks of my hon. friend the member for buckingham (mr. benyon) when he spoke very eloquently on this subject.\\n           in making up their minds, i am sure that hon. members will give great thought to the clear public concern, even among those who strongly favour abortion, that abuses are still going on today which should and could be cleared up. what we have to ask ourselves is this: will this bill help to resolve some of that public concern? if so, the house will decide that it should go into committee. if it is felt that the bill does not do that, perhaps it would be wrong for the bill to go into committee.\\n           i also have a duty to pass on to the house what i know or believe to be the views of professional people in this field. i shall turn in a moment to the question of the upper time limit, and i shall show that in this respect i have some sympathy with the principle to which the bill seeks to give effect. many of us in this country were horrified at the recent reports—on which i shall comment further shortly—of foetuses which had already—according to the reports; but i believe that they were incorrect—started an independent life. that horrified many sections of the public.\\n           the bill goes considerably beyond the limited objective of changing the number of weeks. i should like to refer first to clause 1 (b), inserting the words \" grave risk \" and \" substantial risk \" in the principal act. i am sure that hon. members realise that that alters significantly one of the key criteria laid down in the original act.\\n           as i said a moment ago, the act has been in operation for more than 11 years. its central provisions concerning the circumstances in which abortions should or should not be allowed were a very careful balance. they were finally written into the act after a very prolonged debate, which was so ably steered at the time by the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel).\\n           in april 1974 the lane committee recommended—again, after a very careful examination of six years\\' operation of the act and a good deal of research—that the criteria in the 1967 act should be left unchanged. in the 1975–76 session the select committee under the chairmanship of the right hon. member for sunderland, north (mr. willey) again made no recommendation for change in those criteria, although there were those among its witnesses who had very strongly pressed the case for change.\\n           i am bound to say to the house that i can report no proposal from the professions involved to change the criteria. indeed, i believe it to be generally the view of the professions that there should be no amendment to them.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'],

correct in his recollection of the deliberations of the lane committee. this was a serious consideration of that committee, but it came to the conclusion—i must come back to this—that legislation was probably not the right way to deal with the abuses that were taking place.\\n           the right hon. member for norwich, north (mr. ennals) referred to some of the steps that had been taken to see that abuses, when they occurred, were dealt with adequately. i suggest that that is something which, if the bill goes into committee, we shall want to look into again in great detail, because it is clearly very important.\\n           i was saying that at this stage i do not know of any proposal or request from the professions involved for a change in these criteria. in fact, there is a good deal of evidence that the professions which have to carry out this task would like to see the criteria left as they are. of course, it is for hon. members to listen carefully to the arguments advanced for this particular change and to reach their own conclusions, but i thought that it was right to draw their attention to these facts.\\n           it was reported in the press earlier this week that the chairman of one organisation, welcoming the provisions in the bill, estimated that if the bill were passed it would reduce the number of abortions by two-thirds. that is a big statement. it is, of course, speculation. all i can tell the house is that the proportion of all abortions certified for women resident in this country on the basis of the criteria which it is proposed to amend is about 85 per cent., and it would remain to be seen how many women would in future be found to meet the requirements of an amended criterion if that were put through in the bill. the house will readily see that the proposed change affects potentially a large proportion of women who now obtain abortions. what i am saying is that we have to go very carefully before we change the criteria, and we must not delude ourselves that it would be altering the situation for a small number of women, because it could alter the situation for a large number of women.\\n           that proportion is in sharp distinction to that likely to be affected by a change in the upper time limit. as the house knows, the present upper time limit is 28 weeks. the bill seeks to reduce that to 20 weeks. the right hon. member for norwich, north has given some of the figures for abortion. in the latest year for which figures are available to me, 1976, the number of united kingdom residents for whom abortions were carried out at or after 20 weeks was 975. that represents just under 1 per cent. of all such abortions, so the maximum effect of the proposed change would therefore be contained within that figure of 1 per cent.\\n           the house will realise that within this area, small though it is, some quite serious doubts have been expressed from many quarters. what crosses my mind is that numbers alone are not the total answer. if even one child is wrongly aborted, that is a fault in the law and something that we shall have to consider.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0),

with a claim that would be generally accepted as valid? would a change have any other undesirable consequences? i shall take up one or two of those queries.\\n           first, the size of the problem. we are dealing here with fewer than 1,000 cases a year, representing less than 1 per cent. of the total. since the act came into effect, the figures show no trend which would suggest that this problem is either decreasing or increasing. looking at the figures for each year, one's conclusion must be that there has been no significant movement at all in the ratio which the numbers under 24 weeks bear to those above.\\n           the conclusion that i put to the house is that a change can neither be supported nor denied on the grounds of the size of the problem. i am interested to note that no hon. members jumped up to intervene at that point.\\n           secondly, the seriousness of the problem. the reasoning behind the desire for a change concerns the viability of the foetus. it may be the view of the house that an upper time limit should be set at a point where there is, in all foreseeable circumstances, no prospect of a child being born as a result of a procedure for terminating pregnancy.\\n           i know of only two authenticated cases in this country of a foetus surviving before 26 weeks. one was at 24 weeks, and the other was at—it was slightly debatable—either 24 or 25 weeks. even at this age a crucial factor is the weight of the child, and no child weighing less than 500 grams-1 lb 1½ oz—has been known to survive. nevertheless, if we are

clearly too late and out of keeping with what happens in most other countries in western europe—to take some middle ground. of course, the key to all this is what sort of exemptions would be allowed,

late and the woman who does not realise that she is pregnant and discovers it very late and has very good reasons for termination—to be dealt with. but most significant of all is the time between 18 and 22 weeks, when the various investigations for foetal damage have to be carried out. sometimes they are delicate tests that do not always give clear results and have to be repeated, all of which takes time.\\n           if we are to go for a time lower than 20 weeks—there are strong arguments in favour of that—we must look carefully into the exemptions so that there is no bar for someone who,

objection to any involvement in abortion work, except in an emergency should not be restricted simply to religious objection. i shall not go into details, but it seems to me common sense and common justice that if staff who are asked to take on this extremely unpleasant task have strong ethical or moral views on why they should not do so, they should be allowed not so to do without jeopardising their career and appointments. this applies to nurses and to many doctors.\\n           in this case we are discussing professional people who are trained and who have a special sensitivity—not only a very precious one but a special one—to preserve life. that is their whole ethic and background. that is why many went into these professions. we should tread very carefully indeed before we ask people who have developed a tradition of that kind to do something that they feel is ethically and morally wrong. if we push this too far, we could well see the beginning of a move towards an attitude in the

remarks, which follow the line that i had just touched on.\\n           the house would want to know that the question of doctors within the nhs who apply for jobs that involve termination of pregnancy is one that we have looked into just recently. in 1975 this was dealt with in a letter issued by the chief medical officer. at that time guidelines and safeguards were set out for the advertising and filling of such posts. the select committee thought that this letter did not provide adequate safeguards, and we have recently been considering this, together with the medical profession, to see whether some change ought to be made.\\n           i can now announce that the existing guidance is to be changed and that the chief medical officer will shortly be issuing a letter giving effect to these changes. it may be of assistance to know what these changes will be. first, it will be emphasised that it is not expected that any jobs for junior doctors will require responsibilities for abortions. secondly, only where abortion duties are included in the job description would it be acceptable to ask a candidate if he or she would be prepared to undertake terminations. it follows from these two provisions that junior staff should never be questioned about their attitude to termination when they apply for a post. the guidance will also make clear the circumstances and terms in which a job description, but never an advertisement, should include reference to abortion duties. i hope that when hon. members see the contents of that letter they will agree that this is a just and reasonable step to have taken.\\n           i now turn briefly to the provision in the bill relating to the registration of pregnancy advice bureaux. this relates to clauses 4 and 5. i must confess that these are clauses—like that seeking to amend the criteria—that we had not expected to see in the bill. whatever the merits of this provision, the government would have to look very carefully at any provision that seeks to increase the cost of administration and the complexity of legislation. in considering this i ask the house to bear in mind that we do not want to put on the statute book legislation that is so complex that there is some doubt about how it should be administered. i am advised that the administration of these clauses would require the

legislation completely.\\n           cardinal gordon gray, the leader of scotland\\'s 800,000 roman catholics, said in the glasgow herald on 11 july, in an open letter to the 71 scottish members of the house, that the catholic church would never condone the right to kill an unborn child. i quote his emotive words exactly. he referred to the chilling and inhuman provision embodied in the current abortion act\". he went on to refer to the unhappy policies resulting from this squalid era of \\' abortion mills \\'. the cardinal is talking out of the top of his hat, and it is time that someone said so.\\n           in the same report in the glasgow herald, professor macnaughton, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at glasgow university—a man with a family of five—said: i think if mr.

speech today. but the background of that opinion poll is well known to many of us. it was based on the submission made by the hon. member for buckingham (mr. benyon), who introduced a similar bill in february. that opinion poll was based on a gallup poll carried out among gynaecologists on behalf of an organisation the name of which has never been revealed. gallup has refused to reveal it. not only is its name not revealed; neither are the terms of the questions. the survey was to ascertain whether gynaecologists supported abortion on demand. of course, if that question were put to

heart and let our conscience be our guide. i do not impugn the hon. gentleman's sincerity, and i was sorry that he impugned mine.\\n           the hon. gentleman mentioned the barnsley case. i can inform him that the barnsley baby was aborted on 25 or 26 april and died 36 hours later. the coroner for the district decided to hold an inquest, which began in may. it was suspended owing to the fact that only one doctor had signed the certificate for the woman to have an abortion—which act itself was illegal—and that aspect has had to be referred to the director of public prosecutions. the inquest is to be resumed next week, on 17 july. i hope that the hon. gentleman and the rest of the house will suspend judgment on that matter. i shall be as brief as possible, but if the hon. gentleman wishes me to give other instances of such cases i shall do so readily.\\n           i must confess that i would have preferred a simpler and shorter bill, one that took account of the realities of the society in which we live and of the fact that there are circumstances in which, unhappily, most of us would agree that an abortion should be lawful, yet one that did not permit abortion on demand, took into account the long-term interests of the woman herself, and did not lightly condemn an unborn child to death simply because it was unwanted.\\n           let us leave aside for a moment the wanton stupidity of the unwanted child argument. that cannot be sustained for a moment in a land where, as we all know from our constituency experience, countless couples are crying out for children to adopt, to love and to cherish. let us leave aside the question whether abortion too easily obtained can lead, as it does, to marital unhappiness later in life, and to a greater risk of miscarriage, abnormal birth and sterility than in the case of women who have not had abortions.\\n           we ignore at our peril the findings of research in this field. one leading gynaecologist warned, seven years ago: there is now ample evidence to show that abortion is neither safe nor simple. the longterm complications alone condemn its use as a contraceptive method. that is not an argument against abortion; it is an argument against permissive abortion.\\n           these alone, i suggest, are good reasons for us to pause and reflect on allowing too permissive a law on abortion. these alone are reasons why we should have been insisting, as the select committee on which the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse) and i sat for long months wanted us to insist, on facilities for abortion being accompanied by a highly trained and wholly independent counselling service, with no financial link with those who promote abortions for fees.\\n           the hon. member for fife, central knows perfectly well that for years i have argued that abortions, if they are to be lawfully undertaken, should be undertaken in the national health service, so that all women who qualify under the criteria in the 1967 act for lawful abortions can have them—the hon. gentleman is right in some of the things he says; it is his deductions from them that are wrong—and so that a woman, often a very frightened young girl, not only would get the best possible advice as early in her pregnancy as possible but, if she decided against an abortion as a result of that advice, would be steered in the direction of the support in society that she needs.\\n           in considering this grave matter we must understand from the start that abortion is not just another medical procedure, like having one's appendix out. it is a unique operation, involving two lives, one of which, of necessity, must be destroyed. thus, in considering the bill, whatever its imperfections—i can see a number, which i think we can put right in committee—we have first to decide whether the existing law governing this unique medical procedure is really as humane as some hon. members on the opposition benches suggest, and whether it truly encourages that reverence for life which should be the first characteristic of a society that claims to be civilised.\\n           in my view, the existing law is not humane enough. no one who recalls recent cases—i have mentioned one and i could mention others—in which babies aborted between 20 and 28 weeks have been born alive, have clung to life for hours and might have lived if the resuscitation techniques now available, which were not known in 1929 when the infant life (preservation) act was passed, had been used—can consider that the existing law encourages reverence for life.\\n           it is not sufficient to say that since 1967 the law has been made more satisfactory than it was before. it has, and no one in his senses would argue otherwise. but that is no reason for saying that the situation is satisfactory and cannot be improved. in some respects it is manifestly unsatisfactory and it can be improved. that is what the debate is about. imperfect as the bill may be, it should go to committee so that these matters can be thrashed out in detail.\\n           let us keep these matters in perspective. it was certainly the humane intention of the 1967 act to end the chaos and uncertainty in abortion law, and here we can agree with the lane committee that it did much to reduce the toll of suffering, ill health and premature death caused by illegal abortions.\\n           it is no use running away from the unhappy fact that the act was not accompanied by the development of proper facilities in the national health service spread uniformly throughout the country. i can sympathise with hon. members who come from certain areas where there are particular difficulties caused by lack of facilities.\\n           so we have the situation that the criteria for a lawful abortion may exist yet some women cannot get that abortion. that is disgraceful. what happened? as the hon. member for pontypool and i predicted in 1967, there grew up a large and lucrative practice in abortions in the private sector and large fortunes have been made by a few unscrupulous operators. i am talking of the commercial, private sector.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4.1.177', 4, 'uk.m.22249', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'that is not true.\\n

   it was also the intention of the 1967 act to ensure reverence for life. if the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) had been here, i should have paid tribute to him, because that was the motivation behind what he was seeking to do. the authors of that act never intended that abortion should be available on demand. they made that plain at the time.\\n           the lane committee was set up to examine the working of the act because of nationwide concern that its provisions were being abused, especially in the private sector. paragraph 189 of its report states: it would be contrary to the conditions for abortion laid down in the act that it should be obtainable solely at the wish of the woman\". yet the committee felt obliged to continue that the criteria for abortion as laid down was imprecise and could be widely interpreted, and that some doctors were interpreting the wording to mean that abortion was permissible in every case.\\n           the lane committee also found that the act was being flouted and that some doctors, relying upon a loophole in the criteria, were agreeing to abortions without even seeing the patients. that should not have surprised anyone. it does not surprise me.\\n           i recall a distinguished gynaecologist saying publicly: abortion on demand does not contravene the abortion act … the act allows abortion when the risk of permitting a pregnancy to continue is greater than the risk of abortion. when an abortion is carried out in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it is safer than allowing the pregnancy to go to full term. the house should ponder those words and weigh them carefully.\\n           we are being asked to believe that statistically it is safer for a woman to have an abortion than to have a baby. it is true that statistically there is a small risk to the life of a woman in childbirth which is slightly higher than the risk she faces if she has an induced abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.\\n           that argument has been used ever since not merely to give abortion on demand in return for fees but to flout the law. it is palpably false. everyone knows that it is false. it is false because deaths due to childbirth and those due to induced abortion in the first 12 weeks are not comparable. deaths in the first category occur in women suffering from disease or some abnormality. those in the second occur in women who would not have died if they had not had the operation. yet that argument has been and continues to be used to justify abortion on demand, contrary to the wishes of parliament in 1967.\\n           the select committee was worried about this and took a great deal of evidence, but nothing has been done. all this has been known for years, but still nothing has been done. the house has expressed itself in a majority on every occasion in favour of one reform or another, but it was always baulked by the opposition of some, but not all, labour members when the labour government were in office. it is high time for parliament to put a stop to this flouting of the law. we have an opportunity here this afternoon. we can only stop it by agreeing

'mp', 'no, i do not accept that for one moment, and i hope that as i develop my argument i shall carry the hon. member with me.\\n           the use of the statistical argument is not the only way in which the law falls short of expectations it aroused in 1967. two other serious defects cry out for remedy. my hon. friend\\'s bill would deal with them. the first is the reduction of the 28 weeks\\' upper time limit for abortions, a limit that no one in the medical profession defends. the second is the failure of the conscience clause to safeguard those members of the healing professions who have a genuine conscientious objection—not necessarily on religious grounds—to participating in a procedure which is wholly repugnant to them.\\n           the reduction of the upper time limit is long overdue, and this country lags behind most civilised countries in that respect. that in itself is condemnation of the way in which government principally, but parliament, too, have failed in their duty. the 28 weeks\\' limit laid down in the infant life (preservation) act 1929 was based on the presumption at that time that a foetus was capable of being born alive after that date, and so, save in a case where the mother\\'s life was at stake, it was unlawful to destroy it.\\n           since then, medical science and modern methods of resuscitation have reduced the period after which an aborted baby has a good chance of survival. the 20-week limit proposed in the bill would accord much more closely with current medical knowledge than the 28-week limit. i would not myself go to the stake for the 20-week limit. the lane committee suggested 24 weeks, and it is relevant to remind hon. members that the bma, whatever it is saying today, said in its comments on the lane report—and these are the people who have been quoted at us today— even with the reduction from 28 to 24 weeks, however, the position still exists that owing to an error in the calculation of dates a foetus intended for destruction could be born alive and be capable of functioning as a self-sustaining whole independently of any connection with the mother. it is not for me to explain why doctors who took that view a few years ago should take a different view now. suffice it for me to say that when we here talk about a viable foetus we are talking not merely about a recognisable human being in the womb, one that may be sustained and have an existence independent of its mother outside. it was nine years ago that the international federation of obstetrics and gynaecology recommended that abortion should be restricted to termination before 20 weeks. the scientific group of the world health organisation concluded four years ago that babies delivered from the 22nd week onwards had a survival potential.\\n           the select committee sat for months considering evidence from every quarter. it thought long and hard on this issue. i refer to paragraph 65 of the committee\\'s first report, which states: those giving evidence … generally … agreed that the upper limit should be less than 28 weeks but have not all agreed about what the limit should be. sir john peel, in evidence, repeated the view of his committee that it should be 20 weeks. the british medical association, as they had done to the lane committee, supported the peel recommendation. the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists said that to \\' terminate pregnancies at 20 weeks and 24 weeks is on the whole a hazardous performance \\'. hon. members may read the report for themselves.\\n           the select committee took evidence from eminent figures in the medical profession. it came to the conclusion that 20 weeks was about right. it was significant that the department of health and social security said in its evidence that it thought all abortions in the private sector should be restricted to below 20 weeks. it conceded that straight away. there is so much hatred of the private sector that it said straight away—\" yes, we agree that all abortions in the private sector should be restricted to 20 weeks.\" on the basis of that evidence the select committee came down firmly, as one would expect, in favour of 20 weeks.\\n           it is essential, however, that there is some safeguard. i refer again to the select committee\\'s report, in which it is stated that the limit should not apply where the child would be born with a major disability whether physical or mental \". a further safeguard is that the limit should not apply where it is necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman \". i was pleased that my hon. friend the member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) was as flexible as possible on this and said that in committee he would be prepared to reconsider his position. i support him wholeheartedly in that approach.\\n           the 1967 act included a conscience clause. there was a struggle to get that clause in the bill, but eventually it was inserted. yet it is a disturbing fact that from the outset the problems of medical and nursing staff with conscientious objections to abortion have continued unabated. the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists stated in its evidence to the lane committee: there was \\' a very real need \\' for an inquiry into how far junior doctors are under duress when they engage in operations to terminate pregnancy. it commented on the fear of junior doctors that distaste or conscientious objection might prejudice the advancement of their careers \". the royal college stated: their fear is amply justified. the select committee received numerous complaints and allegations of discrimination, especially about fully qualified doctors being debarred from appointments. some of the most distinguished men of their year had to leave britain because they could not obtain appointments—[hon. members: \" no \".] yes, we had the evidence. it is on the record. hon. members need not take it from me as it is on the record. permit me to say that it is increasingly clear as we continue the debate that the failing of so many critics of the bill, full of imperfections as it is, is that they have not done their homework and have not read the evidence.\\n           the nursing profession too has been adversely affected. the lane report made that clear. the evidence that the select committee received from nursing organisations convinced it not that roman catholic nurses were under any particular pressure—the position of such nurses is well understood in most hospitals—but that many non-catholic nurses were being put under pressure, since they could not say with their hands on their hearts that they had religious objections to taking part in abortions. the natural instinct of any girl who goes into nursing is to care for life. what takes her there—to preside over death? it is natural for a young girl entering nursing to have feelings, qualms and doubts about the matter. there are many cases—in my view and, i am sure, in that of many nurses and doctors—where an abortion is justified, but there are others where we should not put people who have entered the noble nursing profession under such pressure. the bill seeks to remedy that defect.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0),

that, he claims, is the purpose of this amending bill. if he is sincere in his intentions i can help him. clearly, it is desirable, if we wish to ensure that abortions can take place at an earlier time, to provide throughout the national health service in britain the resources and the facilities for it. we need gynaecological units in towns up and down the country.\\n           there is a complete regional imbalance in this regard. in the northern region—basically newcastle—90 per cent. of the abortions take place in nhs hospitals. in the west midlands, however, only 22 per cent. take place in nhs hospitals, and in the mersey region only 31 per cent. if those who are likely to support this amending bill are sincere about assisting women to obtain abortions earlier than they are able to in some circumstances, clearly we should be discussing, if such a bill is necessary—and i do not think that it is—how to persuade or instruct regional health authorities to establish day care abortion on a basis of equality of access to abortion for women throughout our society.\\n           that seems to be the best way for us to make real progress if we are anxious in human terms and if we are, to use the words of some who have written to me on this subject this week, to approach the matter from a christian point of view. we should be concerned about the humanity involved in trying to protect women, in the circumstances described by my right hon. friend the member for norwich, north (mr. ennals), who have genuine difficulties and who should be able to obtain abortions through the health service.\\n           as i said at the beginning, what the bill smacks of is an outright objection to the 1967 act and a willingness on the part of those who vote for it today to put the

surrounds it—of the hon. member for preston, south (mr. thorne).\\n           one of the reasons that i identify as being the foundation of that dissatisfaction with the legislation is the upper time limit for an abortion. it is right that the house should look at this matter very carefully. when my hon. friend the minister for health was addressing the house, in a very careful and most helpful speech, he said that the time of 28 weeks was too late and that most other countries would not accept it. i do not think that we ought to accept it either. at 28 weeks, is it not a fact that what is removed, from which life is extinguished, qualifies for something better than the mere technical medical description of a foetus? it is, indeed, at that stage a perfectly formed, though not fully developed, human being. were it not for the abortion, and if it had been, for example, prematurely born, there would be a good chance—perhaps every chance—that it would survive.\\n           it is for that reason that the lane committee, in its most careful review and examination of the various points that have to be considered, concluded that the upper time limit should be 24 weeks gestation. i personally agree with that. my hon. friend the member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie), whom i congratulate on his bill, might well consider that he would draw to himself and his bill greater support if he were to consider lifting the time limit in the bill from 20 weeks to about 24 weeks. i think that most hon. members on both sides of the house should be prepared to look at the upper

abortion debate because we know that an abortion can result from the failure of medical science as yet unable to rescue a malformed, unborn child from its fate. an abortion can be precipitated by a society too indifferent to save women and children from intolerable housing conditions, and it can occur, too, in more subtle ways. it can come from a vengeful society which is now sometimes sophisticating its hostility to lovemaking by the unmarried by proferring abortion rather than providing the financial and social support that they sometimes desperately need.\\n           it is no use having threnodies or lamentation. realism demands that we accept the fact that within our existing society there are women who are frequently in an appalling predicament. unfortunately, within the blemished society in which we live, it is an inevitable fact that abortion is sometimes the only desperate remedy.\\n           some of us believe that abortion should be the last and not the first option. that is the division between the two sides of the argument. we believe that when a child is a potential child, no longer can the issue be regarded as one for the woman alone. it is her business with whom she sleeps. it is not the duty of this legislature in any way to presume to be prurient and to interfere in the private lives of men or women. but when another factor comes into existence, when there is a potential child, there are societal obligations and it is only then that we are compelled to focus our attention upon the issues that are involved.\\n           in a plural society such as we have, there has to be some reconciliation of some kind between, on the one hand, those who believe that in no circumstances should there be an abortion except for the most compelling medical reasons and those who, on the other hand, passionately maintain the view that there should, in no circumstances, be any interference in any form with the decision made by the individual woman.\\n           it is clear from what has been said today that we shall continue with such a debate until such time as we seek to have an act which has done something to assuage the hurt and outrage of large sections of opinion in this country who believe that the present act, as it has been practised, has some blemishes that require urgent attention.\\n           i listened to the speech of my right hon. friend the member for norwich, north (mr. enna1s), the former secretary of state for social services. i understood why it was, as i am sure did many other hon. members, that we had not resolved this problem before. if, despite the fact that he was secretary of state, he did not seize the opportunity of the lane committee urging that there should be a 24-week limit; if, while he was secretary of state, he did not seize the opportunity of acting in accordance with the considered and careful report of sir john peel, indicating why the upper limit should be 20 weeks; if, while he had the power and authority to do so, he did not in any way seize the opportunity to bring this matter to a conclusion, it was because in my view he holds, as he is entitled to do, views which show that if he is not a believer in abortion on demand he is almost indistinguishable from those who hold that view. i therefore believe that we have had a delayed debate which should have been ended a long time ago.\\n           i welcome the speech of the minister for health. it at least showed a keen and sensitive awareness of the type of problems with which we are seeking to grapple in this attempt to have an act that will reconcile the community to the existence of abortion, and even to reconcile the warring factions. the important comment made by the minister was that the criteria should be left untouched. but can they be left untouched as long as there is a minority of doctors who, as is well documented both in the lane report and public statements, practise abortion on demand? can we be satisfied and say \" yes, we laid down criteria, but there is a minority that is abusing and manipulating the criteria \"? can we leave it at that?\\n           i agree that the danger relates to the statistical argument. but surely, without affecting the criteria, it should be possible in committee to devise an exclusion which makes it clear that in measuring the balance of risk which the initial act requires, it is not beyond the wit of the draftsmen available to the minister—while leaving the criteria inviolable—to be able to make it crystal clear that in the measurement of the risk the facts that must be taken into consideration are clinical and not statistical ones.\\n           i notice that the minister nods his agreement with the point that i am making. i hope that he will direct his attention to it, because i believe that we can maintain the criteria but exclude the statistical argument, thus reconciling ourselves with any branch of the medical profession which may otherwise believe that there is a clinical judgment with which we are unnecessarily interfering.\\n           the minister also said that there were opinions relating to the 20-week or 24-week limit, and suggested that there should be a compromise. i do not believe that that is necessarily the correct approach. when sir john peel\\'s committee has given us evidence that it is possible for an unborn child that is able to live outside the womb to be slain, i believe that if we are to err at all we must err in favour of that child.\\n           if there is overwhelming international opinion which says that it is possible for a child to be viable at 20 weeks, it is important that we should not put the limit up to 24 weeks, but instead make certain that any exemptions that we make adequately cover the issue. the approach in committee must be to maintain the 20-week limit but also to look at the existing infant life (preservation) act 1929 and the fact that it is possible for a doctor to perform an abortion today in good faith at 28 weeks if he believes that he is preserving the life of the mother. we should look at that preservation clause and see whether we need to alter it in order to maintain the 20 weeks. i do not believe that we can avoid the scandals that have erupted again today—scandals concerning aborted children being born alive—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1979, 7, 13, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1979-07-13.4.1.201', 6, 'uk.m.22059', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'there is no evidence of that.\\n

are the views of many hon. members, including the hon. member for ilford, south (mr. thorne), who is in the chamber today. many people in the labour party feel as strongly as i do about these matters. there are people throughout the world who subscribe to these views.\\n           the government should take note of the resolution passed at zagreb during the recent conference of the international right to life federation. the resolution stated: this fourth world conference of the international right to life federation held in zagreb, yugoslavia this year condemns the present abortion policy of the united kingdom as one of the most barbaric in the world. delegates representing 15 nations deplore the abortion act 1967 and draw the attention of the british government to the fact that it is the only law in europe accepting social abortion beyond the 20th week of pregnancy, in consequence of which thousands of expectant mothers from overseas are encouraged to go to britain by abortion racketeers for late social abortions, which carry enormously increased risks to women and are in breach of laws in their own countries. the conference calls on the right honourable mrs. thatcher and her government to allow parliament the time to amend the law giving greater protection to unborn children and mothers and ending this dishonourable trade in human misery. the monitoring of the abortion law in the united kingdom has always been of concern to me, if not the statistical basis on which the department disseminates information, certainly the criminal negligence of the government, in turning a blind eye to the operation of the infant life (preservation) act 1929. the act is explicit. it states in section 1 that the killing of a child capable of being horn alive and before it has an existence independent of the mother is an act of child destruction.\\n           the 28-week limit was born in the belief that such gestational age was prima facie proof of capability of being born alive. nevertheless, science has moved on and we now know that a baby of 18 to 21 weeks is most certainly capable of being born alive, albeit that at this stage in medicine it is too small to survive. we also know that from 18 weeks, as any gynaecologist can confirm, babies if born or aborted by hysterotomy, shows real and discernible signs of life.\\n           it was primarily this consideration that motivated mr. c in the case of mr. c v. miss s. acting as a third party, mr. c sought to secure protection of a baby capable of being horn alive. miss s\\'s pregnancy had reached the 20th week and as far as mr. c was concerned deserved the legal protection provided by law under the infant life (preservation) act. he called in aid article 23 of the world health organisation constitution which was adopted by the world health assembly in 1976 and which defined live birth as expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy which after such separation breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscle, whether or not the umbilical cord had been cut or the placenta is attached. each product of such a birth is considered liveborn. mr. c further called in aid the births and deaths registration act 1953 which in clause 41 defines a stillborn child as a child which did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show any other sign of life. thus, a foetus born showing any signs of life must under the act be registered as a live birth.\\n           a child may die shortly after birth, as it most certainly would at only 18 or 20 weeks gestation. nevertheless, the law of the land states that a foetus must be registered as a live birth. someone might ask why abortions are carried out in this country up to and beyond 28 weeks. the answer is the presumption written into the 1929 act that evidence that a woman had at any material time been pregnant for a period of 28 weeks or more shall be prima facie proof that she was at that time pregnant of a child capable of being born alive.\\n           as i have mentioned, medicine has moved on. whereas in 1929 it was miraculous for a 28-week foetus to survive, according to dr. p.m. dunn from the department of child health in southmead hospital, bristol, in a paper submitted in 1985 to the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, in 1984, 72 per cent. of all live born infants of 22 to 27 weeks gestation born at the bristol maternity hospital survived. only two years earlier, in 1982, the survival rate for the same group had been 43 per cent., in 1981 29 per cent. in bristol things are really happening.\\n           the information gleaned from the monitoring of the figures in bristol places a new responsibility upon the minister to review the operations of the infant life (preservation) act. the lane committee recommendations of 1974 seem, on reflection, enlightened and farsighted when we consider them 13 years later. the committee admitted that, despite taking a liberal position on abortion, the taking of a 28-week gestational period as prima facie proof of capability of being born alive was unreasonably late. it recommended that there should be an upper limit on abortion of 24 weeks and that thereafter every effort should be made to preserve the life of the child. if the lane committee were to consider and recommend on these matters today, it would recommend a new limit of 20 weeks.\\n           how can we secure a more vigilant application of the law in the light of scientific advance? according to monitoring by the department, in 1985, 1,628 babies were aborted at 22 and 23 weeks, seven of which were to save the mother\\'s life, and 494 abortions were carried out at 24 weeks plus, only five of which were carried out to save the mother\\'s life. in the latest years for which we have figures, 1,531 unborn children of 24 weeks and over have been aborted, and in only 22 cases could the operation be justified under existing law, particularly as the most avid abortionists at the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists admit that all of these children are capable of being born alive and surviving. what action has been taken by the minister to initiate prosecutions in the other 1,509 cases of child destruction?\\n           in addition, babies of 22 and 23 weeks are aborted, which, quite clearly from the evidence that we have from bristol, were capable not only of being born alive but of surviving. over three years, a total of 4,572 abortions were carried out, of which only 13 were performed to save the mother\\'s life. they are the best figures that i have been able to glean. i am sure that the minister will be quick to correct me if i am wrong and, certainly, to comment on them. what action has been taken in the 4,559 cases in which doctors have flagrantly broken the law, and broken it repeatedly?\\n           in a series of written answers on 10 and 12 december, the minister referred to the fact that the government had circulated to all regional health authorities a copy of a report that they had encouraged the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists to produce on the subject of foetal viability and clinical practice. the report studied the implementation of the infant life (preservation) act and pointed out that many late abortions are blatantly in breach of the law. yet nowhere in the report is it stated that doctors should carry out such late abortions only to save mothers\\' lives. nowhere in the report is it declared that criminal proceedings might be brought against doctors who break the law. the report takes a decidedly schizophrenic approach, urging that the gestational age after which a foetus is considered viable should be changed from the present limit of 28 weeks to 24 weeks gestation. the report goes on to state that: in accordance with the who recommendation a record should be kept of all babies born alive or dead at 22 weeks gestational age, or, if born earlier, weighing 500g or more. however, the figures that are quoted in the report to justify 24 weeks are for 1982. science has moved on since then. the figures for bristol in 1984 are quoted nowhere, but they show that the period of 24 weeks is already out of date.\\n           the government\\'s senior medical officer, dr. w j modle, was a participant in the symposium on pre-term labour and its consequences, at which proceedings the bristol paper by professor dunn was originally presented. therefore, he must have known about the evidence of the survival rate of babies in that area. he was also an observer on the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists committee that published the report on foetal viability and clinical practice, the report that the minister so proudly told us had been circulated to all regional health authorities. how does the minister justify the failure of dr. modle to ensure that this report was an accurate and comprehensive document, giving the latest data available to ensure that those in authority were fully and properly informed? can the minister explain why she has failed to send with such a document the instruction that late abortions are completely unlawful?\\n           no other country in europe allows abortions from 20 weeks, as we do for social reasons. that brings me to a further point. i am told quite categorically by nurses working in national health service hospitals where abortions are performed that a goodly number of the abortions are not nhs abortions, as they are listed in the office of population censuses and surveys monitors. therefore, although they are performed on nhs premises—and listed as such quite correctly by the opcs—many of those abortions are carried out in pay beds. not only do i know of this from nurses who are working in the nhs, but reference has been made to it over the years by doctors working in the private sector as a response to criticism for their charges. what steps has the minister ever taken to check on the number of abortions in the nhs that are carried out in pay beds and those performed as nhs operations? surely that is of particular importance when a law such as the infant life (preservation) act is being broken scores of times each month quite openly.\\n           i have always felt very strongly about this matter. i have not come here today to make an ashamedly anti-abortion speech. that has not been my objective. i shall save that for another occasion. i have come today to make a plea that the minister should ensure that the infant life (preservation) act is implemented, taking into account the latest scientific advances. we cannot fudge these matters. those who follow the law in detail just wonder why the government insist on turning a blind eye to the implementation of the act. i hope that in her reply the minister will answer that specific question.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1987, 3, 20, 0, 0),

elsewhere on these subjects.\\n           let me put on record some of the latest statistics. in 1985, the total number of abortions performed was 171,873, of which 65,176 were performed in the national health service on residents. in 1986, the equivalent figures were 129,131, and 49,433 in the first three quarters of 1986. the rates per 1,000 resident women in the quarter ended september —

the case.\\n           the number of terminations in the case of women under 16 has also shown something of a trend. in 1985, there were 4,002 such terminations and the rate per 1,000 among women of 14 and 15 years of age was 5·41. in the first quarter of 1986, there were 1,028 such terminations; in the june quarter there were 980; and in the september quarter there were 900. therefore the most recent figure gives us a rate per 1,000 women aged 14 and 15 of 1·22. again that is a drop on the previous year.\\n           as the hon. gentleman knows, the gestation period is also one of the statistics that is collected. in 1986—in the first three quarters only—of the 110,000 abortions performed on resident women in this country, nearly 100,000 were performed at the gestation age of 12 weeks or less. therefore, the vast majority are done on pregnancies in the early weeks of the woman\\'s time. the total number of terminations in the first three quarters of 1986 on babies of a gestation period of 25 weeks and over was 19. therefore, i caution the hon. gentleman when he talks about 24 weeks or over 24 weeks— [interruption.] i said, \"25 weeks and over\". the rule that i mentioned says, \"over 24 weeks\", so i take it in exactly the same way. there is a difference between talking about at 24 weeks and over 24 weeks. there is a distinction. it is also worth pointing out—i am sure that the hon. gentleman will agree—that gestation may be a matter of rather fine judgment, particularly before a termination takes place.\\n           the hon. gentleman mentioned the bristol study in which a 70 per cent. survival rate was reported for babies born alive at gestations between 22 and 27 weeks. i have no doubt about that, but i suggest that those figures were heavily skewed towards the later age. in fairness, the figures should be disaggregated. there is a danger that the hon. gentleman might give the wrong impression, with statements such as, \"70 per cent. of babies born at 22 weeks will survive.\" the hon. gentleman knows that such a statement is not true.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1987, 3, 20, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1987-03-20.6'],

Security', 'government', \"perhaps the hon. gentleman will allow me to continue.\\n           it is worth putting on record the number of deaths following legal abortion in england and wales. in 1969 there were still 17 women who died following abortion, but in the years since 1973. the number has never been more than a single figure. in 1985 only two women died following legal abortion. clearly, the change in the law has helped some people quite considerably.\\n           the hon. gentleman asked me to say how the government have been monitoring the abortion act 1967 and ensuring that its provisions are properly applied. i am glad to do so. compliance with the abortion act and the assurances that have been developed in the 20 years since that legislation are monitored in three broad ways—first, inspection; secondly, notification; and thirdly, investigation of complaints and allegations of abuse.\\n           i refer first to inspection. all private sector nursing homes and clinics approved under the abortion act are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the dept's medical, nursing and investigative officers. a thorough check of business and administrative arrangements is made, and patients' notes and medical records are carefully examined. in the public sector, individual health authorities take the responsibility for the way in which abortion services are provided in their own area, just as they do for other forms of medical care.\\n           as for notification, operating practitioners are required to notify the chief medical officer, within seven days, of each abortion that they perform. forms are scrutinised by staff authorised by the chief medical officer to ensure that they do not show any contravention of the abortion law.\\n           the department investigates rigorously any specific complaints or allegations of abuse, as it did on the matter raised by my hon. friend the member for broxhourne (mrs. roe) at question time last tuesday. appropriate action is taken to deal with any irregularities that are discovered. in the extreme, that might well involve a reference to the director of public prosecutions or the withrawal of the secretary of state's approval, or both.\\n           the hon. gentleman asked: how can we secure a more vigilant application of the law in the light of scientific advance? we feel that we have not just done that, but have gone further. the control of late abortions is a typical example of the way in which the assurances required by the secretary of state can be varied to take account of new situations and medical developments.\\n           medical developments now make possible, as the hon. member for workington rightly stated, the survival of some infants born before 28 weeks. in 1985 the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, in a report requested by the government on foetal viability and clinical practice, recommended that the age after which a foetus is considered viable should be changed from 28 weeks to 24 weeks. in the private sector the dhss initially agreed a voluntary limit of 24 weeks. subsequently, in february 1986, that was made a condition of approval. on inspection visits all cases over 20 weeks are now carefully monitored and we are satisfied that those arangements are working. the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists has also sent out the document to all its members, who must comply with it.\\n           the age has effectively been reduced in the light of medical science. it was argued in debates recently in another place that we should see how the voluntary arrangement works before proceeding further.\\n           with regard to the comments made by the hon. member for workington about the leaflet that referred to breaking the law, the royal college was extremely careful to explain that that is not what the leaflet was about. the college was so concerned that it included the following statement in italics: the committee, recognising the complexity of the present legislation relating to fetal viability, did not address themselves in detail to the legal issue, but concentrated on clinical considerations. the college then stated: for this reason they did not attempt to define viability in terms that would be legally acceptable but have described it as it is used by clinicians, for example, when maturity is a important factor in deciding whether or not to deliver a preterm fetus from an unfavourable intrauterine environment. it is our view that in the clinical sense of the word the fetus is viable when there is good evidence that survival is a reasonable possibility, given the availability of what is currently regarded as the best of neonatal care. we do not share the hon. gentleman's view that the law has been broken in the way that he described. as far as i am aware, there have been no successful prosecutions under the existing legislation—either public or private prosecutions — in recent years. broadly speaking, practice has changed in the light of scientific knowledge.\\n           the hon. gentleman referred to a large number of late abortions and mentioned the figures for the three latest years. i must stress that the three latest years that he was able to use were 1983, 1984 and 1985. they were all years before the changes i have just described. i have therefore taken into account the points that he made.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1987, 3, 20, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1987-03-20.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1987-03-20.6.1.10', 9, 'uk.m.10090', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'will

servant. the hon. gentleman's remarks contradict all the conventions of the house. i am prepared to restate that the responsibility for the action of our officials rests with ministers. i am glad to state our full confidence in dr. modle and his staff and we are very fortunate to have him.\\n           the hon. gentleman raised the point about notification and pay beds. the notification of an abortion shows the location where it was carried out. if it was carried out in a national health service hospital that is shown in the statistics. i am satisfied that that is a sensible approach. no doubt the hon. gentleman will continue to disagree about that.\\n           the hon. gentleman knows that the oxford students' case was taken to appeal and the court of appeal held that on the evidence that a foetus of 18 to 21 weeks was incapable even of breathing, it was not a child capable of being born alive within the meaning of the infant life (preservation) act 1929. the court left open the question whether the prospective putative father had locus standi to bring proceedings or whether the child could bring proceedings. the father applied to the house of lords for leave to appeal on the question whether an unborn child of 18 to 21 weeks' gestation was capable of being born alive. that was refused.\\n           the hon. gentleman may call in evidence the words and arguments of the plaintiff in that case, mr. c., and question the actions of the judges concerned. however, i understand from the transcript that the judges proceeded as they did at the request of

(preservation) act 1929.\\n           we can make progress by avoiding the need for late abortions in the first place. the hon. gentleman will know that health authorities have been encouraged to improve administrative referral systems. ministers have already announced plans for three family planning pregnancy counselling projects for young people, which might help to reduce delay. a submission has been placed before my hon. friend the member for braintree (mr. newton), the minister for health, and we are expecting an announcement soon.\\n           i am sure that the hon.

there were strong feelings against amending the law in the way that the hon. gentleman would wish.\\n           abortion, fertility and its treatment, the use of embryos and embryonic material and

anniversary of the passing of the abortion act 1967 which made abortion legal in britain.\\n           too much is heard in this house and outside of alleged scandals, abuses and harmful effects, and far too little, because on the whole it is not the stuff of headlines, of the enormous sense of well-being and relief that the 1967 act, by its very existence, has brought to many women and their families. so now is a good time to ask whether we have the administration right. of course, it will never be right for those who believe that all abortion is wrong, but most of us know—and i hope that my hon friend the minister of state will bring up to date those who do not—the measures which have been taken to control the working of the act.\\n           there is only one major scandal and failure of the act, namely, the failure of the national health service to provide the necessary facilities for equitable treatment throughout the country, and it is a failure that needs a remedy. but it is never mentioned by those who shout most loudly about \"cleaning up abuse\".\\n           next week, those basically opposed to legal abortions and thus opposed to the concept of freedom of moral choice for individuals within a pluralistic society will be carrying wreaths from town to town, having wreaths delivered to hon. members here, and generally attempting to continue their campaign of spreading lies, distortions and despondency, which have been their stock in trade ever since they realised that the majority of citizens did not accept their view that abortion was the same as murder from the moment of conception.\\n           this campaign ignores the fact that more than 1¼ million safe abortions have taken place in britain since 1967 and that almost every country in western europe has now followed and in many cases gone further in liberalising and humanising its laws. only last week in roman catholic italy the chamber of deputies passed a bill to allow abortion on request to any woman over 18 and less than 12 weeks pregnant—something done several years earlier by france and austria.\\n           next week in britain, not only will there be emotive stories spread around, but a new political initiative will be launched called \"value your vote\", based on what has now been shown to be the completely erroneous assumption that abortion can be a major issue in election campaigns. fortunately, the electors at garscadden have proved the contrary to be true. so this government or any other need no longer have any fear about introducing bold and robust measures to implement the abortion act and make national health service day-care abortions the rule rather than the exception.\\n           in garscadden we saw the most highly organised, spare-no-expense campaign that the anti-abortionists could organise. we had a campaign where a pressure group acted like a political party. it ran public meetings attended by the candidates, distributed leaflets to every house, had leaflet drops outside churches, plastered the constituency with emotive posters, cruised with loudspeaker vans and even provided cars to take its supporters to the polls.\\n           it was a campaign in which the leading roman catholic lay organisation recommended the faithful to vote against any pro-abortion candidate and declared that the sanctity of life transcends normal political considerations. it was a campaign in which the candidate\\'s views on abortion were canvassed and continually publicised, a campaign in which a church of scotland clergyman felt impelled in his parish magazine to request his flock not to be \"party political meddlers\"—whatever that means—and to remind them that roman catholic priests in another part of this constituency have advised their folk to vote snp since it is the only party with an anti-abortion policy\". it was a campaign in which roman catholic priests knocked on doors of houses of parishioners showing labour party posters and ordered them to take them down; and one in which the journal of the roman catholic archdiocese of glasgow sought the views of all candidates only on abortion.\\n           but, despite all these massive attempts in an area with a 35 per cent. roman catholic population, the declared antiabortion candidates did not win, and a television programme survey of voters leaving the polling station found only 3 per cent of roman catholics to agree that abortion was the most important issue. it also found that 62 per cent. of them voted for the candidate who as a member of parliament in 1967 had voted for the bill.\\n           the lesson from this must be clear to all members who have had intimidating threats made to them about future votes going against supporters of a liberal abortion law. we know that it is a hollow threat for, if it had any substance, it would have been fulfilled at garscadden. if it failed at garscadden, it must fail elsewhere.\\n           as it must be clear that there are no votes to be lost on this issue, i hope that the minister will propose immediate plans for day-care centres run by sympathetic staff in every region, regardless of the personal prejudices of senior members of the local gynaecological establishment.\\n           these centres would save not only health and happiness by ensuring that pregnancies were terminated early but money and would release overnight hospital beds for those on gynaecological waiting lists. the money saved could be used for family planning—prevention is better than cure—through contraception and sterilisation programmes. this in the long run would reduce the numbers of abortions.\\n           perhaps my hon. friend could confirm my view that if some of the extra money made available for day-care units in the budget last week were used to increase the provision of early outpatient abortion, there would in a short time be an overall saving of money and further reduction in the already much reduced maternal mortality and morbidity associated more with late than with early abortion.\\n           we have already seen a welcome move in my part of the country. faced with an intransigent professor and gynaecological establishment who have ensured that only some 10 per cent. to 15 per cent. of west midlands women have succeeded in getting nhs abortions the regional health authority, under pressure from the community health councils, set up a working party to consider what could be done. that working party has now produced a report with recommendations to improve the situation and to open daycare facilities.\\n           typically, it has been publicly attacked by professor scarisbrick of the anti-all-abortion \"life\" organisation. in a letter to the chairman of the rha, released to and widely reported by the local and national press, he accuses the working party of a serious and astonishing error in stating that the nhs has a statutory responsibility to provide an abortion service.\\n           in fact, it is the professor who is guilty of the \"serious error\", because his letter suggests that the working party believed this duty on the nhs sprang from the abortion act 1967. but nowhere in the report is this said, and clearly the duty—as detailed by the authoritative lane report—springs from the national health service act 1946, which puts a duty on the secretary of state, among other things, to promote the establishment in england and wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the people of england and wales … precisely the same aims as those of the abortion act. perhaps my hon. friend can comment on this. the false premises about the 1967 act have been enshrined in the recent series of bills before the house which in turn were based on the report of the select committee of anti-abortionists.\\n           in fact, in all those areas—except two—where concern was expressed and changes recommended, changes and controls have been introduced. the dhss now has complete control of the private sector, and let us hope it can now devote its energies to improving the public sector. those two areas, where little has been done, are the areas where those with detailed knowledge and objective minds know that there is no real evidence to show that change is necessary. these are reduction of the upper time limit and restrictions on the charitable services. the pressure for reduction of the upper time limit comes from repeatedly making emotive claims about live babies being killed—claims which, when exhaustively investigated, are shown to have no basis in truth.\\n           from the evidence it appears that there was only ever one case where a child might have lived—the stobhill case in glasgow in 1970. tragic and upsetting though it was, one such case in 1¼ million legal abortions cannot justify restricting the law. that there has been only one such case is shown by the fact that it is still quoted today by the anti-abortionists. if they knew of others, they would certainly not rely on evidence that is eight years out of date.\\n           this lack of evidence has not stopped those opposed to legal abortion making unsubstantiated and extravagant claims that have understandably worried the public conscience, have been eagerly leapt upon and spread around by a press that is hungry for sensationalism and fuelled by the hon. member for chelmsford (mr. st. john-stevas), who started this hare running in may 1970 with the rumour headlined in the daily express as abortion trade in unborn babies from a whole series of unsavoury accusations i come to one of the most recent which on 8th february this year was shown in a reply to me to have no foundation in fact. on that occasion, a mrs. chester of droylsden complained in a letter published in her local newspaper that a tameside hospital had posted a notice instructing staff not to resuscitate live babies born following a certain method of abortion. clearly, if this had been true, nhs staff would have been guilty of inciting others to break the law, so investigations were made. it was noticeable that neither mrs. chester nor the newspaper that printed her letter was able or willing to give the source of the information or the name of the hospital. so both dhss time and that of the tame-side area health authority was wasted on following up this apparently baseless accusation.\\n           these unfounded and untrue accusations have led to a general belief that live babies are being aborted. they waste much time of the department and ahas in trying to follow them through—time that could have been much better spent in implementing, through the nhs, the abortion act in those parts of the country where abortion is not yet available.\\n           currently, if the \"life\" newsletter is to be believed—and perhaps my hon. friend can tell us what he knows of this—the most recent \"horror\" accusation is with the dpp. this story, featured again in the national press with vast amounts of space and told to it by the \"life\" organisation, concerned a child delivered by caesarean section at barking hospital when, in the 29th week of pregnancy, the mother\\'s life was in dander. according to \"life\", the foetus was 25 to 26 weeks old and was thrown aside as dead and rescued only by accident while on its way to the incinerator—shades of the stobhill story? but, according to the paediatrician concerned, the baby was in the intensive care unit within seven weeks of delivery and was thriving some weeks later when \"life\" told its horror story to the press. at the time, \"life\" said that its sources were absolutely authoritative. now its newsletter admits: we have no eye-witnesses unfortunately. it is a scandal that this sort of unauthorised and unfounded allegation can be picked up by the press so avidly.\\n           however, the really interesting thing about that story is that the child was born on 17th december and the story was not released in the press until 21st january—in the same week that the authors of the book \"babies for burning\" were forced to make their humiliating high court retraction and apology to the british pregnancy advisory service.\\n           which brings us to the only other area of concern of the select committee whose recommendations for restrictive measures have not been implemented separation of the counselling and other functions of the charities.\\n           it is noticeable that nobody questioned the good faith, the professional integrity or the great need for bodies such as bpas until that disgusting little book was touted around. could it have been that, because the charities were making the abortion act 1967 work as parliament intended and driving the exploiters out of business by providing a competitive, non-profit service, they had to be discredited by the anti-abortionists who saw their supply of sensational stories disappearing and thus their hopes of appealing to the electorate?\\n           certainly the attacks on the charities intensified from that time, and most of them are as baseless as that book would have been shown to be had the authors not recognised that it was better to apologise quickly than to allow all the evidence of their lying, deception and duplicity to come out into the open during a trial. for not only did the authors lie in the book, they lied before a select committee of the house. that is my main reason for seeking this adjournment debate.\\n           both mr. litchfield and \"mrs. litchfield\", otherwise kentish, as she is called on the birth certificate of her and litchfield\\'s child, a certificate which during the course of a bbc interview litchfield described as a fraud being investigated by scotland yard but which so far has never been challenged, told the select committee that the transcripts with which the committee was supplied were a full, true and accurate record of the relevant tape recordings. had the select committee listened to those recordings and compared them with the transcripts supplied by the authors, it would have found that they were neither full nor accurate, nor complete.\\n           it is not surprising that the select committee did not make that comparison, for it took some 300 hours to do just that in preparation for the bpas trial. of 65 relevant conversations found on the tapes, transcripts of only 32 were given to the committee. among those supplied more than half differed materially from the tapes. the bpas schedule of important differences between the tapes—that is, those that materially altered the meaning or the context of the transcripts as supplied by the authors—amounted to no fewer than 71 typed pages.\\n           for example—this was a thread that ran throughout the deception—mrs. litchfield-kentish told the select committee that she was not asked about her menstrual cycle on any occasion. however, in every interview recorded on the tape recordings there is lengthy and detailed investigation of her menstrual history.\\n           in one particular interview with a mr. pond, whom they visited before she saw her own doctor to confirm that she was not pregnant, despite the book stating that she was confirmed as not pregnant before their investigation started, the true transcript shows six pages of conversation about her pill-taking habits and menstrual pattern, with mr. pond, exasperated, saying you\\'re most unlikely to be pregnant\". before the book was published the news of the world featured that visit to mr. pond in its series of articles that later became the book. it not only erroneously stated that first she visited her own doctor but had mr. pond saying \"you are 16 weeks\", whereas the tape clearly has mr. pond saying you are 16 weeks on from your last period. that is something that kentish herself had told him, and which could have been true as it was quite clear from the long private conversation between the authors, which is still on the tape although they did not realise that the tape was working at the time. that conversation took place while mr. pond was out of the room doing the urine test. at that stage they both thought that she really was pregnant and was genuinely seeking an abortion. they were arguing about the cost while mr. pond was outside the room.\\n           there distorting their own situation, distorting the truth and destroying with a a tissue of lies the reputations of honest charities, doctors and others are the so-called journalists whom the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse) described as \"virginal and pristine\", and who the broadsheet of the festival of light says it has consistently backed in bringing their book to the attention of the christian public\", going on to remark its almost unbelievable stories of the abortion racket show the dearth of moral fibre in britain today. indeed they do, but not quite in the way that the festival of light intended.\\n           there are 71 pages of lies, omissions and variations. it is to be hoped that soon, despite the apology being given before the evidence was out in court, it will be available for all. the dpp has requested the police to have the full tapes transcribed. i hope that they are, and i hope that my hon. friend the minister of state will be able to enlighten the house on this point, for sessional standing orders tell us that the house will proceed with the utmost severity against any person who hath given false evidence before this house or any committee thereof. that should interest my right hon. friend the leader of the house.\\n           so far this pair have got off scot-free. they have deluded the public and deluded a select committee into producing a report that has resulted in two bills coming before the house, each of which has attacked and sought to destroy the work that the two major abortion charities undertake to make good the lack of nhs provision.\\n           i hope that my hon. friend, 10 years after the enlightened legislation that the house enacted with the liars publicly exposed and the electorate\\'s views on the anti-abortion lobby made clear at garscadden, will be able to get on with the task and that the house will provide the resources for him to do so.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1978, 4, 19, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1978-04-19.19'], ['uk.proc.d.1978-04-19.19.1.5', 1764, 'uk.m.18528', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'The Minister of State, Department of Health and Social Security', 'government', \"i shall try to deal with the questions affecting my responsibilities as one of the ministers responsible for the administration of the abortion act. first, however, i must remind the house that the government take no collective view on the moral questions of abortion in the belief that individual members should make their own judgments on these matters.\\n           my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) invited me to remind the house of the measures taken by my department to control the private sector of abortion and to comment on whether i agreed that these measures are effective. it might help if i indicate to the house the range of undertakings which private nursing home proprietors must give my right hon. friend as a condition of his approval under the abortion act.\\n           briefly, they provide for the maintenance of detailed records, the inspection of premises and records by the department's officers at any time without notice, the giving of receipts to patients and the retention of copies for inspection, the acceptance of fees only after two doctors have certified that the act's criteria are met in each case, the number of patients per 24 hours not to exceed the number of beds approved, and for the examination of patients by a doctor before discharge.\\n           the nursing home must also undertake not to advertise abroad, either directly or indirectly, employ touts, or to accept patients who have been diverted from their intended destinations or touted for. the proprietors must have no connection with agencies or persons known to advertise abroad, or to tout for or divert patients.\\n           proprietors must also, in applying for approval, provide the department with detailed information about the business arrangements of the companies and individuals involved in the application, all of which is carefully inquired into by the department's investigators. medical and nursing arrangements, including staffing, equipment, procedures and accommodation, are checked by the department's medical and nursing teams.\\n           nursing homes which concentrate on abortions have had to satisfy my right hon. friend that the total costs charged to abortion patients treated on their premises are not unreasonable, and must not increase these costs without prior approval. all financial arrangements between nursing homes and doctors, other than payment of fees, and pregnancy advice bureaux must be reported to the department.\\n           i think that it will also be worth while on this occasion, having dealt with nursing homes, to focus on the arrangements for registration of approved advice bureaux, as this register was established only early last year.\\n           the background to the register is that, under the abortion act 1967, only places which carry out termination of pregnancy are required to be approved for that purpose by the secretary of state. this means that nursing homes that carry out abortions, in addition to being registered with the local health authority, also have to satisfy the secretary of state that they should be approved for carrying out abortion, whereas the bureaux which advise and refer women for abortion neither require approval under the 1967 act nor need to be registered with the local health authority.\\n           in the early years, following the implementation of the act, and in the absence of control of any kind, a large number of small referral agencies mushroomed, mainly in london. it was these agencies that saw some of the most blatant abuses of the abortion act and caused public concern—such practices as touting for patients, employing persons to divert patients from their intended destinations, and canvassing abroad for patients. this led the lane committee to recommend that, whilst the existing control over nursing homes appeared to work very satisfactorily, there ought to be a system of licensing pregnancy advice bureaux.\\n           even while the committee was sitting, my department had adopted a system of blacklisting undesirable agencies. approved nursing homes were warned that if they accepted referrals from such agencies they would risk losing the secretary of state's approval. as a result of the blacklisting of 23 agencies, these abuses were eliminated and most of the people concerned put out of business. in 1975 the then secretary of state accepted a recommendation by the select committee on the abortion (amendment) bill, based on the conclusions of the lane committee, that this form of control should be extended by requiring approved nursing homes to give an assurance that they would accept only patients referred from pregnancy advice bureaux who were on a register approved by the secretary of state. the first register was published on 10th february 1977 and there are now 35 registered bureaux; nine applications have been refused. registration will be reviewed and, as appropriate, renewed on 1st october this year.\\n           before registration, each bureau is inspected to ensure that the accommodation and facilities for counselling and medical assessment on the premises are of reasonable standard; counsellors are interviewed and counselling notes inspected to assess, as far as it is possible to do so, the standard of counselling to be provided to clients and the business arrangements inquired into to ensure that undesirable persons are not involved and that all is above board.\\n           in addition, registered bureaux must subscribe to various requirements governing their conduct. amongst other things, these prohibit advertising abroad and association with touts and require the maintenance of proper records, the giving of receipts, and consultation with my department about the methods of advertising in this country. all registered bureaux have received a copy of my department's counselling circular, and they are expected to provide counselling in accordance with its central requirement that women should make up their minds in the light of all the relevant facts about their situation and about the alternatives to abortion which are open to them. the register appears to be working well.\\n           as with approved nursing homes, all registered bureaux are subject to unannounced visits by my department's inspecting officers. one of these officers is always a doctor, authorised to inspect counselling notes and medical records and to discuss counselling and medical procedures at the bureaux with the counsellors and doctors concerned. the other member of the team, an administrative officer, checks facilities, staffing and accommodation and general records and receipts. a full report is made on every unannounced visit.\\n           bureaux may also be visited by the department's special investigators, who are ex-police officers, either at random or as part of wider inquiries, and the opportunity is taken to check records—other than patient records—staffing and procedures at the premises. so far it has not been necessary to remove any bureau from the register for failing to comply with the requirements of registration. my right hon. friend, however, will not hesitate to do this, if necessary; nor will he hesitate to take firm measures against any approved nursing home which he finds has acted contrary to assurances given to him. i am of the opinion that the present system of administrative control, including as it does now the registration of pregnancy advice bureaux, is effective in preventing abuse and flexible enough to react quickly to any change in circumstances.\\n           the second main issue which has been raised with me concerns the effects of the 1967 act over the first 10 years of its operation and, in particular, the extent to which the nhs has provided facilities for abortion. the statistics published regularly by the office of population censuses and surveys show that the number of abortions performed under the act increased steadily up to 1973 when there were 167,149 abortions performed in england and wales of which 110,563 were performed on women resident in england and wales. the number of abortions notified in 1977 was 132,999 of which 102,237 were notified as being performed on resident women. the rate of abortions per 1,000 women aged is to 45 years also increased up to 1974, but decreased after that, and appears to be significantly lower than the rate in countries with similar legislation.\\n           it is difficult to establish what the long term pattern will be, but, for those of us who lay emphasis on prevention, there are encouraging signs that the free family planning services are helping to reduce the number of unplanned pregnancies. a survey of family planning use between 1970 and 1975 published yesterday demonstrates the growing use of more effective birth control methods particularly amongst those groups which previously seemed least inclined to use the family planning services. the most recent figures on births and abortions show that the rate of extramarital conception, measured approximately by adding figures of illegitimacy, pre-nuptial conception and legal abortion amongst the young, is decreasing. for example, the rate of extramarital conceptions per 1,000 women in the age group 16 to 19 fell from 60·4 per 1,000 women in 1972 to 45·8 per 1,000 women in 1976—a fall of 24 per cent. a similar decline occurred in the 20 to 24 year age group. even in the under-16 age group, where the numbers are small but of considerable concern to us, the figures, which showed a rise up to two per 1,000 in 1973, remained steady thereafter.\\n           on the question of nhs abortion facilities, i fully accept that provision varies considerably among different parts of england, and overall the nhs performs only just over half of all abortions on women resident in england and wales. but we are determined to improve nhs facilities. the letter of guidance which went out with the £50 million announced by my right hon. friend the chancellor in the budget statement last week in fact states that some of the money could be spent on day-care termination facilities.\\n           as a result of recent activities, i am happy to say that my department has had discussions with two regions about improving abortion facilities—namely, wessex and the west midlands. i have noted that the west midlands regional health authority has accepted its working party's report on abortion facilities in that region, which proposed the provision of day-care facilities for abortion supported by arrangements for counselling. i am sure that my hon. friend will regard that as a considerable advance.\\n           on the question of the barking case, i understand that papers relating to the incident at barking hospital were referred to the director of public prosecutions, who considered them and con- cluded that there was no evidence of a criminal offence.\\n           my hon. friend also raised the question of the droylesden case. mrs. chester, the lady who made the accusation, refused to be interviewed or to give any further information about the allegation, other than what she had been told about the notice by a staff nurse. the editor—\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1978, 4, 19, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1978-04-19.19']]\n"

grantham (mr. hogg). the hon. gentleman succinctly and vigorously put forward the case for the 22-week amendment.\\n           i said that the house was weary of the debate. it is a joyless subject. i was about to suggest that there must be a well-founded desire to find a solution that is acceptable within a plural society, where compromise is necessary. the house may be aware that that opinion is echoed in other quarters, including, as i observe this morning, by a number of privy councillors.\\n           unhappily, if, in an attempt to still the controversy, we move on the basis of a 24-week amendment, it is almost inevitable that we shall fail. unlike the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr.steel), privy councillors want to reach a conclusion, as most of us do. the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles has given bad advice for a long time and contributed largely to the problems in which we find ourselves. if the house listened to the right hon. gentleman it would find itself in the position of having to start all over again. the government would then have to be involved. i do not believe that the house should take such advice.\\n           the controversy has continued for so long that the lobbies have become almost institutionalised. i wonder what many of them will do if we ever reach a solution.\\n           i believe it has been suggested by privy councillors that the debate has become unseemly. therefore, why do i reluctantly draw back from the compromise of 24 weeks, which i do not believe will still the controversy?\\n           the house should face two facts that are undisputed except by the most extravagant partisans on both sides of the house. they have both been put forward unequivocally and clearly by the minister. first, the minister has clearly indicated that there is no authenticated case of survival earlier than 24 weeks.\\n           the instant response, in a desperate attempt to reach a conclusion, is to ask why we cannot settle on that time limit and be done with the wretched controversy. alas, it is not so simple. there is another fact, replete with moral problems, that has to be faced. if we do not face it, far from being done with the cacophony of warring views and preparing the path for further compromise in later parts of the bill we shall almost certainly guarantee further and even more shrill controversy. the awkward fact was frankly brought forward by the minister in committee. his remarks have been referred to but not specifically emphasised on report.\\n           after the minister expressed his view, he brought forward a letter that he had received from professor reynolds. professor reynolds is the professor of neonatal paediatrics at university college hospital medical school, which is the main centre in this country for dealing with very young infants. he proceeded to read the letter.\\n           the statistical conclusions have been catalogued to the house and i do not want to repeat them. however, i must say that nobody can read those statistics of how, increasingly over a short period of time, as a result of the dedicated work of all people in that unit, more and more women who cannot carry their children to term are finding that they can have the blessing of parenthood. i emphasise that because there is a mood in some quarters that seeks to devalue and depreciate motherhood to such an extent that certain people seek to prove that life cannot be lived before a certain point. the hopes of so many thousands of women that are concentrated upon the research work of the unit appear to be devalued by assertion after assertion that before a certain time a child cannot be born alive in any circumstances.\\n           the awkward fact that the house must face is, as the minister saw, the most important fact within the letter. in committee, when reading the letter, the minister said: this is the most important part of his —that is, the professor\\'s— letter. i shall read it if the house will bear with me for one paragraph. it says: we occasionally admit babies born at 23 weeks gestation, and while none has yet survived, it is inevitable that one will, sooner or later. then comes the crucial sentence—the one that everyone must face up to if they stand by the 24-week amendment. the letter says: infants born at 23 weeks are, incidentally, sometimes very much alive at birth—whatever you may hear to the contrary!\"—[ official report, standing committee c, 21 november 1979; c. 272.] so that is an awkward fact. the fact is that now—not in some prospective future but now, if we pass the 24-week amendment—we are approving the legality of the destruction of a baby who is brought out of the womb very much alive.\\n           so far, although no 23-week baby has survived for long, the fact is that any 23-week baby can be born alive. if there are hon. members who are prepared to slay 23-week babies—and in moral terms it matters not whether the baby is inside or outside the womb—surely they must be prepared to put forward the most compelling moral imperatives—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2,

intend to give way to no one except the minister. there will be plenty of opportunity for every hon. member to develop his or her own point of view.\\n           to the credit of the hon. member for devizes (mr. morrison), who moved the amendment, and most of those who support the 24-week period, faced with this challenge—the fact that they may be slaying a live 23-week baby—they do not simply catalogue the normal reasons given which entitle doctors to carry out abortions under the 1967act. they recognise that that liberal enactment which enabled an abortion to take place in so many circumstances is obviously not sufficient to justify the killing of a live 23-week baby. they had to deal with other arguments. they advanced them in the belief that they were the most compelling arguments.\\n           let us examine them. will these arguments solve the consciences of hon. members who are seeking to justify the slaying of 23-week old babies? the first argument is that we do not need to be so scrupulous. the minister will have power, by order, to reduce the age limit when it is shown that a child has survived. that contention quite clearly dodges the issue. babies are being born alive at 23 weeks now. they are being destroyed now. after all, that argument justifies reducing the limit only from 24 weeks to 23 weeks.\\n           on many occasions i have had the professional duty of defending murderers. so far no murderer, however arrogant, has claimed in his defence that the killing was only a slight anticipation of the inevitability of his victim's death. that is the argument that is being put forward here. it is said that a 23-week old child born alive will die anyhow. so shall we all. that is not a very well-founded argument. hon. members will need to have stronger stomachs and more robust consciences than i have to go into the lobby in support of that. also, i wonder whether those hon. members who are considering supporting the 24-week amendment will really want to go into the lobby with those other hon. members who believe in abortion on demand.\\n           what other moral imperatives are being claimed to justify an amendment that will give immunity for the slaying of a 23-week baby? the hon. member for devizes put his views fluently last week. he said he was concerned about two small groups among the very small numbers seeking late abortion. the group includes the older, more mature woman who, although they are almost six months pregnant, may make the mistake of believing themselves to be menopausal. does that argument carry enough weight to justify the awesome violation of the principle of the sancity of human life being enshrined in our legislation?\\n           there is a second argument that is more weighty—that is, the hon. member's understandable concern for very young teenagers. there are very small numbers who, out of ignorance or fear, conceal their pregnancies.\\n        \",

problems, because the act does not cover scotland and because of the different legal system in scotland. i therefore withdrew the original clauses and put the present drafting in their place.\\n           i am well aware that most medical opinion, including that of the british medical association and the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, is against 20 weeks but would support 24 weeks, but the two bodies which produced the fiercest opposition to the 1967 act in the first place were the bma and the rcog. at that time their advice was not listened to. that is why we now have the 1967 act, which some of us want to change.\\n           the one thing that is certain is that opinion polls have shown that the public want the upper time limit to be reduced. the brass tacks poll in june 1979 showed over 65 per cent. of the population in favour of such a change. the sunday times poll, whatever else it said, said that 70 per cent. of the population wanted the upper time limit to be reduced.\\n           however, i accept that that is not necessarily the feeling in the house. so let us look at the amendments. i hope that the hon. member for barking (miss richardson) will seek to withdraw amendment no. 3. if not, i hope that the house will vote against it, because i do not think that there is any support for 27 weeks.\\n           amendment no. 2 says \"24 weeks or less\". i hope that hon. members will listen to the argument and think very seriously before supporting that wording. my hon. friend the minister for health said on second reading: the reasoning behind the desire for change concerns the viability of the foetus. it may be the view of the house that an upper time limit should be set at a point where there is, in all foreseeable circumstances, no prospect of a child being born as a result of procedure for terminating pregnancy. that is probably the view of the house. my hon. friend added: i know of only two authenticated cases in this country of a foetus surviving before 26 weeks. one was at 24 weeks and one was at either 24 weeks or 25 weeks. even at this age a crucial factor is the weight of the child and no child weighing less than 500 grams has been known to survive. nevertheless, if we are honest with ourselves, the possibility must be said to exist. what hon. members will do if they support amendment no. 2 is knowingly to go into the lobby to set an upper time limit at which the minister has categorically stated a foetus has survived. i thought that the whole aim of having an upper time limit was to set it where that would not happen.\\n           in a letter dated 14 august 1979, dr. paintin told me: my own view is that abortion is intended to destroy the foetus and that legal abortion has not been performed if the foetus is born alive. i repeat that my hon. friend the minister has told us that he knows of one foetus born at 24 weeks. my hon. friend also said on second reading, when he was talking about the 1 per cent. above 20 weeks: the house will realise that within this area, small though it is, some quite serious doubts have been expressed from many quarters. what crosses my mind is that numbers alone are not the total answer. if even one child is wrongly aborted, that is a fault in the law and something that we shall have to consider.\"—[ official report, 13 july 1979; vol 970, c. 944–6.] my whole argument is that we should not go for an upper time limit where any mistake can be made. to vote for amendment no. 2 would be to vote for a position in some ways no better than the present one. the evidence shows that 24 weeks is too late.\\n           amendment no. 48, in the names of my hon. friend the member for grantham (mr. hogg) and others, is to insert \"22 weeks or less\". i listened to my hon. friend last week, and i listened today to the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse). much as i dislike discarding a limit of less than 20 weeks, i hope that the house will accept amendment no. 48, because it does what is required. it gives patients and doctors time. it also allows for mistakes of up to two weeks. there is at present no chance of a foetus surviving at that age.\\n

in favour of an upper limit of 24 weeks, and i do not intend to go over that ground again today, except to quote what the minister said in standing committee.\\n           first, there are two points that i want especially to make early in the debate. one concerns whether hon. members and the people whom we represent wish the house to reach a decision on the bill. i think that my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse) was suggesting that those whom we represent did not want us to reach a decision. i totally disagree; i believe that a decision must be reached. the issue has been under debate for more than 10 years. we have had select committees, representative or otherwise. we have had attempts by hon. members on one side or the other to amend the law, and now we have this bill before us.\\n           i believe that the people of this country want to see an end to the debate. it arouses enormous passion and deep feeling in those who take either side. i do not despise those who take a point of view quite different from my own. i am sure that the tens of thousands of people who have signed petitions and come to the house to make their representations to hon. members in favour of the \"corrie bill\" have done so sincerely. i do not believe in the sincerity of some of the propagandists who have supported them, but that is another matter.\\n           i equally believe that those who oppose any amendment to the 1967 act do so with genuine sincerity. if my hon. friend suggests that in this great debate one side has care for life and the other none, that one side has morality on its side and the other none, that is totally to misrepresent our views and those of our constituents, whatever view we may take.\\n           i am convinced that it would be a tragedy if the bill were passed in its present form. equally, it would be a tragedy if, because of the lack of time, the issue remained open and undetermined, waiting for the next session of parliament for another private member to introduce another bill and for us to have another year of debate on it. the people of this country, especially the women, believe that parliament should fulfil its duty and that we should take a decision.\\n           i support very strongly the views expressed in the letter which has been circulated by five right hon. members of the house. i have been ill for the last two days, but if i had had the opportunity to see the letter in advance it would have been signed by six right hon. members. what is more, there are many more right hon. members who would have done the same if they had had the opportunity.\\n           some right hon. and hon. members have not seen the letter, and people outside the house are not aware of its contents. for that reason, this short state- ment should be put on the record. i repeat my support for it. it reads: we believe that a wide agreement now exists in the house for a reduction of the time limit to twenty-four weeks. i believe that to be true. it is true of many of those who felt that the 1967 act required amendment to that extent. many right hon. and hon. members who initially supported 20 weeks feel that the minister used all the right arguments, as did the medical profession.\\n           the letter continues: we know that this will not be totally acceptable to all people\"— nothing that this house has ever passed has been totally acceptable to all people— on both sides of the argument. nevertheless bearing in mind that the government constantly keeps the working of the existing abortion law under review, we would ask them to support this\"— that is, 24 weeks— as a compromise in the best interests of the country and, indeed, the house itself. we would hope in return that the sponsors would be willing to withdraw the other sections of the bill. we would urge all sides to accept this as a proper and reasonable solution to what could become a protracted, perhaps unseemly, certainly bitter, conflict. we ask that serious consideration be given to this appeal by all sides of the house and on all sides of the argument. unfortunately, i have forgotten the constituencies of most of the right hon. members who signed that letter, and i dare not mention their names.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6.2.28', 7, 'uk.m.22249',

out that the government constantly keep the working of the existing abortion law under review. when the issue was debated two or three years ago, i and my right hon. friend the then minister of state took the opportunity to show how the labour government had sought to keep it under review. the present minister, both in standing committee and in these debates, has shown again that the government are alive to these issues and are keeping them under review.\\n           on the subject of 24 weeks, i need not quote too many of the minister\\'s statements when he dealt with the upper limit on 7 november 1979. in the course of his most outstanding statement, he said that the medical advice which he had received was unanimously in favour of 24 weeks. he said that it had been put to him—and this answers one of the arguments of my hon. friend the member for pontypool— that if 20 weeks were the limit, many doctors would in practice try to work to 17 or 18 weeks. that would, of course, create great problems. whatever my hon. friend the member for pontypool may say, i am sure that that is right. the thought that somehow or other doctors might get away with it if challenged in the courts is not one that most doctors would tolerate. most doctors are determined to live within the law, and they will not take risks. there would be grave risks, and they were pointed out by the minister. he made clear in many of his interventions in committee the consultation that he had had. he said: the medical bodies, particularly the bma, were opposed to any change in the 1967 act on the ground that it was working reasonably well.\"—[ official report, standing committee c, 7 november 1979; c. 173–4] but they, too, are prepared to accept 24 weeks. i believe that it is a genuine compromise which would be accepted as fulfilling the wishes of right hon. and hon. members on both sides of this argument.\\n           i was disappointed to hear the hon. member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) say that he had just seen the letter and did not think that the suggestion was appropriate. this is a major initiative. if it is not, i hope that around the right hon. members who signed the statement there will be created a major initiative. if we are able to get a major change in what many have felt to be a weakness in the 1967 act—and i would vote for 24 weeks—it will reflect what has occurred since 1967. the bill\\'s sponsors will be very unwise if they do not see that they will gain a victory for themselves and the view that they hold if we can get acceptance just on this.\\n           it has been said by many right hon. and hon. members that if the bill had stuck to just this issue it would have been through by now and we would not this morning have been discussing it. instead, we would have been discussing another private member\\'s bill which has been held up by these debates.\\n           i plead with the hon. member for bute and north ayrshire to consider this initiative, to see it as a victory and, in return, to withdraw other parts of the bill. i assure him that those of us who disagree with the rest of his bill will fight vigorously, genuinely and sincerely not in an attempt to filibuster or to hold up the processes of the house but simply because we think that the proposals are wrong. i hope that the hon. gentleman and his sponsors will give serious thought to accepting this compromise.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6.2.34', 276, 'uk.m.22552',

when my hon. friend the member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) said that public opinion polls showed a wish to reduce the time limit during which the carrying out of abortion was legitimate in the country, he may unintentionally have misled the house. in scotland, there cannot be any poll of persons who wish to reduce that limit, since there is not in law, and never has been in law, any time limit.\\n           the law is clearer. i think that it will appeal to the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse), because the destruction of a living foetus ex utero at any stage, be it four weeks or 40 weeks, is homicide. the destruction of a foetus in utero, at any stage, is not a crime if done for medical reasons. the compromise proposed to the house would introduce into the law of scotland a fundamental control and, in my belief, a fundamental change which, in principle, goes against the law of scotland on this matter as it has always been—oddly enough, without complaint, before the 1967 act and after it. the reason why there has been no complaint since 1967 is probably that nobody knows, or very few people know, that this is the law of scotland. even the sponsor of the bill has

are later amendments which seek to exclude scotland from certain provisions in the bill for precisely the reasons that he enunciated.\\n           i turn now to the main proposition before the

cause. i do not doubt for a moment the sincerity of my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse) about the view that he holds, but i object to the arrogant presumption that those who do not take his view are inhumane, immoral or even murderers. that word is constantly hurled at people such as myself who take a different view from those who support the \"corrie bill\" and those who, in effect, have supported successive attempts to repeal the 1967 act. that is what all these bills have been about, ever since the 1967 act was passed.\\n           my hon. friend the member for pontypool asserted, i think rightly, that the house probably wants to come to a conclusion. that is right on this occasion. but even if we accept the compromise that has been suggested in the all-party letter

it by salami tactics—slice by slice. if a time limit of 24 weeks is agreed to, they will then turn their attention to the charities, the criteria and every other conceivable thing until they obtain their objective. there is abundant evidence to suggest that that would be contrary to the broad feeling of public opinion. whenever there has been a public opinion poll on these matters, it is undeniable that it has shown that the public as a whole want to see the 1967 act amended in some ways but retained on the statute book, because it has given a large measure of happiness and relief to many families and women.\\n           the hon. member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) has suggested a compromise of 22 weeks. that is not good enough, and i think that the house realises that it is not good enough. as the minister said during our debates in committee, 22 weeks would be the worst of all worlds. i now turn to the evidence in favour of 24 weeks. as i have said before, i am a layman in these matters and i must take evidence from whatever quarter i can get it. i must weigh it up as best i can and then make my decision. i believe that the evidence in support of 24 weeks far outweighs the evidence for either 22 weeks or for any other period. parliament would be highly irresponsible if it did not take account of the weight and quality of the evidence in favour of the 24-week limit, including the royal colleges and the professors of gynaecology in scotland. they are almost unanimously in favour of this kind of compromise.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15,

alleged to have lived before 24 weeks, and there have been cases of premature birth when similar allegations have been made of survival before 24 weeks. six such allegations were made between july 1978 and november 1979. i want to put them on record in a fairly brief comment. the first was the wanstead case, where the abortion took place in july 1978, although it did not hit the headlines until 25 march 1979. allegations were made in the press that the gestation period was 20 weeks and that the foetus was live. the subsequent investigation of the area health authority showed that it was a 19-week gestation and that there was no possibility of independent life.\\n           the second was the whiston hospital case, about which i think one of the hon. members from manchester made representations to the minister. there the abortion took place on 4 january 1979, and it hit the headlines about three or four months later, on 20 april 1979. the allegation was that the foetus was of 22 weeks\\' gestation and that it struggled for life for two hours. investigation revealed that the weight of the foetus was 300 grammes and that the gestation age was 18–19 weeks. the minister said that there was no basis for the allegation.\\n           we then had the barnsley case, on 26 april 1979. the allegation there was that the foetus was of 23 weeks\\' gestation, that it had lived for 36 to 38 hours and that it had been left unattended for three and a half hours to five hours. subsequent investigation showed that the foetus was not of 23 but of 26 weeks\\' gestation and that the cause of death was immaturity. the consultant pathologist at the home office said that permanent survival was not possible.\\n           the fourth case occurred in glasgow in october 1979, when the abortion was at 24 weeks. the allegation was that the foetus was born live. professor macnaughton, who was in charge of the case and of the subsequent inquiry, proved that the foetus was not viable and that there had been strong support for the operation from the mother and the general practitioner.\\n           the next case was at chertsey, where the child was born prematurely on 11 october 1979. there was some dispute over the age and weight of the foetus. mr. norris, the consultant gynaecologist, alleged that the gestation age of the foetus was 23 weeks. it was estimated at university college hospital, to which the child had been transferred, that the period was not 23 weeks, but 24 to 26 weeks. this miracle baby, so described by mr. norris, unfortunately died after a five-week struggle.\\n           the hon. member for edinburgh, south (mr. ancram) quoted a united states case, reported in the daily mail of 6 november 1979. it concerned a child with a gestation age of 23 weeks on united states calculations. by united kingdom measurements the period was 25 weeks.\\n           allegations that survival is possible and has occurred before 24 weeks and even at 20 weeks have been repeated.\\n           i quote a letter sent by the hon. member for lancaster (mrs. kellett-bowman) to her constituents some time ago. i gave her notice that i would raise this today.\\n

support amendment no. 2.\\n           i wish to remind the house briefly of some of the reasons why we may regret moving away from the present 28 weeks limit. my ideal solution is to leave the act exactly as it is. i say that because a reduction in the time limit must increase the chances that the most vulnerable groups will not obtain legal abortions when they need them most. women, young and not so young, will be faced with the invidious choice of having an unwanted child or an illegal and possibly dangerous abortion.\\n           it is said that only 1 per cent. of women having legal abortions in 1976 were involved. however, the supporters of the bill have made great play that even if one child is murdered—as they put it—that is unacceptable. i make equal play of the existence of a number of women who need the protection of the law.\\n           a departure from 28 weeks means that there will be an additional bias against some of the women who are likely to need legal abortions most. the tendency of the amendment bills over the years has been to chip away at a fairly sound and widely accepted act. as a layman, i am dubious about the moral arguments that are thrown around. there can be no conclusive moral argument attached to one time limit or another. it cannot be more or less ethical to destroy a foetus at 28 weeks than at 24 or 22 weeks. not even the most cunning theologian could convince me that the soul is present at between 20 and 28 weeks after conception but not at under 20 weeks. the argument about souls and ethics is casuistry. it is worthy of

them. i have no doubt that there may have been more of whom i did not know. there was one doctor in the area, a few yards east of mile end station. he was a lovely old chap. he struggled manfully with what must have been one of the most difficult practices anywhere in the country. he told me that between one-fifth and one-quarter of his work was taken up with cleaning up the septic and other after-effects of either pathetic failed attempts at self-abortion—the knitting needle and the gin bottle—or the back-street abortions.\\n           that was a long time ago. we must consider the up-to-date evidence. there have been many polls on the matter, and the one to which we ought to pay the most attention is that taken recently by the magazine woman's own among women of child-bearing age. after all, they are the subject of the legislation that we are discussing. they will have to make the decisions. it is no good my hon. friend the member for pontypool talking about a moral

letter, and i hope that the house will bear with me if i read an extract from it. the letter states: we are all general practitioners from the health districts of hackney and tower hamlets. from the time that some of us began in practice here in the 1930s up until the abortion act became effective, we have seen the misery, ill-health and life threatening effects of back-street abortion. we all feel that the effect of the 1967 act has been a positive one, and our patients and their families have benefited from this legislation.  the changes proposed by mr. corrie could be a retrograde step, and if the tower hamlets day care abortion service were forced to close the women of this community would lose an important medical facility. the women of hackney have the agreement of the area health authority to extend the service to their area, but if this bill is passed their needs may never be met.  we urge all mps who voted for mr. corrie\\'s bill on second reading to reconsider this in the light of the weight of medical opinion against the bill. those whose constituencies do not share the problems of poverty, unemployment and sickness faced in the east end of london we ask to imagine what the effects of restricting access to abortion would be for the poorest women in this country.\\' those are not my words. the letter was not solicited. it came to me as a bolt from the blue. general practitioners are busy chaps. they are not great lobbyists. they do not have much time to be lobbyists. the fact that they wrote such a letter indicates the strength of their feeling.\\n           i have heard only one argument used against the proposition that more restrictions on legal abortions will mean more back-street abortions. that argument appeared in a letter sent to me from a clergyman in my constituency. it is one of the few letters that i have had from constituents in support of the bill. this worthy and reverend gentleman wrote to me to say, in effect, \"i do not understand, mr. mikardo, why you argue that if we restrict legal abortions we shall increase illegal back-street abortions. they have recently toughened up the law on abortion in czechoslovakia, bulgaria and poland, and there has not been any increase in back-street abortions in those countries.\"\\n           has the house ever heard anything more naive than that? can any hon. member imagine any piece of biased propaganda being more biased than that? it is suggested that we can stop back- street abortion. it is argued that we should do what they do in czechoslovakia, bulgaria and poland. in effect, it is being said \"let us have informers in all women\\'s organisations, informers in every place where women work, plenty of secret police, draconian penalties and courts that are not instruments of justice but instruments of the state.\"\\n            we are not going to do that, are we? we shall not do that by any means, because none of us wants that. outside the draconian approach that i have described, we shall not arrive at a situation in which restrictions on legal abortions do not mean an expansion of illegal abortions. that is my first reason for being unhappy about the amendments. secondly, i agree with the british medical association about the necessity to leave this difficult decision to the unfettered judgment of doctors. doctors are mortal, fallible human beings like the rest of us. they can make mistakes. that is why we have always insisted that there should be the check of a second doctor. however, the doctor is surely in a position to know the particular case and to take into account, in making his judgment, all the factors in the case, including the gestational age of the foetus.\\n           the doctor will know the woman. he will know her well. he will know her physical shape and her attitudes. he will know the likely effects on her physically and mentally of a termination and the likely effects on her physically and mentally of carrying through to a normal ending of the pregnancy. thanks to splendid technical advances, doctors know a great deal about the foetus. they know its age within quite narrow limits. they know its weight and they know which way it is lying. they know many things about it. they are able to take into account all those factors and all that knowledge in making their judgment.\\n           why

trade. please exercise your judgment. however, on this piece of arithmetic you are not allowed to exercise it.\" that is like saying to the hanging committee of the royal academy that selects pictures to be hung at the summer exhibition \"you are great artists. you are great connoisseurs of art. you are fully competent to decide which are the best pictures and which pictures should be exhibited. you must exercise your judgment and make your own decision. however, you will not exhibit any picture if it is less than 3ft long and 2 ft wide.\" that would be silly.\\n           if we are relying

should like to refer once more to the problem of the teenage girls—unhappily, these days, not too far on in teenage—who become pregnant. i have seen many of these cases at first hand and i know how distressing they are. i speak as one who has brought up two lovely daughters, both of whom are now married with lovely families. i am distressed to hear of these awful cases of young girls who either cohabit with a man or have a continuing sexual relationship. sometimes the relationship is with men of about their own age, but not infrequently it is with men much older than themselves. the minute that a girl becomes pregnant, the man disappears—he skives off. the girls are then left in a terrible state. the man whom they thought of as a prop has suddenly gone when he is most needed.\\n           with my own eyes, i have seen kids who said \"of course, i would not tell my parents—my dad would have beaten the living dayights out of me and chucked me out of the house.\" one case that i know of involved a girl from northern ireland who was working in the north of england. she came into this difficulty and she told me that her parents would never let her in if she went back home. such girls are scared to tell their parents. when they finally pluck up the courage to tell their parents it is often so late that inevitably, if there is an abortion, it is a late one. research would probably discover that the incidence of late abortions among teenagers is higher than the average.\\n           i suppose that every hon. member who has or has had children would like to feel—as i felt when my girls were teenagers—that if they got into difficulty the first person they would come to would be their mother, and the second person would be their dad. manifestly, that is not universally true throughout the community. i am terribly worried about these young girls.\\n           i should prefer to have no limit on abortions, but one thing that has become clear in the debate is that there is no case for a figure below 24 weeks. it has become clear that the minister was right to say that 22 weeks is the worst of all possible worlds. my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) quoted from the letter that she received from professor reynolds. that eminent gentleman should have the last word on the matter. he has been quoted by supporters of the bill in order to establish a case for a limit of less than 24 weeks, yet professor reynolds has said in almost identical words to those used by five hon. members yesterday \"i should be happy with 24 weeks.\" as the five hon. members said, professor reynolds added that he would also be happy to see the rest of the bill being dropped. if anyone doubted the case for something not less than 24 weeks—\\n        ',

simply wish to put some points to the house.\\n           first, if we are to avoid children being killed at an age when they might be able to lead an independent existence—from the speeches that we have heard, i believe that that is the widespread view in the house—clearly the upper time limit must be 24 weeks or less.\\n           secondly, in practice doctors work to two weeks below the legal limit. there- fore, 20 weeks become 18 or even 17 weeks, 22 weeks become 20 weeks, 24 weeks become 22 weeks, 26 weeks become 24 weeks, and so on. they do that partly out of professional caution to be on the right side of the law, partly because dates of conception frequently have an error of about two weeks and partly because at these stages in foetal development the exact age of the foetus, even with the most up-to-date and modern ultra sound and other investigation techniques, cannot be estimated within two weeks. there is an error of one week either way on the date.\\n           thirdly, a great deal happens between 17 and 24 weeks. all the major investigations for foetal abnormality take place during that period and, as several hon. members have pointed out, the tests often have to be repeated and that takes a little extra time.\\n           there are also the tragic personal difficulties for young girls who have been too frightened or confused to seek advice earlier and older women who believe that they are menopausal rather than pregnant.\\n           the point is that the medical profession believes that it should have the maximum freedom of discretion over what action to take in the period between 18 and 24 weeks. doctors see that as an important aspect of dealing properly with individual patients on a personal basis.\\n           fourthly, the professional groups concerned—i went to great pains last year to inquire of all the recognised professional groups—were overwhelmingly in favour of not having a change in the abortion act. incidentally, the bma and the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists recently reaffirmed that opinion. the professional groups also overwhelmingly said that, if there were to be a change, their advice was that the upper time limit should be changed to 24 weeks.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6.2.99', 6, 'uk.m.22530', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp',

anxieties of lawyers. first, they are not always expressed on their own behalf. they are frequently expressed on behalf of their clients—the general public—and are designed to ensure that no one should suffer an injustice; in this case, particularly an injustice to doctors. secondly, the apparent nit-picking of lawyers about draftsmanship reflects a real problem about the content of what we are drafting. difficulties about how we say it may reflect uncertainties about what we want to say, or even sometimes emphasise the fact that we want to say inconsistent things.\\n           in 1967 parliament decided that it was right to permit abortions in certain circumstances, without turning the doctor into a criminal. those circumstances were set out in section 1 of the act, and the relevant circumstances for this purpose are that two general practitioners should form an opinion in good faith that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of injury to the physical and mental health of the pregnant woman or any existing children of her family, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated\". the hon. member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) and his supporters argue that that is unsatisfactory and that it should be changed. it is not my purpose at this stage to enter at length into that issue, but it is clearly relevant to the amendments, because the problems about which i want to talk do not arise if there is no need to alter the existing criteria. those who seek to establish that the existing criteria need altering must show two things: first, that there are circumstances in which abortions can now lawfully be performed which should not be permitted, and, secondly, that the changes which they propose will ensure that abortions cannot lawfully be performed in those circumstances, without preventing those abortions which parliament believes should be lawful.\\n           i point that out at the risk of reiterating the obvious, because i confess that i am puzzled by some of the arguments that have been adduced during these debates. it carries the argument no further to show that some abortions are now performed unlawfully, even if that is established. we all wish to prevent infringements of the law, but we do not prevent them by making the law itself more restrictive. i recollect a frustrating conversation that i had some time ago with a lady who wanted to urge upon me that parliament ought to pass a law to prevent immigrants from entering the country illegally.\\n           great use has been made of the expression \"abortion on demand\", and there have been many discussions on whether we now have abortion on demand. abortion on demand is an emotive term which implies that there is something discreditable about demanding an abortion. i assume that in this context \"demanding\" means asking for an abortion or perhaps even consenting to it. clearly, in that sense, if an abortion is not demanded it cannot lawfully be performed at all—at least, if the patient is capable of expressing a view on the subject. therefore, if the expression means anything, it means that abortions that now occur are carried out whether or not the criteria apply.\\n           to show that we now have abortion on demand in that sense, one needs to show that it is possible to obtain an abortion even if two medical practitioners do not form a view in good faith that there is a risk of injury to life or health. i pause to say that that is simply not true in the constituency which i have the

are well enough known for it not to be necessary for me to repeat them.\\n           even if it were shown that abortions are sometimes performed where those criteria are not satisfied, it is not clear how it would help if we were to alter the criteria. any abortion either falls within the criteria or it does not. if it does, presumably that is what parliament intended. if it does not, it is unlawful and one does not prevent unlawful abortions by altering the criteria.\\n           that having been said that, the fact is that what is proposed in the bill as it left the committee is that the criteria should be changed so that it would now be necessary for two registered medical practitioners to form the view.\\n            that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve risk to the life of the pregnant woman, or of serious injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.. substantially greater than if the pregnancy were terminated\". i should like to say a few brief words about the three amendments. amendment no. 4 relates to the word \"serious\" as it is applied to the injury that is in contemplation. amendment no. 6 applies to the word \"substantially\" as it applies to the balancing of the risk in clause 1, and amendment no. 14 relates to the word \"substantially\" as it applies to the risk in the special circumstances envisaged in clause 2.\\n           when a doctor was considering whether he could lawfully terminate a pregnancy, he would need to make up his mind on two things: first, was there a risk of serious injury to the health of the woman or the children, and, secondly, was that risk substantially greater if the pregnancy continued than if it were terminated? the house may be concerned to discuss whether those are proper criteria. ought a doctor to be precluded from terminating a pregnancy where there is a risk of injury to health if the pregnancy continues, but it is only equal to the risk of terminating or only marginally greater?\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6.2.174', 63, 'uk.m.22028', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', \"during the course of

what guidance should be given to doctors if we can find a way of giving it. should a doctor be precluded from terminating a pregnancy where he believes that there is a risk of an injury to health but

better qualified to do that than i.\\n           my concern is that as the bill stands a doctor would have to form a view on those two matters. i hope that he would form that view by applying his professional judgment and experience and that he would form it honestly. if he did not, the criteria would not matter anyway. what matters is that having formed that view the doctor must proceed to act on it. there is no time to initial legal proceedings in order to test whether the courts would endorse his action. he either terminates the pregnancy or he does not. when it is all over, he may discover that the authorities take a different view and that he is accused of having committed a criminal offence.\\n           the matter then goes before a jury who are asked to address their minds

friend says that the doctor must do that now, but the word \"substantially\" is not there now. that is the difference. in my view, there is no precedent within the criminal law for confronting anyone with that sort of difficulty.\\n           juries must sometimes decide whether someone has inflicted grievous bodily harm or whether someone has driven without due care and attention. in my view, that is a different matter. if i assault my neighbour, i know that i am committing an offence and that it is unlikely that i will have any commendable motive for doing that. magistrates or a jury might have to decide how serious my offence is, and if they decided that the victim\\'s injuries amount to grievous bodily harm my offence would be more serious than if they had taken a different view.\\n           but i can hardly complain that i am taken by surprise if i assaulted my neighbour in the first place. my offence might be more serious than i originally contemplated, but that is rather a different situation. a doctor may be acting from the best of professional motives, without there being any indication that he is committing a criminal offence. it does not help to say that juries sometimes have to decide whether someone is guilty of grievous bodily harm or some other offence.\\n           similarly, if the question arises whether i have driven without due care and attention, that is usually after someone\\'s attention has been attracted to my driving because it has fallen below the normal standards. that is very different from confronting a doctor with the dilemma of whether to refuse to perform an abortion that he believes is in the best interests of his patient or to face the risk of conviction for a serious offence.\\n           i wonder what direction i would give to a jury, were i a judge faced with this kind of prosecution, on the question whether the injury in contemplation was serious and whether the risk was substantially greater. in committee my hon. friend the member for bethnal green and bow (mr. mikardo) quoted examples of attempts by judges to help juries towards the definition of those words.\\n           i ventured to look at the lawyers\\' bible on construction, stroud\\'s \"judicial dictionary\". it gives little help on the word \"serious\". it tells us that what is serious and wilful misconduct of a workman for the purposes of the workmen\\'s compensation act 1897 is a question of fact. if that reasoning applied equally in this case, it would mean that if a jury convicted that conviction would be unlikely to be reversed by the court of appeal. on the word \"substantially\", the most helpful passage was that in the expression \"substantially impaired\"—in the homicide act 1957: the word \\'substantially\\' does not mean \\'trivial or minimal\\' nor does it mean \\'total\\'\". i would have thought that that was a conclusion one could have reached by consulting a dictionary.\\n           i wanted to understand the arguments of those hon. gentlemen who wished to insert these words, and in particular i read carefully the speech in committee on 7 november, column 178 of hansard, by the hon. member for edinburgh, south (mr. ancram). i selected that speech simply because it seemed to me the fairest, clearest and probably most concise statement of the case. i am grateful for the clarity of the hon. gentleman\\'s argument.\\n           long experience in this house has convinced me that it is always dangerous to try to paraphrase the arguments of someone else. one is always susceptible to being told that one has not quite understood the argument. i appreciate that i face that danger. as i understood the hon. gentleman\\'s case, he argued that the present criteria was defective, because it is possible to have abortion on demand. i hope that i have dealt with the structure of that argument. one cannot prevent people ignoring a criterion by making the criterion more restrictive.\\n           the hon. member also said that we need clear criteria. i agree with that. that is what the words that commended themselves to the committee failed to achieve. it is that which my amendment is designed to achieve. i am comforted by the view of the lane committee that words such as \"serious\" do not help. the committee states that in paragraph 202 of its report.\\n           the hon. member for edinburgh, south said that he wanted to add the adjective \"serious\" to the noun \"injury\" to exclude the risk of a doctor giving weight to the risk of minor injuries. i am not sure that i agree with that. the question whether an injury is minor often depends upon whether someone suffers it. any lawyer who has conducted a personal injury case will know that the damages that a judge may award for backache may depend upon whether that judge has ever suffered from backache. i believe that we should seek to protect women from any injury, whether or not it is serious, but in any event i believe that the argument is outweighed by the uncertainty created by the word \"serious\".\\n           the argument for the word \"substantially\" is that it excludes what is known as the statistical approach. it is suggested that some doctors argue that more women suffer injury in childbirth than in having an abortion and, therefore, the risk of injury by permitting a pregnancy to continue is necessarily greater than the risk of injury by terminating that pregnancy. i have never heard a doctor say that he reasoned in that way or used that approach. if he does, he misconstrues the 1967 act. if i am wrong the attorney-general will correct me. the lane committee dealt with this matter in paragraph 201 of its report, and i am comforted that the committee arrived at the same view as i did.\\n           the act requires a doctor to direct his mind to the condition and circumstances of the individual patient. he must consider whether she is peculiarly susceptible to a particular injury. when assessing the present criteria were defective, because account the statistical probabilities. but resolving the question by reference to statistics is like arguing that most people die in bed and that, therefore, it must be safer to climb everest than to go to bed. if that is the mischief at which the word \"substantially\" is aimed, the amendment will not meet it. misconstruing an act is not prevented by amending an act.\\n           i was grateful to the solicitor-general for scotland for the information that he gave in committee. i am comforted, because nothing that he said surprised me. he spoke chiefly about the law in scotland. referring to the word \"serious\", he said that the criteria of the doctor and the jury may differ. of course, the criteria of the patient may be different again. sometimes doctors may adopt more spartan standards than the rest of us. the solicitor-general for scotland said that in his brief medical experience he had seen more people in discomfort described as \"comfortable\" than in any other circumstances.\\n           i move the amendment because i fear that doctors, in good faith and according to their best judgment, might suffer an injustice. but not only the doctor might suffer. a doctor knows that if he terminates a pregnancy, however honestly and with whatever good intentions, he might face a criminal conviction but that if he declines to terminate a pregnancy the risks of ill consequences to himself are less likely. and the danger is that the risks that he will balance are not those that the bill requires him to balance. i am not suggesting that a doctor is less likely to be altruistic than the rest of the population. however, the risks that we are discussing are only some of the risks that we impose upon doctors.\\n           my right hon. and learned friend the member for dulwich (mr. silkin) has drawn attention to the problem of the doctor who, in good faith, takes steps to terminate a pregnancy when it transpires that the woman is not pregnant and when the symptoms are phantoms. under existing law it is arguable that a doctor has no defence under the 1967 act. there is a risk of terrifying doctors into a reluctance to terminate any pregnancies at all.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6.2.185', 19,

relation to this difficult problem. in the years since that act was passed i have resented deeply the suggestion that those of us who finally voted for it were in some way less moral than those who were opposed to it. i resent some of the comments that i have heard today that suggest that by standing firm with that balance now we are less compassionate or less concerned than anyone else about the life of the foetus.\\n           in 1967 i abstained from the second reading vote because i was worried that the wording of the bill was too wide and might go as far as abortion on demand. only when the wording was changed in committee and on report did i finally vote for it on third reading. i standby that. there has never been, apart from some areas of catholic opinion, a wholly condemnatory moral opinion against abortion. that applies to catholic opinion at large.\\n           it was possible to have an abortion to preserve the life of the mother before the 1967 act. in a recent statement about the bill, the archbishops came round to saying that if the life of the foetus is destroyed in the course of saving the mother\\'s life, that is not morally wrong. i ask those who express strong views against those of us who are opposed to the bill to question whether it can ever be said that there is a completely clear moral view for or against abortion. the question is, where is the line to be drawn?\\n           i draw the line strongly against abortion on demand. the 1967 act did not allow abortion on demand. anybody who reads it can see that it does not allow that. the terms are perfectly clear. an abortion can be carried out only if two doctors certify, in good faith, that the criteria have been met. although many suggestions have been made by the supporters of the bill that doctors do not honestly apply their minds to the criteria and do not certify in good faith, the answer is not to change the criteria but to provide that somebody should bring a prosecution against such doctors as he believes are not applying the act properly.\\n           it is clear from the figures around the country that there is not abortion on demand. in my constituency in york there are three gynaecologists who are strongly resistant to the 1967 act on what i quite understand to be conscientious grounds. they apply the criteria very strictly indeed. in those circumstances, 28 per cent. only of the abortions that take place for women resident in the york area are carried out under the national health service. the remainder have to go elsewhere.\\n           in adjacent areas such as northallerton, scarborough or areas in the north-east, the figures can rise to as high as 94 per cent. it follows that of those doctors who are applying the same test, some are applying it more strongly than others. that does not mean that some are applying the test in bad faith and others in good faith. one hon. member asked what would happen if the increasingly severe tests were applied in other operations. i was going to tell the house the story of my operation, but i—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'],

he will be patient, i shall come to it in a moment. i had reached a point where i was going to tell the house about my favourite subject, namely, my operation. nobody has any greater cause to be sceptical about the opinion of doctors than i have.\\n           i was taken into hospital two or three years ago for what was said to be a simple gall bladder operation. the operation was to be over in a short time and i was to be back in the house within a month. it took me six months to get back on my feet. that was because the doctor made an error of judgment about whether i ever needed the operation. when they took the gall bladder out, they found that there were no stones. it could have been dealt with without a major operation. because of complications it went wrong.\\n           i could have sued the doctor for negligence, but i would not have succeeded. in the light of a recent decision in the court of appeal, it is clear that an honest doctor applying his clinical judgment would have come to one view, whereas another doctor might have come to a different view. if that sort of test is applied to the question whether a woman should have an abortion within the criteria laid down in the bill, it is perfectly possible for some honest, conscientious consultant gynaecologist to take one view and for others to take a different view of the same case.\\n           it does not surprise me in the least that the figures around the country vary considerably. all that one is saying is that one does not trust the doctors when one has to question the bona fides of the critics. it is one thing to say that one does not trust the doctors when one is in favour of the 1967 balance, but, if one has always been against abortion—and finds abortion so morally repugnant that even to discuss it causes the sort of wrath and ire that this discussion has caused—to say that the doctors are not applying the tests with integrity seems to raise some doubt about the validity of the criticism raised by the critic.\\n           i would rather trust a doctor\\'s integrity than a new version of the words that were finally discovered in 1967 and have stood the test of time. that is why i am against the insertion of either \"serious\" or \"substantially\".\\n           i turn to the point raised by the hon. member for wolverhampton, south-west (mr. budgen), which is central to my consideration of the word \"substantially\". i shall not go into the word \"serious\" at any length as that he been dealt with already. my hon. friend the member for pontpool (mr. abse) is right in that, unlike the word \"serious\", the change to \"substantially\" would accept the same sort of judgment in the mind of the doctor as the 1967 act. he is saying that a doctor has to balance the risk. the 1967 act said that the doctor had to balance the risk and decide whether the risk of danger to life or health was greater in the one case than in the other. we are saying now that it should be substantially greater.\\n           the courts would be bound to take notice of that change of wording. if parliament, in its consideration, decided to insert the word \"substantially\" before the word \"risk\", the courts would be bound to think that parliament meant something by that. a graver burden would be placed upon the doctors. that is the beginning of my answer to the hon. member for wolverhampton, south-west.\\n           the test, in my judgment—and there are many lawyers in the house with a variety of views—would be objective. given all the evidence, a jury would have to decide whether there was a substantially greater risk. i say that on the basis of the simcox case, which was decided by the court of appeal, where the issue was an interpretation of words in the homicide act 1957 and whether the person was suffering from an impairment of the mind that substantially diminished his responsibility for committing a murder, thereby reducing the charge to manslaughter.\\n           it is interesting to read the facts of the medical evidence that appear in the judgment. they are especially relevant to the issues that we are discussing. the court stated: all four medical experts were of the opinion that this appellant suffered from an abnormality of mind, and that abnormality of mind arose from inherent causes, the name given to the abnormality being paranoid personality. not one of them, however, would go to the length of saying that as a result of that abnormality the appellant\\'s mental responsibility was substantially impaired. they used words to the effect that the impairment was moderate, that it was harder for him to control his actions, that the degree of paranoid personality was, as one doctor said, persistent and strong. those and other expressions were used, but not one of the mental experts felt that he could say that the impairment was substantial\". \\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'],

a viable human being. that offence remains whenever there is an abortion. if the foetus is born viable and can live, it is murder if someone kills the foetus at that stage. that is why i tried to

relating to termination, are being used to justify abortion, and we wish to stop that.\\n           i suggested the inclusion of the word \"serious\" in committee because i wish to exclude the trivial injury. i appreciate that the question whether an injury is trivial is a subjective matter, but when one has a comparative basis between termination and childbirth we must remember that there are natural injuries of childbirth in almost every case, including for example, perineal stitches, haemorrhaging and varicose veins. i am trying to exclude the doctor who seeks to provide abortion on

system that fails to provide that help or counsel, a system in which women experience social pressures urging them to have an abortion in some circumstances, a system that can produce the tragic example of women who wrote to me last autumn, who had had an abortion and desperately regretted it afterwards. they said over and over again in their letters \"if only we had had the time to think about it properly…if only people had explained all the circumstances that surround having an abortion\".\\n           few can deny that abortion is an operation that wounds the woman—not only in itself, not only in the possible physical and mental after-effects, which are far too often ignored in this debate, but emotionally. the clause seeks genuinely to protect the women about whom i have talked, who have found themselves at the end of a great channel of social pressure urging them to have an abortion which they will afterwards regret.\\n           let us never forget that though abortion is often the easy way out of a predicament for a man it is never quite as easy for a woman, and for the child it is no way out at all. i hope that we still live in a society in which life is valued and in which, when it is taken, it is not taken lightly.\\n           i believe, too, that we in this house have a duty to protect those in our society whom society sometimes unwittingly

'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6.2.233', 1185, 'uk.m.18458', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'it is no mystery that the hon. member for edinburgh, south (mr. ancram) declined to give way to anyone seeking to intervene in his speech. anyone who makes dogmatic statements which are totally at variance with the facts cannot afford the risk that someone might bob up and ask him to produce some evidence to support what he is saying.\\n           like my right hon. and learned friend the member for warley, west (mr. archer), i do not like to impute motives to people who take a view which is different from my own. however, if my right hon. and learned friend had sat through the committee stage of the bill he would have been left in no doubt that the purpose of the words \"serious\" and \"substantially\" was to frighten doctors off doing abortions. there was no doubt from the proceedings of the committee that that was their purpose, and their only purpose.\\n           the object of including the words had nothing to do with getting rid of abortion on demand. it had nothing to do with the scientific follow-up, the balance of advantage and disadvantage and the balance of the risk at this end and the risk at that end. the words are designed to frighten off doctors and to put them in a position where, having made their own judgment, they say to themselves \"that is my judgment, but how do i know that a jury will take the same view? the jury probably will not have a doctor on it. it may decide on the evidence. it may have people on it who are prejudiced one way or the other in respect of abortion. how do i know that in making its judgment of whether what i did was right or wrong the jury will adopt the same sort of criteria as those which i applied?\"\\n           as we know, it is possible for different juries to take different views about the same word in identical cases. it is possible for courts at different levels to take different views. if the racing form of the last few weeks is any guide, the odds are about 5 to 1 on that whatever the court of appeal finds, the house of lords throws out. the odds are about 5 to 1 on that if the court of appeal found that a matter was \"substantial\", the house of lords would say that it was not, and vice versa.\\n           i did not understand the argument between my right hon. and learned friends about \"objective\" and \"subjective\". of course it is subjective. it is a twelve fold subjective test. it is 12 members of a jury making a guess. if we put in words which are susceptible of different interpretations, the doctor cannot foresee how they will be construed in court. therefore, if he wants to avoid getting it in the snitch, he says to himself \"i had better stay out of this altogether.\"\\n           there is no way of quantifying either \"serious\" or \"substantially\". my right hon. and learned friend quoted from the legal sources to which he says the lawyers always go. i do not know about that. whenever i try to discover some of these things, i go to what i regard as the child\\'s guide to the law, which is butter-worth\\'s legal dictionary. that is the only book that puts legal considerations in terms which a moderately educated layman can begin to understand.\\n           i have looked up both terms in butterworth\\'s dictionary. about \"substantial\", it says: \\'substantial\\' is not a word with a hard meaning in all contexts. it is an unsatisfactory medium for carrrying the idea of some ascertainable proportion of the whole. if it is an unsatisfactory medium for carrying the idea of an ascertainable proportion, the definition is saying that some people might think that 10 per cent. was \"substantial\", whereas others might not think it was \"substantial\" unless it was 20 per cent.\\n           a poor doctor with a case before him has to try to estimate what a jury might think in some months\\' time. it may be a year or two before the case goes to court. this is an area in which there are many litigious people who have no difficulty in getting access to a lot of money for costs. there is no doubt that if these words were in the bill they would be tested over and over again in the courts. one court might find one way and another court another way.\\n           i invite the house to look at the word \"serious\", and what dear old butterworth says is very revealing. it quotes an authority who, i imagine, would be recognised by all learned members of the house as adequate—lord chief justice reading, who had many distinctions. apart from being lord chief justice, he was viceroy of india, and he also preceded me in representing reading in the house. he decided that the word \"serious\" was synonymous with the word \"grave.\"\\n           having decided that \"serious\" was synonymous with \"grave\" he looked at \"grave\" to decide what that word meant. he said: i think we must come to the conclusion that when parliament introduced the word \\'grave\\' before the word \\'misconduct\\' it meant that the misconduct must be not only of a character which could properly be described as misconduct, but also that the misconduct must be such as would amount to misconduct of a grave…character. that is a beauty, is it not? what the learned lord chief justice said in 50 words is what a layman would say in three words. the layman would say \"grave means grave\". that is what the lord chief justice said. he said that he could find no other definition for the word \"grave\" than that it meant \"grave\", and, as i said earlier, he said \"grave\" was \"serious\".\\n           the hon. member for edinburgh, south said that doctors know what the word means because they use the term themselves and sometimes have to talk about serious injury. that will not wash. there is no comparison between assessing whether an injury that has taken place is serious and assessing whether an injury that may take place in several months\\' time will be serious. one can judge whether grievous bodily harm is serious when one sees that the bloke who has suffered it has a broken jaw, five fractured ribs, concussion, a fractured pelvis and bothlegs broken. one has no difficulty in considering that he has suffered a grievous injury. doctors are often called upon in courts to say that an injury is serious. there is no diffculty in saying that it is serious when the chap\\'s injury seen.\\n           what on earth has that to do with a doctor asking himself what sort of injury a woman might suffer if she does not have an abortion and what injury she might suffer if she goes through with her pregnancy for another four or five months? the doctor has no hard evidence. it must be a matter on which he has to exercise the most refined clinical judgment.\\n           the hon. gentleman quoted the bma handbook—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 2, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-02-15.6'],

face prosecution and they might be convicted in the crown court if they could not convince a jury of the genuineness of their professional judgment. supporters of the amendments have already referred to this. doctors will be afraid to use their own medical judgment in this personal and individualistic matter.\\n           when faced with a serious decision whether to advise on and allow an abortion, doctors will not only have to bear in mind the state of mind, physical condition and circumstances of the patient but will always have to be conscious of the fact that, with the new, tighter, legislation, their own reputations are at stake. however sympathetic the doctor may be towards the patient\\'s problem, he will always recollect that he is bound by the interpretation of words.\\n           the supporters of the bill, and the hon. member for edinburgh, south (mr. ancram), would have us believe that at present doctors are practising abortion on demand. they base much of their evidence for this on one doctor—professor peter huntingford—who has often stated that he performs an abortion if the woman requests it.\\n           the fact that one doctor admits to performing abortion on demand is hardly ground for changing the very careful and balanced wording of the 1967 act. abor- tion on demand does not exist in this country for the overwhelming majority of women.\\n           figures show that the numbers of abortions performed in different areas vary. in newcastle upon tyne 93 per cent. of abortions were performed on women in the national health service. in dudley, in the same year, the figure was only 6 per cent. clearly these women do not have abortion on demand. far from introducing restrictive phrases such as \"serious\" and \"substantially\", parliament should be acting to eliminate the gross discrepancies that exist within the national health service.\\n           a poll carried out for the society for the protection of unborn children by gallup in 1971 showed that fewer than one in 10 of gynaecologists believed that abortion on demand should be available in all circumstances. when the lane committee considered this problem, it decided not to recommend any alteration in the wording. the majority of doctors have not taken decisions on abortions lightly. their decisions must now be further prejudiced because a liberal interpretation of the words may mean prosecution. it would take years of litigation to sort out what is legal and what is illegal.\\n           already, in other sectors of medical practice, when faced with completely different situations, doctors have to calculate not only which decision is most advantageous to the health of the patient but which decision is least likely to involve him in legal action. in 1978 a mother with a brain-damaged child was awarded damages of £100,000 against the obstetrician who performed a forceps delivery when her baby was born. in december last year that award was quashed by the court of appeal.\\n           nevertheless, doctors will in future be in a dilemma when deciding between a forceps delivery—which may place them in a position where litigation may follow—or a caesarian section, which may not be in the best interests of the mother but which would entail less risk of legal action.\\n           there is already a flood of law suits in america in cases alleging medical malpractice. huge damages have been awarded and as a result the professional judgment of doctors is being affected. if defensive medicine is growing in other areas, one can imagine how the new restrictions would effectively reduce the chance of any woman obtaining an abortion legally even although she might have a very good case. she would be forced to seek a dangerous and illegal abortion.\\n           we must bear in mind that deaths from all forms of abortion have fallen from 34 in 1969—the year after the abortion act came into force—to five in 1978. only one death after an illegal abortion was recorded in 1977 compared with 22 in 1968. the number of hospital discharges after treatment for septic abortion—a common result of botched illegal abortions—fell from 3,000 in 1968 to 610 in 1975. illegal abortion offences known to the police have dropped from 257 in 1969 to seven in 1978. the number of persons found guilty of, or cautioned for, offences of procuring illegal abortion dropped from 72 in 1969 to three in 1977.\\n           many of the supporters of the bill are assuming that an illegal abortion is something that a woman undertakes lightly. they underestimate the sensitivity, the moral fibre and the humanitarian feelings of the women of this country. they also underestimate a woman\\'s strong maternal instincts. it can never be an easy decision for a young girl, or a not so young woman, and it will be even more difficult if, while having to cope with so many mixed emotions, she has also to seek the assistance of an illegal back-street operator. the strain and feeling of guilt may scar her mentally for many years.\\n           it may not be an easy decision to make, but 80 per cent. of women questioned in a recent gallup poll said that if abortions were made difficult by law they would still go ahead and try to find other ways of terminating a pregnancy. parliament can decide only whether abortions are performed legally or illegally. if the bill becomes law, the number of abortions will not be substantially reduced. women will search for means of procuring an abortion until they find one. it has been thus from time immemorial.\\n           in the last year, four separate polls showed that there was wide support for the existing law. a poll by mori for the sunday times shows that less than half of the population think that the abortion law should be tightened. a clear majority thinks that the law should be left as it is or liberalised. that poll was conducted only two weeks ago.\\n           a recent gallup poll commissioned by woman\\'s own reveals that two out of three women in the 25 to 35 age group are against changing the law. a total of 81 per cent. of women believe that the question of abortion should be left to the woman in consultation with doctors. those views are held by women of all political persuasions. it is interesting that only 12 per cent. of conservatives questioned by gallup supported the new bill compared with 15 per cent. of labour voters.\\n           the representative body of the bma, which includes doctors of all disciplines and religions, deplores the attack on the present abortion act. it considers the act to be humane and practical and says that it does not require amendment. that body is supported by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists and, most importantly, by the royal college of psychiatrists and almost every other medical organisation in britain.\\n           an editorial in the british medical journal said that medical experts were unanimous that the law should be left unchanged. a letter signed by 70 of britain\\'s most prominent doctors appeared in this month\\'s lancet, warning that if the bill is passed septic abortion will once again become a national scourge.\\n           i hope that my colleagues, if and when going through the lobby to support the bill, will remember that they are ignoring sound advice and professional judgment. i hope that my male colleagues will remember that the proposed changes are not considered to be desirable by most of the women in the country and that women are inadequately represented in the house.\\n           the roman catholic bishops of england, wales and scotland support the bill. the catholic church\\'s position on abortion is well known. many religious leaders of other denominations also support that view. i respect their opinion. we are lucky that our religious leaders are given every opportunity to persuade people to accept their view. however, they must work by persuasion. it is not right that they should expect rigid and restrictive legislation from the house on such an intensely personal matter.\\n           i support the group of amendments. i shall not vote for the bill, because if it is passed there will be a return to criminal and dangerous abortion, which will cause hardship and suffering to so many women.\\n

      "[['uk.proc.d.1989-06-08.9.1.2', 2132, 'uk.m.10634', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i am most grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue tonight. i thank you, mr. speaker, for selecting this debate on the topic of the carlisle baby. the case has been raised in questions to various ministers and also as part of the general abortion debate, but it raises so many issues of national importance, affecting all regional and district health authorities and hospitals where abortions are carried out, that it really deserves a debate of its own.\\n           i have given my hon. friend the minister notice of the principal questions that i intend to raise in the hope that many of those hitherto unanswered questions will be answered, and that certain things that went on in carlisle will finally come out into the light of day.\\n           in raising the issue, i have confined myself to the material contained in affidavits, sworn properly before a solicitor, information given to the priest, the chaplain of carlisle city general hospital, and certain press coverage that has gone unchallenged.\\n           nevertheless, i recognise that not all hon. members share my concern about the events in carlisle in july 1987. i offered my hon. friend the member for berkshire, east (mr. mackay), who i know to be entirely honourable and who would therefore have confined his time appropriately, the opportunity, if he wished, to intervene in the debate, but, alack, this place is as empty of himself as the arguments of the pro-abortionists on the subject are of reason and merit.\\n           in summary, on 21 july 1987, a woman was admitted to carlisle city general hospital, 21 weeks pregnant, for an abortion. no injection was used to ensure that the child would be born dead, and the method used was the prostaglandin method. in the event, the child was born alive. she lived for three hours, during the course of which she was baptised by one of the nurses. she was left gasping on a kidney dish. no ventilation or incubation equipment was available. two nurses were left to cope with the situation alone without proper supervision. when the child died, no death certificate was issued, and no birth certificate has ever been issued.\\n           the mother did not find out for six months that the child had lived. when eventually the facts came to light, through the good offices of a catholic priest, a police file was prepared on the case that led the coroner in carlisle to recommend that it was in the public interest that an inquest should be held. normally it is routine that an inquest would follow, but on this occasion it did not.\\n           the case raises a large number of questions, both about the compliance of our hospitals—in the nhs and the private licensed clinics—with the infant life (preservation) act 1929 and about the conduct of late abortions in general.\\n           the 1929 act states: any person who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of the mother, shall be guilty of … child destruction\". that is any child capable of being born alive—and the carlisle baby was born alive.\\n           that same act states that at 28 weeks there shall be prima facie proof that the child will be capable of being born alive. it does not say \"before 28 weeks there is no proof\". it simply gives absolute protection after 28 weeks. if anyone has reason to assume that a child before that time is capable of being born alive, to procure its death is an act of child destruction. that is made very clear under the 1929 act, and it is clear in the abortion act 1967 that nothing in it negates the provisions of the 1929 act.\\n           we are faced with a very strange situation. a piece of law states that it is child destruction to kill a child before it has an independent existence from its mother if it is capable of being born alive. yet widely practised in the private clinics is the diabolical method of d and e in which the child is dismembered alive, without anaesthetic, in the womb. is my hon. friend the minister really satisfied that our nhs hospitals and the private clinics that he must license are complying with the law? in the nhs hospitals, where that diabolical method is not practised, an injection of urea or saline is given to a child before abortion by the prostaglandin method. how does ensuring that the child is born dead possibly comply with the 1929 act? as we now know that children can survive independently of the mother as early as 24 and possibly 23 weeks, what possible reason can there be for allowing any abortions after those weeks if the 1929 act is to be complied with? that has been generally recognised.\\n           we have another complaint, because not only is it permissible to kill those children in hospitals, despite the 1929 act, but, just to make a sop in the direction of complying with the act, there is a set of regulations. they were enunciated by the then secretary of state, mrs barbara castle, on 21 october 1975, when she said: in the national health service the select committee\\'s recommendation that terminations after the twentieth week of pregnancy\"— the carlisle baby was 21 weeks— should be carried out only in hospitals possessing appropriate facilities, including resuscitation equipment, have been accepted, and discussions have been held with regional medical officers who will be responsible for the implementation of the recommendations.\"— [0fficial report, 21 october 1975; vol. 898, c. 245.] furthermore, in approving private clinics the secretary of state demands that they have ventilation and incubation if they are to carry out terminations after the 20th week; demands that there should be staff instructed in their use and available to use them; demands that arrangements be made for the child to be taken to the nearest special baby care unit. i am sure that we do not expect less from the nhs than we expect from the private sector. i ask my hon. friend the minister whether at any time the east cumbria health authority gave notice to him, or to any of his predecessors, that it could not comply with the conditions set out in 1975 and re-enacted ever since.\\n           was my hon. friend under the impression that carlisle city general hospital could comply with those regulations? if he was not, what steps has he taken to ensure that other hospitals, in other areas, that have not had the horror of this case and therefore have not come to public notice, can comply with those simple provisions about ventilation, incubation and trained staff?\\n           why were two nurses left unsupervised? why were no instructions given by the consultant who had authorised and, indeed, started the abortion? why was their only telephone contact with a junior doctor who was on duty that night? what was done by senior medical staff in carlisle city general hospital that night? is all that normal procedure at carlisle? is it normal for nurses to be left unsupervised to cope with very complicated and unexpected cases? if so, is that also done elsewhere? is my hon. friend aware that the junior doctor on duty that night did not wish to participate in abortions? wherefore the workings of the conscience clause?\\n           i come now to the cruellest point of all. it appears that the diagnosis was possibly wrong. the abortion was carried out under section 1(1) (b) of the 1967 act, which states that abortion is permissible where \"there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.\"\\n           in this case the diagnosis was that the father had a mild form—and it was mild—of ehlers danlos syndrome, which the child in turn had only a 50 per cent. chance of inheriting and which ranges from a very minor disability to being quite serious in some forms. can that be described as a substantial risk? if the minister had to take a bet on such odds, would he think it likely that the odds were in favour of the child coming out handicapped? no proper analysis was made of whether that diagnosis was right or wrong.\\n           we come to the aftermath of the carlisle case and to what i can only describe as a massive cover-up. there was a police investigation and a recommendation for an inquest. it is not my hon. friend\\'s responsibility to approve inquests, but may i ask him to say in how many other instances of death in an nhs hospital where a coroner has recommended an inquest has that recommendation been turned down? how often does that happen?\\n           is there or is there not a law which says that live births shall be registered? why was the carlisle baby not registered\\'? why, when it had lived for three hours—wanted, normal and baptised—was there no death certificate? why was the mother not offered the option of a funeral, which is offered even in the case of stillborn babies, let alone those who have lived\\'? why was not the mother told of the true situation for six months? why was it left to a priest to bring the matter into the light of day, and why was the priest\\'s contract not renewed? is it true, as the nurses have stated, that their union advised them to keep quiet and not to take any legal action?\\n           will the minister admit that a thorough overhaul of procedures is needed and that what happened in carlisle that night brings credit to nobody and that the regional health authority must answer properly for its implementation of the ventilation and incubation requirements\\'? will he also agree, chillingly, that there was a similar case in 1983, alas not the subject of so much publicity?\\n           when that little light was extinguished in carlisle, a great darkness fell on the nhs, on its civilisation and on its compliance with basic law. does the minister agree that for a live, wanted, normal, baptised child to live for three hours on a kidney dish—not even in a warm cot and not in its mother\\'s arms—not in an incubator but on a kidney dish, is a disgrace? will he join me in regretting that the case was not resolved in the light of day?\\n           i now make a statement of fact and i do not make it threateningly. i have not tonight named any of the staff involved, the chairman of the regional health authority, the hospital administrator or anybody else, not even under privilege, but if a similar case occurs again in any part of the country a considerable body of parliamentary opinion will insist that that case is solved in the light of day, even if it means coming up with names and personal identities in the house.\\n           i summarise my questions to the minister and i would like him to answer all of them. i hope that i have left him sufficient time in which to do that. how does killing a child before birth tie in with the infant life (preservation) act 1929? what is the point of insisting that ventilation equipment shall be available if the child is allowed to be killed? will the minister consider outlawing completely the barbaric d and e method? does he expect the nhs to match the standards that he lays down for private hospitals? did east cumbria ever indicate that it could not comply with the regulations and, if not, why was ventilation not available that night? why were two nurses left alone unsupervised? in how many other instances of death on nhs premises has a recommended inquest been refused? why was there no birth certificate? why was there no death certificate?\\n           does the minister agree that there was a cover-up and, if he does, what disciplinary action was taken, and if none was taken, what steps will be taken to ensure that this never occurs again? why was the mother not told for six months that the child had lived? why was the priest\\'s contract not renewed? is the minister satisfied that the abortion complied with section 4 of the 1967 act, and does he agree that that section is widely abused and that this is only one instance of it? what steps has he taken to revise the regulations or to re-emphasise them, in the light of the carlisle case, to all regional health authorities? why was there no option of a funeral?\\n           i hope that the minister will answer those questions. they all need answering. if they are not answered, this issue will be properly raised again in the house.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1989, 6, 8, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1989-06-08.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1989-06-08.9.1.3', 253, 'uk.m.17677', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i am grateful to

clearly is today.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1989, 6, 8, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1989-06-08.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1989-06-08.9.1.5', 1723, 'uk.m.17459', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health', 'government', \"my hon. friend the member for maidstone (miss widdecombe) was fortunate to secure this adjournment debate tonight. i think that she described the case as distressing and sad, and i agree with her. her contribution to the debate and those of my hon. friends the members for hyndburn (mr. hargreaves) and for basildon (mr. amess) were illuminating and important.\\n           in the 11 minutes left i can answer but a few of the points raised, but i shall study the reports of this debate. my hon. friend raised a number of issues and was kind enough to give me an outline of the points that she intended to raise. i hope that she will bear with me and accept an answer in correspondence to many of the points that she raised. likewise, i shall write to my other hon. friends.\\n           the debate has centred on the carlisle baby case—a termination of pregnancy on grounds of likely serious physical handicap which took place in carlisle hospital in july 1987. i am anxious to demonstrate to the house that this case has been closely examined by the health authority and by the department of health, and also, as regards the matter of an inquest, by the home office. but in doing this i have to bear in mind two different matters. the first is that of patient confidentiality. termination of pregnancy is for the women concerned inevitably stressful and it is therefore clearly important that the usual standards of confidentiality should be adhered to with particular rigour. the second is the question of possible legal proceedings on behalf of the women. i am advised that this question is still outstanding and i have therefore to bear this closely in mind in what i say briefly tonight.\\n           when the various concerns about the case became apparent the east cumbria health authority set up an internal committee of inquiry which included an independent gynaecologist, and produced conclusions and recommendations. the committee concluded that the termination of pregnancy was properly performed within the requirements of the abortion act but that there was some disregard of the patient's right to confidentiality and lapses in communication at and after the event. its report, which identifies the staff involved and gives details about the patient's circumstances, is confidential. in the light of the committee's findings and recommendations the authority has tightened its procedures in various ways to ensure that they are in line with best practices. written guidance to both medical and nursing staff has been strengthened and staff have been reminded that all information relating to patients must be kept confidential.\\n           my hon. friend asked first about resuscitation equipment and the 1975 select committee report. the committee's recommendation that termination after the twentieth week of pregnancy should be carried out only in hospitals possessing appropriate facilities was accepted and in the nhs responsibility for its implementation has been the responsibility of regional medical officers. the committee's recommendation was discussed with rmos in september 1975. they said that there would be no difficulty in implementing the recommendation.\\n           in march 1983 rmos were reminded that the department wanted to ensure that all nhs gynaecological staff who undertook late abortions were aware of the requirement that resuscitation equipment should be available. the rmos felt that this requirement was sufficiently well known and observed by nhs consultant gynaecologists, and saw no need for the department to issue particular guidance on the subject. in the carlisle baby case the position is that if a decision had been made by the doctor concerned to resuscitate the foetus the necessary equipment was available on site and would have been on the scene within a matter of a very few minutes.\\n           my hon. friend asked about the infant life (preservation) act 1929 which makes it an offence to destroy the life of a child which is capable of being born alive. in any particular case it is a matter for the clinical judgment of the individual doctor whether a foetus, at any age, is capable of being born alive. doctors are properly mindful of the requirements of the act and do not carry out an abortion, by any method, when they consider that a child is capable of being born alive. as for the method used to perform an abortion, that too is a matter for the clinical judgment of the doctor involved having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.\\n           i am sure that my hon. friend will agree that we should not put ourselves in the position of clinicians, making a judgment about whether a child is capable of being born alive. it is for the courts to make a determination given the circumstances of a particular case and i would not wish to go further than that.\\n           my hon. friend asked about the supervision by the nursing staff and specifically about the nursing staff present at the termination. they were not alone and they were not unsupervised. two nurses were caring for the woman under the supervision of a sister. the doctor was called on delivery and attended quickly. he decided not to attempt to resuscitate the foetus and informed nursing staff to that effect. that was entirely a matter for his clinical judgment.\\n           the question of deaths on national health service premises where a recommendation for an inquest is turned down, is a matter for my right hon. friend the home secretary and i will see that my hon. friend's comments are brought to his attention.\\n           my hon. friend asked me why the baby's birth was not registered. the births and deaths registration act 1953 requires that any child born alive shall be registered and if the child subsequently dies the death also falls to be registered. where more than 12 months have transpired since a birth or a death the registrar general's authority is required for the registration. in considering any such application for registration after 12 months the registrar general needs to be satisfied that a registerable live birth or death has occurred. i understand that no such application has been made in this case.\\n           my hon. friend asked why the mother was not told for six months that the baby had lived. the doctor made a clinical judgment that this was not a live birth. in the circumstances staff decided to say nothing to the mother after the doctor made his decision.\\n           my hon. friend asked about policy on burial arrangements. at the time to which these events refer it was the health authority's general policy to offer ordinary burial for stillbirths but not for terminations of pregnancy. this policy has now been extended to cover situations in which the foetus is over 20 weeks' gestation and guidelines have been issued to staff that burial of the foetus should be offered to the mother in these circumstances.\\n           as regards the incineration of the foetus, this was the health authority's normal practice at the time, but, as i have already said, the procedure has now been changed. in cases over 20 weeks' gestation the foetus is now retained for 48 hours to allow for a request for burial.\\n           my hon. friend asked about the priest's contract. as she knows, the department of health does not intervene in the decisions of statutorily independent health authorities as they relate to questions of employment of individuals, and it would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment.\\n           my hon. friend asks for an assurance that the lessons from the carlisle baby case will be learned. it is clear that this was in many ways an exceptional case. it attracted considerable publicity and has been closely studied in the department, culminating in correspondence between the minister for health and the chairman of the authority, who assured us that the lessons of this very sad episode have been fully learned. the department will also take close account of this case in its future administration of the abortion act 1967.\\n           my hon. friend implied that the diagnosis of handicap in this case was wrong. this is a misunderstanding of the position under the abortion act 1967. the act requires that in cases such as this doctors should give an opinion, in good faith, that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped. this is a matter of clinical judgment and i have no reason to believe that the abortion act is not being properly observed on that point.\\n           i have gone into some detail, as far as the requirements of confidentiality and possible legal action allow, about the facts of the particular case which has given rise to concern. i hope that hon. members will accept my assurances and those of the minister for health, who has also looked into this matter, and of the home office that this case has in its various aspects been closely studied. on the general question of late abortions, my department will continue to ensure that the law and practice on this extremely difficult subject are administered as closely as possible. this is of course entirely without prejudice to any changes in the law on abortion which parliament may see fit to adopt in the future and which it would not be right for me to discuss in any detail in this adjournment debate. i am, however, grateful to my hon. friend for giving me the opportunity to set out the position.\\n           on the general question of abortions, let alone late abortions, it has of course been long-standing practice in the house for members to be able to express their own personal views on this issue. as regards that general policy, the government have been consistent and, like my hon. friend, i find this case extremely distressing and sad. whatever my own personal feelings, i see it as my duty tonight and in future correspondence with my hon. friend to answer the facts of the case so as better to inform not only my hon. friend but all hon. members. in answering those questions of fact, one's own personal views or opinions concerning the issues that have been raised are in no way implied.\\n           i undertake to write at length and to answer as comprehensively as possible the points raised by my hon. friend.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1989, 6, 8, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1989-06-08.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1989-06-08.9.1.6', 109,

tested, not just since 1967, but since the 1930s.\\n           i am disappointed that you, mr. speaker, did not choose the amendment relating to the exclusion of scotland from the operation of the bill, because scots law is very different from english law. it is a much more flexible system. there is no stated time limit. the effective time limit in scotland is 24 weeks because the law says that abortion would be a criminal offence in the case of a viable foetus. it is now medically accepted that a foetus is viable at the age of 24 weeks. i find it distressing that we are talking about time limits when the system in scotland is quite different and the concept of rigid time limits is quite alien. we have flexibility and that adds to the system.\\n           new clause 3 would amend the abortion act 1967 and attempts to do what the bill does not do. if the bill is implemented, it will impose a strict time limit with certain minor exceptions. i regard those exceptions as minor,

bill had no prospect in the house without a compromise.\\n           there is already a major difficulty in the operation of the 1967 act. it is well known that the response from the medical profession to the act is, to say the least, patchy. there are some parts of the country where the act is operating in the spirit in which it is passed and in accordance with the law. my own city of aberdeen has long experience of the operation of abortions as a public service to women in need, but there are other parts of the country where the law is operated less satisfactorily.\\n           for example, in glasgow, the law is operated perfectly satisfactorily in one part of the city, hut, if a woman is unfortunate to live in the other part, she has grave difficulty in obtaining an abortion, even if she satisfies the requirements of the 1967 act. the net result is that over 900 women a year have to leave glasgow to go south to england where, for the purpose of statistics, they are treated as foreign women. that subject has caused great excitement among those who support the bill. nine hundred women leave glasgow every year and go south for abortions because they cannot

application by the woman. without the benefit of new clause 4, new clause 3 may appear to be lacking something. obviously, it will need to be amended—presumably in another place—if it is accepted.\\n

spur to the medical profession to reconsider its practices. i commend to them those followed by the grampian health authority, which recognises that time limits are crucial. if a woman tells her general practitioner that she wishes to be considered for an abortion, that general practitioner follows a procedure established by that health authority. while the woman is still in his surgery, he must immediately contact the obstetrics dept of the local hospital, which must make an appointment over the telephone. the doctor does not have time to follow his usual procedure of writing to the

intend to refer later to similar documentation.\\n           the inadequacies in the national health service must be remedied, and that is the purpose of the new clause. a survey of general practitioners in the haringey area attempted to highlight those inadequacies. my knowledge of other areas, especially glasgow and birmingham, is that the survey's findings could equally well apply there. some 41 per cent. of general practitioners said that facilities for abortion within the nhs were inadequate and that there were huge delays in obtaining appointments. although 53 per cent. of those surveyed referred all women to the nhs, a significant number did not. the two most common reasons for that were women's preference—34 per cent.—and the probable delay in obtaining an appointment—a high figure of 20 per cent. the survey suggested that there was a large overlap between the 34 per cent. for women's preference and the 20 per cent. for fear of delays in hospitals providing early appointments.\\n           nearly half the general practitioners surveyed—47 per cent. of them—felt that there should be early abortion units, and i shall return to that point. a substantial proportion of them—67 per cent.—were concerned about pregnancy testing and similar issues. those are real and serious difficulties in the health service. as i said earlier, one of the major motivations behind the new clause is to encourage the health service to re-examine its practices.\\n           10.30 am\\n           i am well aware that the 1967 act embodies a conscience clause which permits certain health service employees to opt out. these days, there is a fondness for that expression on the government benches. in any event, i am concerned at the way in which that conscience clause can be used to militate against women who want or need an abortion. in certain areas there seems to be a preponderance of health service employees exercising their option to use the conscience clause. that fact is not advertised or publicly known, and a woman may be a long way into the system before she realises that it militates against the abortion she may need—not because she fails to comply with the terms of the 1967 act, but because there is an in-built prejudice or conscience against abortion in the first place. i suppose that i am really saying that the law is not being observed and recognised.\\n           new clause 3 will encourage general practitioners to look again at the conscience clause. if i had been given the time and the freedom to draft the amendments i wanted, i would have proposed a register of medical practitioners, which women could consult to identify those operating the conscience clause who held strong, and perfectly reasonable, beliefs against providing abortions. in that way, a woman would not be seeking the assistance of a practitioner whose beliefs entailed an in-built delay she could know nothing about. we must find a way of overcoming that problem, perhaps with the register i have mentioned. new clause 3 would provide a way out and a right of appeal.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 5, 6, 0, 0),

national health service. imagine the pressure that that will put upon national health service hospitals. imagine the pressure that it will put on gynaecological units. all hon. members are worried about waiting lists in our hospitals. this will extend the waiting list. ministers on the treasury bench, who are listening carefully to this debate, will be filled with horror at the idea that they will have to cope with a large number of people in nhs hospitals who would normally use the private sector. i hope that we shall reject this part of the bill and that conservative members will support

not within the nhs and is not registered to perform abortions. therefore, the woman will have to be driven in an ambulance some considerable distance to another hospital or clinic where two doctors or gynaecologists will have to certify that it is right that she should have an abortion. only then will it be performed there.

in the mind of the doctor who made them, and in terms of the law. it is open to question what the response of the profession would be, as its members would see many difficulties where clinical decisions or decisions taken on a clinical basis were subject to review by a group that was not made up of clinicians. that would raise the question whether the decisions by such a body could or would be implemented by a clinician who would have carry out the abortion.\\n           it is clear that nothing that a termination appeals tribunal could decide could compel the clinician to carry out an abortion against his wishes or judgment. i see the hon. member for caernarfon (mr. wigley) shaking his head. i am making these points only to illustrate some of the difficulties that would be entailed in developing this new clause into something that would be sustainable. i am not saying that i am convinced that those difficulties are not surmountable. i am saying that there has been little time

by the charitable sector that several health authorities use its clinics on an agency basis. in 1986, the last year for which we have figures, about 7,000 abortions were provided in that way. the private and charitable sector is tightly controlled by the dhss in all aspects of its work, including prices. the pregnancy advisory services carry out abortions for between £280 and £300. high staff-patient ratios and extensive resuscitation and other equipment demanded by the dhss mean that the actual cost of late abortions is much higher than the sum which is charged for them. late abortions that are carried out by abortion charities are subsidised by other operations. the cost of an early abortion is about £150 to £200. that is also the average cost in the nhs.\\n           i resent the remarks of the hon. member for mossley hill that gave a distorted impression of current british abortion legislation. in fact, it is one of the least liberal pieces of legislation to be

usually for medical conditions, foetal handicap or social and psychological reasons. such abortions are available up to 24 weeks.\\n           we believe that the best way to reduce late abortions is by improving the availability and acceptability of the nhs abortion services, increasing contraceptive provision for young people, offering realistic sex and family life education in schools and developing more sensitive techniques for the diagnosis of foetal abnormality. however, there will always be a need for abortion late in pregnancy for a minority of women. i stress that it is only a minority. it is vital that choice is retained. that is why we oppose the bill in its entirety. i oppose new clause 3. the bill was not changed fundamentally in committee and it still restricts the

dealing with women who required terminations. i am conscious of the pressing need of those women who are denied terminations within their own country. our system is not the most liberal within western

abortion under the terms of the abortion act 1967 or when there has been a delay in reaching a decision on whether a woman has grounds for an abortion. it appears that the new clause seeks to tackle the problem of delays for women seeking termination by creating a new right of appeal. the proposed provisions, however, are inadequate and ineffective.\\n           one of the amendments accepted in

they have not been selected has caused many of us great distress.\\n           the bill's provisions will create enormous difficulties for doctors. we hotly debated this issue in committee. is the hon. member for mossley hill suggesting that rape or incest becomes less traumatic once a woman has had her 18th birthday? if something is not desirable at the age of 18 or under, why should 18 and

request a termination until late in pregnancy? should those be matters for appeal through the procedures spelt out in new clause 3? it is important that we receive answers to those questions.\\n           in 1967, the original medical termination of pregnancy bill included rape as one of the grounds for abortion. however, that was subsequently removed because it was argued that it placed doctors in an invidious position. the amendment tabled by the hon. member for maidstone (miss widdecombe) would place doctors in a similar position. doctors would be able to make a decision only on a woman's mental or physical state. it was considered appropriate to deal with such difficult cases under the mental health provisions. i suggest that the mental health act 1983 has worked well in that respect because it has given doctors sufficient flexibility to deal with difficult circumstances.\\n           i remind the house that the select committee reporting on the infant life (preservation) bill stated: the committee would not wish to see any impediment placed in the way of the victim of rape and incest who is desirous of terminating her pregancy. that highlights the problems with the abortion (amendment) bill as it stands, as it removes the flexibility of the law to deal with those distressing cases. that is one reason why i must oppose new clause 3.\\n           it is the intention of new clause 3 to ensure that a woman who is unreasonably delayed by administrative or other factors can receive an abortion after the time limit at the beginning of the 18th week. if that is the intention, it is not made sufficiently clear, and new clause 3 fails to achieve that objective. as the new clause is drafted, it does not permit an abortion to be performed after the beginning of the 18th week, even if the appeals tribunal finds in the woman's favour and agrees that she has been delayed unnecessarily. a victim of rape or incest may find herself in that position.\\n           new clause 3 is an enabling provision which grants the secretary of state for social services the power to set up the tribunal. however, it gives no specification of the tribunal's nature or powers. that means that the detail of how the tribunal would operate would not be open to debate in the house. the new clause contains no provision for any regulations drawn up by the secretary of state to be brought before the house as a statutory instrument which would be subject to annulment by resolution of either house, and important points of principle would therefore be determined by the secretary of state without the opportunity to challenge them.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 5, 6, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-05-06.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-05-06.4.3.105', 54, 'uk.m.10540', 'uk.p.Lab', 1,

out if it upheld the woman\\'s appeal? if so, what sanction would it have if a medical practitioner refused to carry out the operation? what powers would it have if it found in a woman\\'s favour after the beginning of the 18th week? would it have powers to compensate a woman who had been delayed beyond the statutory time limit and had to continue her pregnancy, although she had grounds for an abortion under the 1967 act?\\n           the new clause does not specify a period within which the appeal must be heard. is it seven days, seven weeks or seven months? unless there is a clear requirement for a tribunal to meet and hear the appeal quickly, the right to appeal in itself will be totally meaningless.\\n           would additional resources—i look to the ministers here—be available to the health authorities to ensure that the appeals procedure was speedy and efficient? given the difficulty of getting any additional resources out of conservative members, there may be some reason to doubt that such resources would be forthcoming.\\n           the concept of a tribunal procedure would create yet more bureaucracy for women seeking abortions. it would be an additional ordeal for such women to have to face a tribunal. would there be provision for them to be represented, and in what way? would they have to be medically examined by members of the tribunal? who would the members of the tribunal be, and how would they be selected? what would be the position of the doctors who had refused the abortion, or any others who were responsible for delay? would lack of resources be a defence if the woman had not had the termination carried out because of a shortage of beds or medical personnel?\\n           while i am sure that the intention of my hon. friend the member for aberdeen, south is to try to help women by minimising unnecessary delays for those seeking an abortion, i suggest that the new clause is inadequate as drafted, and would create a new and unwieldy procedure which would work against women\\'s interests.\\n           there is a minor drafting point. the new clause refers in subsection (1) to an area health board and in subsection (2) to an area health authority, although both appear to refer to the same body. in fact, there are now district health authorities in england and wales—i am sorry to say that there is no longer any regional hospital board—and health boards in scotland, so we have a less democratic health service in wales than in the rest of the country. both should be included in both subsections if the power is to extend to england, wales and scotland.\\n           again, i ask hon. members on both sides of the house to consider their position very carefully before they go through the lobbies today. after hearing the arguments spelt out in committee by the hon. member for mossley hill and his colleagues, it is our belief that their real intention is not to improve on the 1967 act. their true intention is to repeal the 1967 act in its entirety. it would have been honourable for them to have said today, \"that is our real intention. we do not want to improve on the act. we want it to be scrapped

every conceivable aspect of the bill, as amended by its sponsors. we maintained consistently on second reading and in committee that there was no substantiated evidence that the abortion act 1967 is being abused or misused by women or doctors. most importantly, we emphasised that all the evidence shows that the upper time limit of 28 weeks is treated with the greatest of respect by women and by doctors in england and wales, and by women and doctors in scotland, where there is effectively no upper time limit and fewer late abortions are performed than in england and wales. i have moved amendment no. 2, to allow abortions up to 26 weeks. i have an amendment down for 27 weeks, as i did on the corrie bill, as that is the number of weeks that is nearest to 28. one has to remember that as doctors take off two or four weeks, effectively, the period is less than 26 weeks anyway.\\n           we probed every aspect of the bill, as amended, while we maintained our position that no change in the upper limit was required and that the time limit from the beginning of the 18 weeks was unacceptable. it became clear during the course of our discussions that the sponsors of the bill take an absolutist and fundamentalist line on abortion. on innumerable occasions, each one of them has reiterated that he or she is opposed to all abortions and is willing to barter with women's bodies and gamble with children's lives to try to maximise support for the bill and inflict a substantial blow on the 1967 act, which has given women and doctors 20 years of safe and legal operations.\\n           in choosing the arbitrary time limit from the beginning of 18 weeks, the sponsors of the bill have sought to set the terms of the debate so that other equally unacceptable time limits have been opposed as compromises, and that their own restrictive amendments to the bill—on foetal abnormalities, under-18 rape and incest—can be posed as concessions. i recall the way that the under-18 rape amendment, which is now in the bill, was moved. i am sure that my hon. friends who were on the committee will recall that it was moved as a concession. i think that it was appalling to divide young women in that way by introducing an arbitrary period of 18 weeks.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 5, 6, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-05-06.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-05-06.4.5.7', 84,

for various reasons, deny a woman an abortion when she is entitled to have one. some refuse even to pass her on to a doctor who will give her proper advice.\\n           in speaking to the 26-week amendment i want to dispel the belief that some hon. members may have that it represents a compromise or a concession. any legal time limit is, in practice, taken by doctors to be a minimum of two weeks less due to difficulties in estimating gestational age and fears of prosecution that might result from an incorrect estimate. my hon. friend will recall that there was a short debate in committee on the difficulties in estimating gestational age. our arguments were rejected. i recall what was said by the hon. member for maidstone (miss widdecombe) in rejecting the amendment. she claimed that it would bring the time limit to 20 weeks rather than to leave it at 18, which is what she wanted. that was further confirmation that she wants very early abortions at the end of 17 weeks.\\n           doctors' fear of prosecution can only have been grossly increased by the way in which the campaign has been waged both inside and outside the house. we are discussing time limits of 15 weeks, 18 weeks, 20 weeks, 22 weeks and 24 weeks. this is how time limits of 17 weeks, 20 weeks, 24 weeks and 26 weeks are being put into practice. if we remove two weeks from all the numbers of

hill (mr. alton) has chosen.\\n           i do not wish to digress, but two of my hon. friends and i tabled an amendment to introduce self-referral for woman up to the 12th week of pregnancy—that is what happens on the continent. [an hon. member: \"abortion on demand?\"] it is not abortion on demand. a doctor must be present when an abortion is carried out. i hope that the hon. gentleman is riot suggesting that women should do it themselves. in effect, if the doctor agrees, it is abortion on request. in most european countries that is what happens. a woman may have an abortion up to the 12th week. that has resulted in reducing the rate of abortion because women find it easier to obtain one, and the health service provision there makes this possible.\\n           whatever the amendments may say, effectively we are talking about time limits that are two weeks below those listed. that point has been made strongly by the british pregnancy advisory service, which has written to all members of the house and is acknowledged—even by the hon. member for mossley hill—to be an organisation of integrity. the bpas states that it will ban abortions under the provisions of the 1967 act at 15 weeks if the time limits remains at the beginning of the 18th week of pregnancy, as suggested in the bill.\\n           it goes on to say that to ensure that they do not break the law they will work to 20 weeks for a 22-week limit and 22 weeks for a 24-week limit. this would mean that 17,000 women, using 1986 figures, will be denied an abortion and will be forced to continue with a pregnancy which could previously have been carried out legally and safely. that is what the bpas has been forced to do. it is important at this stage to dispel the myth that has been created that late back-street abortions were not and therefore will not now be a problem.\\n           we must remember that it took some years before women, general practitioners and consultants learnt fully about the abortion rights that came into force in 1968. at that time no funds were allocated to the nhs to set up an abortion service.\\n           if we consider the years from 1968 we find that deaths continued not only from illegal abortions, but from illegal-late abortions. from 1970 to 1972, 38 women died from illegal abortions: three at 20 weeks; two at 26 weeks; one at 27 weeks——\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 5, 6, 0,

take up to four weeks to obtain. in some cases, the tests have to be repeated. a friend of mine had an amniocentesis test at 16 weeks. she waited three weeks and then had to have another before it could be confirmed that she was carrying an abnormal foetus. she eventually had an abortion at 22 weeks.\\n           having had an amniocentesis test, a woman would have reached 20 weeks before the results of the first test were known. where a second test is required, the 24-week time limit would provide the necessary leeway for an abortion to be carried out under the provisions of the abortion

to those who are affected, and they should have the benefit of choice, albeit a limited choice under the 1967 act. that is why that act should be left intact.\\n           a time limit of anything less than 26 weeks—which, in effect, is 24 weeks—would write off the interests of real, living women and their children in favour of the interests of an unviable foetus. we must make a decision today, and i hope that it will be the right one. from what the sponsors of the bill said in committee, i understand that they intend further attacks on the 1967 act. that has also been made plain this morning. people will be forced to the defensive. i put down a marker that i will not be forced to the defensive—i shall feel forced to the offensive.\\n           we must study the good practices of those european countries that have self-referral. we must ensure that the 1967 act is responsive to need in every possible way, without going beyond the bounds of legality. we must ensure that the nhs responds adequately in every part of britain. for example, it responds in the north but not in the west midlands. there must be decent, proper sex education at school and a properly funded family planning service. funds should be made available for research into contraception so that women do not take the pill and then find, as some do, that it does not suit them, or that being fitted with an inter-uterine device does not do the trick. all those measures would make women safer. there is a large failure rate in contraception so it is no use people thinking that women are simply being careless. we must ensure genuine choice for women.\\n           hon. members who want to end abortion will achieve only a return to back-street abortion. those of us who support the 1967 act want improvements so that there are safe and legal abortions, with back-up facilities, that allow women to live their lives with dignity and independence.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 5, 6, 0, 0),

abortions to the 18th week of pregnancy, but i made plain on second reading the fact that i was ready to join the search for a formula that would safeguard the position of the woman who might be bearing a child suffering from severe abnormality, and on whom tests to establish the facts had not been completed by the 18th week of her pregnancy.\\n           that aspect was considered in detail in committee and i moved an amendment that now forms part of the bill. that was a genuine attempt by my hon. friends and myself to keep faith with the house. a number of reservations have been aired, even by supporters of the bill and it is necessary to keep faith with the house. the bill that we now seek to amend further is not the bill to which the house gave a substantial majority on second

earlier, probably.\\n           the bill concerns itself with the scandal of abortions for social reasons or for convenience. i remind the house that abortions under the social cause constitute the vast majority of abortions performed after 18 weeks. no less than 92 per cent. of all late abortions are carried out on foetuses, which, if they were permitted to be born, would be perfectly normal and healthy. many of us are appalled that under the 1967 act, 2·6 million foetuses had been destroyed by 1986. if they had been allowed to be born, most of them would have grown into healthy and

pregnancy. that was several years ago and the government made various administrative changes in the light of that recommendation—no doubt the minister will amplify this—which have meant that since

weeks. that committee of inquiry took place some years ago. the most recent study was conducted not by this house, but by a select committee of another place. only a few weeks ago that committee, having deliberated on a bill to amend the infant life (preservation) act 1929, concluded that the limit should be 24 weeks.\\n           the third study of this matter was by a committee that included representatives of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, the british paediatric association, the royal college of general practitioners, the royal college of midwives, the british medical association and the department of health and social security. that very important committee published a report in august 1985 on foetal viability and clinical practice. its recommendation was clear. it said that the gestational age after which a foetus is considered viable should be changed from the present limit of 28 weeks to 24 weeks of gestation.\\n           the committee continued: a strong argument which persuaded the committee against recommending a gestational age that is set too low, is the certainty that fear ignorance and administrative delays will continue to be a major reason for late attendance for termination of pregnancy. these late attenders are usually the women in greatest need of help—the very young and socially deprived. that was not a committee of social workers. it was a highly expert medical committee that recommended to parliament what should be the state of the law. we would be wise to consider its opinions.\\n           just before the bill\\'s second reading, the viability committee of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists circulated a statement reiterating the royal college\\'s view that there should be a 24-week limit. i am sorry that the right hon. member for castle point (sir b. braine) has left his seat, because this is an important argument that is contrary to his. the viability committee said: twenty-four weeks gestation marks a … boundary below which the lungs are not expected to function. a reduction to 18 weeks\"— or for that matter any other limit— has no scientific basis and would discriminate against women who may be most in need. on future medical advance, the committee said: further medical expertise will increase survival rates rather than lower the age at which survival is possible. for those reasons the house would be wise to accept an amendment to the 1967 legislation, creating a bar at 24 weeks of pregnancy. remembering the point made by the hon. member for barking (ms. richardson) that the medical profession always operates within a two-week limit of safety, a legal statement that abortion may not take place beyond the 24th week will ensure that it will not happen after the 22nd week.\\n           i say bluntly to my hon. friend the member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton) and to other hon. members who support the bill that, if they were honest, they would say that there is no ethical difference between an abortion at 10 weeks, 17 weeks or 24 weeks. from their standpoint, the alternatives are all equally wrong. those of us who do not share that view have the responsibility of determining what the boundary of the criminal law should be.\\n           i do not believe that any of the other amendments have any logical argument behind them. the 24-week amendment has the validity of scientific opinion and, therefore, of public opinion behind it. by passing it into legislation we should be keeping open the option created in 1967 for women and their medical advisers to secure safe and legal termination of pregnancy as the lesser of two evils in any given situation in which they decide to do that. that is what the house would be wise to vote

crushing of the baby\\'s skull, the breaking of its spine and its removal piece by piece, and it is a barbaric, degrading and corrupting practice to allow in our country. prostaglandins require the

about the impact of the bill on the current arrangements for abortion that are laid down in the 1967 act. this picks up the point made by the hon. member for caernarfon (mr. wigley). it is indisputable—indeed, it is the purpose—that there would be some reduction in the number of abortions that could be carried out legally. the department estimates that at least 7,630 fewer abortions would have been carried out in england and wales in 1986 if the bill as it stands had been in force. about half the women affected would have been non-residents and the remaining abortions—for very young women or those in much later life which might go ahead at present in appropriate circumstances—would have been prohibited. as i said on second reading, out of a total of 8,276 abortions in england and wales in 1986 at a gestational age of 18 weeks or over, more than one third were to women under 20 and about 3 per cent. were to women aged 40 and over.\\n           the hon. member for caernarfon asked about wording in the bill. it is undeniably a matter of some uncertainty how doctors and others would interpret the bill. it is possible that the exemption for foetal handicap, which is more tightly drawn than the present ground 4, could mean that fewer abortions would be carried out in that category. the difficulty and part of the uncertainty arises from the fact that the medical technology involved is not sufficiently refined to make it possible to foretell with certainty the degree of disability that a child would have after birth. against that background, i cannot give the house a clear-cut or definite statement about the precise consequences of the change. it would be irresponsible of me to pretend that i could do that and i shall not seek to do so.\\n        ',

the house on behalf of the hon. member for dunbartonshire, east (mrs. bain), who is a sponsor of the bill and who has had to go to scotland for the funeral of a close relative. however, she hopes to be back in the chamber before the end of the debate.\\n           i rise with some trepidation to move the second reading of the bill, which seeks to amend the law on abortion as embodied in the 1967 act. no hon. member can be under any illusions about the passions aroused by this subject. indeed, i confess to having them in some measure myself. i hope that the proposals in the bill will receive a wide measure of support in the house and outside. i am encouraged in my task by two facts—first by the evidence of the mounting disquiet that there is in the house about the workings of the 1967 act. that disquiet has steadily increased. in 1967 only 29 hon. members voted against the second reading of that bill. in 1970, 263 hon. members called for an official inquiry into abortion. in 1976, 313 hon. members voted to reappoint the select committee on whose recommendations the bill is based. those results mirror the disquiet which is found in the country at large.\\n           secondly, i am seeking to legislate in response to the recommendations of a select committee of this house. to remove any ambiguity i say at once that if i have strayed beyond the recommendations of that select committee in any respect, that is entirely inadvertent. there may be errors of drafting, but they are not intentional. any errors can be remedied in committee.\\n           the house will recollect that the abortion (amendment) bill was introduced by the hon. member for glasgow, pollock (mr. white) on 27th november 1974. that bill received its second reading on 7th february 1975 by 203 votes to 88. the bill was then referred to a select committee without a vote. the members of the committee were nominated by vote on 26th february. the bill failed to complete all its stages before the end of the session and therefore lapsed. following a debate in the house on 9th february 1976, in the last session, the committee was re-established with the same membership.\\n           during the second reading debate the then minister of state, the right hon. member for plymouth, devonport (dr. owen), said: i have said that this is not a delaying device. … the truth is that it is more likely to reach the statute book more quickly through adopting the proposed procedure. not only is a pre-legislation select committee a good principle, but it is a sensible way in which to proceed in a difficult area. when the select committee reports, it will be open to hon. members to put forward legislation in the normal way or for the government to consider whether they themselves should put forward legislation.\"— [official report, 7th february 1975; vol. 885, c. 1795.] when winding up the debate and addressing the minister my hon. friend the member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine) said: we would not expect nor would we tolerate, any undue delay in the government\\'s implementing any urgent recommendations the committee might feel disposed to make to check present abuses.\"— [official report, 7th february 1975, vol. 885, c. 1853–4.] the minister indicated assent.\\n           it is said that the select committee\\'s report is biased because certain members refused to take part in its work during the last session. however, a careful study of its proceedings will show that this is a false charge. the members of the committee can answer for themselves during today\\'s debate. personally, i have little sympathy with those who opt out of something and then complain about the result— particularly as the result does not include a recommendation on the grounds for abortion, which, as i understand it, was the principal fear of those particular hon. members.\\n           i have used my place in the ballot to introduce the bill because the government\\'s current legislative programme—anyway until recently—precluded any consideration of the select committee\\'s report during this session. i beg leave to doubt whether next session will be any better, as the general election approaches. thus from the time that the hon. member for pollok first moved his bill at the end of 1974, four years would elapse before anything could take place on the recommendations that were included in his bill.\\n           i feel that i must turn, albeit briefly, to the secretary of state\\'s statement of 10th february. this was a curious statement, to say the least, because it appeared to pass judgment on my bill, which had not been published at the time, and on the deliberations of the select committee, and in a sense to anticipate the decision to which the house will come today.\\n           when i first announced my intention of bringing in this bill, i approached the department of health and social security. i was courteously received by the minister of state and his officials, who said at that time, quite rightly, that this was a house of commons matter and that they would reserve their position until the debate took place. i complain that the next thing i heard was a telepone call from the guardian asking me for a comment on the open letter that the secretary of state had addressed to the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel).\\n           i must say that i find that statement misleading in a number of respects. first, it is misleading on the abortion figures themselves. the incidence of abortion may have fallen purely in numerical terms, but it has risen as a percentage of live births, which is the true statistic in my view. if i use the exact dates mentioned in the secretary of state\\'s statement and figures that have been supplied to me by the library of the house of commons only three days ago, i find that, overall, abortions per 1,000 live births were 142 in 1972, 175 in 1974, and 177 in both the years 1975 and 1976. that seems to me to be a plateau and not a fall.\\n           when we turn to the younger age groups we find that for the ages of 20 to 24 the rate has risen from 108 in 1972 to 140 in 1975. in the under-20 age group the position is far more dramatic the rate having risen from 257 in 1972 to 391 in 1975. moreover, the illegitimacy rate, which is also mentioned in the secretary of state\\'s statement, was 9·1 per cent. in 1975, which is the highest recorded figure ever. i submit that these figures give a totally contrary impression to that contained in the secretary of state\\'s statement.\\n           then again, the secretary of state says that abuses have been \"largely eradicated\" in the private sector. if even a quarter of what i have been told since i embarked upon this task is true, let alone what the select committee was told, there is still a great deal to be done to remedy these abuses.\\n           the secretary of state also mentions counselling. this is indeed to be recommended and warmly supported. but is it not difficult, to say the least, for counselling to be truly dispassionate on this particular subject when the counsellors themselves may have an interest, financial or otherwise, in the eventual abortion? surely the important thing is that the woman should be helped to come to the right decision and that she should not be pressurised in any way whatever.\\n           the secretary of state also says that the conscience clause is working satisfactorily. my evidence and a great deal of the evidence that was given to the select committee suggests that that is just not true.\\n           finally, i must remark to the minister of state—more in sorrow than in anger— that it appears to take the introduction of a bill by a private member or the report of a select committee of this house to produce any action on this subject at all. i put it to the house that this does not necessarily prove the need for legislation but it makes a very good case for it. i am extremely doubtful whether administrative measures alone can solve these abuses.\\n           thus in essence my bill seeks to remove the worst exploitation of women in the private sector, to afford greater protection to doctors and nurses in the performance of their tasks and to strengthen the law in certain other respects.\\n           one effect of the bill which may not be so readily appreciated is that it gives the opportunity to the department to institute better arrangements for the after-care of women both as regards the after-effects of the operation itself and, secondly, in relation to subsequent pregnancies. this is a very important aspect indeed.\\n           during the course of my researches for the bill i have been particularly struck by the work that has been carried out in this country and abroad on the aftereffects of abortion. the house will remember that the lane committee itself was very concerned about this point. indeed, i know that this concern is shared by even the most devoted advocates of easier abortion. opinions differ on the work that has already been done, but most are agreed on the importance of after-care and the need for further research.\\n           in this connection it is very significant that countries such as hungary, czechoslovakia, bulgaria, romania and the soviet union—although other countries have liberalised their law in the last 10 years—have tightened up their law in the last 10 years, and they were among those countries in which abortion was most freely available and uncontrolled.\\n           i accept entirely that it is wrong to muddle up this aspect with the more fundamental arguments in connection with abortion itself. all i am saying is that the bill provides a framework under which after-care can be extended in the private sector, so that, together with the administrative reforms undertaken within the national health service, progress can be made towards reducing these highly detrimental effects.\\n           the house will observe that the select committee made no recommendations in relation to the criteria or the grounds for abortion. it said simply, in paragraph 26 of its report, a decision must be left to the individual consciences of members. i must confess that this part of the problem has given me more concern than any other, but i have taken the view, rightly or wrongly, that it would be inappropriate to include the criteria in the bill, and this was the agreement to which i came with my sponsors. i cannot say—no member could—how the bill may be amended in committee, but if that is the case, then the house will have another opportunity to decide the matter at a later date.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25,

some weighty medical evidence, in favour of this point.\\n           it is generally accepted by now that termination should not be performed after the age at which the child is capable of surviving outside the womb. the present upper limit is 28 weeks. the select committee took evidence from a number of bodies and it is generally agreed that the upper limit should be less than 28 weeks but not all agree—i concede this point—on what the time limit should be. i shall not weary the house with the evidence i have, but the recommendations vary between 20 and 24 weeks, with a preference for the former. for these reasons, the committee accepted 20 weeks as the upper limit subject to the provisions i have mentioned.\\n           the clause includes a subsection which allows the secretary of

than five years' standing. secondly, neither of the doctors authorising the abortion should be associated with or able to obtain financial benefit from the clinic or nursing home carrying out the abortion.\\n           the weight of medical evidence to the select committee came down in favour of a period varying between three to five years for one of the doctors. the committee was obviously influenced by the qualifications required under the mental health act 1959 and the cremation act 1962. i emphasise that this clause does not mean that a woman's doctor who is newly qualified would be prevented from being involved in the decision. if the woman's own doctor were of less than five years' standing it would simply mean that the second doctor would have to have had longer experience.\\n           the select committee also formed the opinion that it would give some reassurance over the working of the 1967 act if provisions were made to ensure that two medical practitioners acted independently of each other. these factors give rise to the provisions of clause 2.\\n           abuses of the law will be less likely the more the scope for profit making is reduced and, in particular, the decision whether to abort can be influenced by the prospect of financial gain, direct or indirect.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'],

given to her general practitioner, the surgeon is absolved from this requirement providing that the steps have been taken in accordance with the regulations made by the secretary of state.\\n           i turn to clause 4. the committee's recommendation contained in paragraph 91 of its report has been overtaken by events, namely paragraph 31 of schedule 6 to the criminal law act, which sets the penalty at £1,000 in any event. i have therefore included only that part of the committee's recommendation which favoured extending the time limit for summary proceedings to three years from the commission of the offence. the present time limit is six months and is too short in view of the difficulty of the collection and presentation of evidence.\\n           clause 5 strengthens the position of those who have a conscientious objection to participation in abortion operations. i regard this as a very important clause, although obviously, as the committee pointed out, this question is largely a matter for administrative action but, as with so much else in this bill, it is necessary to lay down guidelines. the house will know that a number of doctors and nurses have been placed in positions of considerable difficulty and distress as a result of their beliefs. the clause seeks to emphasise their right to conscientious objection on religious, ethical or other grounds, and that in court proceedings the burden of proof of conscientious objection need not rest upon the person claiming it. during the course of preparation on the bill, i received more evidence and applications on this point than on any other.\\n           i turn now to what i believe to be the most important clauses of the bill, clauses 6 and 7. i remind the house that the committee stated that legislation should be introduced to require all referral agencies, pregnancy advisory bureaux and pregnancy testing agencies which charge fees to be licensed by the secretary of state and subsequently legislation should oblige the secretary of state to make regulations by statutory instrument to license and control places used for giving treatment for the termination of pregnancy, referral agencies, pregnancy advisory bureaux and pregnancy testing agencies which charge fees.\\n           it would have been open for me to propose two short clauses giving these powers to the secretary of state. it is my view, and i hope that i shall carry the house with me, that it would be invidious, both to the secretary of state and to the house, if no guidance were given to the secretary of state about the conditions to be imposed for the grant of a licence or for the content of the regulations. i just ask hon. members to consider the difficulties of questioning a future secretary of state on this point. that minister will be perfectly entitled to reply that he had given a licence and that was that. i believe that i have interpreted correctly the committee's wishes on this point. in the course of the debate we shall be able to make their position clear.\\n           in addition, previous legislation, in particular the nursing homes act 1975, has laid down conditions and it seems sensible to follow that example. the house will recall that the previous secretary of state—the right hon. member for blackburn (mrs. castle)—accepted an interim recommendation of the select committee to provide lists of agencies and bureaux considered satisfactory, and to make approval of places for the purpose of section 1 of the 1967 act conditional on their non-acceptance of patients referred by unlisted agencies and bureaux. this list has now been published by the present secretary of state.\\n           while this was a step in the right direction, the committee accepted evidence that legislation should be introduced to give the secretary of state control over these organisations. for the purposes of definition, i have used the same definitions for referral agencies and bureaux as was included in paragraph 451 of the lane report and a corresponding definition for pregnancy testing agencies.\\n           several points have been put to me in connection with the clause. the first is that the present system of indirect control is preferable to the direct control envisaged in the bill. the committee was particularly impressed by the evidence from the department which said, on 14th april 1975: we would welcome legislation to regulate referral and advisory services—the main gap in our powers which was identified by the lane committee is in relation to the pregnancy advisory bureaux and the referral agencies, that is an area in which we would welcome legislation. the second point made to me is that these arrangements are far too inflexible and that it is better to leave the matter of licensing entirely to the secretary of state. this puts the secretary or state in a difficult and invidious position in carrying out what everyone agrees is a difficult task. it is necessary to be specific in the conditions laid down. moreover, the secretary of state would have wide residual powers to impose any additional requirement if he saw fit.\\n           thirdly, it has been represented to me by the charities operating in this area that the provision in subsection (4) ( e ) would gravely inhibit their work. the lane committee itself recognised that the private sector must be treated as a whole and that registration as a charity is not an appropriate criterion for assessing the medical aspects of referral or treatment services or any abuses connected therewith. i am convinced that the component parts of these charities, the clinics and the referral agencies, can stand on their own feet financially, particularly in view of the fact that the latter are now undertaking other work in the birth control field. but be that as it may, i believe that it is quite impossible—we have considered this matter very carefully; it may be possible to suggest an amendment in committee—to divide the various parts of the private sector.\\n           i acknowledge frankly that these two clauses have been the most difficult ones in the bill to draft and i do not pretend that they are perfect. all i am saying is that they make an attempt to do what the select committee asked to be done, and they can of course be further considered in committee.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977,

lane committee and is a woman of considerable influence. the letter was also signed by a large number of professors of gynaecology, including two in glasgow, one in dundee, and others from teaching hospitals in oxford, cambridge and many other parts of the country.\\n           i shall quote from some sections of this letter, particularly those that refer specifically to the lane committee: the lane committee reported in 1974 after nearly three years of thorough investigation and found that the abortion act had proved its value in relieving human suffering. we agree with the findings of this carefully researched report which has never been debated in parliament. that was one of the major objections to the amending bill introduced by my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white)—it was brought forward before the lane committee had reported. that committee's report contained a great deal of very carefully researched evidence that would have helped hon. members to arrive at a decision. the letter goes on: those abuses which occurred shortly after the inception of the bill have now largely been overcome. nevertheless we recognise that there are still problems within the working of the act that require attention. the most important of these concerns the question of regional variations in the availability of abortion facilities within the health service … mr. benyon's bill is based on the recommendations of a truncated select committee on abortion whose members were widely known to be in favour of restrictive abortion policies. like the committee, he does not address himself to the real issues that affect patients and their doctors. his bill, if ever enacted, would make very much more difficult the work of reputable agencies and particularly the two major charities which have had to shoulder so much of the burden in birmingham and other cities. the bill would infringe civil liberties by allowing the police access to confidential medical records for no foreseeable practical gain. gynaecologists and other doctors would find themselves increasingly harassed and clinical freedom would be threatened. implementation of this unnecessary bill would result in the very reverse of what its supporters claim for it. that is the answer to what the hon. member for buckingham has said, and i hope that the house will have due regard and give considerable weight to that letter which was received by the prime minister only two days ago.\\n           i agree with the hon. member for tiverton (mr. maxwell-hyslop) who pointed out to his hon. friend that the bill is badly drafted and that he apparently does not understand the implications of his own bill. it is badly drafted, it is ill thought out and it will have the most appalling effect if it ever becomes law. it is a denial of the rights of a woman to decide how many children to have and when she will bear them, and the thing that i find equally objectionable is that it displays complete mistrust of the medical profession in a way that is truly astonishing.\\n           the author of the bill can claim no measure of public support. since the 1967 act was introduced there has been no clamour for a measure such as this either among the public as a whole or among doctors. it is based on an unbalanced report from an unbalanced select committee composed of hon. members who were and still are entirely opposed to the 1967 act. a number of hon. members, including the sponsors of the 1967 act and representatives of the two main parties, withdrew from that select committee because they were not prepared to be associated with its report.\\n           i assume that the hon. member had considerable difficulty in drafting his bill—he admitted as much. that is why the bill appeared rather late. also he has been unable to persuade a single leading figure from his own front bench to sponsor the bill. in the notice that he gave in december he had listed the right hon. member for

the bill does nothing at all to deal with the abuse referred to in the doctors' letter—namely, that it constitutes an abuse of the 1967 act since women in this country do not have the same access to terminations in nhs hospitals. why should women in the west midlands, merseyside and yorkshire have so much difficulty in obtaining legal abortions on the nhs? why should reactionary consultants refuse to help women with legal grounds under the act? this is an abuse, and the hon. gentleman wants to make it easier for consultants to further that abuse.\\n           clearly, the minister should be taking steps to see that enough doctors are appointed in those regions to make it unnecessary for women to have to travel away from home either to areas in the national health service or to seek help in the private sector. it is this restriction that drives women into the private sector.\\n           the charitable clinics and nursing homes were set up because of this attitude of the reactionary chauvinist doctors to whom i have referred. those who deny relief are the very ones who drive women into the private sector. yet it is the highly responsible skilled and efficient private sector, namely the charitable clinics and advisory bureaux, that this bill seeks to smother in a welter of crazy bureaucracy, involving umpteen inspectors, police and others to administer its provisions. that is rather extraordinary from a representative of the conservative party, most of whose members complain about the level of public expenditure. this bill will certainly add to that level of expenditure.\\n           to show his impartiality, the hon. gentleman takes a mighty swipe not only at women but at doctors. he mistrusts them and says that they cannot be trusted if they are working together in general practice or in clinics or nursing homes—and, as the hon. member for tiverton pointed out, this would also apply to doctors working together in hospitals.\\n           the hon. gentleman does not make it clear what he means by his provision dealing with the question of doctors who can authorise abortions. is he saying that in a hospital the consultant in the department would not be able to get his houseman to sign the certificate?—what does he expect them to do? is he saying that two doctors in practice together shall not be able to sign the certificate? if he says that, he is implying that there is a great deal of abuse of the act among reputable members of the medical profession. i do not believe that, nor did the hon. gentleman bring forward a shred of evidence to show that it is so.\\n           the bill also provides that at least one of the doctors shall be qualified for at least five years. that is a nonsense. five years as what? it does not say that such a person should have been working for five years as a gynaecologist or an obstetrician. as the bill is drafted, it means that a doctor working for five years as a geriatrician, ent surgeon, a genitourinary surgeon could take part in this procedure. i hope that is not what the hon. gentleman intends, but that is what his bill could mean. i do not think the house would wish to support this.\\n           the other objectionable part of the bill, which again shows the hon. gentleman's mistrust of members of the medical profession, is that an anonymous witness can lay evidence with the police and the unfortunate doctor could have the threat of legal action hanging over his head for three years. it also means that women could be called to give evidence where they may feel very reluctant to do so because they would not want their own personal details and information brought forward in a court of law. one can see that the clause would put an enormous weapon into the hands of all those who oppose abortions to lay evidence against doctors who they claim had too liberal a view of abortion, to send complaints to the police, and to insist that the procedures were brought against the doctor, thus ruining his reputation and taking away his livelihood.\\n           the other objectionable aspect that i find insupportable is that the bill would give power to the police to enter nursing homes, advisory bureaux giving advice on abortion procedures, and to enter and take photographic evidence not only of records in connection with a specific complaint in a patient's case involving alleged illegality, but of general records, and thus would be able to obtain information from whole pages of names kept in the clinics. they would be able to use that against the doctor concerned.\\n           that is an infringement of the civil liberties and rights of doctors. it is an infringement of confidentiality between doctors and patients going far beyond anything that obtains in this country at present. that must be objectionable to hon. members on both sides of the house, whatever their views.\\n           these aspects of the bill surely are sufficient for us to throw it out. the attempt to question what procedures doctors adopt does not appear in any other area of medical activity. why should it he laid down in this area when it is usual procedure?\\n           the select committee had a great deal of evidence from members of the medical profession. it took evidence from the british medical association, the royal college of psychiatrists, the royal college of pathologists, the royal college of general practitioners, the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, the royal college of physicians in edinburgh, the association of anaesthetists, the royal college of midwives, and the family planning association. all without exception support the 1967 act. all the medical evidence from those weighty professional bodies was against the proposals of the previous bill which the select committee was examining. it was only in a very small degree that the royal college of midwives criticised it and suggested that abortion work should be separated from gynaecological departments for various reasons, but it was not opposed to the 1967 act. where is the weighty evidence that supports the report of the select committee, or the views put forward by the hon. gentleman?\\n           the hon. gentleman also mentioned the legislation introduced in many countries which, he said, supported his view. the situation is that where any country has introduced legislation in the past few years, certainly since 1966–67, it has always introduced a liberal act. in australia, france, germany and even in italy, it is now possible—or shortly will be, because the bill has gone through the italian chamber of deputies—for women to get terminations up to the thirteenth week. what the hon. gentleman is doing by bringing forward his bill, is making it more difficult for women to get abortions, and this may drive them abroad to get abortions there. it will be a reverse of the situation in earlier years, because british women may well have to go to italy for abortions. it is an interesting situation.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.39', 5, 'uk.m.10649',

their consciences. my task, as one of the ministers responsible for the operation of the 1967 act, is to put before the house the facts which are relevant to the issues being discussed and which are in the possession of the government.\\n           i am sure that many members welcome this opportunity for the house as a whole to re-examine the working of the 1967 act and to hear members' views on the reports of last session's select committee. in this respect, mr. deputy speaker, if you could so interpret the rules of order as to allow hon. members to express their views on the second report of the select committee, such an interpretation, and any advantage taken of it, would be welcomed by the government.\\n           this bill is aimed at implementing the points made in the first report

second report the government would hope to get an expression of views from the house. i shall also be referring to the lane committee's recommendations in the course of my speech, particularly those

second reading of the last abortion (amendment) bill many of which have been reported to the house. from july 1975 this government have provided a comprehensive free family planning service within the national health service. as a consequence there is now a trend towards fewer abortions performed on women in this country. the number of such abortions, which reached a peak in 1973–74, has since declined.\\n           this decline continues. in 1976 there were just over 100,000 abortions on women resident in england and wales—a drop of 8 per cent. since 1974. moreover the decline is common to all age groups, including, for the first time in 1976, girls under 16. similar changes have occurred in the incidence of illegitimate births and pre-marital pregnancies. taking a global approach to illegitimate births, pre-marital pregnancies and abortions, there has been a fall of about one fifth between the ages of 16–24 and a stabilisation of numbers in the pre 16 age groups.\\n        \",

and extended its control of the private sector and in this respect my right hon. friend and myself accept that, if there is to be abortion in the private sector, it is our job to supervise the standards in that sector and to ensure that they are adequate. it is no exaggeration to say that the abuses in the private sector which caused so much concern in the early 1970s—taxi touts, the activities of unscrupulous agencies and nursing homes in exploiting women of this country and from abroad and the unethical behaviour of small numbers of doctors—have been progressively brought under control. the lane committee\\'s recommendations on certification and examination were implemented through amending regulations last year, as was its recommendation that the chief medical officers of health should be empowered to disclose to the president of the general medical council information furnished under the regulations.\\n           there is now a provision in the criminal law bill in another place—for which my right hon. friend the home secretary is primarily responsible—for the maximum fine for offences against regulations made under the act to be increased to £1,000. this implements another of the lane committee\\'s recommendations as well as one of the first report of the select committee and is part of an across-the-board exercise to increase fines in line with inflationary pressures since these fines were last reviewed.\\n           nursing homes are regularly inspected and any evidence of improper conduct promptly investigated. it might help the house if i indicate the range of the undertaking\\'s that private nursing home proprietors must give my right hon. friend as a condition of his approval under the abortion act. this is the first time this information has been given to the house. briefly, they provide for the maintenance of detailed records, the inspection of premises and records by the department\\'s officers at any time without notice, the giving of receipts to patients and the retention of copies for inspection, the acceptance of fees only after two doctors have certified that the act\\'s criteria are met in each case, the number of patients per 24 hours not to exceed the number of beds approved, and for the examination of patients by a doctor before discharge.\\n           the nursing home must also undertake not to advertise abroad, either directly or indirectly, employ touts, or to accept patients who have been diverted from their intended destinations or touted for. the proprietors must have no connection with agencies or persons known to advertise abroad, or to tout for or divert patients.\\n           proprietors must also, in applying for approval, provide the department with detailed information about the business arrangements of the companies and individuals involved in the application, all of which is carefully inquired into by the department\\'s investigators. medical and nursing arrangements, including staffing, equipment, procedures and accommodation, are checked by the department\\'s medical and nursing teams.\\n           nursing homes which concentrate on abortions have had to satisfy my right hon. friend that the total costs charged to abortion patients treated on their premises are not unreasonable, and must not increase these costs without prior approval. all financial arrangements between nursing homes and doctors, other than payment of fees, and pregnancy advice bureaux must be reported to the department.\\n           the lane committee looked at the effectiveness of the existing arrangements for approving nursing homes and was of the opinion that no statutory requirements for approval should be laid down.\\n           the latest safeguard, announced by my right hon. friend on 10th february, is the publication of a register of approved pregnancy advice bureaux, following the undertakings he gave to this effect on 5th august last. nursing homes will be liable to lose their approval if they accept patients referred to them by unregistered bureaux which charge fees. registered bureaux, like nursing homes, will be subject to regular inspection without notice. the lane committee recommended a statutory system for licensing advice bureaux, but we now have a register and, in my view, should have an opportunity to see how well it works.\\n           on counselling—on the more positive side—my department has circulated draft guidance to the health service, professional bodies, and those giving guidance on the arrangements for counselling women who express a wish for termination of pregnancy. we are awaiting replies before issuing it for action. the lane committee stressed the importance of such counselling. the standard of counselling arrangements, as well as medical care, was included in the assessment of pregnancy advice bureaux in preparing the register of approved bureaux that my right hon. friend announced.\\n           an issue which is of great importance to the sponsors of the bill, and which arouses a great deal of interest in the country, is the question of the period of pregnancy after which termination should not be permitted. this is another area about which there has been great public concern, partly because of allegations that have been made in the past which received widespread and sensational publicity. there has also been concern for staff involved in late terminations.\\n           the lane committee recommended that there should be an upper time limit of 24 weeks on the grounds that there were some women who have compelling grounds for termination between the 20th and 24th week of pregnancy, and an upper time limit of 24 weeks would afford appropriate protection for a viable foetus. following the recommendations of the select committee, terminations after the 20th week of pregnancy are permitted only in hospitals or approved nursing homes which have resuscitation equipment and staff trained to use it. the number of abortions carried out after 20 weeks is in fact very small, amounting to less than 1 per cent. of all abortions in the country. less than a fifth of this 1 per cent. are performed after 24 weeks. this evidence led my predecessor, in giving evidence to the select committee on the abortion (amendment) bill, to conclude that the case for legislation was not necessarily very urgent.\\n           following the lane committee\\'s recommendations, all nhs authorities have also been reminded of the code of practice drawn up by the peel committee on the use of foetal material for research, and strict arrangements govern nursing homes in the disposal of such material. information to hand indicates that this code is being observed conscientiously throughout the nhs and the private sector.\\n           there has also been a good deal of criticism, which has been aroused again today, about the pressures on staff not to exercise their right of conscientious objection. to the best of my knowledge, and on the information available, this belief is not well founded. a great deal has been made about the advice given by the chief medical officer of my department. this guidance was issued at the request of the medical profession to ensure that where a demand for terminations existed which could not otherwise be met in posts to be advertised, it should be made clear in the advertisements to all applicants for the job that such duties were an integral part of the post, and therefore questions on people\\'s conscientious, religious and ethical beliefs could be avoided.\\n           in practice this advice applies to only a small percentage of the advertised posts in the relevant specialties, and there is no evidence that recruitment to the specialties is in any way adversely affected or that anyone has been penalised in following his career as a result.

which include, among others, many dispensing chemists.\\n           this is in addition to the extra work which would be required to replace the present administrative procedures for controlling the

the private sector and its current decline that the charitable organisations, through charging moderate fees and providing a reasonably high standard of in-paient care, have contributed to the improvements which i have mentioned in the private sector generally. the organisations concerned are as closely supervised as are any of the others in the private sector with which my department deals, and they will obviously be vitally affected by the provisions of the bill. the house will need to consider whether that would serve the overall objectives of preventing abuse in the private sector.\\n           there are some indications that national health service provision for abortion is improving, although i accept that regional variations remain, and i note the criticisms made by

given the figures which the government think are most relevant to the matters at issue. i have explained the introduction of the family planning service. even selecting his own careful figures, the hon. member for buckingham could not argue a better case than that there was a plateau. i shall leave it for the house to judge. we have given our figures to the house, and i am willing to stand by them.\\n           i was just coming to the question of provision in the national health service. the hon. member for reading, south (dr. vaughan) seemed to think that i was about to sit down, but i regret to say that it will be a minute or two yet before the house is relieved of my presence at the dispatch box. i apologise for taking a little longer than i intended, but i have given way several times.\\n           on the question of administrative control of nursing homes as opposed to regulations, although i had intended to deal with that matter in summing up, as the hon. gentleman has brought it up, i shall reply now. yes, we believe that our present administrative arrangements, because they are more flexible, are likely to be more effective than any cumbersome and rather rigid regulations in a situation which has changed quite remarkably over 10 years. regulations, of course, would have to be subject to amending regulations, whereas administrative control can be subject to regular and fairly quick adjustment to circumstances.\\n           i return now to what i was saying about nhs provision. for example, day-care facilities, which offer an equally high standard of treatment in many cases and more effective use of the available resources, have increased. unfortunately, i cannot be precise about the increase for abortions specifically since the figures are not collected on that basis, but the use of day-care facilities for gynaecological patients, which include abortion, has increased by over 30 per cent. between 1972 and 1975. moreover, the mean waiting time for admission to hospital from gynaecological waiting lists for therapeutic abortion has reduced from 12½ days in 1971 to 9½ days in 1974.\\n           i regard that as another improvement in the national health service provision. obviously, there is a great deal more to be done, and i would argue that this is where the resources of the government and the country should be concentrated in this field.\\n           the outcome of the present debate is not known. if the bill fails to receive a second reading, that will be that, for the time being at any rate. if, however, this bill finds favour with a majority of the house, my right hon. friend and i will place the resources of our department at the disposal of the house with a view to consulting the appropriate professional and other interests involved, and this will provide a comprehensive background of information and views for the use of the standing committee which will eventually have to consider the bill in detail.\\n           as i explained at the outset, my task today is primarily to inform the house of the current position. i have drawn attention to what. i hope. a fair-minded person will regard as the most relevant developments related to this bill and knowledge of which is held at the department of health and social security. when i took up my present appointment last september, it was clear that abortion would be on the agenda before long and that the department had no plans for legislation on the subject.\\n           i must add that, in view of the information which i have given the house today, neither my right hon. friend nor i, had we been left to our own resources, would have seen the need to introduce legislation, given the administrative action which has been taken. i believe that the hon. member for buckingham will be prepared to withdraw his charge that nothing ever happens except when a bill on abortion is before the house. i believe that i have shown to everyone generally that there is a substantial amount of activity on the part of my department in between times.\\n           the house will be aware that my right hon. friend has expressed his view that there is a case for a period of calm while the web of administration which i have described continues to regulate and reduce the problems which gave concern not so long ago. the really important task at the moment is primarily associated with the improvement of the health service in this field. that is where we should concentrate.\\n           there is one other point. i have been endeavouring to present some departmental information as dispassionately as possible. i hope that i have succeeded. however, i think that i owe the house one more duty before i conclude, and that is to disclose my own personal bias in order that it may help hon. members to weigh the importance of what i have said. i shall be voting against the bill, although on this occasion i shall leave it to others to argue the case.\\n

accepting all those recommendations and putting them into effect.\\n           at that point, at any rate, the select committee had acted with universal support. however, in view of some of the observations which have been made. i wish to emphasise that the committee had in fact examined the provisions of the bill. what we did was first to examine the provisions of the bill carefully. we came to tentative conclusions. the house ought to know that those conclusions were unanimous. only on two points of detail was one dissenting voice recorded.\\n           that was the position on the

the evidence having been taken, there was the question of presentation of the draft report by the chairman. i went to the trouble and care of submitting to the committee guidelines for that draft report. those guidelines were accepted unanimously by the full committee. in fact, we decided to ask leave to sit again, and we did not then present the committee's report on the bill.\\n           in the following session, the committee was re-established. the hon. members who resigned—i hope that i am being fair to everyone—did not resign on any point of substance which had been before the committee. they resigned on the general ground that, in their judgment, legislation was unnecessary or inopportune. that was the point at issue. i considered that, as we had been set up by a vote of the house to do that very task of consideration of legislation, the committee should proceed with its examination.\\n           we took further evidence. then came the question of the chairman's draft report. i accepted that it was my responsibility to present that draft report within the heads of agreement and the guidelines that we had agreed previously during the previous session's deliberations. that is the position with regard to the report.\\n           i have said that the committee was set up to examine a bill that had received a second reading. that obviously affected our consideration and the recommendations that we felt able to make, but i assure the house—and this is in all fairness to my colleagues on the select committee—that we examined the bill not only within the guidelines that had been agreed by the previous committee, but conscious that we should seek as broad a consensus as possible.\\n           what did we do? we made radical and drastic amendments. i remind the house that we removed from the bill the provisions on criteria consultant medical advisers at the clinics, foreign women, foetuses, foetal material and the onus of proof.\\n           i have referred to the matters that we took out of the bill, but one has only to compare the two bills to concede that we also made radical changes in the provisions that we considered should still be recommended to the house. i emphasise that we considered this in the light not only of evidence but of the point that my hon. friend the minister of state has made about the action taken by the department.\\n           may i give an illustration? the first session's committee agreed, amongst other things, to propose legislation to deal with the traffic in the abortion of foreign women. that was the agreed conclusion of that committee. but the second session's committee recognised the steps that had been taken administratively and such facts as the minister of state has put before the house today, and we decided to recommend no legislative action. equally, the first committee agreed to recommend back-up legislation on foetuses and foetus material but, again it is clear from the matters to which i have referred that after we had received further evidence, we decided to make no such recommendation.\\n           i now want to turn to the recommendations that we made. it is rarely recognised—although it ought to be—that the unique feature of our abortion law is that the evidence of two registered medical practitioners is required before an abortion can take place. i am all in favour of that. one has only to think of the condition of pregnant women to realise how distressing it is for them in other countries to have to go through the official machinery and to face bureaucracy in seeking abortions. but i emphasise that two registered practitioners, not one, are required under the 1967 act.\\n           anyone who is concerned about this subject must also realise how important it is that there should continue to be confidence in the system. the confidence must lie in the fact that two practitioners are required. the committee recommended that one of the practitioners should have professional standing of some seniority—five years' standing—and this is wanted by the medical practitioners themselves.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0),

we do not go as far as the earlier bill, but with the provisions we suggest one can surely rely upon the advice of two medical practitioners.\\n           i turn to the referral agencies and the advisory bureaux. our recommendation is simply that: legislation be introduced to require all referral agencies, pregnancy advisory bureaux and pregnancy testing agencies which charge fees to be licensed by the secretaries of state. that is beyond argument. it is no good the department\\'s saying what has been said by my hon. friend the minister this morning. there is really no argument about this. it is what the lane committee insisted upon and it is also what was proposed in the grylls bill, which the department accepted. the department told the committee that it would welcome legislation. professor lafitte told us that he would prefer legislation. he would prefer the direct power to license rather than the indirect temporary approach through the clinics. who is there, apart from my hon. friend, who believes, having looked at the evidence, that there is any case for anything except the licensing of these agencies?\\n           i want to be fair about this. i have called professor lafitte in aid because it is important that we should pay attention to his point of view. he speaks for the british pregnancy advisory services. it would be unfair to suggest that professor lafitte agrees with the opinion expressed by the select committee. i refer the house to the opinion that the select committee expressed—not a recommendation—because it is quite clear. the select committee recorded: in view of the evidence we received about financial abuses and the importance placed by many witnesses on unbiased counselling. your committee are of the opinion that it is better to insist upon a severance and not to afford any exemption to charitable advisory services. as a result they would depend upon fees and genuine charitable contributions. your committee recognise that due notice would have to be given to allow the charitable agencies affected to make the necessary changes. we should try to achieve maximum consensus.\\n           it is generally agreed that, as far as possible, abortion should be carried out in the public sector, in the national health service. equally, as far as possible, abortion should not be carried out in the private commercial sector. between these two sectors we have the reputable charitable organisations.\\n           i put to the house the views that the committee expressed in the light of evidence that it received. those views are quite firm and definite and, as the hon. gentleman said, this is a matter that should be borne in mind during the committee stage. i refer the house to the recommendation that we made and to the opinion that we expressed arising from this.\\n           we carried out exhaustive inquiries in both the first and second committees as to whether the licensing of the agencies should be done administratively or by regulation—largely because the lane committee, which was not well versed in this field, recommended administrative action. everything my hon. friend the minister said favoured regulations. it is a question of the approval of the clinics and the licensing of the agencies.\\n           i do not want to exaggerate this, but, notwithstanding the welcome administrative action taken, there have been some abuses. we recommended what the lane committee said could not be done—the fixing of maximum charges. this has been accepted but it is surely a matter for regulation and not administration. there is an inspectorate at the department and a whole series of conditions are laid down for the operating of agencies. when we reach that stage, regulations are unavoidable and essential.\\n           british pregnancy advisory services raised with us, when it saw our recommendation, the question of consultation. we made quite clear that regulations enforced consultation. we all know that no department issues regulations without full consultation with all concerned. what is much more important is that the regulations must come to the house, so those consulted have recourse to the house if they feel that their representations have not been adequately considered.\\n           we have emphasised, and this again is a matter for regulations, that if we go to the limits which we have provided there should be a right of appeal. this again is a matter for regulations. we have pressed the department to go so far that what is needed is no longer capable of being done administratively. that would be unfair to everyone. one must be fair and above board and do it by regulation.\\n           undoubtedly legislation is needed on the upper time limit. there is a choice between two periods, or a qualification upon that choice. one can accept lane and 24 weeks, or peel, the other report, and 20 weeks. we must bear in mind that peel has the support of the world health organisation and the medical profession. [ interruption. ] as far as it has indicated, the who\\'s opinion is 20 weeks. we have a choice between 24 weeks and 20 weeks, with the weight of the medical profession behind 20 weeks. [hon. members: \"no.\"]\\n           i remind the house that lane recommended that after 24 weeks there should be no abortion, that the only treatment was to induce labour. we do not think that that is very satisfactory in the light of the evidence we received, and we recommend 20 weeks. we say: but provision should be made allowing such treatment\"— that is, abortion— where the child would be born with a major disability whether physical or mental or where it is necessary to save the life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman; and to provide by regulation an element of flexibility with regard to the time limit. that is a far better recommendation than was made by either lane or peel.\\n           those are the main recommendations of the select committee. it is misleading nonsense to say that they can be carried out administratively. they are all matters that depend upon legislation. my hon. friend can say \"i don\\'t like them, and i will not legislate\", but he cannot say that the government can carry out any of these main recommendations without resorting to legislation.\\n           i should like to say something about other recommendations that we have made. i begin with the question of penalties. i remind stalwart supporters of the lane committee that what is recommended was that offences should be made indictable and that there should be no time limit. we decided that that was to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut. we said that the obvious thing to do was to extend the time limit for summary proceedings. i say to anyone who calls in aid of the lane committee that that is a much more sensible recommendation than it made.\\n           i turn next to the matter of prosecutions. we do not accept the provision in the white bill to shift the onus of proof, but we were faced with the difficulty of obtaining evidence. that was recognised by the whole medical profession. abuses are remarkably few, but the whole profession is stigmatised by them. in one of our previous recommendations we said that documents should be made more widely available and should be available to the general medical council. this has been done.\\n           we took what i thought—and as chairman of the all-party civil liberties parliamentary group i am very sensitive on this issue—was the best course, saying \"you have established the need. we are very reluctant to extend powers. you will do this only by application to a high court judge.\" all this concerns only bodies and people charging fees for the work they do. it is not an uninvited invasion of privacy but something that we believe to be necessary if we are to get to the heart of the problem of dealing with the handful of offenders who bring the whole profession into disrepute.\\n           we received a good deal of evidence that people were disturbed about the provision for conscientious objection. i have already said that we rejected the argument—whatever its strength—that the onus of proof should be shifted with regard to offences under the 1967 act or under this bill. we took the same view about conscientious objection. we removed the placing of the burden of proof on the conscientious objector. we took a very balanced view of the matter.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0),

provision about conscientious objection we should also look at the consequences, so in our second report—to which my hon. friend the minister referred only incidentally—we recommended recognising that there was an obligation as far as possible to provide facilities for abortion as necessary to implement the 1967 act in the health service. to ensure the widest possible availability, we recommended that there should be special units in the national health service to provide abortion in those hospitals where it was shown that women were driven to pay for abortion because they would not otherwise be able to have the facility of abortion at all. i regard that as a recommendation of some importance.\\n           but what disturbs me is that we have had no response from the government, although we have made specific recommendations concerning the public sector. we are returning to the days when we had no select committee. i do not invite the house to set up a permanent select committee on abortion, of the kind that we had on race relations, but one might recommend that. i happen to be chairman of the select committee on race relations. we did have a response during the past couple of years when that select committee was in operation.\\n           i fear, when we have emphasis upon administrative solutions, that within a year or two we shall be in the same difficulties we found before the select committee was set up. i am sure that the most effective answer is to recognise the 1967 act, as the bill does, and to say that there were matters arising from the operation of that act which should be attended to, and that the bill provides an opportunity to do that.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.74',

in the first year of operation of the new legislation the figures were relatively low. few of the charitable services had got started. the national health service was not geared to dealing with the new law. the medical techniques used in abortions have been greatly simplified and improved since the early years. however, in the past two or three years the figures have been coming down, and that should be noted.\\n           the right hon. member for sunderland, north (mr. willey) fairly said that the select committee, under his controlled chairmanship, particularly in its first sitting, confined its activities to those matters on which those of us who were members of the select committee, how- ever different might be our fundamental views, could agree about improving the administration of the act. our report was valuable because it was unanimous. we made recommendations which, within a matter of weeks, were accepted by the then secretary of state for social services and they were implemented. it is fair for the right hon. gentleman to claim that the work of the select committee helped to draw attention to the recommendations of the lane committee and to prod the department into action. a couple of years ago we got the improvements which, i believe, have led to a greatly improved administration of the abortion act.\\n           i hope that, if we are to be given examples—which we have not yet—of current abuses of the act, or allegations of abuses of the act, they will be taken from the past two years. i do not know whether hon. members heard the radio phone-in programme this morning, but the old stories were trotted out about examples of which we all know and condemn of several years ago as being reasons for supporting the bill. the administration of the act, particularly after the taking of the latest steps outlined by the minister a few minutes ago on pregnancy advice centres and referral agencies, has greatly improved.\\n           one of the useful results of the work of the select committee was that parliament, through the select committee, was able to review the recommendations of the lane committee. however, the letter sent to the prime minister highlighted the chief point of maladministration of the abortion act, namely, the regional variation in abortions in the national health service. i am told that of the people who obtained abortion in the birmingham area only 13 per cent. are able to do so under the national health service, whereas in the newcastle area 95 per cent. of abortions are carried out under the national health service. those are the regional extremes, but a variation of from 13 per cent. to 95 per cent. is quite extraordinary.\\n           i should have thought that that was one of the main issues on which we should be pressing the department. it is one of the problems which the bill in no way touches and yet it is highlighted in the letter sent to the prime minister. there are plenty of examples of abuse of the abortion act, in medical and financial terms, over the past three or four years. there has been widespread concern among hon. members, whether supporters or opponents of the 1967 act. in particular, we have been concerned about the inflow of foreign patients, to the great lucrative benefit of a small number of members of the medical profession.\\n           however, the picture has changed, and the house should note the publication of the international planned parenthood federation, which shows that, since we legislated in 1967, 33 states have introduced new abortion laws and most of them are more liberal than our 1967 law. many of them, particularly the more recent statutes of other countries, permit abortion not only after examination by two doctors, as under our law, but at the request of women. there is a campaign to alter the law in that direction in this country.\\n           the result of the change of the law elsewhere, particularly on the continent, and the tightening of the administration of our act has been a dramatic fall in the number of patients coming to this country. according to the figures for last year, the number of foreign patients who had abortions in this country was down 50 per cent. on the 1975 figure. no matter how one may play with the statistics, one cannot pretend that this has anything to do with the fall in the birth rate among foreign women in this country. there has been a dramatic fall in the number of abortions.\\n           my attitude to the bill is this: several of the clauses in the bill could individually be quite easily defended. many of them contain measures which could be taken by the department without the need for legislation, either by way of administrative guidance or by regulation. what worries me is not the effect of each of the proposals but the effect of the bill as a whole. the secretary of state, in his letter to me, was right to claim that the bill would throw the abortion law into fresh confusion just at the time when the administration of the law was settling down in the way that parliament originally intended.\\n           that is the burden of the case against the bill. moreover, as it will cause legislative confusion, it will cause delay in the administration of abortions in the health service. one of the good results is that in the past 10 years the number of abortions carried out late in pregnancies has been in decline. the majority are now carried out after less than 12 weeks of pregnancy, and fewer than 1 per cent. of the pregnancies are over 20 weeks.\\n           i dare say that other hon. members have, like myself, been besieged in advance of the bill, by letters and leaflets on this subject. the two organisations which are campaigning to get their members to write to members of parliament asking them to support the bill stand for the total repeal of the 1967 act. their objective is to stop abortion, and they make no bones about it. they are entitled to their view, and i make no complaint about it. but let us not pretend that the purpose of the bill is to tidy up the administration of the act. the purpose of the steam behind the bill is to stop abortion.\\n           if we decide, as we decided in 1967, that we want a civilised and reasonable abortion law within which it will be possible to terminate pregnancy, we should stand by that attitude and reject an attempt to interfere with the act in such a fundamental way.\\n           i beg to oppose the bill.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0),

of the select committee, i endorse every word that the right hon. member for sunderland, north (mr. willey) said in his excellent and utterly convincing speech. he clearly made the case for legislation. secondly, i should like to make my own position plain, especially in the light of the remarks made by the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel).\\n           some people wish to alter the 1967 act in order to make abortion freely available on request. the hon. lady the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) does not disguise that fact, and she is entitled to her opinion. there are others who wish to make abortion more difficult. some argue that it is the woman\\'s right to choose, irrespective of the effect upon the infant in the womb. others take the view that any abortion is a wanton destruction of an unborn child.\\n           i do not hold with these extreme views and nor did parliament when it enacted the 1967 act. i do not seek any alteration in the criteria for lawful abortion, nor does the bill. the select committee made plain that this was a matter to be left to the conscience of individual hon. members.\\n           in general, i agree with the lane committee that the 1967 act has done much to reduce the toll of suffering, ill health and premature death that prevailed under the previous confused state of the law, but it would be a great mistake to believe that the scandal of illegal abortion has ceased under the act. i concede, too, that it is most unfortunate for those who support the act that its introduction has not been accompanied by the development of comprehensive facilities within the national health service all over the country, with the result that even where the criteria have been satisfied, it has not always been possible for a woman to obtain a lawful abortion.\\n           the inevitable result has been the development of a large and flourishing sector in which, because the motivation was not care of the woman but the making of profit, the \"social\" clause has been interpreted so freely as to constitute abortion on demand. however, the 1967 act did not provide statutory control over nursing homes and clinics in the private sector. it has been prodded in that direction only by the house, by the bill of the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) and the recommendations of the select committee.\\n           it is hardly surprising, therefore, that the select committee found that the vast majority of women who sought advice in the private sector had abortions. it was 98 per cent. in the case of at least one major referral agency.\\n           nor was it surprising that there developed a large and lucrative traffic in abortions for foreign women and that large fortunes were made by unscrupulous operators. the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse) and i predicted in 1967 that, despite the good intentions of parliament and the noble protestations of the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles, the act would lead to grave abuse—and it has. the grave public disquiet which resulted led inevitably to the appointment of the lane committee.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.79', 39, 'uk.m.21824', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i think that my hon.

concerned and anxious house setting up the select committee.\\n           the minister spelled out a list of administrative actions taken by his department on bureaux and counselling. it is important for us to remember that virtually no action was taken by the department to remove the known abuses, condemned by the lane committee and by public opinion, until after the select committee had made its nine interim recommendations to deal with the appalling and disgusting situation in the private sector. that is the answer to those who argue that the bill, which seeks to do no more than implement the main recommendations of the select committee, is not necessary and that it is safe to leave these matters to the department. after the minister\\'s appalling speech, it is clear that it is totally unsafe to leave such matters to the department and that the house must speak today in a very clear voice.\\n           i respect the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles enormously and i know exactly where he stands on this issue. he challenged us to refer to abuses that have taken place in the past two years. i accept. let me go to the heart of the matter because no one has referred to it so far.\\n           when the right hon. gentleman introduced his bill in 1966 he said that it was not intended to leave a wide open door for abortion on request. eight years later, the lane committee recognised that, contrary to the right hon. gentleman\\'s intentions, abortion on request was being practised. the committee\\'s report said: the criteria for abortion as expressed in the act are imprecise and can be widely interpreted and that: some practitioners interpret the act to mean that … termination is possible in every case\". what flowed from that imprecision? strongly associated with the practice of abortion on request has been the prospect of financial gain for those authorising and performing abortions. the financial and vested interests which developed after 1967 included the referral agencies that receive fees, the doctors who perform private sector abortions and the investors with an interest in private clinics. the concern which such vested interests have aroused is caused not simply because profiteering in this area is distasteful but because they have led directly to a blatant disregard for the intentions of parliament and those of the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles when he introduced his bill in 1966.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.83', 23,

large sums of money pointed out that in some parts of the commercial private sector the provisions of the act have been flouted and abortion on request has been the rule. i submit that this association of the profit motive with the authorising of abortions outside the spirit of the law is a scandal and that the house should recognise it as such.\\n           my hon. friend's bill provides that two doctors authorising an abortion should not be in private practice together or share a mutual financial interest in the same nursing home or agency. that is a perfectly proper provision. the bill enables the dhss to license feecharging pregnancy advising bureaux and it would prohibit the granting of a licence to any bureau which has financial connections with a private abortion clinic. these proposals should help to reduce the monetary incentives that exist to approve abortions outside the spirit of the law. indeed, the general feeling of the select committee was that if it were possible for the resources to be made available the whole matter of abortion should be taken out of the hands of the private sector and dealt with within the national health service.\\n           it should go without saying that a woman who is facing the agonising decision whether to seek an abortion is entitled to unbiased medical advice of the highest quality. such advice would have to take into account the interrelation of a number of factors—her age, her previous obstetric history, the duration of pregnancy, her physical and mental health, the availability of skilled help and supporting services, and the risks of termination both long-term and medium-term.\\n           the select committee heard evidence that shows that abortion is not as simple as some people believe. indeed, there is mounting evidence that the effect of an abortion on safe child-bearing later should be researched more deeply. the reluctance of the department to pay any attention to

who is a member of the medical profession and yet walked out of the select committee. the hon. member should have seen what was said in evidence. i am grateful to my hon. friend the member for reading, south (dr. vaughan) for bringing such information to the attention of the house.\\n           in the interests of good medical practice the bill also requires that doctors carrying out abortions must notify the woman\\'s general practitioner of the abortion, provided that her consent has been obtained. the lane committee said on this point: we have received a number of complaints from general practitioners upon whose patients abortions have been performed without the customary notification to them. we have no desire to encourage in doctors an attitude of possessiveness towards their patients but we consider that those who perform abortions without making every effort to obtain a patient\\'s consent to her general practitioner being informed may be failing in their duty towards her. we regard this as being of great importance because of the need for counselling and after-care. the lane committee also pointed out that after an abortion medical after-care may well be needed for conditions such as anaemia, chest infections and episodes of thrombo-embolism; that gynaecological care might be needed to avoid the sepsis which can lead to sterility; that contraceptive care is needed for most women after an abortion; and that considerable time may be needed to ensure an adequate discussion of suitable methods.\\n           the committee also said that common psychological reactions include guilt feelings and varying degrees of anxiety and depression; and that patients need the opportunity to discuss their reactions and feelings, which may be intense, and that is done ideally in general practice with a doctor whom they know. clearly a statutory requirement of notification of a woman\\'s general practitioner should help to ensure the availability of these important elements in medical after-care.\\n           the problem of late abortions has caused as much public concern as any other aspect of the abortion controversy. a healthy child born of a healthy mother and given intensive care from birth now has a reasonable chance of living even if it is born a few weeks before the 28th week of pregnancy.\\n           the 20-week limit which, with some qualifications, is proposed in the bill, would accord much more closely with current medical knowledge and opinion than the present 28-week limit. i refer not only to domestic medical opinion, on which the select committee took advice, but also to that of international bodies. seven years ago the international federation of obstetrics and gynaecology recommended that abortion—which implies that life cannot be maintained in the foetus after expulsion from its mother—should be restricted to termination before 20 weeks. in a report published in 1975 a world health organisation scientific group concluded that infants delivered from the 22nd week onwards have a \"survival potential\".\\n           i understand that there is often considerable difficulty in calculating gestational age with accuracy and, as the lane report observed, many women seeking abortion claim that their pregnancy is at an earlier stage than it is in fact. i suggest that the risk of mistakes in the calculation is a strong argument in itself for bringing forward the upper time limit as the bill proposes.\\n           in any event it is generally agreed that the risks of an abortion to the mother increase substantially after the first three months of pregnancy. that is reflected in the experience of other countries with long experience of therapeutic abortion—many of which have earlier time limits than we do, particularly for abortions that are carried out for social reasons.\\n           there is another reason why the 1967 act cannot go unamended. the act includes a conscience clause. yet the harsh fact is that from the outset the problems of medical and nursing staff with conscientious objections to abortion have continued unabated. the royal college of obstetrics and gynaecology said in their evidence to the lane committee that there was \"a very real need\" for an inquiry into how far junior doctors are under duress when they engage in operations to terminate pregnancy. commenting on the fear of such junior doctors that distaste or conscientious objection might prejudice the advancement of their careers, the royal college said: their fear is amply justified. indeed, the select committee received numerous complaints and allegations of discrimination, especially about fully-qualified doctors being debarred from appointments.\\n           the nursing profession has also been adversely affected. the lane report commented that the abortion act had brought unhappiness to many nurses in the national health service. the committee found that trained staff had resigned from their posts because of the act. it found that many nurses were loath to opt out partly through reluctance to place an extra workload on colleagues and partly through fear that adverse comments might be made in their personal records which would affect their promotion prospects.\\n           the evidence that the select committee heard from nursing organisations convinced us that non-catholic nurses with conscientious objection to abortion faced particular difficulties since in many hospitals the so-called conscience clause is in practice interpreted as allowing religious objections only. the bill would amend the conscience clause and also delete the provision in the act that in any legal proceedings the burden of proof of conscientious objection should rest on the person claiming to rely on it. that is only fair.\\n           in conclusion, in my view the bill would for the first time combat some of the worst abuses of the existing abortion law, would ensure that women receive proper medical advice before abortion and proper medical care afterwards, would give added protection both for the viable foetus and for conscientious objection in the healing professions, and would assist the department of health and social security and the police in enforcing the law in this very difficult area.\\n           this debate should remind us once again that we are not talking about any ordinary surgical operation, such as the removal of tonsils, but about something that must inevitably involve two lives and the destruction of one of them.\\n           it behoves us, therefore, to see that the shattering experience of abortion for a woman is not a source of profit for the unscrupulous and that it is preceded and followed by the best possible advice and care. for those reasons i shall support the bill.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.94', 39, 'uk.m.21824', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'many of

says, mr. william benyon's private member's bill to amend the 1967 abortion act is down for second reading on friday 25th february. we have now had an opportunity to study the bill and believe that legislation is not desirable at the present time to amend the act. in our view, time should be allowed to assess the effects of the changes already introduced; further changes which might subsequently become desirable could best be effected by the more flexible system of administrative control. that is signed by the secretary of the bma.\\n           i believe that a major thrust of the propaganda put out to support the bill has been that it will remove abuses. i do not believe that further legislation is required for the removal of abuses. the secretary of state has powers to impose by administrative measures any controls that may be required to curb abuses. he has recently reaffirmed this in a letter to the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel), and he has confirmed it today in his intervention in the debate.\\n           however, the department has in the past deserved sharp criticism. that is one of the points on which i agree with my hon. friend the member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine). my own view is that after the 1967 act ministers of successive governments were far too slow to curb abuses, many of them ante-dating the act, and those abuses which were rightly disturbing public opinion, and for these failures i attacked them strongly in the select committee, because even then they had the powers of control that they needed. they admitted this. their fault was that they were too slow in using that in the face of the problems, many of which were new.\\n           first, i shall deal with controls in the private sector. the secretary of state, in consultation with the private sector, has established a series of effective administrative controls. i believe that they will prove more effective and more flexible than the complex legislation which we are now asked to pass, although they will be less likely to interfere with the proper operation of the 1967 act—which is a far more important consideration. i welcome the secretary of state's statement on 10th february about this.\\n           it was important that he should confer with the private sector, because since the 1967 act the private sector has helped to carry out the purpose of the act, and has provided well over half the services to which women in need are entitled and, indeed, the private sector has pioneered many of those services. let us remember that it has been providing these services at a time when the national health service has been adjusting itself at a very uneven pace to provide those increased services which are part of its responsibility under the law.\\n           had it not been for the private sector, there would have been far greater strains on the national health service and there would have been resort, on a far more serious scale, to the back-street abortionist, especially in those geographical areas where the national health service consultants so restricted the abortion service that they drove women in need to seek help elsewhere. in short, the bill seeks to impose a network of additional legal restrictions on the private sector at a time when the secretary of state, after consultation with the medical profession, has concluded that these restrictions are not required. in support of that is the letter from the british medical association which i have quoted today.\\n           let us turn now to the public sector—the national health service. by far the most serious abuse of the act, in my view and in the view of many people all over the country, is in the denial by the national health service consultants in certain areas of the service to which women in need are entitled by law. this is the abuse that any select committee concerned to help women should, as its top priority, have aimed to eliminate.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.105', 2, 'uk.m.16771', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'we did.\\n        ',

considering today, not the petty restrictive measures which the bill seeks to impose on the national health service, the private sector and, above all, on women in real and urgent need of help.\\n           a great deal is made in the bill of additional legal measures to protect those in the nhs with conscientious objections to performing abortions. yet the secretary of state, after consultation with the medical and other health professions, is able to say that the present safeguards for conscience are working satisfactorily. i know that this is contested, but the minister has repeated it again and again. in some of the areas in which consultants have severely restricted the level of abortion services to as low as one third of that provided by the nhs in the rest of the country i wonder what freedom of conscience can be exercised by members of the junior medical staff who wish to carry out their responsibilities under the law and to provide women in need with the relief to which they have a right.\\n           i am glad to see that the select committee, in a later slim report dated 22nd november 1976, has at least got round to describing the disparities in the nhs in these areas. i am sorry that the chairman of the select committee is not now here, but i wish to pay him a generous tribute—i see that he has returned—as i come to this second report. it stated: despite the improvements in some regions in the proportion of total abortions performed in the nhs, the regional disparities criticised by the lane committee largely persist. the committee made an important recommendation that: the secretaries of state should after full consultation, consider, by financing if necessary, the establishment, on a strictly experimental basis, of units in local hospitals where the availability of facilities is so inadequate, that women, who are entitled to have an abortion under the terms laid down by the abortion act 1967, either may not obtain it at all or may be compelled to pay for it. the establishment of any such units would be on an experimental basis only, would be provided with as adequate safeguards as could be devised and would be carefully monitored both with regard to their effectiveness and the efficacy of the safeguards. this recommendation needs no legislation. it could be put into practice by administrative measures, but, in certain areas, it will require additional finance and that, as we all know, is scarcer in the nhs perhaps than in any other social service.\\n           this poses a real dilemma for the government if they are to provide in the restrictive areas a level of abortion services comparable with that already available under the nhs in most other parts of the country. i think that the minister responsible here today must be warned that this is a responsibility which must lead to action, otherwise there will be a very strong reaction if it is delayed.\\n           the government seem to have two courses open. first, they can immediately inquire into the working of the abortion service in nhs hospitals in those areas where levels of abortion services are conspicuously restricted, and they can ensure that there are adequate medical staff and facilities to bring those services up to the national average, without putting too great a strain on other gynaecological services. any additional staff, especially in the light of this debate, would need to be carefully chosen for this purpose. secondly, the government can provide on an experimental basis the special units recommended by the select committee in its recent report.\\n           one course—i ask the minister to pay attention at this moment—which is not open to the government is for them to do nothing and to allow this serious abuse to continue. i hope that the minister will confirm that this is not his intention.\\n           until this major abuse is removed, i cannot see the justification for complicating the legislation governing con- scientious objection. if, as i believe, the minister is right in claiming that this is now working satisfactorily, the need for change cannot be justified. i hope that the house will reject the bill and that the government will decide as soon as possible how best to tackle the abuse and the gross disparities in the level of abortion services of the nhs in various parts of the country. then a great majority of women will believe that, in this matter at least, parliament has listened to them and that the government have got their priorities right.\\n        ',

intentions of the members of the select committee. i am delighted that tribute has been paid to what we on the select committee achieved after some of its members walked out and left us. when they walked off the committee, it was after we had taken part in a debate and in a vote in which they were overwhelmingly defeated. their action was rather like that of the small boy who picks up his ball and goes off home.\\n           i expect rather better from my government than we heard today. like the hon. member for buckingham (mr. benyon), i was totally shattered when i read that one of our ministers had written to the leader of the liberal party saying, before the bill was even published, that there was no need for it. i am a simple type of laddie, but i have a clear memory of what happened a few years ago. that was when the government offered me a deal. edward short, who at that time was leader of the house, called my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse) and myself in and said that the government, too, were worried about how abortion was going and he offered us a select committee. i expect better from a labour government than for them to offer me a select committee if any report emanating from it is to be left on the shelves to gather dust as the report of the lane committee was. i believe that the lane committee did a good job, as the select committee did a first-class job.\\n           in this debate we have heard much the same speeches as we heard two years ago. it was interesting how fast the then secretary of state, my right hon. friend the member for blackburn (mrs. castle), moved on our first recommendations. i want the report of the select committee to be adopted on the floor of the house and the hon. member for buckingham has given us a golden opportunity to achieve this.\\n           my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) referred to the evidence to which we listened in the select committee. i attended every meeting of the select committee. we sat for nearly 100 hours and had 43 sittings. we heard witnesses from the salvation army, the church of scotland, the catholic church and the royal colleges. the best evidence that we received undoubtedly came from the royal college of nursing.\\n           my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east stands today like a modern joan of arc holding a wee bit of tube.\\n           i quote from last january's lancet:  the fetal material was collected from the operating theatre as soon as possible after pregnancy had been terminated and was brought to the tissue bank on ice. relevant clinical data were recorded. the following organs, amongst others, were identified: upper limbs 74, lower limbs 61, lung 22, liver 21, eyeballs 11, brain 8. and so on.\\n           i do not agree with that sort of thing from medical science, but i suggest that it is not as simple as a half teaspoonful of some fluid. i claim that i am not totally anti-abortion. the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) talked about outside agencies. i, too, have suffered from them. some want no abortion. some want abortion on demand.\\n           i suggest that some hon. members want abortion on demand. they should bring in a bill aimed at securing that. the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles stated categorically that that was not what he was after. i hope that he will give the bill a good wind today.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'],

the select committee was both truncated and unbalanced. i agree with the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) that members of the select committee appointed by the house who chose to chicken out can scarcely quarrel if the report which was published does not entirely reflect their own personal views.\\n           the select committee on abortion, like the lane committee before it, was set up, as a result of widespread unease about the working of the abortion act 1967 on all sides of the house and in the country at large. as the house well knows, the then secretary of state accepted—we were grateful for this—some of the recommendations of the committee\\'s third special report which could be implemented administratively—for example, making sure—it is incredible to relate that this should have been required in the first place—that a woman was actually examined by the doctor before he signed a certificate recommending an abortion.\\n           the lane committee in paragraph 201 of its report had strongly condemned as wholly unethical what it described as the growing practice of giving a certificate without even seeing the patient. the regulations were accordingly altered to provide that a certificate should henceforth record both that an examination of the women had been carried out and that the opinion was related to the circumstances of her individual case and not to some statistical evidence.\\n           the secretary of state also accepted the committee\\'s recommendation that referral agencies and pregnancy advice bureaux which the secretary of state considered to be satisfactory should be listed and that the approval of places for the purposes of section 1 of the abortion act 1967 should be conditional on their non-acceptance of patients referred by unlisted agencies and bureaux. that, again, was a plus, but would this have come if we had not had the bill introduced by the hon. member for glasgow, pollok and a select committee? all along there has had to be this pushing of the department before action has been taken.\\n           but the licensing of such bureaux cannot be introduced except by a change in the law, and this we as a select committee believed to be absolutely essential.\\n           far and away the most important thing is to do away with the profiteering in abortion which takes place under the present law. as soon as my hon. friend the member for buckingham (mr. benyon) announced that he intended to bring in a bill to amend the 1967 act on lines recommended by the select committee, the powerful pro-abortion lobby swung into action. one group of doctors, calling themselves \"doctors for a woman\\'s choice on abortion\", who should have known better, without waiting to see what the bill would contain immediately formed a group to oppose it, on the grounds that it would, they believed, restrict which doctors may authorise an abortion, impose controls on charitable agencies, ensure that a woman\\'s general practitioner is notified, and ban most abortions after 20 weeks.\\n           let us examine these points as they are treated in the bill. the bill does indeed seek to restrict which doctors may authorise an abortion. in clause 2(1)( a ) it provides that at least one of the two registered medical practitioners must be of at least five years\\' standing. what is wrong with that? whatever the hon. member for wolverhampton, north-east may say, do we really want the law to enable two young, inexperienced doctors fresh from training to take such vital decisions?\\n           clause 2 also provides that the two doctors should be completely independent of one another and that at least one of the two is not able to obtain financial benefit from the place where the abortion is performed. again, what is wrong with that? no reputable doctor could reasonably object to this provision, and most would welcome the severing of the link between profit and abortion.\\n           as the lane report puts it in paragraph 443— in consequence of the abortion act a situation has arisen in which a very small number of perhaps 20 or 30 members of the medical profession and those associated with them have brought considerable reproach upon this country, both a home and abroad. it is not we who mistrust doctors. it is the lane committee and ourselves who mistrust only a very small minority who are bringing the profession into disrepute. it is this that the bill seeks to put right.\\n           secondly, control on \"charitable\" organisations. dr. george morris said on the radio on monday morning that the bill is designed to wreck charitable agencies. this just is not true. it is most interesting to note on this point the opinion of the lane committee.\\n           it said that some bureau owners have attempted to obtain an appearance of respectability by registering their services as charitable. these people calling themselves \"doctors for a woman\\'s choice on abortion\" can have little idea as to how these so-called charitable agencies operate. some people seem to think that to attach the word charitable\" to a pregnancy advisory bureau or referral agency makes it automatically altruistic and totally uninterested in cash. this is very far from being the case. it is true that technically they do not make a profit. they merely pay vast sums in salaries to their directors and administrators and surgeons, who put up the money in the first place. it is total hypocrisy to pretend that there is anything remotely charitable in the normally accepted sense of the word in the way they behave. their counselling is normally confined to suggestions to their victims as to how to raise the cash to pay them.\\n           some advisory bureaux are, in fact, nothing more nor less than a funnel to channel women to abortion clinics under the same ownership and with the same personnel. as the lane report pointed out, it is necessary to check the abuses in relation to agencies and advisory bureaux.\\n           there are, of course, many truly charitable organisations often attached to religious bodies whose sole aim is to help and counsel girls and women in distress. these would be in no way harmed by the provisions of the bill. it is only the sharks that we are after.\\n           as for ensuring that a woman\\'s gp is notified, certainly clause 3 of the bill provides that the doctor terminating the pregnancy shall notify the woman\\'s medical practitioner, but only after obtaining the woman\\'s consent to do so. this is a perfectly sensible arrangement to ensure, as far as is possible, that the woman receives any post-operative treatment that may be required and that her doctor is fully in the picture and on the alert for any complications.\\n           the bill, in the all-important first clause, makes it unlawful to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks except in cases where the child would be seriously handicapped mentally or physically or the mother\\'s health would be endangered. this clause may have to be clarified in committee to draw a clear distinction between terminations to abort the baby, and therapeutic terminations where an early end to the pregnancy is essential not to destroy but to save the life of the baby and mother, as for example in the case of toxaemia. if i had not had a satisfactory therapeutic termination 30 years ago i would not have my twins now. perhaps in committee in clause 1( c ) we could insert the words \"or baby\" so that the clause reads ( c ) that the treatment is necessary either to save the life of the pregnant woman or baby, or to prevent grave injury to her physical or mental health. this is simply a tidying up operation that can be done in committee.\\n           in the last 10 years since the 1967 act, there have been enormous strides in the medical techniques for saving the lives of premature babies, and foetuses which until recently were unviable can now be saved. the old upper limit, under the infant life preservation act, of 28 weeks has become unrealistic, and a lower limit of 20 weeks is vital.\\n           i notice that the expert opinion of my hon. friend the member for dorking (sir g. sinclair) is at variance with that of the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, sir john peel. there are many emotive phrases used to press the case for still easier abortion but perhaps the most misleading is \"a woman\\'s right to choose\". if one has no religious convictions in the matter it is, i suppose, permissible to say that a woman may do as she wishes with her body as far as sexual intercourse is concerned. that is a view with which i personally profoundly disagree but even if one accepts this view, once the woman becomes pregnant that sole right ceases and other rights are created, namely those of the child and the father, who is all too often left out of account altogether.\\n           nor has anything like enough research been done or publicity given to the resultant morbidity and the very serious psychological effect of an induced abortion. it is simply not true to say, as one abortion pamphlet says, that a teenage girl who has an illegitimate baby has nine-tenths of her life mapped out for her and that most of her options are closed. that may have been so 20 years ago, but it certainly is not so today.\\n           it is still far from easy for a girl, or a widow for that matter, to bring up a child on her own, but if she cannot face this prospect there are hundreds of thousands of childless couples longing for the baby they cannot have who would give it a loving and secure home. whereas there may well be unwanted pregnancies, there need never be an unwanted child.\\n           people sometimes say \"but what would you do if your daughter was in that situation?\" both my daughters are intelligent and university material and should have an interesting and demanding career ahead of them. but if either should find herself in this situation, i hope and believe that our whole family would close ranks and help her to go through with the pregnancy as many thousands of other families have done and will continue to do. but the least i would ask is that if she did decide in favour of an abortion, the decision would be hers and would not be in any way influenced by a pregnancy advisory agency or a doctor—and there are more than a few in our big cities—who had a financial motive in the matter.\\n           these are some of the abuses of the 1967 act which we seek to remedy and i hope that the house will support us in this attempt.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'],

she were involved in some attempt to get into the \"guinness book of records\" for making a speech at the fastest speed.\\n           we have heard from the chairman of the select committee, who put forward the ludicrous proposition that there should be a permanent select committee on abortion. it would be much more appropriate for this house to have a permanent select committee on women\\'s rights. we seem to be considering constantly anti-women measures, which preoccupy this male-dominated chamber. perhaps i should suggest to the prime minister that he appoint a woman minister with cabinet rank to guard the rights of women. then perhaps we should not have the kind of legislation that is constantly cropping up in this house to prevent women from having the right of abortion.\\n           i cannot understand why it is necessary to amend the 1967 act in a way that will make it more restrictive to women. why does not someone bring in a bill to amend the 1967 act by giving women the right to choose? that is the kind of legislation that we should be debating. if i get the opportunity for a private members\\' bill, the woman\\'s right to choose will be its subject.\\n           i bitterly resent constantly being forced into the entrenched position of having to hold on to what we have got in the 1967 act. as a woman and as one of the small minority of women members, i protest about the legislation that is set out by men. we have had the fundamentally weak sex discrimination act and the equal pay act, which have been of almost no significance to women when they get down to the nitty-gritty of having to use these laws, which have engendered a hardening attitude towards women. there are constant attempts to change the 1967 legislation in order to make it clear to women that their bodies are definitely not their own. they are the subject of laws to be made in this house, by and large, by the maleocracy. whichever way one looks at it, the house of commons is not a democracy but a maleocracy.\\n           a very sad feature of the bill is that two of its sponsors are women members. i am glad to see that the bill has no labour party woman as a sponsor. however, to see that two women have allowed their names to be so directly associated with such a fundamentally anti-woman bill is a cause for concern, and i hope that women outside the house will note that fact.\\n           the bill now before the house is an anti-woman measure, as was the bill introuduced by my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white). if the 1967 act were amended in the way the bill seeks, women in the lower income groups would suffer far more than those who can afford, and always have been able to afford, a private abortion.\\n           it is time that we said firmly and clearly to the do-gooders in this house—who invoke righteousness, justice, and sometimes even god on their side—that it is time that they accepted the fact that women, and only women, have the right to decide what is to happen to their bodies, and have the right to control them and their own lives. in an age of professional experts, usually men, it ill becomes hon. members to believe that they can take away that right from women in the way that the bill deliberately and wickedly seeks to do.\\n           this debate, apart from the technicalities of the law in a house of commons firmly dominated by male lawyers, should be partly about the need for men to accept the right for women to be people, too. one of the fundamental rights which this bill will deny them is the right to decide on an abortion.\\n           the house would do well to debate what can be done to help women and to ensure that they never again have to resort to back-street abortionists, or even attempts to abort themselves. this house should be insisting to the labour government, who are making enormous cuts in the national health service, that they must provide an adequate service through the nhs which carries out only about a third of present abortions. but, instead, the house debates this bill, which seeks to downgrade women and to deprive them of their rights.\\n           most people would agree that it is time for free, safe and voluntary abortions for all women who want them to be carried out in properly equipped hospitals or clinics by humane and qualified people, including sympathetic and definite after-care counselling. yet there is no clause in the bill which even attempts to put in that kind of recommendation to help women. instead, it seeks to set up a police state in respect of women, with powers for senior police officers to make checks on what are fundamentally private matters between a woman and her doctor.\\n           anybody who is seriously concerned about abortion should be anxious about the help that women need over abortions—the need to get over the sometimes dreadful depressions that can afflict women because of an abortion situation. if the do-gooders are the slightest bit interested in giving that help, they appear at present to be overlooking that aspect.\\n           in efforts to change the abortion situation, one runs up against a great many vested interests. first, one has the would-be legislators, such as my hon. friend the member for pollok, my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse), and now the hon. member for buckingham (mr. benyon). these are the people who refuse to see the need in human terms and who use their law-making power to make it difficult for women to obtain an abortion, and sometimes even claim they do not want to encourage \"promiscuity\", as it is called. secondly, we have some members of the medical profession who find abortions tiresome, who feel threatened by the idea of abortion on request, and who use the law to maintain its power by giving the doctor, usually a man, the privilege of defining the legality of each case—and in private medicine that means charging high prices and making unjustifiable profits from abortions.\\n           one of the myths used by anti-abortionists, and often used in debates in this house, is that abortion violates some age-old and god-given natural law. yet until 100 years ago almost nobody—not even the catholic church—punished abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. the greek city states and ancient rome, the foundations of western civilisation, made abortion the basis of a well-ordered population policy. thus, in some way or another women have always been the victims of expedience, depriving them of their natural rights.\\n           it was christianity that infused the foetus with a soul, but during 18 centuries of debate the church took the conveniently loose view that the foetus became animated by the rational soul, and abortion was therefore a serious crime—at 40 days after conception for a boy, and 80 days for a girl. no methods of sex determination were specified, but here is an early example of sex discrimination. english common law by the thirteenth century settled into a fairly tolerant acceptance of an abortion up until quickening—the unspecific moment, usually in the fifth month, when the women feels the foetus move.\\n           in the united states for a long time the common law inherited from england protected the rights of abortion in early pregnancy. suddenly in the nineteenth century things tightened up. in 1869 pope pius ix eliminated the distinction between an animated and non-animated foetus, and since then the catholic church has called all abortion murder and punished it severely. anti-abortion laws were first passed in britain in 1803 and became stricter through the century.\\n           there were three main reasons why abortion suddenly became a crime. the first was a decent reason. abortion until recently was a dangerous operation: crude methods, antiseptics scarce, dirty hospitals. it was in part the mid-nineteenth century wave of humanitarianism that pressed for abortion laws to protect women from the dangers of having an abortion. i would remind those who support this bill that those reasons do not exist today.\\n           the second motive was less laudable. biologists in the nineteenth century began to understand conception and women began to practise more effective contraception. catholic countries, such as france, began \"losing\" the then population race, and the church wanted to keep its mothers in the running. so the church itself turned to biology and used the idea that \"life\", and therefore soul-infused life, began at fertilisation. this reasoning also spread to england and america. at that time english and american industries needed workers—we did not have the unemployment we have today—the huge farmable territories of the new world needed farmers, and the american civil war depleted america\\'s labour crop. abortion laws saw to it that woman took her place outside the other machines of a developing economy.\\n           in britain we broke away finally from these cruel ideas in 1967. pressure to do so came from the general public, national medical associations and distinguished doctors, as well as those hon. members who were fundamentally humanitarian and progressive. yet today we have this bill, which represents a threat to millions of women, particularly to millions of working women.\\n           there are no perfect laws to deal with abortion, no tidy situations in such a human condition. how easy it would be if that were the case! how easy it would be if every set of problems could be put through a super computer and the perfect answer provided! if that were the case, there would be no need for members of parliament. with abortion we have to balance one sad situation against another, and endeavour, by applying our experience and knowledge, to do what is best.\\n           women and only women should be supported in the abortion situation—not the unborn. i believe that the amendment bill of the hon. member for pollok has held up women\\'s right to choose for at least a couple of decades. this bill seeks to strengthen that situation. as women members of parliament we are constantly placed in the situation of having to hold on to what we have got in the 1967 act, which is now out-dated, rather than making proper progress with women\\'s rights.\\n           it is proper for christian groups to seek to persuade women that abortion is wrong and to point out that it has mental and medical dangers. the views of such people are sincerely held. i do not doubt that. but it must be said that some of the propaganda from the anti-abortion organisations such as spuc, some of the things that are said by its supporters in this house, are not only terrifying but, frankly, untrue. they are interested not in rational argument, in women\\'s condition, or in women\\'s rights. their mind is made up and they use any dreadful propaganda to terrify, but hardly any which might inform.\\n           one of the things which strikes me, as a feminist, is that for all their self-righteous talk of morality there is not one word of sympathy for women from these organisations. billions of words have been coming out of the printing machines but not one has said that this is a woman\\'s right. there is no woman member of this house who is pro-abortion. women are the givers of life. to women abortion is a terrible thing. but sometimes a woman has to make that terrible choice, and i say that that choice should be hers alone.\\n           those who feel that abortion is wrong in all circumstances are entitled to continue to try to persuade women to accept their views. but they should not expect to use this house and the laws of this land in an anti-woman way. but that is the object of this bill.\\n           the bill is bitterly resented by women outside this house, by the tuc, the labour party conference, the labour women\\'s advisory committtee and, perhaps more importantly, by the women\\'s groupings and progressive pressure groups that would not touch party politics with a barge pole. after listening to abortion debates in this house, it is not difficult to understand why there are not more women members of parliament. i hope that women listening to the debate will think it worth while to go through party politics to join us in this house, because when it comes to the vote at 4 o\\'clock today i fear that there will not be sufficient women to ensure that this dreadful bill is stopped.\\n           abortion concerns only women, not men. that is the message of my speech. one of the most fatuous remarks on this issue was uttered in a previous abortion debate by a male member of parliament who said that it was no more necessary for a committee on abortion to be comprised entirely of women than it was for the finance bill to be considered only by chartered accountants. however, it is possible for anyone to acquire a knowledge of accountancy. it is still impossible for a man, even a member of parliament, to have a baby.\\n           this bill attacks women\\'s abortion rights. i hope that the hon. member for buckingham and his hon. friends the members for birmingham, edgbaston (mrs. knight) and lancaster who have, with others, produced this bill will withdraw it. that would be the decent and civilised thing to do.\\n        ',

medicine before arts and law and i saw in those three experiences the effects of unintended conception. i saw the effects of abortions and the circumstances in which they had to be carried out. i saw the effect of crime on those who were forced to have more children than they could emotionally, rationally or financially cope with, and i saw the effects on those who had married, not always because they wanted to, but because they happened to have an unintended conception.\\n           i do not care whether abortion is considered right or wrong in or out of marriage. the problem is as big in marriage as it is outside it. it is probably more in the interests of the stability of marriage that that should be recognised. it is natural for men and women to make love. the process which results in a conception is regarded as a natural part of marriage if not a natural part of it outside of marriage. it is also natural for people to make mistakes, however good the precautions are.\\n           the question then arises whether it is wrong to correct those mistakes. no woman wants, and probably no man wants, an unintended conception. we have to accept that there are those who take the view, as a matter of doctrine, that abortion in any circumstances is wrong, just as christian scientists take the view, i understand, that surgery in any circumstances is wrong.\\n           while they are entitled to have their view and may accept it as an article of faith to which they adhere, nevertheless i do not believe that they have the right to force that doctrine on anyone else, or to claim that they are taking a higher moral stance than anyone else. i object to those who say—and i regret that they often say it puritanically—\"you enjoyed the act, and this is your punishment for indulging in it\". that is part of the thinking behind the bill, and i reject it.\\n           i object to those who will not face the moral responsibility in saying to someone \"so you are pregnant—it serves you right. now go and deal with it.\" no one wants an unintended conception, but many women have the misfortune to have one.\\n           the matter is surrounded with emotion, and there is no better way of demonstrating it, i believe, than this. the law in scotland before the 1967 act was the common law, which covered all medical acts. a doctor could perform an abortion just as he could take out a tooth or an appendix, if he thought that it was medically right to operate. that was the law of scotland, and not one person of any faith ever complained that the law was wrong.\\n

desperately needed to be changed. he had just won his seat at a by-election, and it would have looked absurd for a scottish liberal member to be amending the law of england only. but nobody of any faith objected to the law as it stood at that time in scotland, which enabled the civilised, ethical and sensible work of professor sir dugald baird to be carried on in aberdeen.\\n           it was because the 1967 act frustrated a sensible and civilised law that i was first moved to set up birth control clinics to try to prevent unintended conception and also to see what could be done for those people who inevitably got themselves into a situation that they never wanted. anyone who says that these people should never have had intercourse in the first place is taking a thoroughly unrealistic, unpleasant and impossible stance.\\n           i regret this bill for various reasons, first, because it does grave damage to the trust of the medical profession. what is a person in my constituency to do, and what will doctors who normally ask their partners for a second opinion do, when under the bill this will be forbidden? what will happen in a town with only one practice, or in those places where there is only one doctor? even worse, what will happen in a town that has two practices? people will say to parents \"i saw your daughter in the surgery of dr. so-and-so, but i thought she was with dr. so-and-so. what was she doing there?\"\\n           the pressures on a pregnant girl are appalling. the bill is thoroughly immoral, irresponsible and unthoughtout, as anyone who has ever had anything to do with these problems would agree. the bill envisages that a policeman should be able to look at files if he applies to a crown court judge. i find this offensive.\\n           anyone who seeks to amend the law should find out what the present law is. my hon. friend the member for buckingham (mr. benyon) does not know what the law is in scotland, because in scotland we do not have crown courts. it is very dangerous, when people are trying to change the law and are taking a moral stance that they do not know the law that they are trying to change.\\n           the bill offends many of the principles in which i believe. it will increase bureaucracy and state interference in private lives. it will frustrate the intended medical benefits and make it more diffi- cult for a girl to get an abortion quickly. the bill pretends that it does not want abortions to be carried out at a later stage than they are at present, but it makes it inevitable that abortions will be done later or not at all.\\n           lastly, i think that there is, dressed up in a pretence of doing right, an attempt to try to make it impossible to terminate unintended conceptions. i cannot believe in all morality that it is wrong to terminate unintended conceptions. a bill that makes it more difficult, more expensive, or impossible to do so will create a major misery.\\n        ',

perthshire (mr. fairbairn) has made one of the most powerful speeches of the debate, if not the most powerful, because he knew what he was talking about. i deeply deplore the terms in which the hon. member for buckingham (mr. benyon) spoke because he has clearly neither done his homework nor based the bill on the evidence in front of him.\\n           we should all understand that whatever we do in the house women will still obtain abortions. it does not matter one hoot what we do. they have always obtained them in the past. it has been easier for richer women to get abortions than for poorer women. that was the basis of the abortion law reform society, which came into existence precisely because the law as it then stood was a law for the rich. it benefited the rich, and poor women had to go to the back streets to undergo all kinds of bloody surgery at the hands of butchers. the 1967 act was primarily due to pressure from the abortion law reform society. the right hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles, (mr. steel) had the advantage that the government gave time in the house, for without that on his side that bill would never have become an act.\\n           the 1967 act has been on the statute book for 10 years, but it is premature for the house to say either that it has failed or to claim that the abuses which undoubtedly occurred after the act was passed have not been removed. there are probably still some abuses taking place, primarily in the private sector. we hear a lot from conservative members about the merits of the private sector in cases of all kinds, but on the question of abortion, where life and death are concerned, the medical profesion are making profits out of women's bodies. the hon. member for buckingham seeks to pretend that the bill is out to curb the abuses, but it is doing nothing of the kind.\\n           there are one or two points which i wish to make, but i promise to make a short speech and i shall try to stick to our agreement. i do not think that sufficient emphasis has been put on the letter sent to the prime minister by 1,200 doctors, which was referred to by my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short). the importance of that letter is incalculable, not only because of the merit of those who signed it but because of its content. this is what is said: women would be more likely to seek abortion illegally, commercially or even abroad if the bill became law.\\n           that is the view of these most eminent gynaecologists and experts in the matter, writing to the prime minister. they do not put their names lightly to any letter containing such words. they went on to say—i take this from the report in the times —that the bill ignored the main issue and sought merely to increase bureaucratic devices for further restricting access to legal and safe abortion. the implementation of 'this unnecessary bill' would result in the very reverse of what its supposed supporters claimed for it. it would also infringe civil liberties by allowing police access to confidential medical records. i ask the house to note that. leading spokesmen of the tory party, including lord hailsham and the leader of the opposition herself, are going about the country saying that personal liberty is at stake under this government. what about clause 9 of the bill? for the first time in our history, i believe, it infringes one of the most sacred of our individual liberties, the right of confidentiality between patient and personal doctor.\\n           the police are to have access to medical records, even on suspicion. merely even if they have a suspicion, they must have access to the records. how tory members can put their names to that sort of provision and then go about the country saying that liberty is at stake under this wicked labour government, i do not know. if they wish to adhere to that sort of principle, they had better keep quiet about such things.\\n           i said earlier that rich women have always been able to get abortions. there are people at the highest levels in our land who have access to abortion clinics and have used them. let no one say, therefore, that this bill is anything but a class measure designed to penalise ordinary working people, and especially women. for that reason, i hope that all my right hon. and hon.

there have been debates on television, and there have been articles in newspapers and magazines.\\n           the argument goes on, and there is no doubt that it will not stop until parliament passes a bill to amend the 1967 act. indeed, it may not stop even then, for that will depend on the content of the amending act. however, i have no doubt that the pressure outside this place must eventually result in an act amending the one which the house passed in 1967.\\n           it is not surprising that the argument continues, for we are here dealing with the most basic issue of all—life and death. i strongly repudiate the suggestion that the bill is either a class measure or a measure introduced because we have some feeling that a girl who has an unplanned pregnancy must be forced to go through with it as some sort of punishment. not one of us supports the bill for such reasons. it deals with a matter of life and death. the question is whether one human being has the right to get rid of another simply because that other human being is inconvenient.\\n           i was not a member of the select committee, but i have read its reports extremely carefully. in support of what i have just said, the committee heard evidence of one case where an abortion was sought for no other reason than that the girl who sought it felt that her wedding dress would be too tight if she was not allowed the abortion.

not too worried about the abortion, she will not be harmed by it—or, indeed, by having the child. but the sensitive woman or girl for whom producing an illegitimate child is a truly terrifying thing

professional counsellors are there to help. we care very deeply about a woman who has a pregnancy that she finds inconvenient. this particular organisation, as i well know, is most anxious to help. the service is free. already 150 girls a week go to lifeline either from gps or sometimes because an advertisement has caught their eye, or sometimes they are referred by social or medical social

six-month gestation baby. she, with the other nurses, was working and helping and trying to bring on the child. anyone who has spoken to a nurse caring for a premature baby would know that the love for that child is clear in her face. her job is in trying to save that child. this nurse told me that the child involved, a little boy called paul, would pull through. at the same time as he was in the incubator she had to deal with an aborted child of six-months\\' gestation period who looked very much like the child she was trying to save.\\n           she came to me and asked \"how can i do

that the intention of the bill to save these babies is entirely without support in some parts of the house.\\n           my final point deals with clause 5. in committee i tried to move an amendment on the conscience clause because i was worried about it, as i well might have been. what worries me more than a little—with the greatest respect for my hon. friend the member for buckingham (mr. benyon)—is that the new conscience clause does not precisely get over my concern about what is happening.\\n           what the conscience clause in the original bill says is: no person shall be under any duty to participate in any treatment authorised by this act to which he has a conscientious objection. it is right to draw the attention of the house to the fact that that does not stop authorities from failing to appoint doctors who have conscientious objections. i turn briefly to the first report from the select committee. the evidence there was absolutely overwhelming that people had been denied jobs in gynaecology because of their consciences. the report contains a letter from a doctor who says: i am a catholic, aged 33, and a medical practitioner with five years post-graduate training in obstetrics and gynaecology, and a member of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists. recently, i have applied for registrar appointments at three university teaching hospitals and have been unsuccess ful. at each interview i have been asked my views on the abortion law and have stated my conscientious objection to abortion on demand. at my last appearance before an appointments board i was directly asked if my coscientious objection was due to religious conviction. after the interview was over i was recalled by a member of the committee, himself a catholic and told that although i was the most senior and well qualified of the group shortlisted i was told that i was not given the job as i was a catholic. it was considered that to give me the job would be doing me a long term disservice and i was directly told that \\'there is now no place for a catholic obstetrician or gynaecologist in the united kingdom\\'\". that is a terrifying thing.\\n

cases in which highly trained and well qualified doctors have been forced to leave the united kingdom because they are catholics.…  i am extremely angry and frustrated …i fully understand and respect those who believe the abortion law to be right but i have always thought, perhaps naïvely, that britain respected all shades of opinion. there is another letter which is from a shropshire doctor about a practising obstetrician and a non-catholic telling him: it is impossible for a catholic to become a gynaecologist in the nhs at present. that is truly alarming.\\n           there have been other instances. a doctor from dublin who applied for an nhs post in oxford was not even short listed, although he was an outstanding candidate, a gold-medallist. it turned out that there were on the appointing board two people who would in no circumstances appoint a doctor who would not do abortions. in fact, that doctor was not a catholic, but there was a down on him from the outset because he came from dublin. he was not asked whether he was a catholic, but because he came from dublin he was not to be given the job. he was not a catholic.\\n           anyone who reads the select committee report will see that nurses have similarly been in great difficulty. one witness was directly asked by the chairman whether there was a danger that men and women of the highest calibre, possessed of the best possible instincts, desirous of entering the healing profession in order to save life, may be deterred from practising gynaecology or obstetrics in these conditions? is there a danger of that? the answer was: i am sure this is the case. that is a terrible thing to have to read. if people from kampala, new york or elsewhere were denied jobs because of their place of origin, there would be an outcry, just as there would be an outcry if others were denied jobs because of their convictions. but in this one respect it is supposed to be all right.\\n           i trust that the bill will

being lucky enough to secure a high place in the ballot. i also congratulate him on the cool and dispassionate way in which he covered a topic which arouses strong emotions and feelings from both points of view.\\n           but my congratulations must end there, because i find myself in very nearly fundamental disagreement with the purpose of the bill and the way in which it is framed. i was not a member of the select committee, nor was i a member of the house when the earlier debates took place. therefore, my contribution is more concerned with the practical implications of the legislation in the country at large and in the west midlands in particular.\\n           we have heard today that the bill will restrict the availability of abortions on three grounds; first, by changing the wording of the provision on eligibility for abortion; secondly, by shortening the period during which abortions may take place; thirdly, by restricting the terms concerning the approvals required from doctors before an abortion can legally be performed.\\n           no doubt the sponsors had worthy and worthwhile motives for introducing the bill. certainly, there have been unattractive features of abortion in this country since 1967–the touting for custom at heathrow airport, the standards of medical care in certain clinics, the need for an effective conscience clause for doctors and nurses, and above all, the need for pregnant women to receive unbiased and even-handed counselling. but most of those reasons are either of historic interest, because they have already been tackled, or they are being tackled. the minister of state referred to at least two.\\n           it seems to me that supporters of the bill have forgotten the extreme difficulty with which women obtain abortions in the national health service in some parts of the country, even under the present legislation. my hon. friend the member for dorking (sir g. sinclair) referred to this. the birmingham area, for part of which i have the honour to sit, is notorious in this respect. with only 13 per cent. of total abortions in the nhs, birmingham has one of the lowest proportions of any area in the country. i wonder why.\\n           my hon. friend the member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine) referred to the moral suasion for people to participate in abortion activities. i have no doubt that in the birmingham area the reverse is true. there are a few senior gynaecologists there, led, i regret to say, by the professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at one of the leading teaching hospitals in the area, who are strongly opposed to abortion on any grounds.\\n           their leader is on record as saying that if a woman is going to have a complicated, difficult pregnancy, he will make a bed available for nine months. it is not for me to quarrel with the good professor's medical views, but his nine months are only the first part of childbearing. there is the birth, and the difficulty of child-rearing. for the first 16 to 20 years of the child's life the mother has to keep the child, often in inadequate housing and financial conditions. the good professor has entirely failed to see the major problem.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.145', 75, 'uk.m.16836', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN',

thank my hon. friend for his intervention, but i am rather twixt the devil and the deep blue sea. the chair wants me to hurry and my hon. friend is asking me to explain something. certainly, there is a code of practice, but my point is that young doctors participating in abortion activities find that their careers are being blighted. one of them said that it was not a good thing in the birmingham area to be seen to be in favour of abortions, because the word goes round and a career is damaged. that is a great shame.\\n           i have already mentioned the low proportion of abortions on the nhs in the birmingham area, but birmingham is by no means the worst area. other areas have the following figures: sandwell, 12·4 per cent.; walsall, 11·6 per cent.; wolverhampton, 9·2 per cent.; dudley, 7·5 per cent. i have talked to many doctors in the metropolitan borough of walsall before today's debate, and they say that there is no point in sending a pregnant woman to an nhs hospital for an abortion unless she fulfils one of two criteria. one is that she is under 16 and the other is that she suffers from a chronic illness, such as heart disease or tuberculosis.\\n           therefore, she must go to the birmingham pregnancy advisory service, which costs £60. for many women in my constituency that is a great deal of money to find, especially in the short period during which an abortion can be performed. it is true that the bpas has done a great deal to provide finance for women who have difficulty raising the money required. if the activities of the bpas are restricted and smothered by new legislation and restrictions, many women in the west midlands area will be unable to obtain the abortions they earnestly require.\\n           i turn now to the question of post-abortion mental disturbance, which has been very much stressed by the proponents of the bill. in the current issue of the british medical journal there is an article about the incidence of post-abortion psychosis. the study covered 21 consultant psychiatrists in the west midlands and 1⅓ million people and lasted for 15 months. the incidence of post-abortion psychosis was 0·3 per 1,000 legal abortions. the incidence of puerperal psychosis, which, i understand, is postnatal depression, was 1·7 per 1,000 deliveries. in other words, nearly six times as many women suffer from postnatal depression as suffer from depression after abortion. that was a thorough study which i shall not go into in detail. it covered many people and many psychiatrists.\\n           therefore, the two main premises advanced for the bill are not founded in the west midlands. it is not easy for women to obtain abortions, and the view that women suffer psychologically from abortion is disproved by the fact that women suffer more from childbirth than they do from legalised abortion.\\n           i conclude by referring to two matters which have been mentioned by other speakers. the first is the question of freedom of choice. the woman's position is absolutely critical. she suffers the strain of childbirth and takes prime responsibility for rearing the child. therefore, her rights and requirements must be taken into account in framing legislation.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.147', 3, 'uk.m.22530', 'uk.p.Con', 1,

walsall area health authority in reply to my request concerning the waiting list for abortions. the letter states: there is of course no real waiting list for abortions. these have to be carried out as early as possible in pregnancy and if the abortion is not immediately available in the walsall area some of these patients will go to wherever the service is available, if they can make the necessary arrangements and find finances, or just have the unwanted baby. if women have to traipse the country or go to europe for abortions, or bring into the world an unwanted, unloved, uncared for

because of the area in which they lived, should have an unwanted baby. i absolutely agree with him. but it is desperately sad that it should be necessary to have this debate at all. perhaps the most saddening feature of my three years as a member of the house is that we have had to have three unwanted debates on abortion—unwanted because any abuses have been or are being cleared up by the department, and the abuses which still exist concern the lack of facilities and geographical spread of those facilities in the national health service.\\n           it is terrifying that we should be considering a bill which does nothing but restrict the right of women to an abortion under the abortion act 1967 and at a time when more than 30 other countries are relaxing their abortion laws, going much further than we are even considering going, with the exception of one or two countries in eastern europe which are taking retrograde steps. i should have thought that the hon. member for buckingham (mr. benyon) would have felt a little uneasy about welcoming that sort of action by countries which the opposition normally call illiberal. i would deplore any further illiberality, not only in other respects, but in respect of abortion.\\n           i shall take only a few minutes because so many other hon. members wish to speak. in this debate and the discussion that preceded it in the country it has been alleged by those who support the bill that many women get pregnant and have abortions for frivolous reasons. i beg the house to believe that this is not so. i am sure that no woman would deliberately get pregnant on the basis that she could get an abortion quickly.\\n           we have heard the tales of the hon. member for birmingham, edgbaston (mrs. knight) who, unfortunately, is no longer here, and the frivolous stories that she said she has heard. i believe that they are frivolous. if the hon. lady is to be believed and there is a young woman who wants an abortion simply so that she can continue to play tennis, she will no doubt come from a class or area where she can get that abortion, whether it is immediately available or not. the people whom we are seeking to protect are those who need early, safe and legal abortions, as far as possible under the nhs.\\n           i am deeply saddened that the bill has been brought forward at all. it is a forbidding bill in the most literal sense of the word and is littered with words such as \"punishment\", \"offence\", \"guilt\", \"refuse\", \"fines\" and \"convictions\". the word \"fines\" is mentioned 20 times in the eight pages of the 13-clause bill. it is a forbidding bill and that is how those of us who want to protect the 1967 act see it.\\n           the clause which requires a woman to obtain the consent of two doctors from different practices will be most restrictive for many women. london, birmingham and the great conurbations have been mentioned, but imagine a woman living in a village where there may be only one doctor or a small group practice. if she does not have a sympathetic gp, she will have to go to a second doctor and suffer all the embarrassment and emotional upheaval of explaining again—and this time to a stranger—what has happened and what she wants. the woman will also face the possibility of her family finding out, if they do not know, and her friends knowing what has happened. the clause can do nothing but deter women from seeking abortions when they are needed.\\n           the other particularly dangerous provision is in clause 9. it is incredible that this house, the so-called bastion of democracy, should be even thinking of giving power to the police to investigate records, take away doctors\\' files and break that confidential link which has always existed between doctor and patient and which we should jealously preserve. it is monstrous, not only because women and doctors are involved but from the point of view of civil liberties.\\n           when we hear in this country and in others about police interference, we are up in arms about it, but we are now actually considering introducing some kind of law whereby the police may go into clinics and national health service hospitals. the bill is unclear on that point, because it contains so many negatives and double negatives. if the bill is enacted with this clause the whole tradition of confidentiality between doctor and patient will come to nought. i appeal to the house to throw out the bill. it is ill-considered and ill-drawn. it is a bad bill.\\n           i appeal especially to my hon. friends to remember that a large number of bodies within the labour movement are on record as wishing to preserve the 1967 act. the trade union congress, the annual conference of the labour party, the annual conference of labour women, the national women\\'s advisory committee and a large number of individual unions have expressed that wish. the labour movement will be bitterly disappointed if we vote to support a bill of this kind which seeks to take away from women the rights that they have now had for 10 years and which the supporters of the 1967 act wish to see preserved.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.152', 368, 'uk.m.19401', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i have followed the

important to bear that in mind. today we are discussing a bill which is aimed at tightening up the abuses which some people believe to exist under the abortion act. i confess to the house, perhaps because of my background as a doctor, that i am always conscious that, however legally justified and however much we may wrap it up in words, we are, of course, discussing the taking of human life.\\n           i vividly recall an eminent gynaecologist saying to me \"it is all very well for you to fill in the forms\"—and i have had to fill in abortion forms in my time—\"but i actually have to do

of today\\'s debate.\\n           there is no doubt that there are still very serious abuses of the act, that there is far too much commercial gain and far too much exploitation of women for private

other issue that i can think of in recent years. i am sure that we all want to see these abuses stopped.\\n           the crucial question is whether the bill could substantially reduce those abuses, without—and this is most important—harming the main intentions of the abortion act by making legal abortion more difficult and pushing abortion back into the back streets again. that is the question

although it would be desirable to hear as many contributors as possible, we must appreciate that the house of commons moves within a certain framework.\\n           i am not surprised that there is such a clamour to speak on this bill, which necessarily has aroused, as do all measures on the subject of abortion, a great deal of emotion, since it deals with matters of life and death. i am not surprised, as one is seeking to reconcile the predicament of the woman who is in grave trouble and under great pressure with the wish to preserve the sanctity of life. in endeavouring to resolve such conflicts, inevitably there are bound to be a variety of opinions as to how the conclusion can be reached.\\n           i am grateful to my hon. friend the member for reading, south (dr. vaughan) for bringing the house back to the details of the bill. it is clear that if, on the one hand, we insist that we wish to have abortion on request and, on the other hand, seek to have the abortion only if the mother\\'s life is in danger, we see a total confrontation between the two sections of opinion. we live in a plural society in which we must take account of both views, but we have to seek legislation—which means that we must reach a consensus as best we can on a matter in which nobody can be fully satisfied.\\n           it is important that we look at this bill to see whether we can assauge that large section of public opinion that is clearly fiercely opposed to the way the existing act is operating without trespassing upon the fundamental principles within the 1967 act. i would rather look at the bill and see how it attempts to meet that need, and to reach that possible consensus.\\n           the first clause is the test clause, because it says explicitly that late abortions, as late as 20 weeks, should not take place. is anyone prepared to say that he finds it satisfactory that each year 1,000 unborn children who are capable of living outside the womb—i do not like to use the word \"viable\"—are slain?\\n           a session or so ago a bill of which i was a co-sponsor took the necessary action to ensure that an unborn child which received injuries as a consequence of the negligence of someone was protected. the house was ready to mobilise itself to deal with the problem of thalidomide children, of children who suffered within the womb. yet it can be extraordinarily complacent when those selfsame children are to be killed. that is not a tenable position. it is not good in moral terms and it is not good for the women concerned.\\n           the select committee had abundant evidence telling it of the seriousness of these late abortions. we had abundant evidence from sir john peel, president of the royal college, all of it stressing that there should be a limitation upon the late abortion. there is no civilised country in the world that permits an abortion to take place at 28 weeks. if we are trying to still the abortion controversy and to meet the demands of those who empathise with the unborn child, it is sheer folly to be so inflammatory as to say that the figure is only 1 per cent., as the minister did. it represents 1,000 children.\\n           the clause attempts to deal with the position revealed by the evidence which the select committee took, which made it clear that there was a need for some elasticity to deal with those cases where, until the pregnancy had lasted for 22 weeks or so, it might not be possible accurately to diagnose whether the child had suffered a deformity or disability.\\n           i say to hon. members whose opinions i respect and who try to say this is a class matter that the children who are being killed belong to every class. they are not exclusive to the wealthy or the poor. for me a child is a child whether he is born in a palace or a manger.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1977, 2, 25, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1977-02-25.4.1.197', 71, 'uk.m.22059',

and for connected purposes.\\n           it is a tragedy that, in some countries, the words “it’s a girl” are not always a source of joy but sometimes of danger. the abortion of baby girls occurs in huge numbers simply because of their gender. the un states that it is a problem of “genocide proportions”, with one expert estimating that gendercide has cost the lives of about 200 million women and girls worldwide over the past 30 years.\\n           the practice is pervasive in china. the country’s one-child policy and its traditional preference for boys have led to widespread abandonment, infanticide and forced abortions. china now has 37 million more young males than females. we hear of towns and villages where young men outnumber young women by up to 30:1. quoting china’s official figures, the financial times stated recently that there have been 330 million abortions since the one-child policy was introduced—a policy tragically indirectly aided and abetted for many years by funds provided by successive british governments.\\n           similarly, there are markedly more males than females in india, with various regions facing serious and growing gender imbalances. the murder of a student who was gang-raped on a delhi bus at the end of last year sparked outrage across india and shone a spotlight on the place of women in indian society. that and the country’s long history of expensive dowry gifts on the marriage of a daughter are among the factors that are resulting in the illegal but widespread practice of female gendercide.\\n           female gendercide in such countries is fuelling human trafficking and sexual slavery. it is resulting in tragic practices such as the kidnapping, sale and imprisonment of young girls in places far from their home towns to act as so-called “wives”. such avoidance of female births is gender discrimination in its worst form. it constitutes violence against women even before they have a chance to live.\\n           why am i relating these tragic situations in this place today, when so many members are well aware of them and condemn them? the reason is that if we are to condemn gendercide in countries such as china and india, we must be ready to condemn and challenge any suggestion that gendercide is taking place in the uk. i acknowledge and respect the wide range of sincerely held views on abortion, but such wider discussions are not the subject of this ten-minute rule motion. the motion seeks to draw the house’s attention to indications that illegal gendercide appears to be taking place in this country. i hope that the house can unite in registering profound shock at even the possibility that that it is happening, in whatever proportion.\\n           the house will have seen early-day motion 936, an all-party motion that i tabled on this topic. it has attracted more than 50 supportive signatures. i am\\n           therefore confident that the concerns about this issue are shared by a number of members from all parties in the house.\\n           on 8 january , the department of health confirmed in a written answer to my noble friend lord alton of liverpool that there are discrepancies in the balance between the number of boys and girls born in the uk to some groups of women that\\n           “potentially fall outside of the range considered possible without intervention.”—[  official report, house of lords, 8 january 2013; vol. 742, c. wa2 .]\\n           that indicates that there may be evidence that a significant number of abortions are taking place on the grounds of gender or sex selection, a practice that is wholly illegal in this country. any doctor who performed a termination on that basis would potentially be committing a criminal offence.\\n           i welcome the decision of ranjit bikhu and other british asian women to establish a campaign to challenge anti-girl and anti-life attitudes and practices. it must never be a matter of choice to end the life of a girl merely because of her gender.\\n           an investigation by the daily telegraph in 2012 uncovered strong evidence, including filmed evidence, that doctors at some british clinics are agreeing to terminate pregnancies by arranging abortions on the grounds of gender and to produce the relevant paperwork. the investigation also exposed a practice termed “family balancing”, with boys being aborted too, thus stretching the possibility of gendercide taking place in the uk well beyond certain cultural groups. one doctor, highly experienced in this field, said he believes the practice is “fairly widespread”.\\n           technological advancements in prenatal diagnostic tests now enable the gender of a fetus to be determined at 10 weeks’ gestation. as that technology continues to develop and becomes widely available, there is much concern that it will increase requests for abortions when the gender of an unborn child is not what a mother or father were hoping for.\\n           my bill reminds the police and the crown prosecution service that abortion on the grounds of gender is illegal in this country, and it calls on the department of health to put in place procedures to record the gender of babies aborted under the provisions of the abortion act 1967, once the sex can be determined. the bill would also impose tougher penalties on anyone found to have facilitated the abortion of a child because of its gender, or made arrangements to travel overseas for such an outcome. in addition, it calls for further consideration of the practice and implications of the wide, deeply concerning and, in some countries, extensive practice of female gendercide overseas.\\n           here in the united kingdom, a country that prides itself on striving for gender equality and tackling discrimination in all its forms, any indication of this most fundamental form of gender discrimination and violence against women must surely be investigated further. a key purpose of my bill is to highlight concerns about abortion on the grounds of sex selection taking place in the uk, and to remind us all, whether regulators, prosecuting authorities, doctors, the department of health or, crucially, ministers, that we cannot turn a blind eye to the issue and should be proactive in preventing, challenging and stopping it as something that is wholly unacceptable in the uk, as well as abroad.\\n           before i say “i commend this bill to the house”, this would until yesterday have been the end of my speech. quite remarkably, however, bearing in mind the fact that my bill is called the abortion statistics bill as set down several weeks ago, just yesterday the department of health announced a consultation on abortion statistics and their publication. i would flatter myself by thinking there was any connection; none the less it gives me the opportunity to mention the issue. i understand that the department of health is seeking the public’s view on the publication of abortion statistics, in order—and i quote from its overview—\\n           “to ensure that the reports remain relevant and useful.”\\n           in the light of the causes for concern that i have highlighted today, i trust that the department will consider including in those statistics a record of the gender of babies aborted, if ascertainable. i hope that many responses by the public to the consultation will support that call.\\n           finally, in further support of my motion, i draw the house’s attention to the recent call by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe for members states to\\n           “collect the sex ratio at birth, monitor its development and take prompt action to tackle possible imbalances.”\\n           i understand that the department of health is currently finalising its response to the assembly on that issue, and i note the comment from the health minister earl howe that\\n           “this is an important piece of work and demonstrates how seriously this issue is being taken not just in this country but across europe.”\\n           let us ensure that we lead the way in monitoring, challenging and—most important—preventing this deeply worrying practice. i commend this bill to the house.\\n           question put and agreed to .\\n           ordered,\\n           that fiona bruce, dr thérèse coffey, ms margaret ritchie, mrs mary glindon, jim dobbin, robert flello, pat glass, mr virendra sharma, jim shannon, rosie cooper, daniel kawczynski and jeremy lefroy present the bill.\\n           fiona bruce accordingly presented the bill.\\n           bill read the first time;

kingdom, particularly the number of late abortions highlighted by the recent study group of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists; and calls upon the government to pay attention to the moral and ethical questions raised by abortion. \\n           a member of parliament may have to wait a considerable number of years before he is fortunate enough to have a motion called for debate. i could have decided to ask the house to debate the economy, which is of central concern to the nation, but the house spends virtually every day of every week discussing such issues.\\n           abortion is one issue of vital moral and ethical concern to millions of people which has not been discussed in the house for nearly five years. since that issue was last discussed, about 600,000 abortions have been performed. since the passing of the abortion act 1967, 2,234,326 abortions have been carried out — 145 every day of every year. as one person put it, \"it seems that the abortion act has got cancer.\" it has resulted in many more abortions being performed than the original sponsors of the 1967 legislation intended. for those reasons, i believe that it is my duty to give parliament an opportunity to debate this issue.\\n           the abortion issue raises classic arguments between principle and expediency. i shall deal, first, with the arguments of principle, then go on to the arguments of expediency and finally review the law as it stands.\\n           two questions are raised in the arguments of principle. first, is human life sacred? secondly, where does human life begin?\\n           the answer to the first question must be an unequivocal yes. human life is sacred to the christian who believes that every soul has a right to conscience so that it can know god. human life is sacred to the humanist who believes that, because life terminates with death, everyone has a right to life. i believe that human life is sacred because everyone has a right to life. the mentally retarded have as much right to life as the mentally normal. the old, the sick, the weak and the stupid have as much right to life as the young, the healthy, the strong and the clever.\\n           the second question is: where does human life begin? foetology has made great strides in recent years. ultra-scan techniques allow us to peer into the secret life of the womb. we know that the embryo is genetically complete at conception. we know that at the 25th day following conception the heart beats. we know that the bones are being formed by the sixth week and that by the 10th week all limbs are established. even to the layman\\'s eye, the foetus is obviously a human being. we know that at the 16th week the heart pumps about 50 pints of blood a day. we know that at the 20th week eyebrows and eyelashes have already formed. from the knowledge that has been built up during the past 20 years, we know that birth is an incident in a long-established process. a line cannot be drawn at any one stage — whether at six, 12 or 20 weeks, or even birth—at which one can say, \"this is where life begins.\" the only logical conclusion is that life begins at conception.\\n           another objection to these arguments is that life begins when it is capable of being sustained away from the mother. that begs other serious questions. is life sustainable immediately after birth when a baby is still reliant on outside support? a baby left in the womb would have a chance to survice. most important of all is the question: does dependence deny existence?\\n           a woman certainly has a right to choose to have, say, her appendix taken out. her appendix is dependent on her and can have no prospect of independent existence. does a woman have a right to choose to terminate the foetus, which is certainly dependent on her but which has the opportunity of independence in the future? those are two very different arguments.\\n           i should have thought that those arguments show that, if one looks at this issue purely from the point of personal principle, there can be only one answer—that abortion is wrong. however, many would say, \"although, speaking for myself, i may think that abortion is wrong, i am not prepared to impose my views on society.\"\\n           i do not want to deny the seriousness of the back-street abortion argument or to deny the pain and humiliation suffered under the previous law by many women through back-street abortions. i must, however deal with the moral argument put forward by the anti-abortionists who say, \"because burglaries will always take place, is that an argument for making them legal?\"\\n           one need not take the moral point of view alone. there is evidence that the 1967 abortion laws created a new clientele for abortion. society today is very different from society in 1967. birth control is universally available. society hopes to care and counsel women faced with unplanned pregnancies rather than to censure them.\\n           an interesting report published by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists in 1966 showed that, based on hospital admissions and deaths, there were about 14,000 illegal abortions in 1966. that compares with 128,000 abortions a year now. it is said by those in favour of abortion that the official statistics camouflage the real state of affairs. if that were the case, one would have expected the deaths to figure somewhere in the official statistics. in fact, the figures show that, although the number of deaths among women of child-bearing age was decreasing by 300 a year before 1967, in the first full year of the operation of the 1967 act the number increased.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0),

figures show that only about 2 per cent. of abortions are for genuine medical reasons, including rape. many people who are worried about the abortion legislation as it now operates would be prepared to provide for rape, but that would not affect the 108,000 abortions carried out last year under section 2.\\n           the main argument pursued by pro-abortionists is: better no child than an unwanted child. in modern britain there is and need be no such thing as an unwanted child. for every child there are 10 childless couples desperate to adopt. our want is not a reliable judgment as to whether a human life should be allowed to exist. there is no evidence to show that wanted children are not maltreated. dr. edward lenoski calculated that 91 per cent. of child abuse took place with wanted children. since the passing of the act, there have been 317,000 more children in care. the arguments about wanted or unwanted children are the same as those used in the pagan world about

advice on how life can be saved rather than on how it can be destroyed. the house has a duty and a right to speak up for the weak against the strong.\\n           i said that i would begin by looking at the arguments of principle and then of expediency. i wish briefly to review the law as it stands. the fundamental law on this subject is the offences against the person act 1861, which proscribed abortion. that was amended by the infant life (preservation) act 1929, which introduced the offences of child destruction or causing the death of a child capable of being born alive. that is an important point to which i wish to return later, because it is of significance to late abortions. the act was amended as a result of the case of regina v. bourne which decided that a woman's life depended upon physical and mental health as much as anything else.\\n           those acts were amended by the abortion act 1967. the abortion act provided four grounds for abortion—life saving, therapeutic, social and engenic. in 1983, out of 127,375 abortions, 108,806 — the vast majority — were performed under section 2, which relates to the risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the woman; only 538 abortions were perfomed under section 1, which relates to the risk to the life of a pregnant woman; and only 2,019 were carried out under the engenic section, which relates to the risk of birth of a severely abnormal baby.\\n           apart from the strongly pro-abortion lobby, there is almost universal anxiety about the number of late abortions. i am talking about abortions performed between the 24th and 28th weeks. advances in medical science have ensured that babies of fewer than 24 weeks gestational age can be born alive. as the times put it on 9 january 1984: every advance in obstetric techniques makes the present position less tenable. my reading of the acts, and that of many others, tells me —i hope that my right hon. and learned friend will comment on this point — that the infant life (preservation) act defines child destruction as the killing in utero of a child capable of being born alive regardless of gestational age. a baby aborted alive is covered by the law relating to homicide.\\n           i ask my right hon. and learned friend to comment on the view that it is unnecessary to have a new upper limit bill. all that the government need do is to circulate and inform area health authorities that, with the advances in medical science, the age of viability stands, according to the department of health and social security, at 20, 22 or 24 weeks and that abortions committed beyond that gestational period are illegal.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13'],

weeks.\\n           i do not believe that the sponsors of the original act wanted to see a close financial link between referral agencies and abortion clinics.\\n           on the conscience question, under english law, a person is innocent until proved guilty, but under the abortion legislation doctors are required to prove conscience. recently nurses have been sacked for refusing to insert instruments prior to an abortion, for refusing to fill in forms or for refusing to make appointments. there should be an absolute right for doctors and nurses with conscientious objections not to be involved in abortions.\\n           one of the most difficult areas considered in the recent amending bill was the tightening up of the sections of the 1967 act. in december 1979, during proceedings in standing committee c on the abortion (amendment) bill, the then solicitor-general dealt with the statistical argument. the act in general gives the right to carry out abortions if the risk of childbirth to a mother\\'s health is greater than the risk of her having an abortion. abolitionists claim that the figures prove that fewer women die from abortion than used to die from childbirth. that is true, but the figures are not comparable, because women who die during childbirth tend to be suffering from some gross abnormality, whereas those who die from abortion tend to be healthy young women who would have had a normal pregnancy.\\n           in 1979, the solicitor-general stressed the lack of yardsticks in determining relative risks. i believe that the statistical argument could be overcome by including in the 1967 act the words \"serious or substantial\". it is interesting to note that sir john peel, the queen\\'s gynaecologist, told the standing committee in 1979 that between 5 and 10 per cent. of women having abortions suffered sterility; that figure did not include abnormalities.\\n           in my review of the law, i have refrained from taking the absolutist line that all abortions are wrong. i have simply tried to review the law as it stands. politics being the art of the possible, i do not believe that one can take an absolutist line. there is a case for a step-by-step approach in this immensely important issue. parliament has a right to discuss it, and i hope that hon. members will support me for having given parliament that opportunity.\\n        ',

many years after the passing of an act that has been endorsed by the medical profession an hon. member should present ad nauseam the same old jejune arguments that the 1967 act rendered out of date. i shall not bother to respond to those old arguments, though the minister for health may feel the need to do so.\\n           as regards the new points raised in the motion of the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle, there are legal restrictions on late abortions. the clinics where terminations are carried out are controlled and inspected; an inspectorate was set up under the 1967 act.\\n           in 1975, the department of health and social security laid down that terminations in non-nhs premises should be performed after 20 weeks only if resuscitation equipment was available and staff were present on the premises to use it, thus obviating the danger to the mother. in 1980, the dhss wrote to all places that are approved to perform terminations saying that in cases of terminations where the stage of gestation was believed to be over 20 weeks or there was a reasonable possibility that it may become 20 weeks and the period of gestation was in doubt, an ultrasound scan should be performed. in the same year, the department also recommended that scans should be carried out on all women who were 16 weeks to 20 weeks pregnant, in the hope that the additional assurance of an ultrasound scan will serve both as a safeguard to patients and prove also to be in the best interests of both the operating doctors and the nursing home proprietors against the possibility of subsequent allegations being made that a foetus was viable at the time of termination. so strong regulations are laid down to control doctors working in private nursing homes.\\n

regard to what the bma says, and the association's handbook of ethics states: the doctor should recommend or perform termination after 20 weeks only if he is convinced that the health of the woman is seriously threatened or if the child will be seriously handicapped. that is a clear instruction to doctors.\\n           the latest figures from the department—for 1983—were published last year. they show that only 1·19 per cent. of terminations were performed at 20 to 23 weeks, and that only 0·19 per cent. were performed at 24 weeks or later. that puts the matter in perspective.\\n           we should congratulate all those involved and thank the dhss for what it is doing to control nursing homes. we should also congratulate the medical profession on ensuring that so few terminations take place after 20 weeks. we should be celebrating those facts instead of discussing this sort of motion. contrary to what the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle seems to think, the medical profession is carrying out its responsibilities.\\n           the other serious ground for late abortion is that there is likely to be permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the mother. it is a serious decision, whatever the hon. member and some of his supporters say, for both the woman and her doctor to terminate pregnancy at 24 weeks or later. one of the great benefits of the act is that it has encouraged terminations to take place by a much simpler process and much earlier, so there is much less risk to the mother.\\n           what does the hon. gentleman suggest should he done when lateness is the responsibility of the nhs and not the patient? the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, whom the hon. gentleman quoted twice in his speech, said that only last year—perhaps these are more up-to-date figures than the hon. gentleman has —over 20 per cent. of women who had terminations between 20 and 23 weeks had been medically referred for termination before the end of the 12th week. it is clear where the delay occurs—in the nhs machinery. had their terminations been carried out as soon as possible after the end of the 12th week, when they were referred, or as soon as is acceptable or desirable, they would have been terminated before the 14th week instead of at 20 to 23 weeks.\\n           therefore, i hope that the minister for health will discover why the delay occurs between consultation and operation in a small number of cases, which is obviously serious. it does not happen in the private sector where terminations are carried out very early. there is a considerable impetus for the private nursing homes to get their patients in as early as possible, and many of them are run precisely for carrying out that procedure alone. therefore, i must conclude that either there is poor organisation in the nhs or perhaps some consultants hope that the patients will be diverted into the private sector, where they have an interest in performing terminations in private nursing homes. there could be that profit motive for some of the less scrupulous members of the medical profession. i am certain that they are only a minority, but they exist and delays are caused.\\n           does the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle give any thought to the problem of the menopausal woman who does not always realise when she is pregnant, or the young girl who is similarly unaware? the latter perhaps does not want to accept the fact that she is pregnant and hopes that if she does nothing about it, it will go away. what about the mentally handicapped woman who becomes pregnant, perhaps because of rape, and who does not realise that she is pregnant? there are many such cases. they can lead to late terminations which, i emphasise, are a tiny proportion of the total number of terminations carried out.\\n           i hope that the minister will also examine this point. one of the most serious problems that is the responsibility of the nhs is the delay in carrying out amniocentesis. there is a problem for the older woman who is pregnant. amniocentesis is carried out to establish whether the child is likely to be handicapped. that is crucial to the older woman, who is at greater risk of producing a handicapped child. does the hon. gentleman wish to deny her the relief that the law allows?\\n           professor eva alberman, who is well known to the select committee because she was our epidemiologist specialist adviser when the select committee carried out an inquiry into perinatal mortality, recently published a report in the lancet which revealed that, in the absence of any other change in medical practice, a reduction in the legal age of foetal viability to 24 weeks would have meant that during 1982 a total of 26 abortions for seriously handicapping conditions could not have been carried out. a reduction to 22 weeks would have stopped 77 such abortions from being performed. professor alberman also referred to the importance of early diagnosis of foetal abnormality and yet found that in at least a proportion of the late abortions studied there were delays, some of which, she and others suggest, might have been avoidable both before and after the tests for abnormality.\\n           therefore, it is clear that the weight of medical opinion supports early terminations. the figures show that over 90 per cent. of terminations are carried out within the time limit prescribed by the act, and only a tiny proportion—less than 2 per cent. during the past four or five years—have been carried out later than the legal time limit provided for in the act. they are for serious cases where there is a late discovery of a suspected abnormality.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0),

few terminations, certainly in my region, are carried out under the nhs. nearly 5,000 legal abortions were carried out in the west midlands in three months up to december. of the 4,919 total, the vast majority — that is, 4,225 — were carried out privately in private nursing homes, where the operation is carried out for private profit and gain. only 694 were carried out under the health service in the whole of the west midlands region. therefore, there can be no argument that terminations, certainly in the west midlands region, are preventing other gynaecological cases from having the treatment that they require. it is much to be regretted that the private nursing homes can make so much money out of carrying out those operations, but the act provides for that.\\n           the overwhelming majority of terminations should be carried out early, well before the 20th week, many before the 12th and 14th week. there should be proper inspection of the private nursing homes. the house and the country as a whole should be satisfied that the provisions of the act can be carried out correctly and that there is no need for the present motion, which does not take account of the improvements in

to abortion where there is a serious risk—i am using my words carefully—to the life of the pregnant woman, or a risk of grave injury to her physical or mental health, or where there is substantial risk that the child, when born, would suffer from physical or mental abnormalities which would deprive it of any reasonable enjoyment of life.\\n           that, incidentally, was the view of the

abortion virtually on demand that the figures for criminal abortions were horrendous because, as the royal college pointed out at the time, the figures it gave were without any secure factual foundation\". they were guesstimates. nevertheless, i do not think that any one of us would deny that there was a serious situation in regard to criminal abortions and therefore an urgent need for legislation. the pity of it was that too little attention was paid to the wording of that measure.\\n           i was involved in those early debates and many moments stand out clearly in my mind. on 22 july 1966 the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale told the house that he simply wanted to get rid of back-street abortion. he added that it is not the intention of the promoters

was dr. gullick. they, too, gave clear guidance. but it is the business of parliament to make up its mind on these matters and nothing that the hon. gentleman has said weakens my argument that parliament\\'s failure to realise what was at stake led to serious difficulties.\\n           in those early debates i repeatedly warned that the legislation would lead to abortion on demand, and i was quite right. [hon. member: \"no.\"] i was indeed right, because the law has allowed abortion on demand. that is how it has been interpreted by a great many doctors. [interruption.] we shall not make much progress if there is a running commentary on every speech. i listened in silence to the speech of the hon. member for wolverhampton, north-east because i respect her greatly and wished to hear what she had to say. constant interruptions merely show a lack of conviction that one knows what it is all about; such chatter does not help parliamentary debate.\\n           week after week following the enactment of the bill, anxiety increased at the practices developing. for example, there were taxi touts at london airport picking up foreign women who wished to take advantage of the new law. those women were driven to abortion clinics which were able to pay the drivers generously out of the fat earnings which they were making from frightened women. i agree entirely that the whole matter should have been under the proper direction of the national health service from the start, and i said so at the time. it was not, and racket after racket developed. taxi touts were even stealing girls from other clinics. one driver took girls to a clinic in bournemouth although they had been booked for operations at a clinic in london.\\n           such was the public outrage and the ensuing row in parliament that the government were forced to set up the lane committee. that committee consisted entirely of people who had originally favoured abortion on request, just as the more recent warnock committee was made up of people who favoured the use of the human embryo as a guinea pig. such was the weight of evidence, however, that the lane committee was forced to admit that some doctors were practising abortion on demand. the fact that its members advocated no steps to prevent such practices was simply a measure of their views. they were also forced to admit that there was disappointingly little evidence to suggest that the legislation had stopped criminal abortions.

[interruption.] this method of conducting the debate does not help us to make progress.\\n           the select committee not only exposed the fact that abortion on demand was the order of the day, but suggested a number of amendments to the act to ease the situation. one involved the severing of financial links between abortion clinics and referral agencies. the committee also advocated strengthening the conscience clause and urged that parliament be given ample time to debate and vote on the criteria for abortion to establish whether we wished the law to be changed.\\n           it is to the everlasting shame of the government of the day that they failed to implement the main recommendations of the select committee. moreover, it is dishonest of the pro-abortion lobby to claim that repeated efforts to change the law in parliament have failed. they have failed for one reason alone — the perpetual and successful attempts to talk out every private member's bill.\\n           we must not declare that the abortion act has achieved nothing. however, one of its achievements is nothing to be proud of. it has resulted in the denial of life to some 2 million unborn children. in fact, while this debate is taking place, some 60 babies will be deprived of the right to life.\\n           ironically, the warnock committee was set up to deal with the problem of infertility. infertility has always been with us, but the problem has been thrust into the foreground because the natural and laudable desire of childless couples to adopt has been frustrated as there are no more babies available because, under the law, we are killing them in increasing numbers.\\n           there is another tragedy associated with infertility. it must be a very bitter thing for some women to have to bear. few of us can claim to have done nothing in life to cause us regrets. i know that i cannot. but comparatively few of us have to live with the fruits of our misdemeanours. what must make infertility hard to bear is the fact that in many cases it is avoidable. many cases of blockage to the tubes, for example, are avoidable. it is often caused by infection, which can result from previous abortion or sexually transmitted disease. secondly, while i believe in contraception, i wonder how many women fitted with the coil realise that it can make them barren.\\n           one of the most appalling aspects of women's right to choose, as it is often expressed, is the fact that they are not properly informed about what they are choosing. that is why i have always argued that there should be no connection whatever between abortion referral agencies and abortion clinics, because the one has a financial interest in the other.\\n           the hon. member for wolverhampton, north-east put her finger on the point long ago. if we are to have proper, therapeutic abortion in this country, it should have been controlled from the beginning under the nhs.\\n           people complain about the way things are going, but refuse to see what is happening under their very eyes. they refuse to see that the cheap and shoddy rarely supplies the answer.\\n           i refer again to the original abortion debates. one of the reasons put forward by the abortionists for liberalising the law was that by doing so they would reduce the number of unwanted children and level off—that was an often-used phrase—the rate of illegitimacy. in vain we said that killing babies in the womb would hardly lead to a more responsible society in which children would receive more love. we were right to say that. the numbers of children in care were not reduced after the abortion law came into operation. on the contrary, the numbers have risen by leaps and bounds. between 1951 and 1967 the numbers rose by fewer than 7,000, from 62,700 to 69,300. in the 10 years after the act came into operation, the numbers rose at an unprecedented rate and hit the 100,000 mark, where they remain today.\\n           pro-abortionists give every possible reason for this rise — and i would agree that our liberal divorce law has something to do with it—but the fact is that every other country which has liberalised its abortion laws has witnessed a similar increase in child tragedies.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13'],

health service. in 1966 the leaders of the medical profession were concerned about two things: first, to whom the task was to be entrusted; and, secondly, where it was to be done. they said that there was no need for complicated legislation. if strict rules were laid down on those two points the matter could be left to the medical profession. by that they meant that at least one of the two doctors concerned should be a consultant and also that there should be the strictest possible control over where the operation was done.\\n           if that had been our aim from the outset, we would probably not have been discussing the subject today. however, the decision was made not to entrust the task to two medical practitioners, one of whom would have to be a consultant. and so, presumably because of the fear of strain upon the nhs, the greater part of the demand was met by the mushroom growth of clinics, with all the abuses that i have mentioned.\\n           i should like to recommend a number of courses of action. at the appropriate time the government should give the house adequate time to debate an amending bill. that is unlikely to be in the present session, but the government should be prepared to help an amending bill through, so that it cannot be talked out by its opponents. only in that way shall we see whether or not parliament wishes to retain the present law unamended.\\n           in my view, the grounds for abortion in the present act should be more carefully defined to stop abortion on demand. i believe that that result could be achieved by the addition of two words to the act. we should also put an end to the hypocrisy of allowing the referral agencies to advertise so that they can refer women to clinics in which they have a financial interest. all financial links between referral agencies and clinics should be severed. that should apply equally to those clinics described as charities, from which doctors take home the bulk of the large fees of patients who have abortions.\\n           the conscience clause should be strengthened. in addition, something should be done to help those genuine charities and agencies which offer positive assistance to girls with problem pregnancies. it is scandalous that abortion clinics should be receiving help from local authorities, while agencies which look after girls who wish to keep their babies receive no government grants.\\n           the government should also take a positive stand to ensure that under-age girls are not aborted without parental consent. a dentist in this country is not allowed to extract a tooth from a young patient without parental consent, yet the entrepreneurs of the abortion business are allowed to carry out an operation on a young girl which could blight her entire life and leave her sterile. indeed, if we look at the abortion figures, we cannot fail to realise that those most in need of protection—the young—have become more and more vulnerable. abortions on girls under 16 increased from 2,619 in 1969 to 10,555 in 1983–8 per cent. of all abortions in england and wales.\\n           great play has been made of the fluctuations in the number of abortions on girls in this group since 1978. frankly, this means nothing at all as the total number of girls aged 13 to 15 has declined, while the number of abortions has remained constant at about four per 1,000 girls in this age bracket. that is a very sad commentary on the state of affairs in this country.\\n           during the last election some of the leaders and spokesmen of my own party made great play of the importance that we attach to the family unit and our concern for the young and unborn—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0),

friend intended to address himself to the question of back-street abortions. i have no simple, easy answer to that problem and am well aware that because of my position i am open to the argument that without an abortion provision on the statute book there could well be a return to the back-street abortion.\\n           the right hon. member for castle point also referred to the lane commission. that led me to recall that in 1980 i introduced a ten-minute bill on the termination of pregnancies and whether, as the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle (mr. leigh) pointed out, termination should be allowed to occur beyond 24 weeks.\\n           during that debate i quoted mrs. justice lane\\'s committee, which said: informed opinion is, and the committee agrees, that a maximum gestational age of 28 weeks for abortion is too high, having regard to modern methods of sustaining prematurely-born infants\". elsewhere in the committee\\'s recommendations it stated that the abortion act should be amended to authorise abortion up to the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy and not thereafter\". in fact, the guardian commented that two out of every 1,000 abortions which take place do so on developing children between the ages of 24 and 28 weeks. that goes some way towards answering the interjection made in the speech of the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle.\\n           i believe that this is something on which the house could agree, and i know that my right hon. friend the member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale is very much of a view that at the very minimum there ought to be a reduction from 28 to 24 weeks. it is something on which he and i agree. indeed, my right hon. friend was a sponsor of my bill. the world health organisation takes a similar view.\\n           i am conscious that we are going over arguments that have been rehearsed before, but that is inevitable. the hon. member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) said that she had

sincerely-held view among many people outside this house that too many abortions are taking place, it is legitimate for hon. members to return to this issue. i hope that the hon. gentleman will accept the sincerity of those who seek to raise the matter in this way.\\n           last week, a group of liverpool women came to see me about the general problems that women face. i accept that society does not treat women in the dignified way that it should, and that many of the prejudices and taboos about women and their place in society have placed women at a lower level than men. that is something to which we must address our minds.\\n           those women told me of a recent survey of women at liverpool university who had undergone abortions. it showed that had a creche been available for under two-year-olds, 14 per cent. of the women would have been happy to go ahead with their pregnancies. perhaps we can do something about that. if some people genuinely have abortions for such simple reasons, we ought to make adequate provision for women in that position.\\n           to some of my fellow roman catholic churchmen i say that attitudes on birth control, which sometimes seem to have more to do with the middle ages than with life in contemporary britain and the centre of places such as liverpool, are undoubtedly one of the reasons why people have abortions. i hope that they will address themselves to that problem.\\n           like the right hon. member for castle point, i also believe that there is a desperate need for more counselling facilities. there is also a need for more tolerance among families who reject their pregnant daughters and cast them on to the streets. up to 30 per cent. of people living in parts of my constituency are single parents with one child, then two, who find themselves on the rackety road to ruin as they get lured into things such as prostitution.\\n           we have already heard about a woman's right to choose, and women will ultimately make that decision whether they come within the system or are forced to use the back-street abortionist. however, many of us also believe that the developing child has rights.

rights of the individual that i take the view that i have just expressed.\\n           there is a strange contrast between this debate and the one which will take place on friday. that contrast

unprofessional operation without anaesthetic on a woman to terminate her pregnancy, and sent her home on a tram, and in a condition in which she was still subject to the likelihood of septicaemia. therefore, it was proper that he should have been prosecuted. however, that was the only prosecution for the termination of a pregnancy in scotland.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0),

in the pregnancy. people say, \"perhaps i have missed my period, but it may be natural,\" and they say that about the next one as well, and so on. unintended conception is a mistake. the parties may have used a contraceptive method which did not work, or they may have made a miscalculation. if a woman becomes pregnant unintentionally, is it right for this house to say that that is a mistake which she is not allowed to correct? that seems to me to be a strange moral judgment.\\n           people talk about the right to life of the unintended foetus. the unintended foetus did not have a choice

hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle made has been mentioned frequently in all the debates on legislation dealing with abortion—that nurses and other people have been persecuted and even dismissed because of the exercise of their conscience. whenever that has been alleged, we have asked for one such case to be produced. no one, in any circumstances whatever, has been able to produce a case of a nurse or anyone else in the medical profession who has been dismissed for the exercise of conscience under the 1967 act.\\n           the hon. gentleman asserted that there is no such thing as an unwanted child. i wish that were so, but we live in the real world and we know that there are unwanted children. there are many women throughout britain and throughout the world who find that they are pregnant and who, for whatever reason, do not want to bear the child for very good reasons. the ultimate test must be the consultation between the patient and her general practitioner, and the law should be at a minimum in dealing with that relationship.\\n           the right hon. member for castle point (sir b. braine) laid rather more stress than did the mover of the motion on the development of private clinics. i think that we are all agreed on the undesirability of such a development, but the only possible acceptable alternative is the improvement of facilities within the national health service. the answer is not to abolish all such clinics but to improve nhs facilities. i hope that the minister will give the house some assurance in that respect.\\n           throughout the country public opinion, no matter what people's political or religious persuasion may be, is massively in support of the way that the 1967 act is operating. there may be a case for considering a time limit for abortion. i served on standing committees which dealt with two abortion bills. the right hon. member for castle point will remember them vividly. those bills were talked out of existence. i think we were right to do that, because public opinion was massively on our side.\\n           it is right that minorities should express their opinion. i understand that a petition containing 1·5 million signatures is to be presented by a conservative member. there are another 55 million signatures that are not on the petition. let us not be under any illusion as to the strength of feeling on abortion. minorities have a right to be heard but the majority have the right to prevail.\\n           the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle was right not to lay too much emphasis on the grounds for abortion. i do not think that there is an authoritative body, in the medical profession or anywhere else, in support of any tightening up of that part of the 1967 act. the main argument relates to a time limit. there may be a case for that. however, even if it is set at 24 weeks, there will always be cases where, for one reason or another, exceptions will have to be made. for that reason, the greater the flexibility in the legislation the better.\\n           the 1967 act does not lay down a period of 28 weeks or any other period, and that is for a good reason. there is a degree of flexibility to enable the medical profession to examine and treat each case on its merits. the less we do about changing that the better.\\n           we are all against late abortions; indeed, we are all against all abortions. it is a horrible operation. at the weekend i was talking to a doctor who does abortions and he said that there is not a more undesirable operation, because it is an expression of failure. but if we can do anything in this house to eliminate that failure, it will bring happiness to many women and many families who would not otherwise have it. we legislate in this place for the sake of humanity. we legislate to make practices more humane than they would otherwise be. whatever this house does, women will have abortions. they have had them over the centuries. it is up to us to make the operation more humane by putting on the statute book legislation which is flexible and which recognises the human problems that lie behind abortion.\\n

should make it clear that i am not against abortion per se. in whatever proposals i might make, i am not working towards a day when abortion will be completely abolished. whatever my private and personal views may be, other people will hold different views, and on this subject—perhaps more than on any other—one tries to achieve a consensus.\\n           two points need to be made. first, it concerns me that the word \"abortion\" seems to be caught up with the concept of contraception and birth control. that is extremely dangerous. hardly anyone would now argue against contraception, but in talking about abortion we are not talking about contraception. contraception ensures that human life or conception does not occur. despite the argument that the spermatozoa and ova are alive, there is no human life until they are fused at conception. thus, even a hard-line roman catholic — if i can use that phrase in a non-pejorative sense — who might be opposed to both abortion and contraception, would probably admit that one of them is much worse than the other.\\n           it must be recognised that abortion is ultimately a form of population control. whatever the motives may be, it terminates human life. that is not the same as preventing that life from forming in the first place.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13'],

does not like the answer to his question he could at least have the courtesy to listen to it in relative silence.\\n           secondly, we are used to referring to the 1967 act and to the fact that it liberalised abortion or allowed it in certain circumstances, as though that act was the complete source of our abortion law. but it is not. it has to be read in conjunction with the infant life (preservation) act 1929. subsections (1) and (2) of that act say that if the gestation period is more than 28 weeks, it is assumed that the child is capable of being born alive. in combination, those two acts form the basis of our abortion law. when the 1929 act spoke of 28 weeks, it did so because at that time it was not expected that a child could be born alive before then. in law, capable of being born alive was not even taken to mean capable of surviving. i hope that the one common ground uniting us all is that 28 weeks can no longer be considered appropriate.\\n        ',

that i say that the hon. lady and i are in total agreement on a point.\\n           the essence of that act was the capability of being born alive and not the period of 28 weeks. the difficulty is that in practice the exception becomes the norm. it would be a brave, optimistic and, probably, well-heeled man, who would tell a doctor, who had gone through the procedures under the act and who had aborted a foetus at 23 weeks, that he was to be subjected to a private prosecution claiming that at that age the child was capable of being born alive. that is the difficulty.\\n           i think that i have correctly identified the source of the abortion law. we have moved a long way since 1929, and it is now obvious that a child is capable of being born alive at 28 weeks. it is not just a question of making a slight advance involving a week here or there. it is now possible for a child to be born alive at 23 weeks and, moreover, for it to survive. in such debates, the evidence inevitably tends to become anecdotal, and is sometimes no worse for that. but here the evidence is better than that.\\n           on 10 march 1984 an article appeared in the lancet entitled, \"capable of being born alive\". mr. dunn and mr. stirrat of the bristol maternity hospital reviewed the state of the law as we all understand it to be. a footnote to that article read: at the time of writing two infants of 23 weeks gestation are in our care, one now being 2½ weeks old the other 1 week old. i do not know whether those two children even survived the date of publication, but if they did, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the child who survived two and half weeks was capable not only of being born alive but of surviving.\\n           i hope that my right hon. and learned friend the minister will make a statement along the following lines. if those two statutes taken in combination are properly the foundation of our abortion law, it cannot be right that that 28-week guideline — i hestitate to use that word for reasons that the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood (ms. short) would correct me for — with all the implications that it has, should still be valid. if we are concerned to get our abortion laws right, something must be done, sooner rather than later, to ensure that that time limit is reduced.\\n           the hon. member for fife, central, (mr. hamilton) spoke about the sacredness of human life, and that is right. he might have correctly identified me as being one of those who are in favour of capital punishment and in favour of strengthening or, as he might have it, of deliberalising our abortion laws. we could both argue until we were blue in the face, but neither of us would be convinced that the other was right. but i would argue that a person can forfeit his right to life by a crime so heinous that he should be subject to a capital penalty. but ingenious though the mind of a lawyer is, i cannot begin to conceive of how a foetus that has yet to be born can have committed some crime that requires its extinction. therefore, the hon. gentleman\\'s point was no good.\\n           the hon. member for fife, central also spoke about the elimination of unhappiness. again, that unites us. i am not arguing in favour of the abolition of abortion. with all due respect, however, the hon. gentleman will have to do better than talk about the elimination of unhappiness. in talking about eliminating unhappiness, we are talking about eliminating human life. to consider the woman\\'s happiness does not mean to say that one can simply ignore the fact that the child will be subject not just to unhappiness but to death.\\n           where do we go from here? we are entitled to say that the legislaion under which abortions are performed should be tightened up in view of what we now know about foetology. there is also a job to be done in terms of educating the public, and especially the child-bearing public, about exactly what is involved in an abortion. it is not just a question of going into hospital and having an anonymous collection of cells removed. if a woman has an abortion by vacuum aspiration, she is committing herself to allowing the child within her to be dismembered. if that is the sort of thing that abortion involves, the public should know about it. if a woman, knowing that, still goes ahead with an abortion, she has at least done so with her eyes open. i hope that a film such as \"the silent scream\" will be broadcast on itv and bbc with all the counterbalancing propaganda that i am sure that the hon. member for ladywood will be able to provide.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13'], ['uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13.1.74', 5, 'uk.m.10540', 'uk.p.Lab', 1,

it is about time that he and some of his hon. friends were educated. the trouble with this house is that it is dominated by males who think that they know what is best for women.\\n           the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle (mr. leigh) is one of a string of hon. members who have said that the abortion act brings to the country an air of permissiveness, a lowering of moral standards and a diminution in the sanctity of the family. he and others suggest that the act allows abortion on demand. that is not true. they say that women frivolously use abortion as a contraceptive. that is not true either. they say that the tightening up of this already limited legislation will ensure a rosy picture of happier and more stable parents and children. nothing is further from the truth.\\n           as everyone in the house knows, abortion has existed since the beginning of time. throughout history, wealthy women have always been able to have abortions without problems or questions; they simply had to provide the money. no comfortable place in a private clinic was open to those without money. poorer women had two options. their first was to continue the pregnancy and have an unwanted child. it is not true that children are always wanted when they arrive. their second option was to have a back-street abortion—a messy and dangerous practice which i am glad to say has almost disappeared. however, i fear that it may be on the way back if some conservative members have their way.\\n           many figures have been quoted, and i want to put mine on the record. the number of abortions on residents in england and wales fell each year between 1980 and 1983. however, in the first half of 1984 the number increased by 3,052–5 per cent.—compared with the first half of 1983. that rise occurred in the 16 to 29 age group. the office of population censuses and surveys has pointed out that this took place about three to five months after the publication in the previous october of papers associating certain malignant diseases with the long-term use of oral contraceptives. it is obvious that many women were frightened by the pill scares and changed to less reliable means of contraception. the result was more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions.\\n           it is more important to consider the rate of abortions rather than the numbers, because the rate takes account of the increases and decreases in the numbers of women in the fertile age group.\\n           the abortion rate has remained at or under 12 women per thousand for the past 13 years. that is one of the lowest abortion rates in the world, as my hon. friend the member for cynon valley (mrs. clwyd) said. it is remarkable that it has remained so steady. it shows that women are using contraception in the most effective way possible. there is no foolproof method of contraception. women are not using abortion as a method of contraception. abortion is used only in the most dire circumstances — when contraception has failed or when conception is the result of an unplanned act.\\n           much has been made of the number of abortions performed on young women between the ages of 16 and 29 who are not married and have no children. the implication is that all such women are fit and healthy and that they should have babies or, if they do not want babies, that they should bear them and offer them for adoption. many hon. members have said that. it is an odd argument, because many of those who use it are now holding up their hands in horror at the idea of surrogacy. they suggest that everyone should go through with an unplanned pregnancy to term and then offer the child for adoption, but when it comes to surrogacy they say, \"no, we cannot have that.\" i do not understand their argument.\\n           the house should take account of the trends. women are no longer prepared to put up with a pregnancy that they do not want and with which they cannot cope. many women want to plan a family. they want to develop their talents, to work and to earn a living before having a family. few women now feel compelled to marry if they become pregnant. in 1969, about 44·5 per cent. of pregnant women married before the child was born. in most cases, they were shotgun marriages. in 1981 the figure was 19 per cent.—a much healthier figure.\\n           society no longer condemns a woman for having an illegitimate child. that is another reason why women do not feel that it is necessary to marry. many women categorised as single live with their partner in a stable relationship. they simply do not think it important to marry. in 1982, 59 per cent. of illegitimate births were jointly registered. parliament must take account of changes in attitudes and values and in the way in which people live.\\n           births and abortions to under 16-year-olds since 1974, when contraceptives were made freely available to all, regardless of age, have remained static. at least, they have up to now. abortions for women in that age group have remained at under 10 in 1,000 since 1974. the rate of live births in that age group has been at or under three in 1,000 since 1974. the number of illegitimate births has risen as young girls have decided to keep their children, because they believe that society will tolerate that decision.\\n           an acute danger to that stable position now hangs over young girls and their doctors. i refer to the recent judgment by the appeal court which stops girls under 16 from getting help from their doctors without the express consent of their parents. lord justice parker, one of the appeal court judges, said that that might lead to pregnancy, backstreet abortion or even death.\\n           on 8 february, the times reported that the british medical association had received information that two young girls were alleged to have committed suicide as a result of not receiving the contraceptive advice that they sought. one was a girl who was sexually assaulted by her father, and who learnt that she could not obtain contraceptive advice without her mother knowing of it. the other was a 12-year-old girl who sought advice, but her parents objected. they are reported to have taken their lives. is that really what conservative members want?\\n           perhaps hon. members with teenage daughters have a close and understanding relationship with them. i hope so. if so, they are fortunate, because many do not have that relationship. many daughters do not feel that they can discuss sex with their parents. family situations vary enormously, and there is often conflict in the home which creates a tense atmosphere in which young girls find it difficult to talk about matters at that time in their development. therefore, they need access to their doctors.\\n           under-16s are badly frightened and feel abandoned. i suppose that that fear and sense of isolation is viewed by the moralists on the conservative benches as a healthy deterrent to young girls under the age of 16 having sex. goodness knows how many girls have become pregnant since the court of appeal judgment. the moralists have tabled an early-day motion against abortion for girls under 16. i am afraid that that will not stop pregnancies. i hope that the court of appeal judgment is changed. do hon. members really want no advice, no counselling, no contraception and, if the worst comes to the worst, no abortion, other than illegal or back-street abortion, for girls under 16?\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11,

law. he overlooks the fact that many girls cannot and will not discuss it with their parents. they feel that they cannot talk to them. of course, it would be preferable if they could, and that is what the counselling service and the doctors advise. if we follow the advice of conservative members, the clock will be turned back.\\n           almost every day during question time we urge girls to make the most of education and employment opportunities. we tell them to stay at school, get on with their education and grasp the chances to make something of themselves, yet we deny them the understanding advice and help that would enable them to view sex in a sensible manner at a difficult time in their lives.\\n           there is little support among the public or the medical profession for restricting the grounds for abortion. in 1983, the gallup poll found that 74 per cent. of the public thought that the decision whether or not to continue a pregnancy should be left to the woman in consultation with her doctor. support for that view has been high since 1979 —never lower than 74 per cent., which is three quarters of those sampled. the support is high regardless of the age, sex, political opinion or religion of those polled. there is growing support for a more liberal abortion law that would allow women to make their own decisions on abortion. in 1979, the national opinion poll found that 56 per cent. of people thought that abortion should be available legally to those who wanted it. that was confirmed in a later nop survey in the sun. \\n           people tend to think that it is easy to obtain an abortion. it is not. many of my hon. friends have pointed out the difficulties that face women and girls seeking abortion. we know of the widespread concern about the unevenness of nits provision—from the disgraceful figures in the west midlands where only 3 to 4 per cent. of women can obtain abortions on the nhs to the 97 per cent. who can do so in the north of england. it would have become the hon. member for gainsborough and horncastle more and earned him my respect if part of his motion had referred to the inadequacies of nhs provision for abortion. that would have been a good point to debate, and preferable to the high moral tone that the hon. gentleman chose to take.\\n           a number of different organisations and bodies have taken a similar view about nhs facilities—for example, the royal commission and the select committee which considered abortion in 1981, on which both the right hon. member for castle point (sir b. braine) and the minister's predecessor served. indeed, the minister's predecessor expressed his concern that nhs abortion facilities should be improved. however, those facilities are still not good enough. only last month the women's national commission working group on health, chaired by dame ann springman of the conservative women's national committee, said that where an abortion is permissible, nhs facilities should be made available at the earliest possible stage and that day care facilities should be extended. the labour party's programme gives priority to improving nhs facilities, including day care, so that choice can be effective wherever the woman lives.\\n           during all the agitation, the pontificating, the attacks on the existing abortion laws and the moralising that we have heard this evening, nothing has been said about the role of the man. women are blamed for needing abortions. it is represented as their fault if they become pregnant —they have not taken precautions; the precautions have gone wrong so it is bad luck on them; they must bear the agony and the fear of not finding a doctor willing to help; they must bear the main brunt of an abortion and all the difficulties that go with it. nowhere in the argument is the role and the responsibility of the man pointed out. that was most noticeable in the speech of the hon. member for teignbridge. the women are made to feel blameworthy and guilty. if they cannot cope, people look down on them. they are talked about as though they did not exist or work in this place. they are continually put down by less than half the population—the men—who want to decide for them what they should do with their bodies.\\n           even in the argument about the under-16s and the recent court of appeal judgment, it is the daughters' difficulties that are exposed and it is their lives that are being endangered. the law actually protects boys of 14, but they have not been mentioned in our discussion. the house should remember that in our moralising we must understand that women will not for ever be prepared to go on being unable to control their fertility and their bodies. they will continue to demand more rights and more of a say in how they shape their lives.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13'], ['uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13.1.79', 2325, 'uk.m.10115', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'The Minister for Health', 'government', 'i begin by congratulating my hon. friend the member for gainsborough and horncastle (mr. leigh), first, on his good fortune in obtaining this allocation of parliamentary time and, secondly, on giving the house the opportunity to consider this subject again. since the abortion act 1967 was passed the house has considered its provisions on several occasions and several attempts have been made to introduce amending legislation, although none has been successful. but it is surprising — it has surprised me during my time as minister for health—that the house has not considered the subject since 1981. the previous occasion on which the house considered it was when the hon. member for barking (ms. richardson) introduced a ten-minute bill, which did not reach the statute book.\\n           although some hon. members criticised my hon. friend the member for gainsborough and horncastle, and although i do not agree with all of his views on this subject, the way in which he put them forward commanded respect, and i am sure that his reasonable proposition will be supported by many inside and outside the house.\\n           i must make it clear that the government, like all their predecessors, are neutral on the great issues of principle that are raised by abortion. the government believe that it is for parliament to decide the law and to take any opportunity that the majority wishes to change the law. since parliament has decided that abortions may lawfully be carried out in the circumstances specified in the act, the government have a duty to ensure that the provisions of the law are properly applied. that must remain our view. i have always been a supporter of the 1967 act and believed that the way in which it has been applied has, on balance, been beneficial to society. but as i speak in this debate, because i happen to be the minister for health, i shall not take advantage of the time to discuss at length some of the issues that have been raised, which i might have done were i not on the front bench.\\n           following the examination of the working of the act by the lane committee and later by the select committee on abortion, we now have a strict system of control over the application of the act. i assure the house that my department takes seriously its duties of inspection and control of private clinics. we monitor closely the operation of the act, and i assure hon. members that our monitoring machinery does not reveal any abuse of it. the government are satisfied that they are ensuring, to the best of their ability, that the wishes of parliament are respected. that means that abortions are being carried out in proper circumstances and only when the provisions of the act are satisfied. obviously, we must strive to ensure that that continues to be the case.\\n           i and the government share my hon. friend\\'s concern that many abortions are still considered necessary, for the reasons that were expounded by the hon. member for barking. the background to most abortions is at least error, but often it is severe emotional crisis. abortion is often the cause of considerable distress and difficulty. the figures for 1981, 1982 and 1983 showed a slight decrease in the number of abortions. from the best test that can be applied, which is the number of abortions per thousand women between the ages of 15 and 44, we discover that the rate fell from 12·62 in 1980 to 11·94 in 1983.\\n           it is regrettable that the 1984 figures that we have so far show a slight increase in abortions. no one knows what caused that, but i share the theory of the hon. member for barking that it almost certainly resulted from the scare that followed last year\\'s reports of possible dangers from the contraceptive pill. when those stories emerged, we did our best to give proper advice to women, which included asking them to ensure that they finished the course of contraceptive treatment upon which they had embarked, and that they took advice about alternative methods of contraception. but it seems likely that some women, in panic, stopped the course of pills that they were taking or made a mistake in changing to other methods. everyone who has spoken in the debate, with whatever views, must hope that the downward trend which we previously witnessed will soon return and continue.\\n           i agree with my hon. and learned friend the member for perth and kinross (mr. fairbairn), who put his views in his usual colourful way, that one of the best things that we can do to reduce the large number of abortions is to encourage the sensible use of family planning. we do that by the provision of a free family planning service, which we believe is an essential preventive measure which contributes to the avoidance of unwanted pregnancy, to the proper spacing and timing of children and, therefore, to better maternal and child health and to a secure and stable family life. for that reason, we support financially those voluntary bodies that work in this area and the family planning information service.\\n           the hon. member for barking felt free to express her views about the case that has been brought against the department by mrs. gillick. she will understand that, as the matter is still waiting to go to the house of lords, i would rather not be drawn into that discussion. but it is important that that court of appeal decision is appealed, if only to clarify some of the doubts left unanswered by the way in which the judgment was expressed. this is an important matter for our society, and the highest court in the land must give a clear ruling on whether the guidance issued by the department was lawful.\\n           in the brief time that i propose to take in the debate, i shall say a few words about the matter which most concerned my hon. friend the member for gainsborough and horncastle. he was worried, as were many hon. members, about the late stage at which some abortions are performed, especially having regard to the advances in medical techniques of helping premature babies to survive. this matter has caused anxiety for many years, and it has been considered from time to time since the lane committee produced its report. several hon. members have accurately described the legal and statistical position, so i shall not repeat everything that has been said about the infant life (preservation) act 1929, which was described by my hon. friend the member for teignbridge (mr. nicholls), and its relationship to the present law. as he said, the act requires prima facie proof that a foetus is capable of being born alive if a pregnancy is of more than 28 weeks\\' duration.\\n           as the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood (ms. short) made clear, the infant life (preservation) act protects the life of any foetus capable of being born alive, but in practice the 28-week period has been taken as the usual guideline for the application of that act. the lane committee recommended that it should be made illegal for an abortion to be carried out after 24 weeks, but, after repeated attempts, the house has not yet been able to resolve that matter, and the law stands as it was in 1929 and in 1967.\\n           the government have become concerned about the state of the law because of the changes in medical techniques. in march 1980, my predecessor—my hon. friend the member for reading, east (sir g. vaughan) — asked the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists to undertake a review of late abortion practice. its report was published early in 1984, and i commend it to those hon. members who have not read it. the government have been considering how best to follow the eight major recommendations in the report, which examined the causes for late abortions and the way in which unnecessary delays and, therefore, the number of late abortions might be reduced. the report has been helpful in drawing attention to the factors which cause abortion to be carried out later than need otherwise happen. we hope that those who provide abortion services, whether it be the national health service or the private sector, will consider its findings carefully.\\n           the government propose to act in several ways. first, to take the point made by the hon. member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) among others, we propose to discuss with nhs representatives the report\\'s findings about delays between referrals and operations in the nhs. we shall be having serious discussions with national health service representatives to ascertain whether improvements can be made in practice in areas where delays seem to be inexplicably longer than in other parts of the country. we shall try to disseminate the best practice so that the lessons learnt in one place can be applied by authorities elsewhere. i understand that there is a good scheme which appears to be working well in newcastle. if it is proved that newcastle has a better method of handling these matters, we shall do our best to commend it to other health authorities and so spread it through the service.\\n           secondly, the recommendations of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists point to a need for more education, especially for younger women, to make them appreciate the urgency of early consultation and decision making when pregnancy occurs. we shall be consulting our colleagues in the department of education and science about the prospects for more health education and counselling facilities for young people in this sensitive area.\\n           thirdly, we shall be seeking to reinforce in every other way the importance of early recognition of pregnancy and recourse to advice when anyone faces a crisis of the sort that we are discussing. that message has already been highlighted by the maternity services advisory committee, which the government set up and whose report we have already commended to health authorities.\\n           the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, together with other medical bodies, is considering actively whether to recommend that the 1929 act should be amended to change the definition of \"foetal viability\" from 28 to fewer weeks. the hon. member for east kilbride (dr. miller), the only member with a medical qualification to speak in the debate, told us that there is not unanimity within the medical profession on this matter. however, i feel that most doctors consider that 28 weeks is too long a period. this important matter needs to be considered at the level at which the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists is now examining it. when the medical bodies produce their advice, i am sure that it will be widely debated and that the house, as well as the government, will want to consider it and decide what implications it has for abortion law. i suggest that until we have had time to consider the views of the royal college it will be foolish for the government to take a view about any alternative to the 28-week provision. it is probably a little premature for anyone to try to introduce a proposal to make changes in the law.\\n           i think that we all expect the royal college to come out with a shorter period than 28 weeks. long ago the lane committee said that 24 weeks should be the maximum for a legal abortion. practically everyone who has contributed to the debate has suggested that perhaps 28 weeks is too long a period and that it should be reduced.\\n           my right hon. friend the member for castle point (sir b. braine) and others reminisced about previous bills. i remember the issues which have been discussed this evening being canvassed when the house considered the bill that was introduced by my hon. friend the member for cunninghame, north (mr. corrie). my hon. friend tried to introduce a substantial amendment to the 1967 act. in this debate those with views as opposite as the hon. members for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton) and for fife, central (mr. hamilton) have supported a reduction from 28 to 24 weeks. i remember that i did when the cowie bill was passing through the house. i think that i voted to that effect, although i have not checked to ensure that i was present when the division took place. however, i recall that i supported a reduction from 28 to 24 weeks.\\n           the majority of the house voted in favour of the reduction when the division took place in the course of our consideration of the corrie bill.\\n           it is my recollection that the sponsors of the corrie bill insisted on adding many other drastic amendments, with the result that those like the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale (mr. steel), for fife, central and for barking and myself, who would otherwise have been happy to see a reduction from 28 to 24 weeks placed on the statute book, found that everyone\\'s wishes were frustrated because the bill was eventually talked out.\\n           if the royal college returns with some clear advice, i think that the house will have a duty to recognise that there is an amazingly wide spread of opinion. i hope that i shall be forgiven for referring to the opinions of my right hon. friend the member for castle point and of the hon. member for barking. probably 28 weeks is too long a period, and the house must concentrate on making progress on that issue, if on nothing else, if that proves to be the recommendation of the royal college. it will be for my right hon. friend the leader of the house to decide whether the government will provide time for these matters to be considered by the introduction of a bill, if and when this hypothetical situation ever arises. that is not a matter to be decided before the royal college reports to us.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1985, 2, 11, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1985-02-11.13'],

(mr. hargreaves) and for basildon (mr. amess). the last time that my hon. friend the minister answered a debate of ours, on 27 july, he asked, \"when shall we three meet again?\" i am afraid that on this occasion, there are only the two of us, but the others join me in the remarks that i intend to make.\\n           the ruling by mr. justice brooke was in the case of a mother who had sued a health authority because she bore a handicapped son. she had asked the health authority, or at least the doctors, to abort the son at 27½ weeks. to their credit, the doctors refused. they said that, even though handicap was present, under the infant life (preservation) act 1929, the pregnancy had advanced too far and they refused the abortion.\\n           in ruling in favour of the doctors and the health authority and against the mother who had claimed damages, mr. justice brooke took the opportunity to give a long overdue and much-needed clarification of the infant life (preservation) act, which states that it is an offence of child destruction to destroy a child capable of being born alive. it goes on to say that there is a presumption that the child will be born alive at 28 weeks, but if a child is capable of being born alive before that time, it is still protected under the act. the act says that, after 28 weeks, there is prima facie proof that the child could be born alive. the burden of proof would be on the doctor performing an abortion after that time to show that the child could not have been born alive. before the 28th week, the burden of proof lies on those who would prosecute the doctor.\\n           the words capable of being born alive have been construed in different ways. i am glad to see my hon. friend the minister in his place. i refer him back to the debate on the carlisle baby on 8 june last year. i asked several questions in that debate. i asked why, when the child had been born alive as a result of an abortion which had gone wrong, and had survived gasping and with a pulse rate for three hours, resuscitation was not provided. my hon. friend the minister replied that the doctors had decided that this was not a viable birth. i asked why the child was not registered for birth or for death. i obtained the same answer in each case. the doctors had decided that it was not a viable birth.\\n           mr. justice brooke ruled that the meaning of the words capable of being born alive was that a child was capable of surviving independently of its mother even if only for a short time\". those are the crucial words, and that is the crucial clarification. many of my hon. friends and i have claimed over a long period that that was the correct interpretation of the infant life (preservation) act 1929. the carlisle baby, who survived for three hours—a short time, but nevertheless it survived—was therefore born alive.\\n           the medical profession and, i regret to say, the department of health, however, have tended to define life in terms of long-term viability. that does not stand up in logic. if i were terminally ill, i might have no long-term viability but no one would suggest that i was not alive. we do not say that our hospices are full of unviable beings. they are full of current living people. the carlisle baby was a living child.\\n           if mr. justice brooke\\'s interpretation of the infant life (preservation) act 1929 is true—at present, that is the ruling that we have in law and the only recent judicial clarification that i know of on the matter—it follows that all those children who are aborted in national health service or private clinics at an age when they are capable of surviving, if only for a short time, are protected by the infant life (preservation) act 1929 and that those who destroy them commit the offence of child destruction.\\n           does the minister agree that, under the terms of mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling, at least 2,000 illegal abortions are carried out every year in national health service and private clinics? the medical profession says that, at 22 weeks, there is a 5 per cent. chance of long-term survival, yet 2,000 abortions are carried out after 22 weeks. how is that compatible with mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling on the infant life (preservation) act? the medical profession tells us that, after 24 weeks, there is a 15 per cent. chance of survival. we know that children of 24 weeks are regularly horn breathing and with a pulse rate. every year, however, there are some 20 abortions after 24 weeks. how are those abortions compatible with mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling that, if a child is capable of surviving for even a short time, that child is covered and protected by the infant life (preservation) act? does my hon. friend the minister agree that in all those cases the act has been violated?\\n           we must remember that mr. justice brooke gave his ruling in the case of handicap. he did not say that there were exemptions to the infant life (preservation) act. he said in a straightforward manner that, if a child is capable of surviving, albeit for a very short time, it is protected. what is a very short time? let us consider abortions at 20 weeks. we must remember that the carlisle baby was 21 weeks, but it survived for three hours. surely there must be cases of earlier survivals for shorter periods. let us take the 20th week as the guide, which surely must be logical, given that the nhs has clear guidelines that, after the 20th week, resuscitation equipment shall be available.\\n        ',

accept that she is approaching the problem from the wrong direction? we are all sorry about any abortions, particularly late ones, but why does the hon. lady approach the matter from the legal angle, when we should be approaching it from the opposite direction? why does she believe that there is a hard and fast point at which the law can decide whether a child is viable? surely those matters should be left largely to the medical profession.\\n           i believe that the hon. lady is wrong to think that the law can be used as some kind of a weapon in her campaign against abortion. she should consider the practice in holland, where, the number of abortions is half that carried out here, although the laws are much more liberal.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1990, 3, 27, 0, 0),

expecting an intervention, but i got another speech. i shall not give way to the hon. gentleman again, no matter how pressing the points that he wants to raise.\\n           the hon. gentleman has totally misunderstood the nature of the debate. i am willing to engage with him on the general principles of abortion at a time that will come shortly. i am not talking about what i think is the right line, what i want to do with the doctors or where i want to define women\\'s rights, but about mr. justice brooke\\'s legal ruling. i want to know what the department of health is doing about complying with that legal ruling. as mr. justice brooke has talked about survival which lasts for only a short, unspecified period, as the basis of the infant life (preservation) act, is the minister satisfied that abortions which are carried out when a child can survive, albeit for a short time, are within the law?\\n           when he replied to my debates on the carlisle baby case and to the administration of the abortion act 1967, last june and july respectively, the minister said that he accepted that his department had to work within the confines of the infant life (preservation) act. in view of the recent judicial ruling, does he think that his department is doing that?\\n           another case has recently made headlines—that of ashley gardiner, a child of eight months gestation, who died when an allegedly reckless and drunken driver killed his mother. in that case, the crown prosecution service decided that it would not prosecute for death caused by dangerous driving. i appreciate that my hon. friend the minister cannot answer for the attorney-general\\'s decisions, but there is a similarity of language in the replies to those two cases.\\n           my hon. friend the minister gave a thorough reply to the carlisle baby case debate, for which we were all most grateful. he said that it was a distressing and sad case, but nothing would be done about it. the attorney-general said exactly the same. he said that it was sad that an eight-month-old child had been killed in the womb, but he was not actually going to do anything about it.\\n           we have had mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling, and at eight months that child was clearly capable of being born alive. therefore, it was capable of being destroyed under the infant life (preservation) act, so it was capable of being killed. i do not understand why the man alleged to have caused the incident is not being prosecuted for causing death.\\n           does my hon. friend the minister accept that viability in the long term is not an accurate interpretation of the infant life (preservation) act? what investigations will he demand into the alleged king\\'s college baby case, the facts of which emerged in sunday newspapers two weeks ago after a member of staff was so distressed by what had happened that she wrote to the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton) setting out the facts. that incident has shades of the carlisle baby case.\\n           the alleged facts in the king\\'s college baby case are that a child of 27 weeks, clearly more than capable of being born alive, suffering from a relatively minor but certainly not a serious and incapacitating handicap, was killed in the womb while its healthy and fit twin was allowed to go on living. that was described as a selective reduction, in which a pair of children are growing in the womb and the doctors decide which one shall be allowed to live and which one shall die. can the minister honestly say that such a policy complies with the infant life (preservation) act? if it does, why is that so? if it does not, what steps does he intend to take?\\n           i return to some of the questions that i raised in july about the administration of the 1967 act. the minister is familiar with the questions. mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling has changed the answers that i was given then, or certainly should do. my question was this. if a child is not capable of being born alive, what is the point of the lethal injection of urea or saline that is given in the administration of the prostaglandin method of late abortions? that method is widely used in the national health service, as opposed to the dismemberment method which is so grotesquely used in the private clinics and which the minister continues to allow. the prostaglandin method involves inducing an early birth and administering a lethal injection which, in the words of the medical text books, ensures that the child is born dead.\\n           if the child is not capable of being born alive in the first place, what is the purpose of an injection to ensure that it is born dead? if a doctor is giving an injection deliberately to kill a child which he believes to be capable of being born alive, surely he is violating the infant life (preservation) act 1929. under mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling, which has nothing to do with long-term viability but everything to do with short-term survival and short-term independent breathing—he talked not about existence but about independent breathing—how can lethal injections be compatible with observation by the health service of the infant life (preservation) act? surely that is illogical and wrong.\\n           does the minister accept that there is a lack of will throughout the health service, and certainly within the department, to ensure that the abortion act 1967 is policed in its own right? surely the effect of mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling is that the amendments to be tabled to the embryology bill by the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton), my right hon. friend the member for castle point (sir b. braine) and myself will be unnecessary. if the act was properly policed and if the infant life (preservation) act was properly enforced, the abortions that we wish to outlaw would be outlawed already. is it not the case that, under mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling, those abortions which are already outlawed are greater in number than those which we would outlaw?\\n           we have been obliged, reluctantly but of necessity, to exempt all cases of severe handicap. mr. justice brooke has not made that exemption. indeed, his ruling was based on a case of handicap. mr. justice brooke is saying that, if the law were properly administered, no changes would be necessary to the 1967 act to bring about the limitation on late abortions that is desired by the majority of members in this place.\\n           surely there is a clear responsibility on the minister, first, to outlaw the use of lethal injections and, secondly, to outlaw all abortions for whatever reason except saving the life of the mother after the 22nd week at the latest, and probably after the 20th week if we take the judge\\'s views as they stand. if my hon. friend does not accept that, how does he interpret mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling? what will he do to ensure that the health service and private clinics observe the ruling? what has already been done to observe the ruling, which is several weeks old?\\n           i turn to the dismemberment method. surely there must be a clear case for saying that if a child that is capable of being born alive is protected by the infant life (preservation) act, what goes on in the private clinics—live dismemberment of babies after the 18th week of gestation without anaesthetic—is a violation of the act and a gross atrocity under the act. we have been claiming that for some time, and the minister\\'s standard response has been to say that the method of abortion chosen has to be down to clinical judgment.\\n           i ask my hon. friend this question. we know that the eight-month-old baby in the womb who died as a result of a road accident is claimed not to have died. if that baby had already been born and was being transported in an incubator when it met with the accident, the death of a live person would have been recorded. there is no doubt that the law would have said that that was a death. yet because the child was in the womb he was deemed not to have died.\\n           does the minister accept that we would not countenance or even dream in our worst nightmares of the live dismemberment, for whatever reason, of a child in an incubator? we would not even dream of creeping up and giving that child a lethal injection, and live dismemberment would be utterly repugnant, so why is it acceptable when practised on a child of identical age and development in the womb? is it because we see the one and not the other? is it the fact that we can see the pain and the reaction of the child in the incubator that makes such an act unthinkable?\\n           it is very convenient that we do not see the pain of the child in the womb—it is hidden from us. is that the reasoning—that we can do wrong so long as we cannot see that we are doing wrong? is it really down to medical judgment whether a child shall be dismembered alive? now that there is no longer a shred of doubt that such children are protected under the infant life (preservation) act, will my friend consider outlawing that method?\\n           perhaps the fact that that method is permissible does not come down to whether its effects are seen or not seen. perhaps we now define life in terms of our perception of life. if a child is wanted it is a person. if it is not wanted—even if it is an identical twin, as in the case of the king\\'s college baby—it is not a person. that is the slippery slope. if we start to define humanity in terms of our perception of humanity we shall be doing what was done by a regime in the 1930s which defined an entire race as sub-human. that is what is done—if not in theory, in practice—by racially repressive regimes everywhere. if we start to define humanity according to our wants and perceptions rather than on objective criteria, we are heading for a very dark age indeed.\\n           i said earlier that mr. justice brooke had protected even the handicapped, and mr. justice brooke is to be congratulated. during the passage of the bill unsuccessfully introduced by the hon. member for mossley hill, any handicapped person could switch on the television or radio at any hour of the day or evening and hear politicians such as myself glibly discussing whether they had the right to be born. that is not an insult that we would offer to any racial or religious group. how dare we single out the handicapped for such an insult and treat them as a race apart? will the minister now accept that, as a result of mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling, handicapped children capable of being born alive are as well protected under the infant life (preservation) act 1929—and under the abortion act 1967, which must comply with the terms of that act—as fit and healthy children, who account for 92 per cent. of all abortions after the 18th week? if the minister does not accept that, can he tell us how he squares mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling with that refusal?\\n           mr. justice brooke has done something that we have been requiring for a long time, but it should not have been down to mr. justice brooke to make that decision. the terms of the infant life (preservation) act have always been abundantly clear. a child does not have to be born alive or to survive long term—it merely has to be capable of being born alive. what we have been given by mr. justice brooke is a definition of \"born alive\"—breathing independently for only a short time.\\n           perhaps the minister will be able to tell us what is the earliest recorded birth or abortion in which the child breathed for only a short time. with regard to the carlisle baby case, is it not true that there were precedents, that other children had been born breathing, at earlier stages of gestation? they may not have been capable of surviving, but clearly they were capable of being born breathing. i suggest the test that i mentioned earlier. if a doctor really believes that a child is not capable of being born alive, there is no point in a lethal injection. i suspect that if a lethal injection were not given, and if the nhs guidance were that the child must be given every possible chance, there would be many fewer abortions because doctors would not be willing to take the risk.\\n           the other point about which i am concerned is the lack of will to enforce the acts in their own right—long before the passage of any amendment in this parliamentary session. how many doctors have been prosecuted for aborting children who were capable of being born alive? i think that my hon. friend the minister will be able to tell me that over a very long period there has been only one. yet there is clear evidence, as in the carlisle case and in the king\\'s college case, that this abuse is going on all the time. any child who is aborted after a certain stage of gestation would have had a chance, however slim, of being born alive. for that reason, there should be more prosecutions. it is as simple as that.\\n           those of us who have worked to have the legislation amended have been channeling our energies in the right direction, but there is another way—mere enforcement of the law as it stands. as i have said, mr. justice brooke has made it abundantly clear that the law is already adequate to do all the things for which the hon. member for mossley hill, my right hon. friend the member for castle point and my hon. friends the members for hyndburn (mr. hargreaves) and for basildon (mr. amess) and i have been calling. the legislative changes for which we have been asking would be unnecessary if only the law were applied.\\n           will the minister please look again at the guidelines on resuscitation? during the debate on the carlisle baby case, on 8 june, he told me that resuscitation equipment had to be available from the 20th week. but \"available\" means simply \"on the premises\". the equipment does not actually have to be used; it merely has to be there. the mere presence of equipment does not mean that any effort will be made to save a live baby.\\n           to qualify for a licence, a private clinic must have resuscitation equipment if it is to abort after the 20th week. but even if that equipment remained unused, uncleaned, unmaintained, its mere presence would enable the clinic to comply with the guidelines issued by the minister. should there not be a very clear requirement that if a child is born alive, resuscitation equipment must be used? if the child is not capable of long-term existence, the resuscitation equipment will ultimately be unsuccessful, but at least we should know that efforts had been made to save the child.\\n           the carlisle case, to which i keep referring, is the clearest demonstration largely because it was the result of a coroner\\'s inquiry and we have sworn affidavits and do not have to rely on rumour or newspaper reports. we have a clear legal guidance as to what went on.\\n           the carlisle case epitomises what i suspect goes on a great deal. i doubt whether there are children gasping for three hours on kidney dishes in wards up and down the country—i do not wish to paint such a horrible picture—but in a lesser sense, i suspect that there are many carlisle babies born alive who breathe for just a short time and who are treated as though they had never breathed at all, as though they were the foetuses which the pro-abortion lobby claims them to be.\\n           that is the problem. it is one of misuse of language. if a baby is wanted, it is a baby. it is referred to as a baby from the moment of its conception. if it is not wanted it is a foetus, even while its identical twin, in the king\\'s college case, is a baby. what sort of doublespeak, dual standards and misuse of language is that?\\n           will the minister seriously consider investigating fully the allegations surrounding the king\\'s college baby and give an absolute undertaking that he will consider referring that case for prosecution on the facts as they are alleged, because there almost certainly should be such a prosecution?\\n           we are told that that case caused great distress to members of staff, but, as so often, as the select committee on social services has been hearing while it considers the conscience clause, a member of staff writes and says what happened but asks not to be identified. is there an atmosphere of fear in the health service? has the minister considered whether that conscience clause is being adequately upheld? if, in horrifying cases such as the carlisle case and the alleged king\\'s cross case, staff are afraid to speak out, how much less ready must they be to speak out over smaller, routine—if i may put it that way—violations of the abortion act 1967 and the infant life (preservation) act 1929?\\n           the pressure of fear should be removed. no member of staff, either of an nhs department or of a private clinic, should ever have to write to any member of parliament, as they do in droves, and ask not to be named. one of the most difficult features of the investigation now going on in the select committee is not the lack of evidence but the utter unwillingness of people who believe that they have been discriminated against because they do not believe in assisting at abortions, to be named for fear of their careers, their future progress, and sometimes of jeopardising their jobs.\\n           we heard, oh so eloquently, from one consultant that he was prepared to come forward and give his name because he was now a consultant, but a few weeks earlier, when he sent his initial letter to the committee, he did not want his name made public. what sort of atmosphere are conscientious objectors working in in the health service—i assume that they would not be in a private clinic because they are dedicated clinics—that even in the worst hospital cases and the worst excesses of abuse they do not want their names to be given?\\n           i sum up by putting some questions to my hon. friend the minister which i would be grateful if he could attempt to answer in the time left for the debate. he has always answered debates on this subject thoroughly. we are grateful for his careful explanations and for his almost invariable follow-up in writing. i know that he will answer my questions to the best of his ability.\\n           does my hon. friend accept that mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling must be observed in the health service and in the private clinics? if he does, and if he accepts mr. justice brooke\\'s decision that they are capable of being born alive, does he also accept that, already, without any changes to the 1967 act, thousands of illegal abortions are being carried out in this country by the nhs and by private clinics?\\n           does he accept that the ruling given by mr. justice brooke now protects the handicapped child in exactly the same way as it protects the fit and healthy child? does he accept that the use of lethal injections means that a doctor must believe that there is a chance that the child is capable of being born alive and, therefore, under mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling, such injections should not be given? does he accept that long-term viability can no longer be used as a criterion for assessing whether a birth is live, because his answers in the carlisle baby case about the birth and death registrations were not that it was not a live birth, but that it was not a viable birth? will he accept that there is now a clear contradiction between mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling and assuming long-term viability to be the criterion?\\n           will the under-secretary consider revised guidelines specifying not only that resuscitation equipment must be available, but that it must be used if a child is born breathing? once again, i ask the under-secretary to accept that there has to be a case in humanity, never mind in law, for reconsidering the social, legal and moral acceptability of live dismemberment without anaesthetic? will he undertake to investigate thoroughly the allegations surrounding the king\\'s college baby case? will he state clearly that there is no case in law, as it stands, particularly under mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling, for saying that a handicapped twin can be \"selectively reduced\", as they delightfully described it—i would call it by a stronger term, but i will not use it because i have tried to avoid emotive terms such as murder—in the womb at 27 weeks, while its twin is allowed to live? will he say that, if that did happen, it is illegal?\\n           will the under-secretary of state say whether he believes that there is an atmosphere of fear in the nhs among people with conscientious objections? although i understand that he will wish to await the report of the select committee before responding to any courses of action that might be recommended, will he at least state his concern that those with conscientious objections should be fully protected under the act?\\n           will the under-secretary of state say that, if the act were properly policed and enforced, there would be no need for legislative changes and that those changes are needed because the act is not properly policed and not properly enforced?\\n           will the minister say what revised guidance he has issued in the light of mr. justice brook\\'s ruling? if he has not issued any revised guidance, why not?\\n           in short, will my hon. friend state what effect that historic ruling has on the conduct of late abortions in this country, and will he guarantee that if there are clear violations of either the abortion act 1967 or the infant life (preservation) act 1929, it is his department\\'s view that those violations should be referred for prosecution? in other words, will he guarantee that the acts are vigorously enforced, rather than loosely conducted? i should be grateful if he could answer those few queries.\\n           as i said earlier, i understand that he cannot comment on the case of the child who died in the accident, but he may perhaps like to reflect on what would have happened if it had been a child in an incubator, and whether there is need for further clarification.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1990, 3, 27, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1990-03-27.25'], ['uk.proc.d.1990-03-27.25.1.4', 12, 'uk.m.22486', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'chairman', 'chair', 'with the leave of

both i and my hon. friend the member for maidstone (miss ann widdecombe) are somewhat surprised at her good fortune in being called at what is likely to be the conclusion of this debate.\\n           i pay tribute to my hon. friend's undoubted energies. to be as fresh and as lucid as she has been at this hour of the morning is no mean feat, but to maintain the enthusiasm and dedication to the causes which she holds so dear is a most remarkable quality. i pay tribute to her: to speak so eloquently for nearly 40 minutes without notes is an incredible achievement, and one of which the whole house should be proud.\\n           my hon. friend has raised a number of important issues. i think that she will understand if i am reluctant to comment either on case law or on matters that are really for my right hon. and learned friend the attorney-general. she will not expect a health minister charged with administering the present law to venture too far down the path of commenting on recent cases, but i shall do my level best.\\n           let me say at the outset that abortion is not a convenience but a tragedy, in each and every case. those are my personal feelings, but i am sure that they are shared throughout the house. we sometimes fall into the trap of believing that abortion, at whatever stage of gestation, is a medical convenience rather like minor surgery, but it is always a tragedy for the mother—indeed, for both parents of the life that is involved.\\n           the scale of abortion is significant, not only in britain but in other western european countries. earlier in this consolidated fund bill debate we talked at some length about the pressures on the national health service. it should be noted that some of the demands are created by ourselves, and not by the natural misfortunes of life—the afflictions that we, as human beings, may not be capable of controlling.\\n           there are substantial pressures on the obstetric and gynaecological departments of nhs hospitals arising from the demand for abortions. i make no moral judgment, as a minister of the crown, about the need for such abortions, because the law provides for such services under the 1967 act; i merely comment that we should not dismiss the pressure for them lightly, as some minor convenience that is provided for all who seek it.\\n           it may be helpful if i review briefly the legislative background to abortion issues. as my hon. friend said, it is an offence under the infant life (preservation) act 1929 to destroy the life of a child that is capable of being born alive, except when that is done in good faith for the sole purpose of saving the mother's life. although she did not refer to it specifically, i think that my hon. friend has always accepted that that exemption clause exists, allowing abortion regardless of gestation period to save the mother's life.\\n           the 1929 act contains a rebuttable presumption that a foetus of 28 weeks' gestation or more is capable of being born alive. in the event of a prosecution under the act in respect of the death of a child of 28 weeks' gestation or more, the onus would be on the defence to prove that the foetus was not capable of being born alive. in the case of the death of a child before the lapse of 28 weeks, it would be for the prosecution to prove that the child was capable of being born alive.\\n           let me make two observations. first, i am sure that my hon. friend would accept that, even with the advance in medical science, it is still difficult to date precisely the gestation period involved in a particular case. we are making best estimates. our understanding of the gestation process and of the date at which fertilisation occurred and, therefore, of the age of the foetus is improving, but it is still imperfect.\\n           i sense, too, that that there is a growing consensus among hon. members, based in part on medical advice, that the 28-week period could and should be reduced. i believe that that is a relatively uncontroversial statement, but this is a matter not for the government but for the house. i merely comment that to reduce the gestation period from 28 to 24 weeks would be a move that the house might find convenient. it would reflect a consensus among the medical profession, due, i suspect, to significant advances in medical technology.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1990, 3, 27, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1990-03-27.25'], ['uk.proc.d.1990-03-27.25.1.6', 97, 'uk.m.10634', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', \"i believe that

reflecting what seemed to me to be a consensus, based upon advances in medical technology. of course she is right that the difference between 23, 24 or 25 weeks is a matter of judgment. i am merely reflecting the advice received from medical circles: that a reduction from 28 to 24 weeks might be based upon advances in medical technology. however, i fully understand my hon. friend\\'s position.\\n           the main thrust of my hon. friend\\'s speech was directed towards the ruling of 5 february. it is a recent ruling. my hon. friend is very quick off the mark—quicker, perhaps, than the department of health, in the sense that we are talking about a judgment that is only six weeks old. she would not expect me at this stage to gibe a definitive answer as to our view of mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling. that is primarily a matter for my right hon. and learned friend the attorney-general.\\n           my hon. friend\\'s main comment was that the definition capable of being born alive as commented upon in mr. justice brooke\\'s judgment could have a different interpretation from the one that some people have put upon it. in other words, it is not just long-term viability: it is the ability to survive, if only for a few hours. i shall seek to deal with my hon friend\\'s comments, but may i preface my remarks by underlining once again that medical technology has advanced considerably since 1929 and that it is advancing all the time. in a clinical sense, therefore, the definition of \"viability\" is not immutable and fixed for all time. it is changing.\\n           when i visited st. helier hospital last week—a major london hospital in the constituency of my hon. friend the member for carshalton and wallington (mr. forman)— i saw the excellent efforts of the staff there to keep alive premature babies of very small birth weight by means of techniques that were undreamed of five or 10 years ago. another great pressure on resources in the health service—i referred earlier to abortions—and one to which we are happy to respond is the pressure to provide the technology, equipment and staff to keep alive premature babies, some born after a gestation period that would not even have been contemplated a few years ago.\\n           the case involving the judgment given by mr. justice brooke has only just been fully reported and its implications will have to be carefully considered. i assure my hon. friend that we will take great care to interpret the judgment. that is primarily a matter for the law officers, but i assure her—prompted by this debate, which has been helfpul—that we shall, with all speed, ensure that the implications of that judgment are properly considered.\\n           matters relating to the infant life (preservation) act 1929 are for the home secretary, as his department is responsible for the administration of that act. it is widely known that the consensus of the main medical and professional bodies is that, with the advances in medical and scientific development in neonatal medicine, it is now possible for some babies born after 24 weeks to survive. i accept my hon. friend\\'s comment that, while she does not dispute that fact, she would perhaps extend it to include infants born after a shorter gestation period. my department took steps to draw that view, shared by the relevant royal colleges, to the attention of members of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists.\\n           administratively, the 24-week limit has been imposed on those private facilities approved under the abortion act 1967. under that, as my hon. friend will know, they are authorised to carry out terminations after 20 weeks, and we have taken the step already of imposing the new lower limit administratively. there is of course the exception, to which i referred, in cases where the life of the mother is threatened.\\n           in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available, in great britain there were 23 abortions after 24 weeks. i cannot give my hon. friend the number within that 23 where it could be said that the abortion was necessary to preserve the life of the mother, but when i respond more fully to her in writing i will give her that analysis.\\n           my hon. friend referred to a case allegedly involving selective termination of pregnancy at king\\'s college hospital. as she said, the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton) has written to the minister for health drawing attention to that and asking a number of questions. details of that distressing case were reported recently in the sunday express. my department\\'s regional liaison division is conducting inquiries into the circumstances of that case and will shortly be reporting, not only to ministers at the department of health but to the law officers. i look forward to those inquiries being completed quickly.\\n           i share my hon. friend\\'s view that the ashley gardiner case, which involved reckless driving, was unfortunate. i well understand her anxiety and distress about the outcome of the case. as she rightly said, those are matters for the law officers, and she will not expect me to comment further.\\n           my hon. friend implied that there was a loss of will by the department of health in monitoring the 1967 act. i assure her that that is not the case. she argued that there were imperfections in the act, and that she wished to see parliament change the 1967 act and the infant life (preservation) act. given the law as it stands, it is emphatically not the case that there is a lack of will in the department of health. my department maintains a team of investigating officers, including doctors, nurses and administrative staff, and i assure my hon. friend that any complaints about specific cases, raised from whatever source, are properly and fully investigated and that, where necessary, appropriate action is taken.\\n

the administration of abortion legislation to ensure that no one, whether in nhs of private hospitals, is above the law. a proper implementation of observance of legislation is also important to protect the women who choose to have abortions, and we must not forget the health of the women involved. i resist my hon. friend's implication that there is a lack of will and determination to enforce the law by the government and the department.\\n           my hon. friend referred to lethal injections. i realise that she finds these techniques repugnant. whatever one's personal views about abortion, it is always a tragedy when an abortion occurs. the method adopted is, of course, a matter for clinical judgment. it is neither sensible nor practical to define in legislation the method

morning and she would not expect me to. the judgment that has to be made by the clinician involved is separate from the techniques, however repulsive and repugnant, used by the clinician to render the medical services necessary to the woman in a particular case. i hope that my hon. friend will agree that it is not sensible to enshrine in legislation or regulation a precise medical technique.\\n           on the conscience clause, i am aware that officials from my department have given evidence to the select committee on social services. we await its report with interest and i assure my hon. friend, who serves on that committee and through her the chairman and members of that committee that the recommendations and observations of the committee will be given very careful consideration and attention. i am given to understand that that report is expected shortly, and i know that the whole house will be interested in it.\\n           in conclusion, i repeat and sum up the answers that i have given to the nine points that my hon. friend made at the end of her speech. i am unable to answer the questions dealing with the legalities. she would not expect me to comment on those; that is not a matter for me or for the department. of health. she asked whether mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling should be observed: we are carefully studying that recent judgment, which has great significance for abortion procedures. she asked whether handicapped children are covered: all children are covered. i will take further advice on that matter, but that is my initial response.\\n           i hope that i have dealt with the issue of lethal injections. my hon. friend referred to lives being \"dismembered\": the use of medical techniques is a matter for the clinicians involved. she asked whether we will issue revised guidelines on procedures: once we have considered mr. justice brooke\\'s ruling and taken further advice, if revised guidelines are needed we will certainly issue them. she asked whether the king\\'s college baby case will be investigated: i have already given my hon. friend some assurances on that score.\\n           regarding the conscience clause and the select committee\\'s report, we await that with interest, and any recommendations that may be made will be followed very carefully.\\n           my hon. friend asked whether the law will be enforced: yes,

      "[['uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18.1.1', 2914, 'uk.m.17677', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'at the end of a parliamentary session which has seen the pro-life movement inside and outside parliament at its most active, it is appropriate that we should debate the administration of the abortion act 1967, although some of us would have preferred the debate to take place at a more civilised time.\\n           i am grateful to the minister for being with us at this late hour and i welcome the support of my hon. friends the members for basildon (mr. amess) and for maidstone (miss widdecombe), who applied for similar debates.\\n           during the passage of the abortion act in 1967, the then hon. member for maidstone was reprimanded by mr. deputy speaker for reading a newspaper in the chamber. he defended himself by saying that he was briefing himself for taking part in the debate. i have a feeling that the present hon. member for maidstone will need no such aid tonight, and i look forward to hearing her contribution.\\n           when the abortion act was passed in 1967 it was claimed that it would be the answer to many problems, and few could be found to oppose it. indeed, only 29 hon. members voted against it on second reading. it was said at that time that the act would reduce the rate of illegitimacy. now, over 21 years later, it is running at 15 per cent. and rising. we were assured in 1967 that the act would mean that every child would be a wanted child. today, every time we pick up a newspaper we read of yet more cases of sexual or physical child abuse. in 1967 women were assured that the abortion act would make them free. today, there is a dramatic increase in requests for post-abortion counselling, so damaged are many women by the abortions that they have had.\\n           far from solving society\\'s ills, easier abortion has resulted in more problems and i believe that many people are coming to accept that no problem is so big or serious that only the death of a helpless, unborn child will solve it. the right to life is the most basic of all human rights and we in the pro-life movement will continue to speak up for the small, naked, nameless and voiceless being which is the unborn child.\\n           this morning i wish to concentrate my remarks not on the major victims of abortion—the mother and child—but on those who are victims of discrimination because they wish to have nothing to do with abortion.\\n           section 4 of the abortion act 1967 provides that except where it is necessary to save life or to prevent grave permanent injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman, no person shall be under any duty … to participate in any treatment authorised by this act to which he has a conscientious objection. that conscience clause protects all those who are expected to play a part in the team effort leading to an abortion once the decision to perform an abortion has been reached. it therefore protects doctors, nurses, pharmacists, ancillary staff and clerical workers who play a necessary part in carrying out an abortion.\\n           those with conscientious objections to abortion are protected in the following ways. staff may not be asked to make appointments for patients to have abortions. nurses or paramedics may not be asked to help undress a patient admitted to hospital to have an abortion; and they may not be required to prepare the patient for the operation. operating theatre staff may not be required to prepare the theatre or sterilise instruments for abortion. if a theatre is used exclusively or almost exclusively for abortions, a conscientious objector may not be required to take part in the work of swabbing down either before or after an operating session; neither shall he or she be required to clean instruments or tubes used in abortion procedures.\\n           unfortunately, however, there are many different ways in which the present conscience clause of the abortion act does not work effectively. management can indicate that promotion prospects will be damaged if medical personnel do not take part in abortions. candidates for interview for medical appointments will not be successful in some cases unless they agree in advance that they will take part in abortions. peer group pressure—the burden falling upon other overworked medical personnel—can persuade individuals to become involved in abortions about which they are unhappy. ancillary workers, such as medical secretaries, may be dismissed if they refuse to become involved. unless an individual has been informed of his or her rights to object to becoming involved in abortions, when confronted with a problem, that person is unlikely to know how to opt out. for all those reasons and for many more, it is clear that the conscience clause does not work in practice and that it should be reviewed.\\n           the case of the carlisle baby is an example of the fear under which some doctors and nurses work. i need hardly remind the house that the case involved a baby who was aborted at 21 weeks and survived for almost four hours. through the protests of nurses, who appealed to the local catholic chaplain, the case came to light. however, they were terrified of losing their jobs. i stress that the young doctor who was called to see the baby when it continued to struggle to breathe was opposed to the abortion act and had refused to become involved in performing abortions. the gynaecologist who was responsible for the abortion had gone off duty and when he was asked to return, he refused.\\n           thus, nurses who disliked the operation and a conscientious young man who had opted not to carry out abortions were left to cope with the results of somebody else\\'s work. apart from the baby\\'s horrifying death, the carlisle case epitomises the total ineffectiveness of the conscience clause. nurses who were too frightened to opt out became involved in abortions on their wards. when there was an inquiry, they were too frightened to speak up for fear of losing their jobs. a young doctor was made to appear the villain of the piece and left to cope with the remains of someone else\\'s botched-up piece of butchery.\\n           i was recently told of a matron who said at a meeting: the conscience clause works in theory … but it most certainly does not work in practice. i have to run a hospital and i cater for shifts, holidays, staff illness, ensuring that patients are looked after throughout their treatment. obviously this is bound to create problems and it is hardly surprising that in some hospitals—although not all—nurses are made to feel that by opting out they are creating problems or being anti-social.\\n           in others the pressures go further than that. perhaps one of the most extreme cases about which i have been told is that involving a young african nurse who, on being appointed a staff nurse at a london hospital, made it absolutely clear that she was opposed to abortion and that she would take part in abortion operations only to save the mother\\'s life. for a year she was left in peace. however, she began working at nights and her duties involved her with patients in the hospital who were having abortions. at night, the number of staff was limited and the technique most commonly used in this hospital, which carried out private abortions, was to insert at some time during the night, prostaglandin pessaries in the vagina to soften the cervix before surgical intervention. the nurse refused to insert such a pessary.\\n           at first, one senior, presume taking advantage of the fact that the nurse was foreign, told her that she could be charged for refusing to obey the law. far from cowering, i am delighted to say, this outraged the young woman, and she made it clear that she would go to prison rather than become involved in an abortion. her senior then became rather more devious, bringing all manner of pressure to bear on her, and picking on her work. finally, in a great attempt to be persuasive and reasonable, the senior urged the nurse that she was not asking her to do anything unreasonable, and that all she had to do was to put the prostaglandin pessary on the patient\\'s bedside table, instructing her how to insert it. the nurse was told that that would not involve her in an abortion and was the least required of her under the law.\\n           at that point, the nurse, who was an evangelical christian, went to her church minister, who put her in touch with the society for the protection of unborn children, which sent her a solicitor\\'s letter and guaranteed all her legal fees if the hospital persisted in its conduct. the girl sent the letter to the hospital authorities and was left in peace.\\n           how many other young women have similar experiences but are not put in touch with people who can counsel them? the case involving trent regional health authority came to light as a result of the work of care and the spuc, but i wonder what would have happened if they had not learnt what was going on.\\n           the lane report referred to complaints that chances of promotion in the disciplines of obstetrics and gynaecology may be lost by those with a conscientious objection to the termination of pregnancy, but believed that it was probable that that affected only those departments where there were few staff or where the workload was heavy. complaints and allegations of discrimination have been received, especially about fully qualified doctors who are debarred from appointments. nurses are also affected, and their general position is difficult.\\n           the lane report said that, in the national health service, the abortion act 1967 has brought unhappiness to hospital nurses. the royal college of nursing has said that some nurses are reluctant to exercise their right to contract out under section 4 because to do so would create problems for their colleagues.\\n           i shall let some of those who have suffered speak for themselves by reading out their letters. the first says: dear sir,  i shall be most grateful if you will give me some advice re: abortion for i am having problems at work.  the position is that i am a midwife working on the labour ward at a large london hospital. we do a lot of scans, for we have an excellent scan department, so patients are referred from all over the country. also they do fetoscopies on patients not only referred from around the country but from abroad. many of our patients are found to have abnormal foetuses more so than from a normal catchment area, so this causes problems, for although many of the referrals go back to their home area for abortions, lots are aborted here (for they want the foetus for research purposes).  three years ago when i applied for the post in london i made my position regarding abortions clear—that is that i would not wish to be involved in abortions at all. the then senior midwife assured me that this was not a problem for they rarely did abortions. however, while this was true three years ago, it certainly is not the case now.  the senior midwife has changed three times since then and at present we have no direct person in charge on labour ward so all the sisters have a share of power. as far as i can see they all agree with abortions, and while some don\\'t like them being done on labour ward, none can accept my objections to caring for these patients.  so at least once a week there is trouble and i find myself having to argue my point. this has happened before, the pattern seems to recur every few months. i have up to this been reluctant to go to the chief nursing officer for i know what will happen: i will simply be moved off labour ward. also i know it will not go well in my records, and seeking references in the future is a consideration.  i do feel very unhappy about this, apart from religious views, on an emotional level i find it difficult to cope and would find it absolutely impossible to give advice and support to a woman having an abortion while i feel so strongly that it is wrong. just before christmas they aborted an abnormal foetus, but at delivery it was perfect, it nearly broke my heart. the abortion act 1967 does have a conscience clause, but no one pays attention to it. i asked the student nurses about the position on the \\'gynaecology\\' ward where all the social abortions are done. they said they are not allowed to opt out. if they were catholics then they could object and would not be sent to the gynaecology ward at all, so missing this experience, but also making themselves unpopular.  a doctor whom i asked about this issue … said they fare even worse than midwives, for they are all but told if you don\\'t want to do abortions don\\'t bother coming into obs and gynaecology.  i should be interested to hear your view and would appreciate any advice you can offer. a second letter said: i work in an operating theatre in a london hospital as a trainee o.d.a. we work as scrubbed assistants to assist the surgeon and also as anaesthetic assistants.  we have operations for women when they have had a miscarriage and they are called e.r.p.c. (evacuation of retained products at conception). however, it has come to my attention that some of these are actually \\'clean-ups\\' after hormonally induced abortions. there is no way they indicate these women have been having a miscarriage as the result of a dose of hormones.  i feel extremely compassionate for women who have had a genuine miscarriage, but i am worried and upset about those miscarriages that aren\\'t really miscarriages. at work i was told that any miscarriage is a miscarriage, and that since it isn\\'t an abortion they have not got to tell us that it is a hormonally induced miscarriage and that i have no right to refuse them. i want your point of view on this. a third letter sent to the spuc said: i am employed as a staff nurse at my local hospital to work in the general operating department. occasionally i am put down on the duty rota to assist in the day care theatre during the gynaecological lists which often include as many as ten abortions. i have stated my objection to assisting in abortions to the senior sister who will only assure me that i would not have to be the instrument (or scrub) nurse. however she does expect me to be present in the theatre to assist setting up the theatre, tying gowns, opening packs and clearing away, believing that this role cannot be described as \\'being involved\\'. on wednesday 16th september i attended a meeting at bideford parish church where a speaker from s.p.u.c. showed us your video on abortion. since then i feel very strongly that i must make a committed stand against the abortions taking place in my hospital and … have absolutely nothing to do with them.  before i go and see the senior sister again i would appreciate your advice on how far i can take the clause in the 1967 abortion act in making a conscientious objection to assisting in abortion. can i refuse to be present in the theatre during an abortion? the letters that i have read out give some indication of the problems faced by many members of the medical profession since the 1967 act came into force. clearly we are putting an unfair burden on the consciences of many people. some can be helped—as they have been—by pro-life organisations like the spuc and its conscience code, but many others are unaware of their rights and afraid to exercise them.\\n           others—as in the case of mrs. barbara janaway—do not appear to have rights under the act. mrs. janaway, a medical receptionist, was dismissed after refusing to type abortion documents, and it was held that she was not entitled to the protection of the \"conscientious objection\" clause because she was not participating in a termination of pregnancy in the meaning of the act.\\n           earlier this year, my hon. friend the member for basildon introduced the abortion (right of conscience) (amendment) bill, while i introduced a similar bill to cover ancillary workers. the bills were based on a simple principle: doctors, nurses and ancillary workers should not be expected or required to be involved in any way in the performing of abortions unless they had first made it clear that they had no conscientious objections to being so involved.\\n           this reverses the current impractical position in which doctors and nurses are required to take part in abortions unless they declare that they have conscientious objections to such involvement. the bill took the sensible approach of requiring those involved to opt in rather than to opt out of abortion. the bill\\'s purpose was to prevent medical and ancillary personnel from being cajoled or pressurised into taking part in abortions when they did not wish to do so. that suggestion has merit and would help to resolve what is undoubtedly worrying many medical staff. i hope that if a similar bill is introduced next year the government will look favourably on it.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1989, 7, 27, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18'], ['uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18.1.2',

administration of the abortion act 1967. i pay a warm tribute to my hon. friends the members for hyndburn and for maidstone (miss widdecombe) for the magnificent job that they have done in the past year to make sure that the fundamental issue of abortion is raised in the house on every conceivable opportunity so that it does not move far from the minds of hon. members.\\n           i also pay tribute to my hon. friend the under-secretary of state for health for the courtesy that he has shown in responding to all our debates and in providing us quickly with the information that we have sought. our hon. friend the member for chipping barnet (mr. chapman) has a close interest in these matters and i am pleased to see him here for the debate. it would be extremely churlish of me not to mention the hon. member for barking (ms. richardson), because, although we fundamentally disagree with her view on the subject, at least she recognises the great importance of the matter and is here to take part in the debate.\\n           i hope that when the minister responds he will tell us about the government\\'s intentions on the warnock report. i note that only this week his department issued a strict new code of practice governing the use of the foetus and foetal material in treatment and research. i trust that he will take this opportunity to enlarge on the issue. perhaps he will also give some detail about how the government intend to handle the warnock report.\\n           will there be an opportunity to vote on the time at which an abortion can be obtained? i hope that every party in the house will allow a free vote on the time limit. it would be conceived nationally as an outrage if any political party imposed a whip on that issue. there is little point in being a member of parliament if the house cannot meet and decide that protection is needed in respect of the time at which life begins. a recent newspaper story carried the headline: tiny thomas wins brave battle for life\". the story says: tiny thomas johnson shouldn\\'t even have been born until the end of next month.  but already he is 10 weeks old and doing very nicely, thank you.  doctors even refused to speculate on his chances of surviving after he was born 16 weeks premature and weighing just 11b 15oz in may.  `they just said we would have to take it hour by hour, day by day,\\' said proud mum christine johnson of wood street, elton, bury. that is what we are debating. my hon. friend the member for hyndburn spoke about the bill that i sought to introduce on the conscience clause, but i shall direct my remarks to the financial involvement of private clinics. i am proud to be a conservative. i have no trouble dealing with the profit motive that we enjoy in this country. however, i am outraged that anyone should make a profit out of the abortion industry. when abortion act was being debated in 1967, a press conference was held by pro-life gynaecologists, and it attracted much abuse because one of the doctors described what was then the abortion bill as a licence to print money for the shady end of the medical profession. doctors pleading for the law to be passed immediately protested that money was the last thing to be included on their agenda. they simply wanted to help poor women in need of support. yet, when the law came into effect, in the words of sir john peel, at that time the queen\\'s gynaecologist as well as president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, they all removed themselves from the back streets to the front streets\". once there, they increased their fees and the number of patients beyond belief.\\n           it was hardly surprising that within only a few months, london became known as the abortion capital of the world—and once the united states supreme court had made its famous and disastrous decision to allow abortion on demand up to birth, we saw london reduced to the abortion capital of europe. i need hardly say that abortionists made a large amount of money as a result of the passage of the act.\\n           however, life was not as easy as the abortionist believed that it would be. as we know, doctors and clinics cannot advertise. thus, in order to reach the public, they needed some way in which to promote their service. without the ability to advertise, they were held back. then somebody had the brilliant idea of opening an agency, called the pregnancy advisory service. there was no law to stop it from advertising. in turn, it would refer the girls who responded to its posters on stations, in tubes, at bus stops and in newspapers to the abortionists and, overnight, a considerable amount of money was made.\\n           such is the way of the media that these agencies were presented as some kind of guardian angels, looking after the well-being of girls in need. in fact, they were abortion referral agencies that got round the existing law and touted for clients through advertising. shortly after they first came into being, two of them succeeded in getting themselves registered as charities. i would not suggest that they have broken any charity laws, but i would add that whereas most of us think of charities as made up of people acting from love, there is little doubt that doctors and others in the service of charitable pregnancy advisory services have been provided with incomes from their labours.\\n           in the case of the british pregnancy advisory service—for example—its total income in the year 1986 was £4,383,000. of that, £2,176,000 went on staff salaries and wages and a further £750,000 went on medical and doctors\\' fees—meaning that about 67 per cent. went on salaries and fees. in comparison, only £536,000–12 per cent.—was spent on medical and other supplies. even more surprising—considering that we are talking about a charity—is the fact that the minute sum of £32,000 was given in grants to \"indigent patients\" and a further £51,000 was \"written off\" in loans to patients. in other words this charity gave only 1·9 per cent. of its income to patients in comparison with over 66 per cent. in payments to doctors, nurses and others.\\n           over the years many of us have had cause to become increasingly worried about the quality of the counselling that is given to girls through the so-called pregnancy advisory services. is the advice given more to the benefit of the doctors and others than to the girls?\\n           bernadette thompson, to name one girl, runs british victims of abortion. it is an organisation which helps women who are experiencing trauma. bernadette had an abortion about 16 years ago through the services of a pregnancy advisory counsellor, and a charitable pregnancy advisory service at that, but she would say that she received no counselling. she was merely referred for an abortion, an operation which she has regretted ever since. there are many thousands of women suffering as bernadette thompson did.\\n           about six weeks ago there was an article about bernadette and her experience and the work of british victims of abortion in the women\\'s magazine bella. within one week bernadette received over 150 calls from women asking for help, and some of them had been grieving for a number of years. she is still receiving calls. this shows the sort of feeling that there must be throughout the country among women who have gone through similar experiences and have since regretted it. many of the women had been aborted through so-called charities and they did not want to return to them for support and help during their grieving.\\n           there are many who do not agree with me on the principle of abortion. i know that the hon. member for barking is one of them. i make no secret of my opposition to the killing of unborn children, which is shared by my hon. friend the member for macclesfield (mr. winterton). yet when he introduced the abortion (financial benefit) bill, he was amazed by the amount of support he received. the aim of the bill was to hit directly at profiteers in the private sector. it aimed to sever the links between abortion agencies and private clinics, and called on medical practitioners referring women for abortion to make a declaration that they had no financial interest in the place where the abortions were performed and derived no benefit from it.\\n           as most hon. members will be aware, the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists opposed any amendment to the abortion act 1967 yet even the college wrote to my hon. friend the member for macclesfield: we have seen in the press that you intend to introduce a private members\\' bill to implement the recommendations of the 1976 select committee on abortion, so that there should be no financial links between doctors and agencies who refer women for abortions, and the institutions in which abortions are carried out.  we at the royal college would like to support the spirit in what you are trying to achieve, as we think that this, after all, is only right and proper. among the groups who were threatened by the bill of my hon. friend the member for macclesfield was a company. i am loth to use parliamentary privilege on this occasion and so i shall call the company miss y. it advertised its pregnancy advisory services. clients—not patients—were referred to a hospital by a mr. x, who was not a medical doctor. he was a business man who ran a private clinic.\\n           the matter becomes much more worrying when we realise that miss y, who runs the agency, is none other than mr. x\\'s wife. not surprisingly, they have become extremely wealthy. their business covers abortions and cosmetic surgery, as a result of which they were exposed on the \"that\\'s life\" programme in january 1985. that programme revealed that medical services offered in connection with cosmetic surgery through certain advisory agencies had led to tragic results. the same programme also exposed other abortionists. it apparently takes a certain kind of mentality to exploit unhappiness, whether it be caused by an unplanned pregnancy or dissatisfaction with one\\'s appearance.\\n           mr. x responded to that broadcast by threatening to sue the bbc—a tactic he apparently uses to silence anyone who attacks his methods. when a newspaper announced mr. x\\'s intention to open a hospital to perform abortions, he threatened legal action against a group that leafleted the area in an attempt to arouse public opposition to his plans. he claimed that the newspaper story was incorrect, but seemed to make no attempt to have a correction published.\\n           late in 1987, my hon. friend the member for macclesfield was informed that eight referral agencies had financial links with clinics providing abortions. the number rose to 32 when he asked about individuals who were directors or trustees both of companies or charities providing abortions and counselling and of clinics offering abortions.\\n           there is no doubt that immense fortunes are made from abortion clinics. the answer to a parliamentary question tabled at the end of 1987 revealed that a total of 594 beds in private clinics were licensed for abortions, and that 114,621 abortions were performed that year. that meant that each bed was used an average of 193 times a year.\\n           at that time, the cost of a private abortion, including the referral agency\\'s charges, was, at a conservative estimate, £200—thus producing an income of £38,592 per licensed bed. the total turnover realised from that barbaric industry reached £22,923,648 annually. as a conservative, i am absolutely ashamed at the profit that is made from destroying lives. returning to mr. x, the income of the private nursing home of which he is a director, and which is provided with clients by his wife, totalled £810,600. that is not a bad income from a clinic with only 21 beds.\\n           earlier i spoke of a \"barbaric industry.\" when the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton) introduced his bill, a video showing a d and e abortion was introduced to this country. in the earliest stages of abortion, a technique known as d and c—dilation and curettage—is used, whereby the mouth of the womb is dilated and a curette is used to scrape the inside, in the process of which the foetus is cut to pieces.\\n           after about the 12th week of pregnancy, a curette is not sufficiently strong enough to tear apart the bone structure and limbs of the unborn baby, so the instruments used are decidedly stronger. they are rather like those used in carpentry and other forms of building work. a different title is given to that technique. it is known as dilation and extraction. that sounds harmless enough, but the video \"eclipse of reason\" proved otherwise, and showed precisely what an abortion of that type involves.\\n           one aspect of pro-abortionists that worries me most is the way that they distort the truth, while pro-lifers are told by politicians of all shades of opinion that dilation and extraction is not a form of abortion that is performed in britain. the pro-abortionists plant newspaper stories claiming that pro-lifers arouse public feeling in an emotive fashion, with stories of outdated abortion techniques not used in this country.\\n           the office of population censuses and surveys monitors show that those claims are untrue. far from d and e being used less, it is on the increase, particularly in private clinics. there are several reasons for that. it can be upsetting for nurses, to whom my hon. friend the member for hyndburn referred, caring for a patient having an abortion by the use of prostaglandin to see a whole baby emerge when the abortion takes place. in contrast, d and e ensures that nothing but mangled pieces, often crushed and battered beyond recognition, emerges.\\n           a second reason is that the d and e takes far less time than a prostaglandin abortion. when money has to be made and the whole procedure has to be completed as speedily and efficiently as possible, why not use the technique which takes the least amount of time?\\n           i was sickened when i met a doctor who had just visited a private abortion clinic in london which specialises in late abortions. there the pieces torn from the baby were so large that huge pieces of arm and leg of spine were put through one of those large mincing machines that we see in butchers\\' shops to enable them to pass through the sluice.\\n           i conclude with the latest figures. in 1987 in the private sector 12,222 abortions were carried out at 13 weeks or more and of those 3,698—nearly one third—were carried out by d and e. those tiny humans, whom we know feel pain, are being destroyed for money. that is the kind of barbarity which i and my hon. friends are determined to stop.\\n           i shall never cease to be amazed at the manner in which some of those involved in the abortion industry seek to deceive themselves. the chairman of the trustees of the british pregnancy advisory service wrote to doctors saying that abortion does not typically require them to diagnose and treat a morbid condition, but rather to consider the wishes, wonders and worries of normal people in normal health.\\n           is that really the way in which they bemuse themselves when they tear a child limb from limb, having to put the larger pieces through a mincing machine in order to get them down the sluice?\\n           i and my hon. friends who have spoken tonight are appalled by that, and the british nation will join us in our abhorrence.\\n        ',

debate and i congratulate my hon. friend the member for hyndburn (mr. hargreaves) on securing a debate for which several hon. members applied, because it is an issue, which has dominated the last two parliamentary years. frequently, attempts to resolve some of the worries that have been voiced tonight have been defeated, not because a body of opinion in the house resented what was being done but because we were not allowed to have a free and fair vote.\\n           i hope that my hon. friend the minister can confirm our hope that when the warnock proposals come up for discussion next year we can have a free and fair vote on issues other than those strictly raised in the warnock report.\\n           the debate is on the abortion act 1967, which is administered far more in the breach than in the observance. in particular, there are several areas of concern where specific questions can be asked which i hope that my hon. friend will answer.\\n           in the first case, i am concerned about the administration of the act and the way in which it takes on board the infant life (preservation) act 1929. in an adjournment debate on 8 june, my hon. friend the minister accepted that it was necessary to observe the infant life (preservation) act in the administration of the 1967 act. in response to a point that i made in that debate, which was principally about the carlisle baby, he said: doctors are properly mindful of the requirements of the act and do not carry out an abortion, by any method, when they consider that a child is capable of being born alive.\"—[ official report, 8 june 1989; vol. 154, c. 465.] my question to the minister is this: if they do not carry out abortions when they consider that a child is capable of being born alive, what is the purpose of the injection of urea or saline, which is commonly used in the prostaglandin treatment to ensure that the child is born dead? what is the point of ensuring that a child is born dead if the doctor does not believe that it is capable of being born alive in the first place? the act is not administered to take account of the infant life (preservation) act.\\n           we now know that children are capable of surviving independently from the 24th week. yet in a parliamentary answer the minister told us that last year there were 17 cases of abortions after the 24th week, six of which were not even for handicap or to save the life of the mother; they were done under the social clauses. will the minister explain how he can reconcile the statement that doctors do not abort children capable of being born alive with the fact that they abort children of a gestational age in excess of that at which children do survive, and at which such survivals are fully documented?\\n           in the light of the recent spate of survivals at 22 weeks, how can doctors abort after that age and seriously believe that the child is not capable of being born alive? in the carlisle baby case, in which the abortion took place at 21 weeks, the child was not just capable of being born alive; she was actually born alive.\\n           will the minister consider outlawing completely the d and e method? there is no good reason for dismembering alive in the womb, without anaesthetic, a child which in different circumstances would be in an incubator, loved and cherished, with everyone desperately fighting for his or her survival. can the minister imagine circumstances in which a child in an incubator could be dismembered alive? can he imagine a national health service or a ministry that was responsible for licensing private clinics allowing that? if it cannot be done to a child in an incubator, why should he allow it to be done to a child in the womb? it is not just a question of medical or clinical judgment—the panacea behind which so many of these issues disappear. it is not down to clinical judgment whether we dismember alive babies in the womb. it is a clear moral issue for society. there is an optional method. i do not particularly like that either, but at least it does not involve cruelty. that is the prostaglandin method.\\n           will the minister bring into general conformity with the rest of operations abortions involving children under the age of 16? if a child needs its tonsils out, it must have parental consent for the general anaesthetic that will be applied. yet in response to my hon. friend the member for bury, north (mr. burt), the minister said that young girls under the age of 16 do not require their parents\\' consent to have an abortion performed under general anaesthetic. why is abortion singled out for exemption? why is a child not allowed to decide to have her tonsils out when she is allowed to decide to kill an unborn child—at an age when she cannot possibly have a concept of the consequences and of all the moral issues involved, for which, surely, she requires parental guidance?\\n           then there is the question of the unperson, to use an orwellian phrase. when i asked the minister about the case of the carlisle baby, and asked why the child was allowed to stay for three hours, breathing, with a pulse rate, fully alive—so much so that the nurses saw fit to baptise her—he replied that resuscitation equipment was not provided, and she was not registered for birth, and she was not registered for death, all for the same reason: the doctor in the case had decided that it was not a live birth.\\n           if a living, breathing human being can survive for three hours, how can a doctor say that that is not a live birth and that none of the rights of life follows? if a small premature baby as a result of a normal premature birth is alive, then a small premature baby as a result of an abortion is alive. the abortion act 1967 is not administered fairly or equitably. anything goes when it comes to an abortion. there is no way that a child born normally could be declared a non-person.\\n           there is also the nonsense of piecemeal legislation for the foetus at all stages of development. the warnock report proposes experiments up to 14 days. in the same breath, the polkinghorne report states that foetal tissue may be used in the second trimester, which is from the 12th to the 24th week. those two reports are not taken in conjunction with the abortion act 1967 and considered comprehensively. they are being taken piecemeal.\\n           when it discusses warnock the house will probably be deceived into believing that nothing will happen after the 14th day. but polkinghorne states that experiments can occur at horrendously late stages. will the minister admit that we need one comprehensive abortion bill which reviews the working of the abortion act 1967, considers the infant life (preservation) act 1929 and the financial administration—a matter raised so ably by my hon. friend the member for basildon (mr. amess)—examines the workings of the conscience clause, and considers foetal tissue and embryology research. one bill should do all that to clarify those issues and sort them out once and for all. we do not need a long series of attempts to amend each and every working of the gross abortion act 1967.\\n           is the minister convinced that the abortion act 1967, in its own terms, is adhered to? the carlisle baby was aborted under the terms of a clause which states that if there is a substantial risk, not just some sort of risk, of serious—and not any old sort—of handicap, that is grounds for an abortion. the carlisle baby had a 50 per cent. chance of inheriting a very rare disease of which her father had only a mild form. where does a substantial risk of serious handicap occur there? will the minister admit that abortions have been carried out for club foot, hare lips and all sorts of minor handicaps? the abortion act 1967 is not even policed properly in its own terms and there is no will to police it. does the minister believe that new advice should be issued, if not a comprehensive inquiry launched, into how well the 1967 act is implemented even in its own terms and even before we have seen the abuses that result from it?\\n           to sum up, i put these questions to the minister. how can he equate the use of injections to kill a child with a statement that doctors would not abort where they thought that there was a possibility of a child being born alive? will he consider outlawing the d and e operation altogether? will he re-examine the requirements for permission for anaesthetics for young girls under 16? in what circumstances is a child declared a non-person when it has existed? we know that the carlisle case caused horror, but there are probably other cases where children are born and live for only a very brief time. are they also regarded as non-live births? will he investigate the financial regulation of private abortion clinics and consider issuing advice on the interpretation of \"substantial risk\"? will he overhaul the policing of the abortion act 1967 and will he consider the case for comprehensive, rather than piecemeal, reform?\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1989, 7, 27, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18'],

anti-abortion people to try to change the abortion act 1967, and two lords bills on the subject. all 16 attempts were introduced over the past 20 years. i have not been involved in all of them, but i

that public opinion has been going in a counter direction. the 1988 marplan poll asked a sample of 1,552 people in 103 constituents do you think that women should have the right to choose an abortion in the first few months of pregnancy? eighty per cent. of the women and men who were polled agreed that they should. eighty one per cent. of women were in favour. when the sample was analysed, it was found that 86 per cent. of those who said that they were church of england were in favour, and, surprisingly, 67 per cent. of roman catholics were also in favour. the fifth report on british social attitudes in 1988 showed that 54 per cent. of men and 54 per cent. of women supported the idea that only the woman should decide whether to have a child.\\n           although no one likes the idea of abortion—contrary to what has been said here this morning—the sample shows that a substantial majority of the population believes that it is the woman who is important. i have been quite taken back during the debate by the lack of reference to the women who have to make agonising decisions and who do not like having an abortion, but who have one for various reasons which are personal to them, either medical or social. when we say \"social\", we mean things that are connected with their personal lives and their families. the public obviously recognise that those women are the ones who are important and who should make the choice.\\n           a relatively small group of hon. members, who are against abortion, have been trying to convince the house that women should have no say at all, and that public opinion should be treated with contempt, in favour of their narrow and, in my opinion, cruel, moral judgment. so far, thank goodness, they have been unsuccessful.\\n           the hon.

appeared in the warnock report will contain some opportunity for the house to make a decision on abortion. my personal view is that i hope very much that that bill will not contain any reference to abortion. as i understand it, the government are proposing to give the house an option of voting for or against pre-embryo research, which is probably the right way to deal with it. however, to mix the whole argument up with abortion would be wrong and would, in fact, obscure many of the other parts of warnock that need to be fully explored and fully debated. i hope that the minister will resist any blandishments to include a clause on abortion.\\n           the hon. member for basildon really went over the top when he talked about the millions that are being made, as he alleges, out of abortion clinics. i do not know very much about the commercial sector, but i know quite a lot about the charitable sector. i am a trustee of the british pregnancy advisory service, and i have seen or heard nothing of which i could be ashamed. i invite the hon. gentleman to come along to see for himself. if he is talking about the commercial sector, which existed long before the 1967 act came in, that is a different matter, and one which he must take up with the minister and on which the department of health must decide. i am sure that the minister will be able to confirm, however, that everything is all right in the charitable sector.\\n           i shall give as an example some figures that i obtained only this afternoon, when i knew that i would be participating in the debate, and which i have had confirmed by the british pregnancy advisory service, which is one of the biggest charitable organisations. the bpas carries out one third of all the national health service abortions. sixty eight per cent. of bpas\\'s total income is spent on fees and salaries, and 77 per cent. of the total nhs expenditure on abortion is spent on fees and salaries. the bpas is not, therefore, paying out lavish money.\\n           the average cost of a bpas abortion, at 1989 prices, is less than £190, including overheads. the cost of a national health service abortion, at 1988 prices, is £190, excluding overheads. the bpas cannot, therefore, be charging exorbitant fees. national heath service hospitals using bpas services are, therefore, not wasting public money but saving it.\\n           i wish that the hon. member for basildon and other conservative members would stop making allegations about the charitable sector. i do not deny that it pays wages, because people must be paid for their work and expertise. however, they are not millionaires and they are not trying to make profits in the dreadful way that the hon. member for basildon suggested. all bpas counsellors and general practitioners are paid on a sessional basis. they therefore see however many patients turn up at a session, which includes contraception, infertility advice, pregnancy testing, and counselling on matters other than abortion, as well as abortion counselling and referral.\\n           the consultant who performs the operation has no link with patients until they visit the clinic. there are therefore no incentives, links or profiteering. there is no department of health information to uphold claims of abuse of misuse. if claims of abuse or misuse had been made, the department would have withdrawn the rights of the pregnancy advisory service or the bpas to act.\\n           several references were made to the carlisle baby. of course everyone was shocked by what they heard, but i was shocked by the lack of concern shown throughout the saga for the mother. much as been said of the baby, who was allegedly born alive and who breathed for a while before dying, which we regret. i also have feelings for the mother, who had her name, medical records and life history dragged through the courts, but for what? why should she have been so castigated? why should she have had to open up her life in that way?\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1989, 7, 27, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18'], ['uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18.1.11', 7, 'uk.m.17677', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'the mother took the

mention it. time and again, conservative members drag up the case of the carlisle baby, but it will not further influence the public.\\n           i know that the minister wants to ask all the questions asked by the hon. member for maidstone, so i shall make one or two final points. the anti-abortion lobby fails to face up to the fact that the abortion act 1967 was woman-centred legislation. it was enacted because before that women felt forced to go to back streets for abortions.\\n           the force of the abortion act 1967 was to protect and support women. there is nothing wrong with that. we should now take it a step further and introduce earlier abortions for women who want them. at present they are alowed only in exceptional circumstances. early abortions will be possible only if we amend the legislation to provide for self-referral up to 12 or 14 weeks.\\n           we must ensure that nhs facilities are evenly spread throughout the country. incidentally, that would deal with the arguments about the charitable sector. women in the west midlands—an area which you, madam deputy speaker, represent—have much more difficulty in getting an abortion than women in the north-east or south-west. wealthy women always have and always will be able to get an abortion, even if the anti-abortionists succeed in repealing the act, which i hope they do not, but ordinary women face great difficulties.\\n           we are moving into the 1990s. women are being exhorted to train for new technologies, to plan their lives, to enter new industries and fill the gaps in the employment market. how can they do that if restrictions on abortions make it even more difficult for them to plan their family properly? family planning is being cut. i hope that conservative members do not approve of that. i certainly do not. how can women control their bodies if this male-dominated house makes it more difficult for them to plan their lives and keep their family happy?\\n           only this evening i was talking to a member of staff who told me that when many years ago a local friend of her mother's who had 13 children became pregnant for the 14th time and when she tried to abort the child herself, she died. i do not want those days to return. i want women to be confident that they are not being patronised and that the legislation supports and gives them as much information and as many facilities as possible, and then allows them to make choices about their life, family, partners and children. that is the way to approach this thorny subject. none of us likes abortions or wants people who do not want them to have one. we should improve the 1967 act to give women the choice.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1989, 7, 27, 0, 0),

the member for hyndburn (mr. hargreaves) on his success in the ballot and on introducing yet another debate on this extremely important subject. i also pay tribute to the eloquent contributions by my hon. friends the members for basildon (mr. amess) and for maidstone (miss widdecombe) and to the contribution by the hon. member for barking (ms. richardson).\\n           these are important issues and, from my point of view, any hour of the day or night is appropriate to debate them. my hon. friend the member for maidstone asked a number of questions. although i shall, in the time available to me, answer as many as i can, i hope that she will permit me to write to her in due course so that i may answer them more carefully and comprehensively.\\n           my hon. friend the member for basildon drew attention to those who were present in the chamber at this early hour, and he was charitable in referring to me, for which i thank him, and to others, including the whip who was on the bench at the time. it should be noted that one of the new members of the whips\\' office is now on duty. we congratulate my hon. friend the member for sheffield, hallam (mr. patnick) on his appointment and hope to welcome him to many more debates at these early hours.\\n           on the order paper earlier in the day was a motion to wish the serjeant at arms well for the future. i am sure that hon. members who are present now and were not in their places earlier will wish to be associated with those good wishes. it must be unusual for a distinguished servant of the house to be thanked and then to have to remain in the chamber for the succeeding 24 hours. in regard to this debate he and i perform the same duties. we are servants of the house. my job as minister is to make sure that the act with which we are concerned is administered properly and to provide information and statistics to the house, but not to make moral judgments or take any initiative in relation to an extension or contraction of the act. therefore, i see my role as being to answer questions of fact and to assist in the deliberations of the house.\\n           this subject has featured often in our deliberations. the hon. member for barking said that in the present session, for example, the house had debated on 16 december a motion on the rights of the unborn child, introduced by my hon. friend the member for slough (mr. watts), and that six private members\\' bills on abortion-related subjects have been introduced, including the abortion (amendment) bill sponsored by my hon. friend the member for maidstone. there have been two adjournment debates, one introduced by my hon. friend who initiated tonight\\'s debate, on the united nations convention on the rights of the child, and the other on 8 june on the carlisle baby case initiated by my hon. friend the member for maidstone. in addition, 112 parliamentary questions on abortion topics have been addressed either to the department of health or to the office of population censuses and surveys, for which i have ministerial responsibility.\\n           there has been reference tonight to the prospect of legislation on the issues dealt with in the warnock report which the government have said will be introduced during the lifetime of this parliament. there has been considerable media speculation in recent weeks about its content and timing. hon. members will understand that i cannot go beyond restating that commitment to bring forward a bill.\\n           it would not be right for me to comment on the contents of the legislation and in particular on whether, as some hon. members have suggested, it should contain provisions about abortion. i shall, as i have done in the past, draw the attention of the leader of the house to the comments that have been made.\\n           in 1967 parliament was given the opportunity in a private member\\'s bill to build on an existing framework of criminal law which prevented abortions except in a very restrictive set of circumstances. parliament agreed to do so on a free vote. it is, of course, open to parliament to alter that framework. i realise that many hon. members feel sincerely that the law needs radical adjustment. it is against that wide divergence of views that the government must operate. we also have the views of the select committee in another place, which has suggested a framework for amending the abortion law. clearly, the government must take account of all those factors, and of what has been said in this debate, in looking at the legislative position. that we shall carefully do.\\n           this debate focuses mainly on the administration of the abortion act 1967. as the house knows, my department takes seriously its task of monitoring the operation of the act, which was introduced as a private member\\'s bill and was passed by both houses on the basis of a free vote. the act allows abortion where two doctors certify in good faith the the risk to the life, or injury to the physical or mental health, of the pregnant woman or the existing children of her family would be greater if the pregnancy continued than if it were terminated.\\n           as parliament has decided that abortions may lawfully be carried out in the circumstances set out in the act, the government, like their predecessors, consider that facilities for abortion treatment should be available. the government also have a duty to ensure that the provisions of the act are properly applied until and unless parliament chooses to change that law.\\n           within the national health service the level of gynaecological provision, including abortion, is, like any other provision, decided by individual health authorities. the government believe that such decisions are best taken locally in the light of authorities\\' first-hand knowledge of local needs and priorities and competing claims on resources. the private sector adds to the range of options available offering flexibility to both patients and health authorities. it is for health authorities to decide the extent of any arrangements made for treating nhs patients in the private sector. in 1988 some 9,000 abortions were performed under such arrangements.\\n           the operation of the act is monitored closely by my department, through its control of the private abortion sector and the investigation of specific complaints. all operating medical practitioners are required to notify the chief medical officer of each abortion that they perform. the notification form contains many details, including the grounds for abortion, the estimated gestation and the method of operation. those forms are scrutinised by staff authorised by the chief medical officer to ensure that they do not indicate any contravention of the abortion law.\\n           it might be helpful to my hon. friends and to the house if i were to say something at this point about the way in which the operation of the abortion act is monitored in the private sector. before we approve a clinic or private hospital for the termination of pregnancy under section 1(3) of the 1967 act, the premises and facilities are inspected by the department\\'s medical and nursing officers, and persons connected with the application are interviewed by investigating officers. an important element in the process of approval, and subsequent monitoring, is the system of \"assurances\"—instituted in the early 1970s after some abuse of the original arrangements had become apparent. the assurances are specific undertakings which proprietors of \"approved places\" are required to give to the secretary of state on the conduct of their premises and the facilities available. in effect, the assurances form a set of conditions on which initial approval depends and contravention of which could lead to the withdrawal of approval, thus preventing any more abortions from being carried out at that place unless approval is reinstated.\\n           all private sector nursing homes, clinics and private hospitals approved under the abortion act are subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by the department\\'s medical, nursing and investigative officers. a thorough check of business and administrative arrangements is made and patients\\' notes and medical records are examined. any irregularities are followed up and the appropriate action taken to obtain future compliance by the proprietors. in an extreme case this could involve the withdrawal of the secretary of state\\'s approval or, where there is evidence that a criminal offence may have been committed, a reference to the director of public prosecutions. the machinery that i have described does not reveal any abuse of the act. my hon. friend the member for maidstone asked me to comment specifically on that.\\n           the carlisle baby case was raised by my hon. friend the member for maidstone. this case was the subject of the adjournment debate on 8 june during which i addressed as fully as possible, and as far as the requirements of confidentiality and possible legal action allowed, the issues that gave rise to the concerns expressed by hon. members. my hon. friend asks again why no attempt was made to resuscitate the baby. as i told the house on 8 june, the doctor concerned made a clinical judgment that this was not a live birth.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1989, 7, 27, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18'], ['uk.proc.d.1989-07-27.18.1.18', 66, 'uk.m.10634', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'the minister says that the doctor decided that it was not a live birth. the question that i asked in this debate was how can one accept, when a child has been breathing without the aid of artificial

point. the decision was properly, and entirely, for the doctor, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on it. it was a clinical judgment. i shall deal shortly with the circumstances surrounding it. if he had decided that resuscitation should have been attempted, the appropriate action would have been taken.\\n           how doctors decide whether a baby has been born alive is a question that should be asked of obstetricians and paediatricians. my understanding is that a doctor\\'s main criterion of a live birth before 28 weeks of pregnancy is that, when born, the baby starts to breathe properly. in these circumstances a heartbeat will, of course, be present, but a beating heart on its own would not be regarded as sufficient to label the delivery a live birth since delivered foetuses of 16 weeks or even less may have beating hearts although they have no prospect whatever of surviving. i am making no moral or ethical judgment.\\n           deciding that a live birth has occurred is only one step towards reaching a decision on the appropriate subsequent management. very few live born babies of less than 28 weeks continue to survive without a great deal of intensive care. even if they do survive, there is a significantly increased risk of their developing substantial handicaps. the doctor responsible for the care of the mother and the baby has to weigh all the relevant considerations and use his or her knowledge and clinical judgment to decide what action is appropriate and in the best interests of the mother and baby in the circumstances of each case.\\n           my hon. friend the member for maidstone asked me how a doctor could avoid the possibility of a live birth through the application of medical techniques or injections. my hon. friend the member for basildon asked how doctors can use techniques such as dilation and evacuation. i am making no moral judgment, but these are matters for clinical judgment. it is not right for the minister or any politician to make judgments about what are essentially clinical matters. i appreciate that my hon. friends have strong views on this subject. all of us have strong views, but these are matters for clinical judgment.\\n           the conscience clause has been mentioned. section 4 of the abortion act 1967 provides that no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this act to which he has a conscientious objection\". under a longstanding agreement with the medical profession, no reference to termination duties should be included in the advertisement of hospital posts, but it should be included in the job description made available personally to all applicants. this procedure ensures that all practitioners, including those who, for whatever reason, do not wish to undertake such duties, are made aware of the requirements of the post before interview. national guidance about this was sent to regional health authorities in 1975 and 1979 by the former chief medical officer. in view of a recent error on the part of trent regional health authority over the wording of an advertisement for a consultant post in obstetrics and gynaecology, the chief medical officer will remind regional medical officers of the existing guidance.\\n           for non-medical staff, in a recent ruling in the house of lords—r v. salford health authority—lord keith of kinkel stated that, in its ordinary and neutral meaning, the word \"participate\" in section 4 of the abortion act referred to taking part in treatment.\\n           i am of course aware that my hon. friends the members for hyndburn and for basildon have introduced bills proposing amendments to the conscience clause. they fall to be considered by the house in accordance with the procedures governing private members\\' legislation.\\n           my hon. friend the member for hyndburn spoke eloquently about the difficulties experienced by hospital staff who have a religious or ethical objection to abortion. everyone can sympathise with someone who experiences pressure to take part in a form of treatment to which he has a conscientious objection. any such pressures could take a number of forms, but it is very difficult, if not impossible—i am sure that my hon. friend would agree—to legislate to encourage the development of appropriate attitudes. what is clear is that the law explicitly protects those who have conscientious objections to taking part in abortion treatment. the law is crystal clear on this subject, and we expect both the letter and the spirit to he observed. i am sure that the hon. member for barking will join me in that.\\n           let me conclude by dealing with the issue of financial links. since the passing of the abortion act 1967, several attempts have been made to introduce legislation relating to the links between doctors and agencies who refer women for termination of pregnancy and the institutions in which they are performed. these have led to the existing requirements that all nursing homes must notify the secretary of state of any financial arrangements between the nursing home and any medical practitioner, pregnancy advice bureau or referral agency, and must report any changes in existing financial arrangements. furthermore, all pregnancy advice bureaux referring women for abortion at places approved under the act must identify financial links with other businesses, and doctors must not operate on patients whom they see at a referral agency.\\n           those requirements are drawn to the attention of administrators of premises when the first visit of inspection is made. checks continue to be made on subsequent visits, and company searches are carried out as necessary. proprietors and administrators are well aware that failure to comply with an assurance could constitute grounds for withdrawal of registration of bureaux or approval of nursing homes.\\n           i hope that this has been a useful debate, and that it has increased understanding of a very important issue.\\n        ',

      "[['uk.proc.d.1996-12-17.9.1.1', 1035, 'uk.m.10009', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i beg to move, that leave be given to bring in a bill to amend section 1(1) of the abortion act 1967 in relation to the grounds on which a pregnancy may be terminated. it is christmas and the whole country seems to be immersed in preparations to celebrate that day. it is not a matter for conjecture—christmas will be celebrated on 25 december and that is the day that the infant jesus was born. there was an interesting editorial in the sunday express this weekend that posed the question of how many people actually think about the real purpose behind the celebration of christmas. in the same newspaper, there was another excellent article by mr. enoch powell about the issues that are debated in parliament these days and the nature of our debates. i had the privilege to be present in the chamber when enoch powell moved a similar bill and i can only lament that, for various reasons, we no longer have such profound debates on fundamental issues. this is the perfect time for the house to spend a little while considering the plight of babies who are never allowed to develop and be born. i refer to abortion.\\n           the house is familiar with the arguments deployed in support of the abortion act 1967 when it was originally introduced. the intentions of the act were clear at the time. my bill would support that act in spirit and in practice. those who support abortion per se explain their views by saying that a woman has a right to choose and they ask what the state does with unwanted babies. last year, 163,621 abortions were carried out in england and wales. did every one of those women choose not to conceive a child? is it really possible that so many women had abortions because the risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the mother or existing children was greater than if the pregnancies were terminated? to me, that seems beyond comprehension.\\n           the current clinical interpretation of the abortion act 1967, in effect, means that any woman can have a termination if she wishes as long as gestation is under 24 weeks. that fact was highlighted in the summer when a healthy twin was aborted for purely social reasons and a senior gynaecologist admitted on bbc radio 4: there is abortion on demand … if a woman wants an abortion, she gets one\". aborting any foetus is contrary to the original intentions of the abortion act of some 30 years ago, which was passed to allow abortions only in a restricted number of cases. furthermore, with increasing evidence of the humanity of the foetus, those abortions raise serious moral and ethical issues.\\n           section 1(1)(a) of the abortion act 1967 provides no yardstick, thus allowing abortion on demand, sometimes quite late in a pregnancy as we saw with the twin who was killed after 16 weeks. in 1979, sir ian percival, then the solicitor-general, told a standing committee that was considering tightening the grounds for abortion that there was bound to be some risk in every continuing pregnancy, which makes nonsense of the law as it stands at present. he was discussing the inclusion of the word \"substantially\" before the phrase greater than if the pregnancy were terminated in order to make the test more stringent and more than merely a statistical evaluation.\\n           while the bill would be only a small improvement, we are still left with the words \"risk\" and \"injury\", neither of which are quantified. having a stitch or two in the cervix could be regarded by some doctors as an injury, but it would hardly justify the killing of the child in the womb. we therefore need to make it clear that both the risk and the injury must be serious.\\n           evidence is emerging of the long-term damage caused by abortion, not the least of which is the possibility of breast cancer following abortion. current figures show a 30 per cent. increase in the incidence of breast cancer among women who have had abortions. there is also evidence from all over the world of women suffering years of trauma as a result of abortions that they imagined would be simple procedures and the answer to an immediate problem. only this month, the british medical journal carried a paper on suicide after pregnancy in finland from 1987 to 1994. the general suicide rate in finland for that period was 11.3 per 100,000 and the rate associated with birth was significantly lower at 5.9. however, the suicide rate associated with miscarriage was 18.1 and it soared to 34.7 for induced abortion—significantly higher than in the population at large.\\n           some years ago, westminster hospital published a research paper about attempted suicides among teenagers in its catchment area. the only significant statistic to emerge was that the suicide rate was seven times greater among girls who had had abortions compared with the control group. that figure increased to nine times greater when compared with teenage girls in the population at large. the research was decried on the ground that it was statistically too small, but i have heard of no follow-up investigation. in 1992, a short-term study published in the british journal of psychiatry found that 10 per cent. of women undergoing abortions suffered from psychological damage or trauma.\\n           my bill would not alter those sections of the act that allow abortions in order to save the mother\\'s life. it would not alter the sections dealing with grave and permanent injury to the mother or with the handicapped. it would tighten that part of the act, section 1(1)(a), under which 97 per cent. of abortions are carried out. it would state quite simply that an abortion would be granted only if there was a significant risk to the mother of serious injury and if that risk was substantially greater than the risks inherent in every pregnancy. it would see an end to abortion on demand—which was never the intention of the 1967 act. it would do what the present laws are meant to do but what they singularly fail to do: protect the woman and the child. i commend the bill to the house.\\n

about which many people feel strongly—and it is not difficult to understand why. some hon. members hold particularly strong views on the subject and have declared their intention to use every opportunity to raise the issue on the floor of the house. it is their right to do so, but they should appreciate—and we should remember—that, although they are very vocal, they represent a view that is held by a very small minority.\\n           when a sunday newspaper commissioned a mori opinion poll following the controversy about abortions that occurred this summer, it found that 81 per cent. of respondents agreed or tended to agree with the statement: it is important for pregnant women to have the right to choose whether or not to continue their pregnancy\". only 10 per cent. disagreed or tended to disagree and 9 per cent. neither agreed nor disagreed or had no opinion on the matter. the great majority of people in this country accept that abortion is regrettable but sometimes necessary.\\n           perhaps most people feel that way because they are sympathetic to the plight of women with problem pregnancies and they have some sense of what it might mean to force a woman to bear a child when she believes, and her doctors agree, that she could not cope. it is all very well for members of parliament to hold the strong view that abortion should not be allowed when a foetal abnormality is detected. they have the right to propose legislation that would prohibit such abortions. however, when we discuss such measures we should remember that we, personally, would not have to live with the consequences if the law were so amended.\\n           it is the women denied abortion and their families who would suffer the consequences of such a restriction. their lives—not ours—would be profoundly changed by the need to care for a child with a serious disability. in many cases, the other children in the family would suffer most. organisations such as support around termination for foetal abnormality, which provides counselling and assistance for those whose pregnancies are affected, know how important the option of abortion is. they know that the choice of abortion is valued even by those who choose not to take it.\\n           most abortions in this country are performed because the pregnancy is unwanted in circumstances where two doctors agree that it would be damaging to the mental wellbeing of the woman if she were forced to continue it. they are the abortions that some hon. members are particularly keen to prohibit. but have they thought about what it would mean in practice? have they thought about what it would really mean for a woman to bear a child that she desperately does not want?\\n           contraception is not fail-safe. organisations such as the birth control trust remind us frequently that about a third of pregnancies are conceived by women who say that they were using contraception when they became pregnant. about 50 per cent. of pregnancies are unplanned. not all unplanned pregnancies will be unwanted, but many will be and we must think carefully about the consequences for individual women and for the whole of society if such women are forced to have those children against their will.\\n           motherhood is a great responsibility—it is difficult even for those who embrace it willingly. it is worth stating that no woman ever wants to have an abortion. however, many believe that it is the best solution to a dire problem. we have only to look to northern ireland to see what happens when legal abortion is severely restricted. every year, more than 2,000 desperate women travel to england for the procedure. more than 4,000 women travel to england from eire, where abortion is illegal in all circumstances. those who cannot afford to travel here sometimes try to abort themselves—that is what happened in britain before the abortion act 1967 allowed safe, legal abortion.\\n           women have consciences and so do their doctors. abortion is not a casual choice by women who cannot be bothered to use contraception: it is the last resort of those who are pregnant and who are convinced that it would be better if the potential child were not born. it would be a tragedy for the women if the abortion law were restricted.\\n           the abortion act 1967 has served women and their doctors well. those who oppose abortion in principle like to remind us that there have been almost 4 million legal abortions since the act became law. they sometimes claim that that is an abhorrence. it is possible to interpret that figure differently and see it as a measure of the benefit that the act has conferred on women and their existing families: that number of abortions took place because that number was necessary for the well-being of women and their families.\\n           the debate on the human fertilisation and embryology act 1990 allowed the opportunity for considerable debate about amendments to the abortion law. the issues were discussed in great detail and some changes were made to the law. the bill that the hon. member for basildon (mr. amess) seeks to put before the house is not motivated by new developments or discoveries that require the act to be amended. public opinion is not pressing for a change in the law. the need for abortion on the grounds that it is currently provided in this country remains as pressing today as in 1967.\\n           it is the responsibility of those who sit in the house to draft and pass legislation that affects the everyday lives of the millions of people who live in this country. it is right that we take into account issues that are perceived to be morally difficult or troublesome, but we would be doing the women of this country a great disservice if we allowed access to safe, clinical procedure to be more restricted than it is at present. i ask the house to oppose the bill.\\n            question put, pursuant

      "[['uk.proc.d.1969-07-15.7.1.2', 1332, 'NaN', 'NaN', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i beg to move, that leave be given to bring in a bill to improve the law governing abortion and the status and rights of the medical profession in relation thereto. the long title of the bill is: a bill to improve the law governing abortion and the status and rights of the medical profession in relation thereto. abortion is a controversial and emotional topic and the house needs to discuss it rationally. emotive or sensational utterances, whatever their source, do not help us. there are widely differing views in the house on the question of abortion. i do not question the good intentions or the sincerity of anyone, least of all the sponsor of the abortion act. i ask, in return, that no one should question mine.\\n           it is true that i have strong views on the morality of abortion which derive in part, but only in part, from my religion. i realise, more fully than anyone else, that a catholic celibate is not the ideal person to be introducing a bill of this kind. it would be better if i were an agnostic mother of nine, but one has to discharge the duty which falls upon one.\\n           it would be a slander upon the moral sense of the british people if it were thought that only roman catholics are concerned about the working of the abortion act. i place a very high value upon human life. that is why i am opposed not only to abortion, but also to capital punishment. i believe that all life is worthy of reverence, especially if it is in a defenceless form. i am entitled to give witness to that belief inside and outside this house. what i am not entitled to do is to impose my moral views on this question on other people. indeed, it would be wrong to attempt to do so.\\n           the law as far as it concerns moral matters should rest on the moral consensus of the community. as i take it on this matter, while the community as a whole does not want a total ban upon abortion neither does it want abortion on demand. what it wants is that abortion should be available where there are serious and genuine needs and that it should be carried out under the best possible medical conditions. that i believe to have been the will of parliament when it passed the abortion act. i do not believe that the act is achieving those ends. that is the actual situation we have to face today.\\n           \"there is no doubt that the way the act is working, in particular, in the private sector, is giving grave alarm even to those who were keen supporters of it\". those are not my words, but the words of the secretary of state for social services. my concern is not with the national health service, but with the private sector. we have all read stories about foreign women coming to britain for abortions. this is disturbing, but what is important to britain is the impact which the act is having on the british people and on the medical profession here.\\n           what is clear, also, is that a minority of doctors are making huge fortunes out of the act and are not observing the normal standards of medical care. i will give the house one figure which was quoted by sir john peel, president of the royal college of gynaecologists, which indicates the way the act is working. during a three-month period, 52 women were treated under the national health service and discharged from hospital in 24 hours. during the same period the number of women discharged after 24 hours in the private sector was over 5,000. sir john peel characterised that as amounting almost to medical negligence. under the cover provided by the section in the act concerning good faith, rackets are being operated which neither the law nor the profession is able to check.\\n           my right hon. and learned friend the member for st. marylebone (mr. hogg), shadow home secretary, warned the house of this danger during debates on the final stages of the bill. i believe that he has been proved right. anyone with the slightest concern for public morality must be concerned about these abuses under the act. having held detailed consultations with representatives of the medical profession, i put forward this proposal, which has the support of the royal college of gynaecologists, the b.m.a. and the medical defence union. it is the only proposal in my bill, which is limited to it because i believe it to be vital.\\n           i propose that of two doctors who certify abortion under the law to be legal one should be a consultant gynaecologist holding office under the national health service and that the operation should be carried out under his supervision. as there is a limited number of gynaecologists in britain, and i do not wish to see the act nullified in certain parts of the country, i further suggest that other doctors of equivalent status be approved by the minister from panels submitted by professional medical bodies. this simple step would bring to an end the vast majority of racketeering which is going on. the weakness of the act is that there is no effective check in it. its sponsor hoped that the place where the abortions have to be carried out having to be approved by the minister would act as a check, but the minister has taken the view that, provided certain facilities are available, he has no power in the matter.\\n           the reporting of abortions has not proved to be a check. what we need is a responsible medical person, highly qualified and highly placed, who will effectively check that the provisions of the act are being followed. it may be objected that this would provide a unique limitation on medical practice. i say two things in answer to that. first, abortion is a unique operation because it involves the lives of two people, not one. it is not the same as having a tooth out, or having a finger or limb amputated. it is in a category of its own. secondly, the official bodies of the profession approve this course.\\n           it may be objected that the minister would not want to take an invidious decision, but the sifting out process would be done by the profession and the final decision only would be the minister\\'s. i am not wedded dogmatically to this particular proposal. if, during later stages of the bill, should it get to committee, an amendment were moved to meet such objections, i would be most willing to consider it.\\n           one cannot dispose of a complicated subject like this in a 10-minute speech. the house knows as well as i do the purpose of the ten minute rule bill procedure. the house has here an opportunity to register by its vote the opinion that it shares the anxieties of the majority of people in the country, of the press and a large number of members of the medical profession, and encourage the government to take action.\\n           whatever its decision, it is right that the house of commons, which is the forum of the nation, should register its vote and its voice on this subject. a social policy which makes abortion easy and family planning difficult cannot be a good policy. it is national scandal that out of more than 200 local health authorities only 34 provide a full family planning service.\\n           i believe that by giving me leave to introduce my bill today the house would give an impetus towards the introduction of more intelligent and rational policies in these matters and that it would be striking a reasonable balance between the needs of the individual mother, for whom we should certainly have concern and compassion, and the demands of the social, moral and medical strength and reputation of the country, with which we should also be equally concerned.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1969, 7, 15, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1969-07-15.7'], ['uk.proc.d.1969-07-15.7.1.4', 1294, 'uk.m.19190', 'uk.p.LDem', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i do not ask the house to refuse the hon. member for chelmsford (mr. st. john-stevas) leave to bring in his bill on the grounds that i regard the abortion act as totally perfect or immutable for the future, nor do i do it on the grounds that i am totally satisfied or complacent about the manner in which it is working today. i do it, rather, because i see in the proposed bill something which would not solve the problems that we are facing in the working of the act, but which would be a thoroughly regressive measure.\\n           it is worth reviewing the facts at the end of the first year of operation of the act. about 40,000 legal abortions were carried out. this is a substantial increase on the previous number, but an increase was to be expected if the act was to be effective. if there had been no increase, clearly the act would not be achieving its objective.\\n           the limited evidence we are able to gather—for example, from the london emergency bed centre figures—shows that we are achieving the objective of reducing criminal abortions. the figures given by that centre show that in the first quarter of 1966 there were 1,363 emergency admissions for spontaneous or incomplete abortions, whereas during the first quarter of this year the figure was down to 870. this is a very satisfactory development.\\n           moreover, it is not true that we have established in britain a high rate of legal abortion. britain has approximately five abortions per 100 live births, whereas in norway, sweden, denmark and finland, all of which have abortion laws roughly comparable with our own, the figures are higher, ranging from 6 to 8 per 100 live births. our figure of 5 per 100 is nowhere near the figure achieved in countries with abortion on demand legislation, such as czechoslovakia with 43 abortions per 100 live births and japan with 38. taking these figures in their context, it is nonsense to claim that london is the abortion capital of the world.\\n           the present problem which the operation of the act has faced is one which was not mentioned by the hon. gentleman. it is the regional difference within britain of the practice of abortion under the national health service. this was something which was foreseen by the sponsors, and i myself referred to it during the passage of the bill. i believe that it will take many years before we even out the practice and end the present situation, in which it is twice as easy to get an abortion in newcastle as it is in birmingham. this is the type of question which should be the subject of concern in the house rather than the matters referred to by the hon. gentleman, because i believe that it is the restrictive practices in centres like birmingham which in themselves stimulate the growth of the private centre of abortion in london.\\n           that growth of the private sector has very little to do with foreigners. the amount of hysteria in the press in recent weeks about, for example, 30,000 danish women coming in charter flights to britain has been shown to be complete nonsense. the secretary of state for social services, having made his inquiries, discovered that, in the period of this hysteria during june and the first week of july, only four danish women had abortions in the private clinics in london.\\n           typical of the stories was one in one newspaper, where a taxi driver who was interviewed was recorded as saying that he had, in fact, been bringing foreign girls on an average of one a week to clinics in london; the enterprising journalist multiplied this figure by the number of taxis available at any given time at heathrow airport and came to the conclusion that 1,000 foreign girls were invading britain each week for abortions. these figures are shown to be false by the number of notifications received, unless it is suggested that cases are not being notified, in which case a criminal offence is taking place under the act and action can be taken.\\n           having said that, however, i believe—there i share the concern felt by the hon. member for chelmsford—that one or two doctors in one or two clinics are not giving the fullest medical attention to their patients and are primarily motivated by financial considerations. i share that concern with the hon. gentleman, but i say to him that we gave the secretary of state full power in the act to introduce new ministerial regulations. the act empowers the secretary of state under the regulations, to demand such other information relating to the termination as may be so prescribed\". therefore, there is still legislative power in the secretary of state\\'s hands which he has not yet used and which he could use if he were satisfied that the situation demanded it.\\n           moreover, i believe that the profession itself has a responsibility. the general medical council, in its rules of discipline, has as one of its definitions of infamous conduct the abuse of financial opportunities offered by medical practice. i should have thought that it should be the general medical council which should take action in cases where abuse is occurring.\\n           i respect, and always have done, the sincerity of the hon. member for chelmsford, but he must forgive me if i find it difficult to accept that he has come forward today in the spirit of the man wielding the oilcan just to ensure that the machinery works a little better. the fact is that he has come armed with a spanner to throw into the works, whether it is his intention or not.\\n           i invite the house to consider four points in rejecting the hon. gentleman\\'s application to bring in a bill. first, to limit one of the two doctors to a consultant would not check the operation of the private sector. some part-time consultants in the national health service are already operating in the private sector and it would be only a matter of time before one or two consultants had lined up a particular monopoly in this area.\\n           secondly, and much more seriously, i believe that it would cause delays in patients getting abortions. whatever one\\'s view about abortion is, both medically and ethically—i have said this before—i believe that if it has to happen it is desirable that it should happen at the earliest possible time. the experience of sweden has shown that where there is too much red tape and where, as in this country, there are only 600 consultant gynaecologists, it would be disastrous from the point of view of mortality figures and in the effect of driving women again to illegal operations if there were long delays in women obtaining appointments for a legal abortion.\\n           thirdly, what the country requires is more doctors under the national health service willing to operate the act properly and in a balanced way, not fewer doctors. this proposed amendment would merely create more birminghams, instead of more newcastles. the amendment which the hon. gentleman proposes was discussed twice in the house and twice in the other place in one form or another during the passage of the bill, and i see no reason why w(.; should not stand by our original decision in rejecting this restrictive proposal.\\n           finally, i welcome what the hon. gentleman said at the beginning of his speech about emotional language, but i cannot end without referring to what i think was the quite disgraceful speech made last night by the hon. lady the member for birmingham, edgbaston (mrs. knight). it is, i think, a monstrous slur on the medical profession in britain to suggest that live babies are being burned in incinerators.\\n        ',

      "[['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.9', 1268, 'uk.m.16771', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'hon. members will recall that in the debate on the second reading of the abortion (amendment) bill on 7th february last year the minister of state. department of health and social security gave a firm undertaking that: should the eventuality arise that the house goes into a different session before the bill is considered, the government give the commitment to the sponsors of the bill that they will re-establish the select committee.\"—[ official report, 7th february 1975; vol. 885, c. 1794.] the motion now before the house honours that undertaking.\\n           in the event, the select committee was unable to complete consideration of the bill before the end of the session. not that it was dilatory in any way; under the guidance of its chairman, the right hon member for sunderland, north (mr. willey)—i pay a warm tribute to his skilled, tactful, good-humoured but always firm leadership—the committee held 23 meetings, took evidence in public on 14 occasions, and, in its third special report to the house, made nine interim recommendations, which the government accepted in their entirety.\\n           as the select committee explained in its report, its recommendations were not exhaustive, and they were made without prejudice to any further recommendations that a re-established select committee might wish to make. the committee added that it was its belief that a re-established committee should be able to report without delay in the next session.\\n           i hope to show, therefore, that there is indeed a pressing need for the select committee to be re-established so that it may complete the work on which it embarked last year, which was interrupted in the way i have just described.\\n           we are discussing a complex matter, and it may be helpful to the house if i say something about its history. not long after the abortion act became law, it became apparent that, whatever benefits it was conferring, grave abuses were taking place in the private sector. licence to provide abortions in return for money led to large numbers of foreign women flooding here for the purpose of obtaining abortions that were illegal in their own countries. apart from anything else, practices detrimental to the interests of those women were occurring.\\n           that growing public anxiety was justified, and that the situation was one that cried to heaven for remedy was confirmed by the minister of state when, with re-freshing candour, he said, in the second reading debate a year ago: i deeply regret that such abuses have been allowed to continue for such a long time. i profoundly wish that my own profession had puts its house in order. i wish that, immediately following the passage of the act, when the abuses were at their height, successive governments had used administrative measures to prevent abuse.\"—[ official report, 7th february 1975; vol. 885, c. 1806.] the anxieties in some part of the medical profession and the police service, among the wider public and hon. members had already grown so great by 1971 that the then government set up the lane committee to review the workings of the act. that committee took a great deal of expert evidence, made its recommendations and reported in 1974. i make a brief reference now to the lane report because it is relevant to the motion.\\n           the lane committee found that while the act had relieved a vast amount of individual suffering it had resulted in a greatly increased number of those seeking legal abortion, had involved a substantial increase in the work load of national health service gynaecological departments, and had led to a marked in-equality, over the country as a whole, in the provision of services, and that this in turn had encouraged the growth of a flourishing private sector. the lane committee also confirmed what we already knew, namely, that in the private sector there had been gross abuse as a result of the opportunity to make money arising from the great number of foreign women who came to this country to have abortions.\\n           the lane committee was convinced that the official figures of such traffic, which it considered were alarming, were not reliable and that abortions were being performed without any certificate being completed or any notification being made. it found that some doctors were interpreting the abortion act in a way contrary to the intention of parliament and contrary to the intention of the author of the act, the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel). in short, it found that the act was being interpreted in a way contrary to the intention of parliament that it should not be lawful to permit abortion on demand.\\n           the lane committee considered—in one of those rare references to the fact that abortion is not just another operation but involves the deliberate destruction of an unborn child—that the upper time limit for termination, after which a child is capable of being born alive, should be reduced from 28 weeks to 24 weeks, and it made a number of other recommendations regarding regulation and control.\\n           inevitably, since parliament was given no opportunity to discuss the lane report and very little was done to implement any of its recommendations, public anxiety, far from abating, grew even greater. that is the background against which we must view the emergence of the abortion (amendment) bill introduced by the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white), which led directly to the setting up of the select committee last year. that bill may have had serious defects—i am not arguing about that, because it was a private member\\'s bill and one can understand why it might have had drafting defects—but it was an honest attempt by the hon. member to force the issue and to get something done.\\n           whatever hon. members\\' views may be on the subject of abortion, as such—i suggest that that is not really the issue tonight—i think that the whole house and the country should be grateful to the hon. member for pollok for making it possible for parliament at long last to focus attention on the workings of the 1967 act. indeed, the house recognised this when it gave the bill a second reading and accepted the government\\'s constructive suggestion that the bill be remitted to a select committee. the minister of state himself told us: the bill\\'s essential provision is to prevent the abuses which we all know have existed in the private sector i believe that sensible legislation now for the private sector will strengthen, not weaken, the 1967 act.\"—[ official report, 7th february 1975; vol. 885.c. 1806.] the bill certainly had the effect of waking up the department of health and social security. no sooner had the hon. member for pollok announced his intention of introducing his bill—before anyone knew what it contained—than the department started asking for information about abortion in the private sector—information that it should have obtained long before, certainly after the lane report had laid bare what was going on and had said what should be done about it. for example, it was not until mid-january 1975 that parliament learned that the department was sending out a questionnaire to private abortion clinics asking such questions as \"what care do you provide? where are your patients referred from? how many foreign patients do you take?\"\\n           it was hardly surprising, therefore, that the house gave the bill a second reading and accepted the minister of state\\'s wise advice that such a delicate and complex subject as this was better suited to the procedures of a select committee—which has the power to call for expert witnesses and papers—than for the normal standing committee.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0),

accepted a select committee. if the bill's sponsors felt so strongly that it should be submitted to a select committee, why was a vote forced on the bill in the previous debate?\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.11', 566, 'uk.m.16771', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i have no responsibility for forcing votes. i cannot answer that question, and it is not relevant to the argument before the house. perhaps the hon. gentleman will pursue that matter later. all i am saying is that the decision that the house took, on the minister\\'s advice, was wise and sensible, and in the end proved fruitful. it was fruitful because, despite sincere differences among members of the select committee, we were able to make nine interim recommendations for action, all of which the government were able to accept.\\n           i tell the house quite frankly that the majority of members of the select committee would not have agreed to those interim recommendations if we had thought there was any likelihood of the select committee\\'s not being set up again. it was clear, at least to most of us, that if the intentions of parliament when it passed the 1967 act were not to be flouted, there was urgent need for further clarification and improvement of the law.\\n           moreover, there are other matters which have arisen since 1967, not foreseen at the time, which require either amendment of the existing law or new administrative regulations, or both. as the select committee did not have sufficient time to take evidence on these matters or to discuss them at any length and so to make recommendations, it was unable to complete the task for which it was set up. we were not worried about that because we had been given a solemn pledge by the minister of state that if we did not complete the business it could be continued in a further session. i cannot believe, therefore, that the house would be prepared to leave the matter there.\\n           may i give just five examples of what i have in mind? first, the 1967 act certainly did not intend to provide abortion on demand, as the lane committee report later confirmed. nevertheless, in paragraph 201 of the lane committee report it asserted that some practitioners interpret the act to mean that…termination is possible in every case\". that is still the situation.\\n           later, in paragraph 603, the report said that in parts of the private sector patients could have their pregnancies terminated on request, for payment, when there were no lawful grounds for that to be done. to quote directly, it said: in short, in some parts of the private commercial sector the provisions of the act have been flouted and abortion on request has been the rule\". who, in the face of that, can doubt that the law needs to be clarified and strengthened so that flagrant abuse in return for financial reward is brought to an end?\\n           it would be naïve to think that the select committee\\'s interim recommendations concerning the examination of women seeking abortion will eliminate that scandal. indeed, an assistant under-secretary at the home office told the select committee: if it is indeed the case that…a doctor can lawfully perform an abortion on the strength of a mere statistical risk, then i am not even sure that you get home by providing that he has got at least to see the woman and examine her. those last few words\\n            to see the woman and examine her underline the type of scandalous abuse and disregard of the interests and health of the women concerned that have been going on ever since the act was passed.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.12', 68, 'uk.m.17719', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'does the hon. gentleman agree that the whole tenor of his argument so far has been about the enforcement of present legislation and in no way about changing the law? he was been describing the way in which doctors abuse the present act. we need to enforce the act. there is no need to change the legislation in the light of anything that the hon. gentleman has said.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.13', 1284, 'uk.m.16771', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', \"i have a great deal of respect for the hon. lady, who has been a good colleague on the select committee. if she will listen to the rest of my argument she will realise that what she said is not so. let me proceed. if the hon. lady catches your eye, mr. speaker, no doubt she will be able to take up the point.\\n           nor will our interim recommendation concerning the control of fees be adequate in itself. dr. coplans, of the association of anaesthetists, told us that controlling the price will not stop people interpreting the act in a way which you could say was abortion on demand. that is my first example. clearly, therefore, further consideration must be given to this crucial question.\\n           second, it is necessary—here is the answer to the hon. lady's point—to bring the upper time limit of 28 weeks for abortion, except in cases where there are serious medical indications, into line with current medical opinion and modern techniques. in any event, the lane committee thought that the limit should be reduced to 24 weeks. we are told that the world health organisation is considering a period of 22 weeks. sir john peel, one of the most distinguished gynaecologists of our time, thinks that the upper limit should be 20 weeks. indeed, the british medical association, commenting on the lane report, warned that even with the reduction from 28 to 24 weeks, however, the position still exists that owing to an error in the calculation of dates a foetus intended for destruction could be born alive and be capable of functioning as a self-sustaining whole independent of any connection with the mother. therefore, whatever change is thought to be appropriate—it is clear that whether we accept 24 weeks or 20 weeks as the upper limit, some change is long overdue—it must involve amendment to the abortion act combined with the repeal of the 28–week presumption in the infant life (preservation) act 1929—the course favoured by the lane committee.\\n           the select committee's very modest interim recommendation that late termination be restricted to certain places with certain facilities is, in my view, no substitute for such a statutory provision, since that recommendation involves leaving legal time limit as it is. that makes legal nonsense. it is a situation that the house cannot continue to tolerate. for that reason alone there will be an argument for the select committee to consider what is the most suitable legislation to be introduced.\\n           third, there is the disturbing question how far the conscience clause in the 1967 act protects doctors and nurses who have a genuine conscientious objection to abortion and the extent to which the careers of those who have such objection are damaged.\\n           there is no doubt that discrimination exists and that it causes fear and distress. i do not want to give the house my own opinion. let me quote the evidence which the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists gave to the lane committee: …medical members of hospital gynaecological and anaesthetic departments…are fearful that if they show distaste or conscientious objection to terminating pregnancy their position may be prejudiced. this fear is amply justified for we have certain knowledge that when candidates are being interviewed for appointment as registrar, senior registrar or consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology it is now almost the rule for them to be asked their attitude to the implementation of the abortion act…we submit that it is quite improper for candidates for posts in obstetrics and gynaecology to be discarded or outruled on the grounds that they have a conscientious objection to performing any particular operation. discrimination continues. my attention has been drawn recently to two cases—one of a distinguished royal college gold medalist who has been driven out of the country by it, and the other, a general practitioner, who for years sought posts involving gynaecology in different parts of the country and was turned down repeatedly because of his views on abortion. such evidence should be laid before the select committee. we have already taken convincing evidence from the royal college of nursing that great distress and anxiety exists in the nursing profession as well.\\n           in recent years parliament has spent a great deal of time legislating against the evils of discrimination on grounds of race or sex. how can anyone justify discrimination against members of the healing professions who have a conscientious objection to the destruction of life in the womb? is the house of commons going to say that it cannot find time to discuss a matter of this importance? that is really what the issue is about—whether time can be found for that matter, among others, to be discussed. it is utterly disgraceful that discrimination of this kind should be practised. clearly, a reappointed select committee should consider the problem and decide whether it can best be overcome by amendment of the 1967 act or by fresh administrative regulation.\\n           fourthly, the select committee should be given an opportunity to make recommendations on the question whether, in criminal prosecutions, anonymity should be granted to witnesses who have had abortions. the lane report commented on the difficulties caused to the police by the present situation which frequently leads to women being unhelpful to the police in their inquiries.\\n           an assistant under-secretary at the home office told the select committee that, in principle, the home office would go along with the idea of anonymity, though possibly at the court's discretion rather than as an absolute right. the home office was concerned, however, that this question should also be considered in the context of offences other than abortion.\\n           since the select committee last discussed this question, the advisory group on the law of rape, under mrs. justice heilbron, has recommended that rape victims be granted anonymity in criminal proceedings. i understand that the advisory group's recommendations have had a sympathetic reception from the home secretary, and rightly so. 1 submit that a reappointed select committee should now consider the question of anonymity in abortion cases in the light, inter alia, of the recommendations of mrs. justice heilbrcn's advisory group.\\n           my last example—hon. members will be able to produce many other examples of cases in which consideration must be given to the question whether legislation is necessary—is that it is clearly unsatisfactory in law and in morality to leave the blacklisting of pregnancy advice bureaux to the indirect means of control proposed in the select committee's third special report. that was intended purely as an interim measure indicating to the government what we thought should be done. here again, there is need for new statutory controls, which witnesses from the department of health and social security repeatedly urged on the select committee.\\n           here, then, are five good reasons—there are many others—for reconvening the select committee and allowing it to complete the task with which it was entrusted by the house last year. i urge hon. members to support the motion. it does not commit any hon. member to one view or another on any of these contentious matters. the final recommendations of the committee would have to be decided by the house itself. the select committee could not determine the matter. it would make recommendations to the house, and the house would then have the opportunity of deciding whether to accept them or not.\\n           i hope that, because of that fact, hon. members will tonight decide to agree to the motion without a division, but whatever decision they make it is clear that these grave matters cannot be left where they are. the law must be clarified and amended. what better body than a select committee to review what needs to be done in this context?\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.14', 4, 'NaN', 'NaN',

select committee to consider a bill which lapsed in the last session. it is not the same committee as that which the government offered during the debate a year ago, when the suggestion was that the

(amendment) bill. that is a very important limitation. if the motion empowered us to keep a watchful eye on the working of the abortion act generally, on the development of the new day-care facilities or the lack of facilities in the national health service in birmingham or glasgow, or the difficulties of operating a conscience clause, bearing in mind the evidence given to us by the royal college

will find that i shall be coming to the question of abuses. the situation a year ago was that parliament was faced with a series of abuses of the abortion law. one could criticise successive administrations for lot acting and reporting to the house on what they were doing to check these abuses. it was as a result of questions in the house from members with different views that the previous secretary of state for social services, the right hon. member for leeds, north-east (sir k. joseph), set up the lane committee in 1971. it reported in march 1974. it came to the conclusion that the act has relieved a vast amount of individual suffering\", and that members of the inquiry were unanimous in supporting the act and its provisions. we have no doubt that the gains facilitated by the act have much outweighed any disadvantages for which it has been criticised. the committee, however, also said that much of the criticism is justified: in consequence of the abortion act a situation has arisen in which a very small number, of perhaps about 20 or 30 members of the medical profession and those associated with them, have brought considerable reproach upon this country. despite the publication of the lane committee\\'s report, the house had no government statement on the matter. the committee had reported but the house was left in the dark. the hon. member for pollok has, in a sense, provided a useful service in raising the whole matter and enabling us to get started on our work. the fact that we were able to elicit from the department for the first time some of the steps that it was already taking—for example, the development of the black list of referral agencies—was of value. they were able to close clinics by using the powers of the act—powers which had existed all along in the act but had not been used before. in the wake of the select committee\\'s work the department is to operate stricter controls, such as fees and certification. the department is taking several important steps, and has begun successfully to end many abuses.\\n           i am not surprised that the house voted overwhelmingly for the bill of the hon. member for glasgow, pollok. i pay tribute to the chairman of the select committee and to the useful work which was accomplished by the select committee in the previous session. we were able to produce a nine-point series of recommendations that were accepted by the secretary of state for social services. i think they have been useful, doing much to highlight abuses of the act and to recommend further steps that should be taken.\\n           the hon. member for glasgow, pollok mentioned three abuses in his speech last year. he said: the base of commercial operators is the growing number of foreign women who are lured into britain in the knowledge that for cash a group of doctors will perform illegal abortions on request, totally ignoring the criteria of the act. that was perfectly true. the minister of state took up the same point and said: france since 1972 has always provided the largest single group of patients: in 1974 it was 36,541. to many people this is a very high figure which raises serious questions about the need to have a statutory ban, but it may well drop considerably following the introduction of the new laws.\"—[ official report, 7th february 1975; vol. 885, c. 1758–1805.] that last sentence has turned out, a year later, to be true. as other coun- tries have changed their laws, the picture of abortion in this country has become totally different. the number of women coming from france in 1974 was 36,541, but last year it dropped to 14,809. the breakdown for 1975 shows that 7,400 women came from france in the first quarter, but in the last quarter the number had fallen to 1,411. there has been a similar decline from other countries, such as germany, as more liberal abortion laws have been introduced. we have broken the back of the problem of importing foreign patients.\\n           interestingly enough, the number of women from italy and spain has increased, for the obvious reason that no abortion law exists in those countries. the number of foreign women coming to this country was down by 37 per cent. in 1975. the total number of abortions was down by 14 per cent. the picture today is very different from what it was a year ago, the figures now being in decline for the first time since the passing of the act in 1967.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.36', 9, 'uk.m.21722',

gentleman and his supporters to disclaim that book\\'s influence. it provided headlines in many newspapers, and many respected commentators quoted from it freely. copies were sent to members.\\n           when the committee examined the authors i must say that i had never seen such a pair of charlatans before a select committee. i do not wish to go into the claims that were made and the credentials that were offered, as those are all matters that may be before the courts, but in the introduction to the book there appeared this sentence: every quote we reproduce was tape recorded by us. yet when we asked for the tapes of the most gruesome parts of the book it was admitted that no tapes existed. we were told that the mechanism was faulty, that the newspapers had lost them, or that the police had possession. there was always some explanation, but by some strange coincidence it was always the most sensational parts of the book for which no tape was available. there were plenty of tapes available to cover the more ordinary parts of the book. the book uncovered many abuses, but the most blatant and gruesome sections were unsubstantiated.\\n           nor have the authors ceased their

plain sailing from now on; there is bound to be variation within the medical profession. but i take issue with the hon. member for glasgow, pollok on the bonafides of some members of the medical profession who operate within the national health service in london. the suggestion is made that there are certain consultants who provide abortions on demand. i met one such consultant recently. although this consultant did not go along with the mainstream of medical opinion, he had an equally sincere and conscientious regard for his patients. there was no question of merely granting abortions. there was certainly no question of performing abortions without examination, interview and regard to the length of pregnancy. all those matters were taken into account before the consultant made up his mind.\\n           it is totally false to suggest that abortion on demand exists within the national health service. however, there is a wide discrepancy of interpretation. that will always exist within the medical profession, on this and other matters. it is our duty to lay down the boundaries of the criminal law. that is what we did in 1967. it is not up to us to judge whether individual abortions should or should not be carried out. as long as the practitioner acts in good faith under the 1967 act, such judgment should be left to him.\\n           normal parliamentary checks are open to us. if the house wishes at any time to change the substantive law it should do so by the normal processes and not by hiding behind a select committee. i believe that it will be a waste of parliamentary time and resources to set up another select committee to operate within narrow terms of reference. i also believe that in the light of the evidence that has accumulated during the past year, and as published in the past month in the british journal of psychiatry for the first time, the picture is much clearer. the study of the british journal of psychiatry was based on women who had abortions at a london hospital. it is the only study of its kind since the abortion act came into force in 1968. the article was written by a number of doctors. no evidence prior to the study had been published in britain.\\n           the article claims that the evidence provides documentation to the effect that the abortion act has led to relief from distress not measurable in statistical terms. it is in that spirit that we should decline to set up the committee.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.41',

proceedings. abortion has never been one of my main interests, although i have taken a keen interest in many aspects of the national health service. therefore, when i was appointed to the select committee i had to study the matter in much greater detail. as a result of that study and of being a member of the select committee—i believe that i have a 100 per cent. attendance record—two matters have become clear to me. the first point is not easy to state without appearing to be a female chauvinist, if there is such a thing, but this is how i feel.\\n           it is clear from the comments on the bill in committee that it is impossible for many people to understand the totality of involvement in which a woman is caught by an unwanted pregnancy. it is an involvement not only for nine months or for the duration of childhood but for the rest of the woman's life. because nobody but the woman herself can fully appreciate the totality of this involvement, it must be her decision whether she can cope with that total situation, for whatever reason, and that must be the decisive factor in giving an abortion.\\n           i am not saying that we must not do everything possible, by more effective contraceptive methods and advice, to try to prevent unwanted pregnancies. but if that fails and the woman decides to have an abortion, she should be entitled to have her pregnancy terminated within the law in the safest possible conditions. i stress this factor because there were poignant reminders in written evidence given to the select committee by those who had experienced the horrors of backstreet abortion. relief was expressed by nurses in evidence to the committee that they no longer had to treat the sickening after-effects of such cases. no woman should be driven to such desperation again by putting back the clock with restrictive provisions such as those referred to by the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white). if the select committee is re-established with its present membership, however, i believe that that will be the result. there is an imbalance in the committee's membership in favour of those restrictive provisions.\\n           the select committee clarified for me the basic soundness of the 1967 act. this was made clear by the whole weight of medical evidence and there was a good deal of it ranging from major national bodies, such as the british medical association, to individual testimonies by doctors, many of whom work in socially-deprived areas such as that part of north london in which my constituency is situated.\\n           it was clear that if the committee proceeded with the main provisions of the bill it would go against the whole of that medical evidence. it was clear from the evidence that many of the abuses stressed by the bill's sponsors either never existed at all or had been cleared up by administrative action. nevertheless, there were positive points on which our deeply-divided committee was able to agree. these were incorporated in the committee's third special report. that report was accepted by the secretary of state, and action is being taken by the department on all its recommendations.\\n

wish to speak for only a few moments, and i shall concentrate on the essential point of why i believe that the committee should be re-established. after the second reading of the abortion (amendment)

indeed, in that debate the minister went much further and said …the government believe that the bill should have the benefit of sustained scrutiny by a select committee.\"—[official report, 7th february 1975; vol. 885, c. 1796.] the minister is an honourable man and i am sure that when he replies he will admit, openly and frankly, that the select committee has not yet had the opportunity to examine the bill or some of its most important clauses in toto. i am sure he will recommend to the house that we should re-establish the select committee tonight. if he does not do so, he will be going against his own view that the committee should be able to give the bill sustained scrutiny—something we had no time to do in the last parliamentary session. indeed, we were overwhelmed with paper.\\n           something like 200 major written submissions were sent to the select committee. several thousand letters were sent to the select committee. i doubt whether any single member of the select committee can claim to have read every single letter that was sent or to have read in great detail every one of over 200 written submissions. we have a great deal of work to do if the select committee is re-established.\\n           i should have thought that there are very few members who have not had a significant amount of correspondence from their constituents on this matter in the last two or three years. whatever view may have been expressed in that correspondence, it clearly shows that many millions of people in this country are concerned about the operation of the abortion act 1967.\\n           the committee has not discussed the first two clauses in the bill, which are probably the two most important and key clauses. they relate, in effect, to abortion for social convenience and abortion on demand. these have not even been touched by the select committee, because we agreed at the beginning that we would quite openly try to reach agreement in certain areas where there was a possibility of getting a consensus and where there was a possibility of making unanimous recommendations and reports to the house.\\n           on the advice and under the guidance of our outstanding chairman, we were right, i believe, in doing so and in trying to find the areas on which we could agree, but it is also the duty of this house to re-establish the select committee so that it can discuss and argue the areas in which it is unlikely to reach unanimous agreement.\\n           there are very many other areas in which consideration is needed. one can argue very strongly that the police find themselves in an impossible position in relation to the working of the 1967 act. it is well known that it is almost impossible to get a conviction for an illegal abortion under the 1967 act in the context of either the national health service or, in particular, the private clinics. yet a prominent gynaecologist has said openly on television, on the radio and in the press that for all practical purposes he flouts the law of the land. he has said that he has carried out and will continue to carry out abortions on demand. how can any hon. member say, in the context of that statement, that there is not a great deal of work to be done by the select committee?\\n           i beg the house not to be complacent when it reads the latest abortion figures. i am sure that we are all grateful, whatever views we hold, that the number of abortions which took place in 1975 had dropped compared with 1974. but do not let us imagine that it is a substantial drop in the context of women resident in england and wales. it is only a drop of 22½ per cent. on the 1974 figure. there has been a horrifying increase in the number of abortions carried out on girls under 16 years of age. the increase is 9 per cent. in figures, that is an increase from 3,243 to 3,526. there are no grounds for complacency in that area.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0),

disappointment, not only in this house but in the country, if the select committee is not re-established. i believe that the house wants the select committee to continue to probe and question and to think about the fundamental issues involved.\\n           many of the supporters of the 1967 legislation are far from happy with the operation of the act in practice. this house has everything to gain

up its recommendations, its very existence has taken up a disproportionate amount of the time of the members of the select committee and members of this house—time and energy which, i believe, could usefully have been spent on other subjects. i could quite well have done with the time and thought which i have had to put into this question in dealing with other matters of importance to this house. i regret that my energies have been diverted in that way.\\n           it has led to a situation almost of confrontation outside this house in terms of the general public. many thousands of women have taken—or have, perhaps, been forced into taking—extreme positions. they have had their time taken up with organising demonstrations, and so on, on one side of the argument or the other. in my view this has been an enormous waste of energy.\\n           the hon. member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine) has said that the house should be grateful to my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) for introducing the subject. i am not grateful for having had to waste this last year on it.\\n           it is ironic, too, that we should have spent so much time in 1975 in considering how to extend the rights of women. we have taken some fairly small steps overall in terms of sex discrimination legislation, and by virtue of some of the provisions of the employment protection act. in this way we have on the one hand been trying to extend women's rights, while, on the other, allowing, by the very existence of this select committee, a consideration of the restriction of women's rights. nevertheless, the select committee was set up, and it called a large number of eminent people and eminent bodies to give written and oral evidence. the select committee made a number of recommendations. these are now familiar to us and, indeed, are being carried out.\\n           many of them, as i understand the evidence of my hon. friend the minister of state, were already in train before the report was published. that fact should not go unnoticed. indeed, i suggest that the recommendations could very well have come anyway—and probably would have come anyway—from the department of health and social security, even if the select committee had not considered them. nevertheless, the committee has done its job. i hope that will be the end of it, and that the house will vote against the re-establishment of the select committee.\\n           the supporters of re-establishing the select committee have said that this does not end the story. the hon. member for essex, south-east has told us that the committee must be reappointed in order to complete the work that was entrusted to it in the last session, but neither he nor any other hon. member has yet produced a valid reason why this select committee should be reconstituted. names have been bandied about of people who could be called to give evidence. various arguments have been advanced that the committee needs to consider amending the existing legislation in order to do this and that. i think that all the supporters of the select committee wish to do is to strike at the fundamentals of the act itself.\\n           what have these people been saying? who would they now call to give fresh evidence to them in the context of what they are now putting before the house? would they call representatives of the british medical association? the bma has given evidence already, as have the royal college of general practitioners, the royal college of psychiatrists, the royal college of pathologists, the association of anaesthetists, the royal college of pediatricians and gynaecologists, the royal college of midwives and the health visitors association. all these bodies have said

20 weeks and 28 weeks. i do not think that the select committee ought to consider a reduction of the period, and i do not consider that a good and valid reason to reconstitute the select committee, if that is what it wants to do.\\n           much has been said about the nursing profession. the royal college of nursing and the association of nurse administrators themselves have serious doubts about the changes proposed in the bill, that, including the evidence of the home office and of the department of health and social security, the overwhelming weight of opinion offered to the select committee was to leave the act as it now is.\\n           this proposal might have been tenable if the select committee had been set up to consider the report of the lane committee, although i have never understood how a select committee could be set up to consider the recommendations of another committee—an eminent and distinguished one at that—which took three years to report. simply to implement the recommendations of the lane committee would have been sufficient, but the motion says that the select committee will consider the abortion (amendment) bill. furthermore, the composition of the committee is the same as before, so we must assume that the supporters of the select committee again want to strike at the foundations of the act.\\n           what we need, not only in this house but outside it, is a period of calm and to take the whole issue out of this situation of continual confrontation between one side of the argument and the other. supporters of the select committee inside the house have been loud in their wish to frustrate abortion on demand and, in some cases, to frustrate abortion altogether. i hope that they noticed a recent editorial in the crucible, the official journal of the church of england board for social responsibility, which took a line in favour of working towards a genuine and responsible response to the considered wishes of the pregnant woman. this is a departure for the board for social responsibility and one which i think hon. members ought to welcome. i applaud it.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0),

in with parliament\\'s will? despite what the hon. member for barking said, parliament made it clear, as did the sponsor of the original bill throughout the committee proceedings, that it was not intended to sanction abortion on demand. that was quite clear. the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) said this in letters to churchmen, he said it frequently in committee, and

implement abortion on demand is being frustrated by the working of the act.\\n           then there is the most important question of the position of doctors and nurses who are jeopardising their careers because they will not carry out abortions. i find it extraordinary that members of this house are not prepared to give thought and sympathy to doctors who wish to practice their profession in accordance with their conscience. not for one moment would anyone suggest that people should go to war and fight if they conscientiously objected to it. why does the house insist that it is perfectly proper for men to be hounded out of their jobs unless they agree to carry out operations which they loathe?\\n           what about the legal protection of the unborn? this house spent some time last friday debating a bill brought forward by the hon. member for birmingham, northfield (mr. carter). i notice that the times had a headline \"rights for some unborn\". i should think it is \"some unborn\". it seems that the decision as to whether an unborn child shall have rights will rest solely on whether it is a wanted child. how can this house agree that only a wanted person has any rights? it is a total denial of all the things we are here to protect.\\n           there is the question of collusion by racketeering doctors which the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) dealt with in his bill. the committee has not touched on this question, which is of importance.\\n           most important of all, perhaps—and it has not yet been raised—is the question of the care of women and the need for warnings to be given to them about the nature of the operation. i have here a report from russia. it is interesting to note that many who support abortion are vociferous in their support for the soviet union. dr. polchanova of the central scientific research institute for health education of the ussr ministry of health has written about this. i remind the house that the ussr was the first country to have abortion as a legal operation.\\n           the doctor said: it is one of the most important problems confronting women\\'s clinics to reduce the number of induced abortions and by so doing to reduce gynaecological morbidity and disorders of the reproductive system. the prevention of abortions is an important purpose of health education… the very frequent development of psycho-nervous reactions following an artificial termination, and the extraordinary tenacity and punctillious observance of instructions by women undergoing treatment for sterility, are a convincing indication how necessary it is for a pregnant woman to have a personal interview with a sympathetic doctor who can prevent her making a rash decision.… according to our findings many women assume that provided an abortion is carried out at a hospital all possibility of complications is thereby eliminated. this misconception is due to the comparatively simple way women are admitted to gynaecological wards and their short stay there. we have ascertained that the majority of women are well acquainted only with the comparatively rare complications of an operation for the termination of pregnancy, i.e. perforation and haemorrhage; they are quite inadequately informed about the most prevalent consequences, i.e. gynaecological inflammatory diseases, frequent complications during subsequent pregnancies and confinement, disordered function of the ovaries and so forth. therefore it is necessary to take more active measures based on up-to-date scientific data to combat the idea so firmly held by the public that an abortion performed in hospital conditions is a perfectly safe and harmless operation. the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles mentioned a survey which had been carried out involving women who had had an abortion. the difficulty about putting any credence upon the findings of that survey lies in the fact that only 60 patients out of the 360 were followed up at all. when i inquired from those who were informed about this scientific area whether this would be a reasonable sample to work on, i was told that it was not a reasonable sample. i am concerned about the women. as i understand it, before any other voluntary operation a woman or man is warned of the dangers if there are dangers connected with that operation. so far as i am aware, abortion is the only voluntary operation for which there is no legal commitment to warn the person that dangers exist and may well follow the operation.\\n           what are the people who oppose the setting up of the committee once more so frightened about? the act is on the statute book. women are having abortions every day under it. the committee seeks merely to go further into these important matters. it would be a sad day if this house said that it no longer had the time or energy to debate whether parliament\\'s will was being carried out, or to talk about men and women who are being prevented from working in their chosen professions, legal protection for the weak and helpless or medical care for women. there is no reason why those who oppose the setting up of the committee should be so flighty in their opposition. we ask merely that this vital question be examined properly. so far it has not been.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0),

1975, when we were discussing the bill. my hon. friend said: this proposal for a select committee offers a way of ensuring that any future legislation to amend the 1967 act will be soundly based. therefore, the outcome of the deliberations of the select committee will be of vital importance in any future legislation on abortion. my hon. friend also said: i have not, i fear, dealt with all the issues but i hope i have said enough to indicate that a select committee on this bill has a major task ahead of it.\"—[ official report, 7th february 1975; vol. 885, cc. 1797–1806.] that was the view of those of us who were concerned about the re-establishment of the select committee.\\n           i wish to make my attitude perfectly clear. in spite of my jewish name, i am a roman catholic and i have very strong views on abortion. i recognise the sincerity of those who disagree with me, and i hope that in this and subsequent debates they will recognise my sincerity.\\n           this subject is of vital importance to all sections of the community, whatever their views may be. we have seen in the public gallery tonight the extent to which some people are prepared to go to influence the house. i do not say that in a critical sense. we have all received correspondence from our constituents expressing views for or against abortion. i hope that hon. members have done the same as i have done and have written to their constituents saying, \"even though we disagree with you, we appreciate your having brought your point of view to our attention.\"\\n           we must not only consider this question very seriously; it must be seen by the public that we have done so. that is why it is vitally important that the select committee should have a full opportunity to consider the mandate placed before it. my hon. friends have referred to groups and individuals who have been interviewed by a select committee. there may be many more who wish to be interviewed and to put their point of view. we should reappoint the same select committee, otherwise we shall have to go through the whole business again, and that would not do justice to the decision of the house or to the people who

although i am speaking from this box, my voice, such as it is—i apologise for it—represents no party line, no party or manifesto commitment. i speak only for myself, but i hope that my views may commend themselves to some hon. members in all parts of the house.\\n           since i have not spoken in any abortion debate since the report stage of the bill of the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) in 1967, perhaps i might start by making it clear where i stand on the main issue. that might help the house to weigh the advice that i may be giving on the point before us.\\n           i supported the original bill on second reading and on third reading, although on third reading with some misgivings. as the record shows, on report i spoke to amendments which the sponsor felt unable to accept. but i supported the bill in the end because i thought that there was a great need to define the circumstances in which it was right for a pregnancy to be terminated, that there was a need to take powers to deal with private establishments where the abortions were done and that it was necessary to provide protection to doctors and nurses with conscientious objections. the bill did all those things and i voted for it.\\n           i have never supported either of the extreme views—on the one hand the view that there could be no abortion or an abortion only if a woman\\'s life was at stake, or on the other hand the view that abortion should be available on request unless there were clear medical contra-indications. i imagine that that view is held by a great many hon. members. i do not believe that abortion should be confined strictly to medical reasons. the struggling, inadequate mother of six who finds herself pregnant yet again with an unwanted pregnancy seems to present a case where social reasons may well justify terminating the pregnancy.\\n           however, i also believe that the unborn child has a right to life. that is a view which must be given full weight. i cannot accept the doctrine that abortion is a woman\\'s right to choose. any human life—anyone\\'s life—even life in embryo, is not at anyone\\'s unfettered disposal, not even the mother\\'s.\\n           therefore, for me this has always been a question of striking a balance. it has been a difficult question and it is one to which the house on this second time has yet to address itself. i hope that the house will forgive that brief personal testament, but it may be helpful and was a way of putting my own credentials before the house.\\n           within a few months of the 1967 act becoming law there was growing public concern at the way it operated in practice. it is right to put on record, because it is often forgotten, that my right hon. friend the member for leeds, north-east (sir k. joseph) took a great deal of action to tackle the worst of the abuses as they became apparent. he set up a special investigation branch within his department. he exercised a rigorous scrutiny, so far as resources allowed, over abortion clinics. many licences were withdrawn or suspended and steps were taken to deal with the dreadful business of touting at airports and stations.\\n           my right hon. friend also set up the lane committee in february 1971 which was to look more closely at the operation of the act although it had restricted terms of reference. that committee reported in april 1974. it provided a mass of information and made a number of useful recommendations. however, the report was not debated until the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) presented his bill last year.\\n           however, that did not still public anxieties. when the hon. member for pollok presented his bill many right hon. and hon. members recognised that the supporters of the original act had a not insubstantial case to answer. the hon. gentleman\\'s bill may not have been the right way to frame that case. indeed, i am pretty clear that his bill was not the most appropriate vehicle for reform. there was no doubt about the deep anxiety, which was felt in all parts of the house, about the way in which the original act was operating. therefore, there was widespread support—which i shared—that the bill should go to a select committee.\\n           presumably the assumption which the house made, when it accepted the motion of my right hon. friend the member for crosby (mr. page) that the bill should be committed to a select committee, was that that select committee would examine and report on all the matters that were put in issue by the bill. it was recognised during the debate that that might well take longer than the last session. the words of the minister of state, as reported in hansard on 7th february 1975 at column 1794, have been quoted many times this evening and i shall not weary the house with them again. however, at that stage the government were committed to re-establishing the committee. that meant that they were committed to putting a motion before the house and presumably to supporting it.\\n           therefore, the question is: has the committee examined and reported to the house on all the issues raised in the bill presented by the hon. member for pollok? the only possible answer must be \"no, it has not\". the committee has heard a great deal of evidence and has reported on some of the issues, but it has not reported on all the issues.\\n           the committee made nine valuable recommendations, all of which were accepted in principle by the right hon. lady the secretary of state. when reporting to the house in its third special report, the committee had this to say: in their second special report your committee undertook to make an interim report. in so doing they deal only with some matters on which they believe they have received sufficient evidence to make recommendations upon which the government ought to take action now without awaiting any further report. paragraph 5 of the report says, your committee emphasise that their recommendations are not exhaustive and are made without prejudice to any report which the re-established committee may make on the bill. indeed it is for this reason that your committee in their present report have not referred to the provisions of the bill. it is their belief that the re-established committee should be able to report without delay in the next session. if one examines the minutes of the committee, one finds that there was no dissentient voice to either of those paragraphs. that was in july. since then the committee has seen many organisations: the british pregnancy advisory service, the brook advisory centre, the royal college of nursing, the association of nurse administrators and the health visitors association, and it has seen the minister of state. yet when we came to november, at the final meeting, as the hon. member for wood green (mrs. butler) has told us, there were some members of that committee who by then had decided that there was nothing further for them to do.\\n           what has happened? we have some clues now from the speeches in this debate and from the circular sent around by a number of members of the committee to all hon. members, i imagine, at the end of last month. the message of the circular was \"because we are unlikely to be able to reach a consensus, therefore no further useful purpose would be served by reconstituting the committee.\"\\n           i do not share that view and i do not think that the house as a whole ought to share that view. i have just spent most of the weekend in bed—with a heavy cold—reading a great deal of the evidence tendered to the committee. it is obvious that much—indeed, most—of the evidence was opposed to the particular provisions of the bill of the hon. member for pollok. however, i think that only a very deeply prejudiced supporter of the original act of the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles could fail to recognise the genuine voices of concern that all was not well with the operation of that act.\\n           nor is it true that the nine measures which the interim report put to the house represent the full extent of the legitimate areas of concern. there is a whole raft of matters, matters on the day-to-day application of the provisions of the bill to situations that actually happen in real life and on which a great deal of evidence was heard, on which we till have to have a report from the select committee. my hon. friend the member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine) mentioned a number of them, and no doubt other hon. members will be able to mention others.\\n           for me, there are three matters which seem to be of critical importance in deciding whether the 1967 act requires to be amended, all of them matters on which evidence was given to the select committee and all of them, i suspect, matters on which it ought not to be difficult for the select committee, if it is prepared to try to be objective and to exercise some good will and harmony where that can be done—as it has in the past—to be able to reach agreement.\\n           the first matter is the operation of the conscience clause. freedom of conscience is the very stuff of liberty. even when we were faced with the full terror of hitler\\'s tanks and bombers, we recognised the freedom of conscience of individual men and women who were pacifists. freedom of conscience was written into the 1967 act, but who can read the evidence tendered by the royal college of nursing, or even the evidence tendered on the last day of evidence by the minister of state, without recognising that not all the intentions of parliament in 1967 are being met?\\n           can anyone who reads the minister of state\\'s long answer to question no. 1995 on page 374 of the report—i have no intention of reading it to the house tonight—be in any doubt that willingness to perform abortions is a term of some appointments under the national health service? i would find it helpful to have the committee\\'s view on that, perhaps if necessary even its divided views. the committee has heard a lot of evidence, but most hon. members do not have time to real all the evidence. that is what we appoint select committees for. this is a matter of great importance.\\n           the second point which is important is a corrollary of the first. it was the intention in the original act that it should be possible to have therapeutic abortions on the national health service, though it was always recognised that there would be a substantial private sector. the evidence both to the lane committee and to the select committee has shown that there is a huge variation in availability of therapeutic abortions under the national health service facilities between different parts of the country.\\n           again, this is a matter of some importance to the house and to the country. if a patient\\'s condition indicates the desirability of an abortion, if the law does not prevent it and if, as was the intention, termination should be available under the national health service but it is not, surely we need to know the select committee\\'s view on that and what measures might be necessary to remedy what is a defect.\\n           i am not suggesting that it is remotely possible in the foreseeable future—in the next few years—that the national health service could or should become the sole source of therapeutic abortions. my point is that there are enormous variations in the availability of abortions between different parts of the country.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.76', 122, 'uk.m.10649',

terms of the bill and within the terms of reference of the select committee. they are problems upon which the select committee has heard a great deal of evidence. my point is that, faced with this, at least the house might have the benefit of the select committee\\'s views on these two problems.\\n           the third problem, which i believe is perhaps the key question of all and, perhaps, the question that lies behind the circular and some of the very bitter opposition to the re-appointment of the select committee is: does or does not the act in practice allow abortions on request to take place?\\n           i accept, as perhaps the hon. member for barking (miss richardson) did not, that it was not the intention of the sponsors of the original act that it should allow that. the hon. member for rox-burgh, selkirk and peebles said this: we want to stamp out the back-street abortions, but it is not the intention of the promoters of the bill to leave a wide open door for abortion on request.\"—[ official report, 22nd july 1976; vol. 732, c. 1075.] indeed, if that were not so, why did we spend so many hours, days—and, indeed, nights—and weeks arguing about it all?\\n           yet it is possible to state that it is on request. dr. coplans, the anaesthetist representative on the cchms, said this to the select committee on 23rd january in answer to question no. 1006: i believe that some people interpret the present act as something which allows them to move very far to \\'on request\\' and others do not. one reason—this has been exhaustively examined by the committee—is the statistical argument. the argument is that if one takes a pregnancy before the twelfth week there is greater risk by letting it run to full term than there is by procuring a termination, and therefore, some people say—on the argument of balance of risk—the right thing would always be termination without any examination of the patient, without taking account of her health or circumstances. that argument has been used not perhaps in the public sector but certainly in the private sector.\\n           professor sir stanley clayton, president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, was perhaps one of the committee\\'s most important and distinguished witnesses, and his evidence is frequently read as showing that the royal college was not upset at all by the existing act and, by a vote of 28 to two was in favour of preserving it. yet on the question of misuse—the misuse of the intention of parliament on the balance of risk argument, the so-called statistical argument—sir stanley was clear. the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse) put to him—this is question no. 1216 in the evidence— …there should be a proviso there which would not make it possible for people to use the general statistical argument? and sir stanley replied: yes, i would accept that. i have mentioned only three matters, but there are many others on which the select committee has still to report to the house.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.78', 4, 'uk.m.22028', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp',

will be voting in different lobbies. it might, however, be helpful to the house if, as minister with day-to-day responsibility for the workings of the abortion act, i were to bring the house up to date on the present situation.\\n           the house will recall that on second reading of the abortion (amendment) bill i suggested, on the basis that the sponsors had agreed to withdraw the bill, that a select committee should be set up to examine the proposals contained in the bill. at that time it was widely recognised in the house that there were some aspects of the workings of the abortion act, particularly the extent of abuse in the private sector, which were causing grave concern to many members, and i have never hidden from the house my personal concern about these abuses. this concern was unrelated to the views that many hon. members might have had on the question whether they supported or rejected the abortion act itself.\\n           it was felt, i think, by many members that a dispassionate yet detailed examination by a select committee on some of these matters to reinforce those already identified by the lane committee in its report of the working of the abortion act would help the secretary of state and the government, who had already embarked on a scrutiny of the working of the act. at the end of the debate the house decided against establishing a special select committee as had been suggested. it decided to commit the bill itself rather than the proposals to a select committee. as a direct result of this decision, under the rules of procedure, the bill and the select committee lapsed at the end of the last session.\\n           some people have criticised or attacked the decision by the government to put down this motion, arguing that we were not committed to give the house an opportunity to re-establish the select committee. i believe that to have refused to put down this motion would have been to shield behind a technicality that would not have been in keeping with the spirit of the previous debate or what i said during that debate, or in keeping with the wishes of the house. whatever our views—and there are strong views in this house and outside—i think it was the government's duty to give the house the opportunity of deciding whether or not to re-establish the select committee.\\n           i am grateful to the hon. member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine) for recognising so fairly in his speech that the government have honoured the commitment that i gave. that point was reiterated by the hon. member for rox-burgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel).\\n           i see my task now as trying as objectively as i can to indicate, first, what the select committee has already achieved and what are the issues involved if the house decides to re-establish the select committee.\\n           during its sittings last session, the select committee received a formidable amount of written and oral evidence from government departments, professional bodies and individuals, including myself. the select committee produced several reports, and in its third special report it unanimously presented to the house a list of nine recommendations clearly designed to reduce the potential for abuse and exploitation of patients and to improve the workings of the abortion act. the secretary of state, in her statement to the house on 21st october 1975, accepted in principle all of the recommendations. i think it will help the house if i summarise the action that has been or will now be taken.\\n           new regulations have been made and laid before the house to implement the recommendations on disclosure of information contained in the abortion notifications to the president of the general medical council where serious professional misconduct is suspected, and on the examination of patients prior to certification of abortion. it is proposed that the new abortion regulations will come into effect on 1st march, when new forms for the certification and notification of abortions, including these new provisions, will be available for use.\\n           my department has also undertaken a study on certification and notification procedures and its findings in draft form are now being considered with other government departments.\\n           in the private sector, the secretary of state now controls the total cost charged to patients at all nursing homes that concentrate on abortion. nursing homes must inform her before they increase charges above the level approved, and they are required to inform patients of the total costs of their treatment before it is carried out. these measures should contribute to preventing the financial exploitation of women who find themselves in this vulnerable, situation. nursing homes must be able to show my department's investigators that their financial arrangements with doctors and referral agencies are satisfactory.\\n           my department is in the process of drawing up a list of approved pregnancy advisory bureaux, in addition to the black list which already exists. thirty-five bureaux have already applied for approval and their applications are being investigated and their premises and facilities inspected. my department's special investigators will continue to make unannounced visits to nursing homes and pregnancy advisory bureaux to ensure that they are adhering to these and the other assurances required of them.\\n           terminations after the twentieth week are now restricted to those nursing homes which have available adequate equipment, including resuscitation equipment. currently, seven out of the total of 57 homes approved under the act have been authorised to carry out late terminations. as to the national health service, regional medical officers will ensure that all nhs hospitals where terminations after the twentieth week are carried out are equipped with appropriate facilities.\\n           a draft paper on the counselling of patients seeking abortion has been circulated, for consultation, to statutory bodies and organisations. we have also sent it to various voluntary bodies and those known to support and those known to oppose the act. a revised version of the paper will be prepared in the light of comments that we receive, and the final version will subsequently be issued.\\n           in june 1975, my department issued a circular reminding health authorities of the peel committee's recommendations on the use of foetuses and foetal material for research, and where the peel code of practice was not already in use they were called on to adopt it. in addition to fulfilling this condition, private sector nursing homes are required by my department to give an assurance that appropriate arrangements are made for the disposal of abortion foetuses as a condition of approval to carry out terminations.\\n           my department is currently undertaking an inquiry into the facilities provided by nursing homes which treat foreign patients with a view to ensuring that the reception, counselling and after care of foreign patients meet the high standards expected, and to prevent the exploitation of those foreign women who are most vulnerable because of their language difficulties. i am also obtaining, as a routine feature, quarterly figures of the number of foreign patients treated at all nursing homes.\\n           as i have said, some of these steps were being planned by the secretary of state or had already been identified in the lane committee report on the working of the abortion act. nevertheless, the select committee's report gave them an additional impetus and enabled them to be treated collectively as a comprehensive package. i am grateful to my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white), my right hon. friend the member for sunderland, north (mr. willey), and all the other members of the select committee for the work they carried

responsibility for the act.\\n           there is one important matter concerned with the working of the act on which there is general agreement, which will require government action and which is touched on by the select committee in its recommendations on abortion after 20 weeks. this concerns an upper time limit for abortion. various proposals have been made as to what an upper time limit should be. at present, the infant life (preservation) act 1929 contains a statutory presumption of viability at 28 weeks' gestation, and this, in practice, has provided an effective upper time limit.\\n           the lane committee recommended that there should be a lower limit of 24 weeks, without exception, and this has been generally supported by those consulted on the lane report. i told the select committee in november that we broadly approved this recommendation, which would require principal legislation.\\n           the government have tabled this motion to enable the house now to consider, in the light of progress to date, whether it wishes the select committee to be re-established to examine more fundamental aspects of this controversial issue. members of the select committee were themselves divided on the question whether the select committee should be re-established, voting 5 to 4 in favour, and i think this vote reflects the problems which would confront a reconvened select committee in reaching a substantial measure of agreement.\\n           the figures for resident women receiving therapeutic abortion has remained relatively stable for the last three years. the 1975 figures which have just been published show a 3 per cent. fall compared with the previous year. at the same time, there has been a dramatic fall in the number of foreign women being treated in this country in the last 12 months. there has been an overall decrease of 37 per cent.—nearly 20,000 patients—compared with last year.\\n           the fall in the number of foreign women is directly attributable to the new abortion law that has been introduced in france and the changed attitude being taken in some neighbouring countries. i am sure that hon. members, irrespective of the view they take on legal abortion, will welcome this fall in the number of women seeking treatment.\\n           as for resident women, i am hopeful that the long-overdue free comprehensive family planning arrangements that we have introduced, which became fully operative on 1st july last year, will give all women the opportunity of planning when they wish to become pregnant. i am sure that whatever our attitude on this subject we would all accept that treatment for termination of pregnancy should be a last resort and should be kept to the minimum.\\n           a number of issues relating to abortion have been raised in this debate. the right hon. member for wanstead and woodford (mr. jenkin), who spoke with much understanding of the problem, raised two important issues—the question of freedom of conscience and the variations in practice in the national health service. i think that my hon. friend the member for coventry, south-west (mrs. wise) was right in her intervention when she raised the question of possible conflict between these two beliefs. evidence was taken on this matter by the select committee, and i was questioned. i think that the hon. member for brighton, kemptown (mr. bowden) was right when he said that the principal matter on which no action had been taken in my hon. friend's abortion (amendment) bill was the proposal to change, and, by the words in the bill, restrict the grounds on which doctors decide whether women may receive treatment under the act.\\n           on this issue, as has been testified by many hon. members who have spoken in the debate and who are members of the select committee, there is unlikely to be unanimity in the select committee—and there are many differing views outside. the british medical association voted 360 to 4 against any change in the grounds for abortion, and the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists similarly voted, by 28 votes to 2, in favour of retaining the existing provisions. their president told the select committee that he thought they would gain little by altering the act. a central unanimous conclusion of the lane committee, after studying the working of the act for two and a half years, was that the grounds set out in the act should not be amended in a restrictive way. this select committee has unanimously produced an important set of recommendations, which should generally improve the working of the act.\\n           it is not for me to make recommendations to hon. members as to how they should vote, but as my hon. friends have asked me directly, and in order that hon. members may discount any bias that i may have put into my speech—and as the right hon. member for wanstead felt that he should tell the house—speaking personally, i believe that what is now needed is not further examination of the provisions of the act by the select committee, which is itself clearly divided, but a period of time to see exactly how its unanimous recommendations, which the government are implementing, will work out in practice.\\n           there is no secret about my views. hon. members can read them in the select committee's report. i told the select committee that this was my view when i gave evidence to it on 3rd november 1975. i shall therefore, personally vote against the motion.\\n           in putting down this motion and making time available for debate, the government are fulfilling the pledge which i gave to the house last february and which was reiterated by my right hon. friend in her statement to the house on 21st october, giving the house, in the light of the committee's reports already published, and of this debate, the opportunity to decide whether the select committee should be re-established. we are enabling every member of the house, on a free vote—as is traditional in these matters—to exercise his or her individual judgment. that is, i think, what the house expects.\\n        \",

contribution of the minister of state, who is responsible for the day-to-day working of the abortion legislation.\\n           one feature that should be laid to the credit of the select committee is that it spurred the department into action. i personally believe, as did the committee, that the department should have taken earlier action to deal with two factors—first the question of public anxiety, and secondly the report of the lane committee. if that had happened earlier, i believe that there would have been no need to set up a select committee to examine the situation.\\n           i accept the minister\\'s personal view that we should now have a period of calm. the 1967 act brought great benefits to women in this country, and indeed to women in other countries whose legislators have followed the example of our legislation. our legislation has been a great refuge for women in times of great trouble for themselves and their families. i believe that women have been under-represented in this house; they have been especially in the consideration of this legislation which mainly affects women.\\n           it was by women that i was asked to help to sponsor the original bill that led to the 1967 act. that act ran for three and a half years before the lane committee was set up. it looked at the operation of that act and made far-reaching recommendations in a report published in 1974. on those recommendations there should have been more action.\\n           the lane committee had recommended, among other things, that there should be no change in the grounds of abortion. four years later the select committee took evidence from the medical profession and was given the same story: \"whatever you do, do not interfere with the grounds of abortion or restrict them.\" in plain language, some of them said \"stop mucking about with this law because we have had to adjust to it. we believe that, for the time being, it is the right measure. if you try to restrict it now, it will put doctors in a quandary and will drive people back to the back-street abortionists.\"\\n           that is one of the things we wish to avoid. that is why i wish to see a period of calm reflection and an opportunity for the minister to heed the \"kick in the pants\" by the select committee and get on with the job of curbing abuses.\\n           on 3rd november in the select committee i asked the minister whether he now thought that he had all the powers required to deal with any abuses current or foreseen. his answer was: yes. we believe that we would, by accepting your own report and by the action we have taken, have got a comprehensive package to stop as far as is possible abuse in the private sector over abortion. that was the sector with which we were most concerned. i have disagreed with the minister over many things, but on this matter i find myself in complete agreement with him.\\n           there has been a welcome decline in the number of back-street abortions. it was these that worried people so much that they consented to the passage of the abortion bill in 1967. there was evidence from leading medical authorities that the emergency units set up in many of the main hospitals throughout the country had been stood down because the need for them to deal with the results of back-street abortion had lapsed and that, fortunately, they were able to deploy the staff for more useful purposes.\\n           the view of the medical profession has quite clearly been that it does not want a change in the grounds of abortion.\\n           i believe that many people who wish to see the select committee reestablished, with the widest possible terms—unconstrained, by the long title, from discussing any item at all in the whole area of abortion, as the hon. member put it—should face the fact that its reestablishment will go on putting the public in doubt and keep the medical profession in doubt.\\n           i do not believe that we should any longer give people the worry that the government or this house will interfere or restrict the carefully devised grounds for abortion which are enshrined in the 1967 act, recommended by the lane committee and endorsed by all the medical opinion that came before the select committee.\\n           for that reason, i shall be among the many people in the house who will vote tonight against a reconstitution of the select committee.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.88', 29, 'uk.m.17903',

first is whether there are still areas which require the adjudication or consideration of a select committee, or some other body. secondly, if it is not to be a select committee, can we leave it to the minister? are there areas which genuinely need to be examined? if there are, should it be left to the house, through a select committee, or should it be left to the department, at the elephant and castle?\\n           the right hon. member for wanstead and woodford (mr. jenkin) has mentioned three matters which particularly concern him, which have not been fully discussed by the select committee or are matters on which the select committee has not so far made adequate recommendations.\\n           the hon. member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine) has categorised five issues. i shall run through them, and also some others that i think are quite clearly the types of matters that have to be dealt with, and upon which decisions have to be made.\\n           first, there is the need, which was repeatedly stressed by the department, to give statutory powers directly to license and control pregnancy advice bureaux, rather than—as we tried to do in our recommendations—give indirect powers, which really amount only to a holding measure.\\n           all along, the ministry has maintained that it requires statutory measures. that is why it supported a previous private member\\'s bill. i ask why it now believes—if it does—that the tentative, negative measures that we have suggested as a holding operation should be regarded as satisfactory. are they satisfactory?\\n           secondly, there is a most important matter that has not been dealt with except very elliptically by the minister—namely, the discrimination against doctors with conscientious objections to abortions. it is a weighty and serious matter. i suspect that it is a matter that can be adequately dealt with and weighed only by a select committee.\\n           thirdly, there is the practice of some doctors to grant abortions virtually on request under the terms of section 1( a ) of the original act. home office witnesses suggested to the committee that even a requirement to examine each patient individually and to consider each case individually would not necessarily eliminate the practice. it is a question of examination by committee or by an individual to ascertain how we can remedy the problem.\\n           the suggestion was made by the president of the royal college in oral evidence, that the risk necessary to justify a legal abortion may not have been within the terms of the bill of my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white). we shall have to consider whether the matter can be confined so as to overcome the statistical problem mentioned by the right hon. member for wanstead and woodford.\\n           there is the possibility of collusion by doctors in approving abortions outside the spirit of the law through a mutual financial interest in the decision to terminate. that was attempted to be dealt with within the bill of my hon. friend. it has not been dealt with so far. it has not been touched upon in any of our recommendations, yet who can doubt that it is a matter upon which some judgment and guidance should be available to the public and the house?\\n           there is the desirability or otherwise of statutory restrictions on the qualifications and experience of the medical practitioners undertaking or approving abortion operations. should they have been in practice for a number of years? that is a matter upon which the bma and the other medical organisations hold varying opinions. no decision has yet been taken, and judgment has not been weighed. the select committee believed all along that it would have ample time, and it has not engaged itself upon matters that are urgent and upon which unanimity is necessary.\\n           we have heard once more of the confusion that exists about the need to bring the upper time limit for abortions into line with current world medical opinion, merely doing as we have recommended. the minister has indicated that our recommendation will be fulfilled. but we have not made a judgment on the important question of how late an abortion can take place. it has been indicated by the hon. member for essex,south-east that we have not dealt with the need that is generally regarded as necessary to provide anonymity for witnesses who have undergone abortions and who are involved in criminal proceedings. no judgment has been made. a problem faced by the police, as the evidence clearly revealed, is the virtual impossibility of proving lack of good faith on the part of the doctor. there is also the difficulty of gaining access to patients\\' registers at approved places.\\n           many matters have been raised in our discussions with the home office, but they have been left unattended. there is the important difficulty that is caused by the six-months\\' limitation within which prosecutions can be brought under the abortion act. there is the paltry minimum fine provided for breach of certification and notification regulations. we have not dealt with the issue. we have not engaged ourselves upon those matters. but they are not issues on which the committee could not reach some consensus, given the good will\\n           the point has been rightly made about the inconsistencies that exist between one area and another in terms of the availability of abortion under the national health service. it is an important issue. has it arisen because in certain areas there are people who are being excessively restrictive, or has it come about because in some areas there are people like professor huntingford, who have taken the view, despite the will of the house, that there should be abortion on demand? do both factors apply? surely there is a necessity for some recommendation to come from a committee which would lay down guidelines and amount to something more like a standard medical practice than exists today.\\n           again, there are the conditions relating to the licensing of clinics or blanket pregnancy advisory bureaux. these cannot be left now, as has been suggested, merely to men in the elephant and castle. i speak as a lawyer. justice requires that there should be an appellate jurisdiction. does this mean the creation of machinery by legislation? this has not been dealt with.\\n           we should ask again—who can deny that it is not necessary to ask—whether there should not be a special screening of first-pregnancy abortions. we may argue how high is the incidence of risk, but everyone agrees that there is a significant risk when a first pregnancy is aborted. all the medical evidence, including that from russia, hungary and czechoslovakia in recent months, indicates that this is not a matter to be put on one side, and that it can have very serious consequences. i know of nothing more dangerous and sad than that an ill-considered decision taken by a woman when she is young can mean that she is rendered sterile, and never able to have the blessings of parenthood. i know there are women who put forward the view that motherhood is a curse and not a blessing, but that is not the view held by the majority of women in this country. i believe that it is necessary that the house should know the evidence and, in the light of the evidence that the select committee can collect, be able to make its own decision whether we should give, in some form, special consideration to a woman in that position.\\n           this becomes more important when we find that since we have reported the suggestion has been made—it has not come from the committee and has not been examined by the committee—that there should be day clinics for what have been pejoratively described as \"lunch-time\" abortions, and that the ministry, without and review by the select committee, will give these experiments into the hands of so-called charities. i say \"so-called\" charities, because the evidence that came before the committee showed that the doctors who work for these charities, as abortionists, are capable of earning £25,000 a year. that is a charity, and it is one of the two charities to which the minister is prepared to give this experiment, which may have merit and which may have to be done, but which, if it were done, i should prefer to see done in the national health service than by a charity of this kind.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'],

my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) believes in abortion on request, and it may be that that is a view which can be respectably argued. but it is not the law of the land. it is not what this house has passed.\\n           i have considerable misgivings when i find that this new and serious experiment, on which there are arguments between the so-called charities as to which is the right technique, should be given to what is effectively the private sector. it is to be done without any surveillance. this is the first real initiative to have come from the department other than as a result of repeated promptings by way of questions, motions or requests from select committees.\\n           if i look back upon the history of the workings of this act i realise that it is only as a result of pressure from this house, following what has happened outside, that any changes have come about. the truth is that the department, in successive administrations, has limped and lagged behind the expression of opinion in this house. at the beginning we were told, in the memorandum presented to the select committee by the department, that the department's view was that it had limited powers. it felt that it could do nothing to control any clinic other than by way of approving its physical accoutrements. provided that, physically, it had the necessary equipment to be classified as a nursing home, nothing more could be done. in its evidence the department made it clear that it believed it could not go further.\\n           it took years before the department took the appropriate legal advice which eventually brought it to the conclusion that it could take action as far-reaching as that now to be implemented by the minister on the recommendation of the select committee. it would be curious if the house were now asked to trust the men at the elephant and castle. if they came here with a good record, having shown themselves ready to take the initiative, that would be a heavy argument. but the hon. member for dorking (sir g. sinclair) has expressed his opinion of how febrile the activities of the men at the department have been for years. is he now asking us to place all confidence in the department? ministers come and go, but the men at the department continue. the house would be wrong if, even with the best will in the world, it decided to put this matter to rest in the cradle inside the elephant and castle.\\n           the truth is that however we interpret the undertaking given by the minister on behalf of the government—whatever casuistry may be attempted to be brought in to suggest that a commitment eras not given to the house and the country that the select committee would have the full opportunity to review matters and continue its work in another session—the undertaking was given. i saw that this would happen, as did my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok. we asked for an undertaking from the government when we agreed that we would support the idea that the bill should go to the select committee. we anticipated the situation. we knew that if the house was to do justice to this issue we would have to carry on as a committee.\\n           we asked for the undertaking and it was given in specific terms. we sometimes have to explain to people outside that this is a pluralist society and that no one can have his own way totally on an issue of this kind, in this highly opinionated society. we who have taken people with us would be placed in a great difficulty. it would be regarded as a betrayal, even if that were not intended, if we decided to shirk the issue and pass it back to the ministry. i hope that as a matter of political wisdom my hon. friends will join with me. in my view it is hon. members on the labour benches who have a responsibility, because the government will be regarded by many as having given an undertaking.\\n           i do not understand what the fear is. the select committee will try to reach unanimity. every sensible man or woman knows that what we are aiming at is a consensus that will stretch out its hand to women in trouble while at the same time striving to maintain the sanctity of life and a cessation of the corrosion of our values. that is the aim, and it is difficult, but surely possible, for legislators to make the attempt.\\n           i hope that the house will enable us to have another look at the possibilities which i hope will bring about a consensus and a lasting healing—not a sense of frustration or betrayal—because that is what every sensible man and woman wants.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.96', 395, 'uk.m.17216', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', \"we

three years of inquiry by the lane committee into the workings of the 1967 act. there has been a year's deliberation by the select committee which is the subject of the motion. i agree with the minister of state that it is time that we allowed this matter to settle down and for the medical profession to operate the bill with any additional guidance which it receives from the minister from time to time.\\n           until the passing of the 1967 act there had been no legislation on this subject since 1861. the battle lasted for over 100 years and was eventually won by those in favour of

having too many pregnancies, for whatever reason, and who are entitled under the law as it is—i defend the 1967 act, in spite of what my hon. friend the member for pontypool wants to put into my mouth—but who are refused a legal termination of pregnancy.\\n           it so happens that the figures that were given by my hon. friend the minister of state in hansard a week ago indicate the unfairness of the way in which the act operates. this is because of the abuse of the conscience clause which is written into it.\\n           in the west midlands the women have the lowest number of abortions per 100 live births. the figure in the west midlands is 3·7 per 100 live births. that is a scandalous situation. yet we find that, according to the number of abortions per thousand women in the childbearing age from 16 to 49, taken according to residence in hospital areas, the highest number of abortions, apart from those in the london area, is carried out in the west midlands. by contrast, in the north, which includes the old newcastle regional hospital board area, there is the highest number of abortions in the national health service but the lowest number per thousand women of child-bearing age.\\n           the conclusions are clear. the fact that there is an area in which the availability of abortion is restricted because of the conscience clause, about which so many anti-abortionists have made a great deal of play tonight, does not prevent women from seeking and obtaining terminations under the law. they are precisely the women who are driven to the private sector. that is another issue about which many anti-abortionists have made a great deal of weather.\\n           fewer women have had abortions in areas where abortions are available under the national health service than in areas where abortions are restricted under the national health service. a clear lesson is to be learnt from this. it so happens that, in areas where the consultants have a reasonable view towards pregnant women, they also have a reasonable view towards the availability of contraceptives, and contraceptives are made freely available by them in co-operation with health visitors and the social services. very few anti-abortionists have asked that contraceptives should be made more freely available. they want it all ways and will never be satisfied. they ask for the select committee to be set up again. as my hon. friend the member for barking (miss richardson) said, the select committee will have the contrary aim and objective to that of my hon. friend the member for pontypool. it will seek to undermine the 1967 act because the bill is a wrecking bill. the committee has a built-in majority, as the hon. member for skipton (mr. drayson) said, of those who are fundamentally opposed to the 1967 act. their aim and objective has always been to undermine that act. they do not mind what will happen to the unfortunate women who now have a legal right under the act to the termination of an unwanted pregnancy.\\n           we have heard a great deal, again from the anti-abortionists, about the need to take account of public opinion. what public opinion is it of which they want us to take account? even before the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) introduced his bill there was a determined, well-organised and well-financed campaign against the 1967 act by a minority. that minority has written letters, sent deputations and held demonstrations in london. its supporters have come to london in their coach-loads. however, the committee has also taken evidence from a united medical profession—from general practitioners to the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, the men who operate the 1967 act. without exception, all have condemned the bill. without exception, all have said that they want the act to remain unamended.\\n           in the face of that united medical opinion, what have we got? the anti-abortionists on both sides of the house—even the right hon. member for wan-stead and woodford (mr. jenkin), forgetting what his leader said yesterday about choice—say that women shall not have the choice, even though they are entitled to it.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1976, 2, 9, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1976-02-09.9.1.105', 72, 'uk.m.22490', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'as there may be a

      "[['uk.proc.d.1996-12-04.9.1.1', 1309, 'uk.m.22624', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i beg to move, that leave be given to bring in a bill to prohibit partial-birth abortions. partial-birth abortion is defined in the bill as an abortion in which the person performing the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living foetus before killing the foetus and completing the delivery. the procedure, which originated in the united states, is usually used after the 20th week of pregnancy, and often much later. the practitioner, guided by ultrasound, pulls the living unborn child through the mother\\'s vagina, except for the child\\'s head, which is deliberately kept just within the uterus. the practitioner then puts surgical scissors or another medical instrument into the back of the skull, inserts a catheter and sucks out the brains.\\n           in 1992, dr. martin haskell of dayton, ohio, wrote an eight-page paper explaining step by step how to perform the procedure. haskell himself has performed more than 1,000 such procedures, for which he coined the term \"d and x\". it is also known as brain-suction abortion. a diagram illustrating the procedure has been circulated widely to hon. members. it was confirmed as accurate by a spokesman for the american national abortion federation in evidence to the house of representatives judiciary sub-committee in june 1995.\\n           the bill would amend the abortion act 1967 to prohibit the partial-birth abortion procedure. under the bill, any person performing a partial-birth abortion would be guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or both. no proceedings would be brought without the consent of the attorney-general. it would not be an offence for a medical practitioner to perform a partial-birth abortion if he or she reasonably believed that the procedure was immediately necessary to save the life of the mother, and that no other procedure would achieve that.\\n           it is not known to what extent the technique may be practised in the united kingdom. provided that the terms of the 1967 act are complied with, there is nothing to stop a practitioner from using it. replies to parliamentary questions show that abortion notification forms do not specify whether abortions are carried out by that method.\\n           the secretary of state for health has stated that the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists has asked all its members and fellows to ensure that they record details of any abortions involving intra-uterine decompression of the head of the foetus on hsa4—the form that notifies the chief medical officer of all abortions. however, there is no legal requirement for practitioners to notify the use of the technique.\\n           in the partial-birth abortion method, a woman visits the abortion clinic on three successive days. on the first two days, her cervix is mechanically dilated with material called laminaria. the baby is removed on the third day. american medical news reported on 5 july 1993 that two leading practitioners of the method, dr. haskell and dr. mcmahon, had stated in interviews: the majority of foetuses aborted this way are alive until the end of the procedure. dr. martin haskell, the principal exponent of the technique in the united states—he has performed it more than 1,000 times—said in a tape-recorded interview with the american medical news : in my… case, probably 20 [per cent. of abortions by this method] are for genetic reasons. and the other 80 per cent. are purely elective. elective abortion is another name for abortion on demand. dr. haskell\\'s statement refutes the claim by some advocates of abortion that the procedure is used only where the woman\\'s life is in danger or in cases of extreme foetal abnormality. the rcog has claimed that the procedure would be used in britain only in extreme cases of disability. nevertheless, under the abortion act 1967, there is nothing to prevent a practitioner from using the technique in abortions certified under any grounds.\\n           in the previous parliamentary session, an early-day motion calling for a ban on partial-birth abortion was tabled. several hon. members signed an amendment objecting to such a ban, in which they cited the objections of the rcog and the british medical association, and argued that it was not the role of parliament to regulate the details of clinical procedures. no one suggests that the opinions of those bodies should be excluded from the debate, but there is particular cause for concern about the rcog\\'s opposition to a ban of the procedure in view of its guidelines on termination of pregnancy for foetal abnormality, which stipulate that, to avoid the possibility of prosecution, a legal abortion must not be allowed to result in a live birth\". that means that steps must be taken to ensure that the unborn child is dead before being expelled from the mother. the practice of partial-birth abortion would conform with those guidelines.\\n           in a paper opposing a similar bill, which was sent to members of the other place at the time of the bill\\'s introduction by my right hon. and noble friend lord braine, the rcog stated: partial-birth abortion could be considered more respectful to the foetus than established methods of abortion… in which the foetus is removed from the uterus in fragments. as the editor of the sunday telegraph aptly commented, \"respectful\" is not the first word that springs to mind at the description of the sucking out of a baby\\'s brain.\\n           the fact that an unborn child has a disabling condition is no reason for killing the child, and in such an appalling manner. furthermore, disability in the child does not mean that the procedure is indicated for the benefit of the mother. even in cases of hydrocephalus, a condition which enlarges the head of the foetus, there are alternative methods of clinical management. if necessary, a caesarean section can be performed.\\n           former abortionist dr. bernard nathanson wrote in 1983 that the \"destructive operation\" in which a baby\\'s head was crushed to allow vaginal delivery became obsolete towards the end of world war two as a result of medical advances that greatly improved the safety of caesarean sections. in the light of dr. nathanson\\'s observation, it is ironic that, despite continuing advances in modern obstetric care, partial-birth abortion is defended as though medicine had not progressed since the 1940s.\\n           furthermore, there is evidence that the procedure could endanger the mother. dr. pamela smith, head of the obstetrics teaching programme at mount sinai hospital in chicago, told the us senate judiciary committee that the partial-birth abortion procedure is an adaptation of a procedure occasionally used to deliver a baby in a breech position, but that that procedure carries risks for the mother and its use is recommended only to deliver the second baby in the birth of twins.\\n           the bill allows a medical practitioner to perform a partial-birth abortion if he or she reasonably believes that it is immediately necessary to save the life of the mother and that no other procedure will achieve that. evidence that before the 10th week of human development foetal structures relating to pain are present and functional supports dr. giles\\' and others\\' opinion. even many of those among us who do not agree with the principle of the right to life of the unborn child accept that avoidable suffering should not be inflicted on the foetus. under current practices, there are more restrictions on how the remains of aborted babies may be disposed of than on how they may be killed.\\n           it is perplexing that several hon. members who called on the government to ensure more humane treatment of veal calves signed the amendment opposing a ban on partial-birth abortion. surely parliament has no less interest in protecting the young of our own kind from cruel and unusual punishment than in protecting the welfare of animals. i hope that the house will give me leave to introduce the bill.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1996, 12, 4, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1996-12-04.9'], ['uk.proc.d.1996-12-04.9.1.2', 707, 'uk.m.10120', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', \"partial-birth abortion, more correctly described by doctors as intact dilatation and evacuation, is a procedure used on rare occasions by some doctors in the united states of america when they believe it to be in the best interests of the woman. it is not currently used in the united kingdom. members may have already noted from the official report that on several occasions conservative members have asked how many times partial-birth abortions have taken place. on each of those occasions, ministers have repeatedly confirmed that they are not aware of that procedure being used in the united kingdom. a bill therefore to prohibit its use is clearly unnecessary and a misuse of the valuable time of the house.\\n           the descriptions of the procedure, as it is supposedly carried out in the united states, are both inaccurate and misleading. descriptions such as the one we have just heard contain horrific accounts of the foetus being partially delivered while alive. it is my understanding that, on the rare occasions when intact dilatation and evacuation is carried out in the united states, the foetal heart is humanely stopped before the procedure. president clinton himself has recently vetoed attempts to ban the procedure, referring to it as a potentially life-saving, certainly health-saving, measure for a small but extremely vulnerable group of women and families.\\n           emotive, grisly descriptions of abortion procedures are often used by those who oppose abortion to shock and repulse people. the anti-choice movement considers it an important tactic because it believes that those who are pro-choice attempt to deny what is involved when a pregnancy is ended. that is not the case. those of us who support legal abortion do so because we believe that it is necessary for the well-being of the woman.\\n           it seems that the bill proposed by the hon. member for batley and spen (mrs. peacock) is an attempt to reintroduce the topic of abortion to the house. she may expect that the emphasis on the details of that technique—her version—will attract support for further legislation to limit the availability of legal abortion. the present abortion law was accepted as necessary by a majority of both houses in 1990. nothing has changed since to justify any amendment.\\n           abortion at any stage of pregnancy is performed only after careful consideration and within the grounds permitted by law. late abortions are often of wanted pregnancies, terminated because a severe foetal abnormality has been detected. those women are especially vulnerable and it is important that when decisions are taken by doctors about the management of their care, they are free to act in the best interests of their patients.\\n           when, earlier this year in another place, lord braine introduced a private member's bill to prohibit partial-birth abortion, it was opposed by the british medical association and the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists. those organisations support the view, which has also been expressed by ministers in response to questions on the matter, that methods of abortion are a matter of clinical judgment.\\n           as the procedure referred to as intact dilatation and evacuation is not used in this country, the bill that the hon. lady seeks leave to introduce would not affect abortion practice directly. it would, however, undermine the principle that a clinician should have freedom to choose the method of abortion most appropriate to a specific clinical situation.\\n           that could interfere with doctors' ability to act in the interests of their patients. a gynaecologist or obstetrician could be convicted of a criminal offence, even when his or her peers considered the actions taken to be the safest and most appropriate management of an abortion. the clinical decisions taken by doctors could be influenced by their fear of prosecution. that would be an unacceptable outcome, and i ask the house to oppose the motion.\\n            question put,

i presented the bill, i thank those hon. members on both sides of the argument for the way in which, generally, the debate has been conducted. this is a difficult issue, which rouses sensitivities, anger, bitterness, and, sometimes, even hatred. by and large, members of this house have conducted the debate in the country with great dignity and decorum, giving this issue the respect to which it is entitled. i hope that we shall be able to mirror that in the house today.\\n           fifty-nine years after the passage of the infant life preservation act and 20 years after the passage of the abortion act, it is my hope that the house will today allow this bill to proceed to commitee. public and parliamentary opinion clearly believes that, in the light of medical and scientific advances, a clear upper time limit beyond which abortion may not occur should be established.\\n           wherever we come from in this debate, be we pro-life or pro-choice, opposed to or in favour of abortion, no one can be sanguine about the nature and consequences of late abortions. that is the issue before the house today and this bill provides a vehicle for public policy to be reviewed.\\n           the existing statute regulating abortion comprises three pieces of legislation—the offences against the person act 1861, the infant life (preservation) act 1929 and the abortion act 1967. no upper time limit when abortions may occur is specified in the 1967 act. no distinction is made between late and early abortions. indeed, section 5(1) declares: nothing in this act shall affect the provisions of the infant life (preservation) act 1929. those who framed the 1929 legislation came to the question after an assize judge had before him a case in which a child had been killed shortly before the moment of birth and before it had an existence independent of its mother. it emerged that the killer could not be charged with any criminal offence, so a bill was introduced in the house of lords by one of the lords of appeal to fill the gap between abortion and murder. in framing the legislation, it was considered necessary to exclude the case where a foetus was destroyed at a time when it was not capable of being born alive, so a rule of thumb was created in section 1(2) of the act to the effect that, at any time after the 28th week of pregnancy, the child is, prima facie, assumed to be capable of being born alive.\\n           it does not seem unreasonable, 59 years after the passage of that act, to ask parliament to reconsider this rule of thumb. indeed, given the gigantic strides in medicine and technology, where medical knowledge has increased by leaps and bounds, it is incumbent on any civilised or ordered society to review its public policy and to strike a proper balance between claimed rights and responsibilities.\\n           many of us hold powerfully held convictions about the right to life over the notion that we have the right to choose to take life, but this debate is not about that. it is about what, in the judgment of individual members of parliament, the public interest requires and what people as a whole can be brought to accept as a rational solution

cause for concern.\\n           in 1967, abortion was presented almost as a panacea or as a universal remedy. in 1967, we were told that abortion would reduce illegitimacy. today, it stands at 15 per cent. and is rising. in 1967, we were told that there would be less child abuse because every child would be wanted. however, scarcely a day passed in 1987 when we did not hear of a case of a child being physically or sexually abused. in 1967, we were told that abortion would give a woman new rights. by 1987, many women and men had been emotionally and psychologically scarred and the demand for post-abortion counselling has been growing. we have learnt much in 20 years, and even more since the passage of the 1929 act.\\n           it was only in 1969—two years after the passage of my right hon. friend\\'s bill — that the science of foetoscopy really took off. in 1967, let alone in 1929, medics could not take an electrocardiogram of the baby, which shows its heartbeat and reaction to painful stimuli as its heartbeat increases. twenty years ago, it would have been impossible accurately to date the exact time of gestational development or the characteristics of the developing child. clearly, ultrasound scanning, chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis have changed all that. since 1967 we have revolutionised our awareness of the humanity of the developing child. since then, we have learned a lot also about the consequences of abortion, both for the mother and child, and for the medics as well. i am amazed that those who counsel in favour of abortion, especially so late in pregnancy, would really warn a woman of the potential physical and psychological consequences. abortion was recently described by an opponent of my bill as being as safe as having an injection of penicillin\". we must challenge the assumption that abortion is either prudent or desirable.\\n           not only are there the physical effects of invasive surgery on perfectly healthy women but there are the psychological consequences of post-abortion trauma. in 1976 the department of health and social security started to fund the manchester unit of the royal college of general practitioners which is studying the psychiatric morbidity experienced by women after an abortion. the report will be published shortly. but today the independent shows that of those surveyed 79 per cent. admitted that, if they knew that a child had quickened in the womb, they would experience a great sense of guilt if they were to carry out an abortion after that time. that is how people tick. a late abortion—when a woman has felt her child quicken, when its humanity can be in no doubt—is inevitably the most traumatic abortion of all.\\n           kathleen mcdonnell, in her book \"not an easy choice —a feminist re-examines abortion\"— i do not believe that abortion is ever an easy choice — quotes approvingly a young abortion councillor who says: yes, this is killing, there is no way around it. but i am willing to accept that. mcdonnell says: there is no escaping the fact that we have, with full consciousness, terminated life. this is most emphatically not the same as blaming ourselves or burdening ourselves with an unnecessary load of guilt. but it is simple casuistry to say, \"yes, it is killing, but, no, i will not feel any sense of guilt.\"\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988,

be subject, having had an abortion, why do counsellors advise her to have an abortion, especially so late in a pregnancy? one reason is revealed in a figure which has been provided to me by the department of health and social security. the department confirms that 32 individuals are directors or trustees of a company or a charity providing abortion counselling and are simultaneously involved in private clinics undertaking abortions. about £12 million is estimated to have passed hands in this business last year. according to the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists survey into late abortions, in one year alone 60 per cent. of the late abortions undertaken in private clinics were performed by just 11 practitioners. they and the clinics in which they work netted £2 million in

childless couples anxious to adopt.  however, private clinics are not in the business of giving support and pointing out the available options.  sadly, i only considered my own situation at the time.

important intervention. some 88 per cent. of all late abortions take place not in the national health service but in private clinics. half of the late abortions are on women from overseas, who are then duly despatched on an aeroplane back to the countries from which they came, without any care or compassion shown for them. how do we know what physical or psychological condition a woman will be in when she returns to her country? that is why there is a case to be answered. we must show compassion for the woman and the child. if there are consequences in a late abortion for a woman, there are consequences for the child as well. every country and every age will be judged by the simple test: how did they treat their people?\\n           by 18 weeks, a foetus is not just a clump of tissues, not just a blob of jelly. the child has sentience and can feel pain. if a light is shone at its mother\\'s womb, the child will react and turn away. the child has a complete skeleton and reflexes. it pumps 50 pints of blood a day. a report \"human procreation — ethical aspects of the new techniques\", published by the council for science and society — certainly not a body supporting my view—states that pain is experienced after the foetus has developed a nervous system, six weeks after pregnancy being the earliest. in november, dr. peter mccullagh, an eminent immunologist, stated that research on foetal nervous systems showed that pain could be felt at eight or nine weeks, and perhaps earlier. he said that babies could be in agony during abortions.\\n           what, under a late abortion, do we allow to happen to a child? two principal methods are used in a late abortion. of the 12 per cent. of late abortions undertaken in the nhs, the method known as prostaglandins is the most commonly used. by this method, labour is induced by drugs. the labour will be more painful than in a birth and can last for 20 hours or more. there is a chance that when prostaglandins is used the child will be born alive. to avoid this a child is usually poisoned before the abortion. because this is a long-drawn-out business, the method of late abortion used in private clinics is primarily dilatation and evacuation. by this method, the cervix is dilated and the baby\\'s body removed piece by piece. to facilitate its extraction from the womb, the skull is crushed, the spine snapped and the body removed piece by piece. an attendant nurse then has the job of reassembling the body to ensure that nothing has been left behind that might cause infection. throughout this procedure no anaesthetic is used on the child.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.17', 6, 'uk.m.10407', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'will the

about 8 per cent. of late abortions occur after an amniocentesis or another test that shows that a child will have a disability. as professor ron taylor, a supporter of the bill and the professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at london university stated in last week\\'s sunday times:  with new techniques such as chorionic villus sampling and ultrasound, discovery of such abnormalities as can be diagnosed are found much earlier than 18 weeks. it is true that not all conditions diagnosed by amniocentesis will be discovered by cvs —and cvs is not yet available everywhere. i recognise that some hon. members will wish to include an exclusion clause to allow post-l8-week abortion on the ground of disability. that is a perfectly proper issue for the committee to consider. although i personally do not support abortions on eugenic grounds, i have made it clear that even if such an exemption were placed in the bill it would still be of enormous worth.\\n           for six years before coming to the house i worked with children with special needs. it would have been a brave man or woman who would have told them that they would have been better dead. at the outset, when i announced my intention to introduce the bill, a young woman called ellen wilkie contacted me. she was born with muscular dystrophy. the doctors had told her parents that she would not live beyond her teens. ellen is now 29, she has a classics degree and writes poetry and plays. she said in her letter, more eloquently than i could say: no one can say what a disabled person will be capable of. who are we to play god? disability should not be a disqualification for life.\\n           interestingly, wednesday\\'s gallup survey of gynaecologists revealed several significant things. almost all gynaecologists questioned sought a later limit for severe handicaps, such as anencephaly or potter\\'s syndrome where the baby cannot survive. my bill contains a specific exemption for such circumstances. however, two thirds, or 68 per cent., believed that an upper limit of 18 weeks was right in the case of minor handicaps such as hare lip, club foot, or impaired hearing or sight. almost half, or 46 per cent., said that there should be no abortions for such minor handicaps. the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists called for an upper limit of 24 weeks to allow late abortion for handicap, but that suggestion had the support of 31 per cent., or less than one-third, of practising gynaecologists in britian.\\n           there are radical alternatives to utility, based on uninhibited, unqualified, unconditional love, and backed up by practical support, care and resources. that finds its bedrock in authentic human values. abortionism is defeatism — albeit a defeatism that is often born of desperation and fear. the answer can never be to kill one of the two patients who confront the doctor.\\n           let me turn to some of the other cases which have been cited by those who oppose the bill. contrary to what has been said in newspaper articles and speeches that oppose the bill, after 18 weeks, abortions are not often performed on young girls. only 4·7 per cent. of late abortions are performed on girls under 16. late abortions are not often performed on women with many previous children who cannot face the prospect of another baby. only 0·8 per cent. of abortions after 18 weeks are on women with more than four children. late abortions are not often performed on middle-aged women who may have mistaken pregnancy for the menopause. only 2 per cent. of late abortions are performed on women over 41. late abortions are not often performed in cases of pregnancy arising out of rape or when pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. during five years, only 13 late abortions, out of 40,000, were performed for one of those two reasons. the bill specifically allows for a termination of pregnancy when the mother\\'s life is at risk.\\n           we are told that 20 per cent. of late abortions result from delays in the nhs. no doubt the minister will want to say something about that. however, given that 88 per cent. of late abortions are not even performed in the nhs, that seems a curious claim. the 1984 report of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists stated that 95 per cent. of women presenting for late abortions were operated on within 14 days of first seeking advice.\\n           opponents of the bill claim that women will be forced into the back streets. the dilatation and evacuation operation that i mentioned earlier clearly could not be performed by a back-street abortionist. in other ec countries, where time limits are much lower than in the united kingdom—the average time limit in the eec is about 14 weeks—that argument has been shown to be scare mongering of the worst kind. let me re-emphasise that 88 per cent. of late abortions, or 7,270 out of 8,276, were performed under the act, which allows for social abortions.\\n           men must, of course, approach the debate with humility and sensitivity. we rarely have to suffer the practical day-to-day experience of an unwanted child. we rarely hear about unmarried fathers, only about unmarried mothers. we do not hear about men having illegitimate children, only women, and how often men smugly talk about fallen women. we never hear about fallen men.\\n           women are frequently pressurised into abortions by men. men too often leave a woman in the lurch, having used their sexuality without responsibility. those who maintain that abortion is purely a woman\\'s issue do women no service; it allows men to evade their responsibilities, and without changes in men\\'s attitudes women will not be truly liberated. men and women are involved in abortion, and all that is required to come to this debate is humanity.\\n           i believe that i have made out a case for this bill being allowed a committee stage. these arguments must then be sifted through and honed.\\n           speaking on \"woman\\'s hour\", dame josephine barnes, not a supporter of my bill, but a leading gynaecologist, said: we have far too many late abortions in this country. it is deplorable. many would share that view.\\n           i have attempted to bring forward a modest bill. which deals with only 4·8 per cent. of all abortions, but undoubtedly those which carry the gravest consequences for the mother, for the child and for the medic alike. in framing this one-clause bill, i have demonstrated a willingness to be reasonable. i have made it clear that i will not be intransigent in trying to steer through a much-needed and long overdue reform. it is in that spirit that i commend the bill to the house.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0),

grossly disabled child in the past, wish to have further children, and know that there is a one in four chance that that child might also be grossly disabled.\\n           the house will be aware that tests can only just be carried out at 18 weeks. those tests take many weeks before conclusion can be drawn and then, if need be, a traumatic and difficult decision must be made by the parents to

whatever one's view of the bill, one would have been deeply moved by the people one met there. they were not zealots or fundamentalists; they were christian, caring people who had experienced the trauma of having a grossly disabled child and did not want to repeat that tragedy. not unreasonably, they wished to have further children, which their gynaecologist told them had about a three in four chance of being disabled. they would be denied the opportunity to have an abortion if the bill is passed.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'],

member for lancaster (dame e. kellett-bowman) points out, many people have disabled children and they love them and treat them well. they are given excellent services by the local authority and the state.\\n           like the hon. member for mossley hill, i am not in favour of abortion. all i am in favour of, as a conservative, is freedom of choice for people to be able to decide. it is a traumatic decision for the parents to have an abortion—not just for the mother, but for the father as well. it does not help if politicians interfere and tell those parents whether they should go ahead with that abortion. it is up to the parents to decide whether they wish to have a grossly disabled child. i could never dream of advising them one way or the other. my wife and i are not sufficiently capable as parents to have a disabled child. to be totally honest, i could not cope with it. i have terrific admiration, as does my hon. friend the member for lancaster, for those people who are able to cope—but the decision must be theirs, not ours.\\n           another element of the bill worries me. if passed, the bill would be the worst piece of class legislation that the house has put on the statute book for many a long day. my affluent, middle-class, and, i hope, by and large intelligent, constituents would have no difficulty in arranging an abortion, either privately or elsewhere. most of those abortions, except in the case of the disabled, would be well before the 18-week limit, so they could take a very relaxed view.\\n           all hon. members have had come to their surgeries 15 or 16-year-old girls with a low iq. they are not aware of what contraception is; they are pregnant, lost and confused. often the girl does not realise for several months that she is pregnant. she is scared, frightened to speak to her parents and frightened to go to her doctor, so it is many weeks before she faces the crisis. that will be the little girl who will suffer from the bill, not my affluent constituents. we will then go back to the bad old days, briefly mentioned by the hon. member for halifax (mrs. mahon), of back-street abortions.\\n           it is only 21 years since the abortion act was introduced, but i am sure that everybody can recall the horror of back-street abortions. we are all realistic enough to know that abortions will still take place, whether legal or illegal, so it is important that they are done in modern clinics where there is good hygiene, good follow-up services and a sensitive attitude. a return to back-street abortions will mean a return to deaths and trauma, and the people who will suffer are those whom the house should most want to protect. the vulnerable, the not very intelligent and the inadequate will be driven to the backstreet abortionists, who will be laughing all the way to the bank. that would be a bad example to set.\\n           like me, many of my hon. friends would be happy for the limit to be reduced to 24 weeks. medical science has advanced immeasurably during the past 20 years so that today it is perfectly possible for a child to be born at 24 weeks. i also believe that abortions on grounds of disability need not be performed after 24 weeks, as tests for disability can be carried out earlier. what should those of us who hold that view do? i suggest that they should not support the bill, as my right hon. friend the prime minister suggested at the dispatch box yesterday. i will tell the house why. in the past few days, some of my hon. friends have said to me, \"i am totally against 18 weeks. i accept all the arguments on disability. however, i would like the limit to be reduced to 24 weeks. cannot we amend the bill in committee?\" my hon. friend the member for dorset, west (sir j. spicer) raised that point earlier.\\n           i will tell the house what will happen if hon. members who advocate a limit of 24 weeks vote for the bill today. it will get a substantial majority on second reading, which will mean—i do not object to this—that the hon. member for mossley hill will have a considerable say in the constitution of the standing committee. i suggest—i would do the same in his position—that he will pack the committee with anti-abortionists who would like to see abortion made illegal.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'],

alton) introduced his bill. he is not only my hon. friend but a friend of mine, which is not always exactly the same thing in this place. having said that, i cannot support the bill, and i wish to tell the house why.\\n           in the past few weeks, we have all been bombarded with postcards carrying enlarged photographs — me more than most, perhaps. one that i received from a constituent said: mr. steel, how do you think the human race managed to keep a balance for nearly 20 centuries without abortion? it is one of the great myths peddled by the supporters of this bill that abortion came into being with the 1967 act. the truth is that it did not. the house was motivated to change the law in 1967—mine was the seventh attempt in 15 years to use private members\\' legislation to secure reform —by the appalling record of illegal abortions in britain. no one knows the precise figures for illegal abortions, but the medical authorities vary in their estimates from 40,000 to 200,000 a year. they fell into two categories. some people could get safe and comfortable abortions—the law for the rich — because if one had money and the intelligence to find one\\'s way through all the medical specialists, one could get a quasi-legal abortion in a hospital. however, people who were not rich and intelligent went through the various back-street methods.\\n           in the 1960s the house was faced with the knowledge that between 30 and 50 women died each year as a result of criminal abortion. that was only the tip of the iceberg. many more were maimed or injured for life as a result of operations carried out in the back streets. the idea that abortion started with the 1967 act is one of the myths that we must explode.\\n           the other myth is that britain has become the abortion capital of the world and that we have a high abortion rate. i am not in favour of a high abortion rate, but the house should be aware of the facts. according to the figures for 1984—the latest that i have—our abortion rate is 12·2 per thousand women of child-bearing age. that compares with 15·2 per thousand in france, 18·4 per thousand in denmark, 19·1 per thousand in italy and 27·4 per thousand in the united states. that is not taking info account those countries that unfortunately use abortion as a method of population control. in romania, the rate is 90·9 per thousand and in the soviet union it is 181 per thousand. we need to keep a sense of perspective and recognise that, deplorable though the increase in abortions may be, our rate is by no means the highest in the world, as the opponents claim.\\n           i have never come across anyone who is pro-abortion. most of us who support the present legislation have always operated on the basis that abortion is the lesser of two evils in some circumstances. i hope that the church of england will reprint its detailed and objective report, \"abortion— an athical discussion\" published in 1965, which traces the ethics of abortion over the centuries. it said: this discussion will proceed … on the supposition that there may be cases in which, granted this general right of the foetus to live and develop, this right may be offset by other conflicting rights; and that the proper function of the criminal law is, in a restricted area, to regulate the adjustment of those rights when they cannot be, or are unlikely to be, adjusted by other means. \\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.38', 7, 'uk.m.21717', 'uk.p.LDem', 0, 'NaN', 'mp',

about to come to that point, because at that time most of the churches supported the reform of the law. since then, various churches have monitored the operation of the act and have expressed their views, which are all different. my church, the church of scotland, made it clear in a letter sent this week to all scottish members that it is a matter for individual christian consciences. the letter says: you will no doubt be aware from debates at the general assembly that there is division of opinion within the church of scotland on the issue of abortion as clearly there is throughout the country. in all of this, the church should urge that those engaged in political decisions should recognise that freedom should be given to all to act according to their conscience. i think that that approach has been broadly adopted by the church of england. different committees in the churches—and hon. members can speak for their own church—have produced different recommendations to the house.\\n           it is our task to lay down the boundary of the criminal law. it is not our task to say in what precise circumstances any individual should or should not have an abortion. the house decided in 1967, despite the fact that some hon. members argued then, as some hon. members will argue today, that we should legislate for abortion at the request of the woman, that that was not to be the basis of the 1967 act; nor is it. we did not legislate for abortion on demand.\\n           my hon. friend the member for mossley hill complains that people are running profit-making clinics and using those clinics for making money mainly from patients imported from overseas. that was not intended in the spirit of the 1967 legislation. the answer to that complaint lies in the capacity of the ministers in charge of the health departments to make regulations under the act and to say to such clinics that their licence will be withdrawn. there is no need to change the law in order to achieve the objective.\\n           i now turn to the question of late abortions. i have read again the speeches made in 1967. i said at the time that if we were to have abortion at all, it was desirable that it should be done as early as possible. i very much regret that we still have a high rate of late abortions. they happen for two reasons. one is that administrative snarl-ups in the national health service very often delay the abortion operation. that is a matter to be argued on another day. the other reason is that, sadly, many women present very late for consideration of termination of pregnancy. that is especially so in the case of those who fear or have been tested for foetal abnormality — covered by a specific clause in the 1967 act.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0,

hon. friend's bill and support the present legislation. it is not true to suggest that those who believe that this is a proper provision in the law do not care for the disabled in our midst, who deserve the full consideration that we all give them.\\n           we have had many letters from medical bodies urging us not to support the bill. more impressive than those is a short letter that i received from a constituent who said: having had a late termination (about 19–20 weeks) because it was discovered my baby had severe abnormalities i know what i am talking about. it was a disturbing event for me but not as bad as giving birth after 9 months to a baby the doctors said would not have lived anyway. parents must have the choice to make their own decision in cases like this.  i know i personally could not have coped with a full term baby being born like this. i have had a healthy daughter since this tragic event but i am sure i would never have had the courage to become pregnant again if i knew that i would have to go 9 months and not be offered a late termination had the baby had the same abnormalities. that letter is the answer to those who say that it is uncaring or unheeding to consider the termination of pregnancy in such circumstances. nobody is forced to require this if that person does not believe that it is right. it is simply that the criminal law allows it to happen if the doctors, the mother, the father, think that these are the right circumstances.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'],

the time limits, if that is what the hon. gentleman is asking about. my hon. friend the member for mossley hill asserted, and i have seen it in much of the literature put out in support of his bill, that other european countries have a much more restricted cut-off point in their legislation than we have. my hon. friend is misinformed in this matter, because that is not so. the laws of most of our european neighbours are different from ours because they establish in their legislation two degrees of abortion. they allow abortion on request of the mother up to a certain limited stage.\\n           i have a list which illustrates that. sweden allows abortion on request of the mother up to 18 weeks, but after that it is for serious medical or social reasons. in denmark, abortion is on request up to 12 weeks, but after that it can be for social or medical reasons. in norway it is on request up to 12 weeks and after that it is on the doctor's decision. france allows abortion on request up to 12 weeks but allows it up to 24 weeks on medical grounds. in italy it is allowed for various reasons that are established during the first three months, and after that it is allowed for the woman's health or for foetal abnormality.\\n           therefore, one sees that other countries have approached their law in a different way and the cut-off points mentioned by the promoters of the bill are not cutoff points at all. they are the dividing line between abortion on demand and other categories of abortion that come later. because we have not approached abortion in that way, we do not have a cut-off point and it is unfair to make comparisons with the cut-off points in other legislation.\\n           the committee of inquiry, under mrs. justice lane, into the working of abortion recommended that there should be a restriction of abortion to 24 weeks. that has been endorsed by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists. in 1967 we did not establish a 28-week limit but simply took the existing law, the infant life (preservation) act 1929 as the basis for the cut-off limit. there is no cut-off limit in the 1967 act and the law of england and wales is established as in 1929. it is similar in scotland. i think that it is fairly common ground that medical science has moved on, and that it is possible for foetuses born as early as 24 weeks to survive. that is why i support, as do the prime minister and the leader of the opposition — although that may not be an argument that commends it to the house—the 24-week limit.\\n           my hon. friend's bill seeks to do something very different from that. it does not seek to establish an 18-week limit. that is because, every time a legal limit is set down, the actual medical practice allows two weeks for safety. in medical practice, the present 28-week limit is a 26-week limit. if the house establishes a statutory 24-week limit, in medical practice it would be a 22-week limit. the bill does not seek to establish an 18-week limit because it talks about the beginning of the 18th week. that is a 17-week limit and in medical practice will mean a limit of 15 weeks.\\n           i do not have the slightest doubt that, if the bill were to pass into legislation, it would make a major difference to the operation of the abortion law and would deprive thousands of women of the opportunity to go to their medical practitioner and consider the case for termination of pregnancy. as i have said, i do not think that it is for us to tell women in particular circumstances, or their doctors, that they should or should not have an abortion. the bill would cause deprivation and for that reason it should be opposed.\\n           i agree with the point, perhaps not made very judiciously, by the hon. member for berkshire, east (mr. mackay) that the promoter of the bill is entitled to choose the members of his committee. there is no doubt that the bill would not be substantially altered in committee. but it will have to come back to us and we could alter it on report. i have a bigger objection than that to voting for the bill. the second reading should be a vote on the principle of the bill. the principle of the bill is not about tinkering with the upper medical limit as recommended by mrs. justice lane or the royal college. it is a fundamental change to the abortion act 1967, and that is why i oppose it.\\n           finally, we are meeting at a time when, whether we are for or against the bill, we are all concerned that, if at all possible, there should be a lower level of abortions. it is tragic that this year the family planning services, funded by the national health service, are facing cuts. i am told that this very day the central birmingham district health authority is negotiating with the brook advisory centre for further cuts for the next three years, which will result in a 40 per cent. reduction in that centre's activities in the city of birmingham.

when a similar bill has secured a second reading and has done so on the basis of principle, all have foundered because of procedural devices at one stage or another and because of lack of time. that is sad, because we know that there was and is now a substantial majority in the country in favour of abortion reform.\\n           for over 20 years, i have been concerned at the way in which a civilised country such as ours has permitted, and indeed encouraged, the deliberate destruction every year of 150,000 unborn babies, most of whom, if born, would have been perfectly normal, healthy children. that was the point on which my hon. friend the member for pembroke (mr. bennett) sought to gain a response from the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale (mr. steel), but the right hon. gentleman misunderstood it. that point remains unanswered, but perhaps i shall be able to develop it a little later.\\n           abortion presents a dreadful dilemma for all of us, whatever view we take of the bill. in cases where the mother's life is in danger or where there are indications of grave and permanent damage to the child if born, the majority accept that termination is justified. however, such tragic circumstances account for only a minute proportion of the total number of abortions carried out under the 1967 act. of the 2·6 million unborn babies destroyed up to the end of 1986, only 123 had to be sacrificed to save the mother's life. the overwhelming majority were authorised on social grounds—and many of us know precisely what that means: abortion on demand.\\n           the bill will not change that situation greatly. the hon. member for mossley hill is not proposing something that will tear up the 1967 act or change the position in any material way. however, i readily concede that it will change the climate and affect our attitudes to abortion generally in important ways.\\n           it follows then that the overwhelming proportion of late abortions are performed on babies which if born, would have been normal healthy children. there is only one word for that in my book, and that is murder.\\n           i agree that there is no magic about 18 weeks. the early stages of human life are part of a continuum as, indeed, are our own lives after birth. well before 18 weeks, the foetus is recognisably human. the hon. member for mossley hill touched on that, and it should be basic to our understanding of what the bill is about.\\n           an article in the british medical journal of 26 january 1980 put the facts very clearly. i read the article at the time and have kept it. it states: nine weeks after conception, the baby is well enough formed to bend his fingers round an object in the palm of his hand, in response to a touch on the sole of his foot he will curl his toes or bend his hips and knees to move away from the touching object. at 12 weeks he can close his fingers and thumb and he will open his mouth in response to pressure applied at the base of the thumb. at first when his hands touch his mouth the foetus turns his head away though his mouth opens. later the foetus may turn his head towards his hands and even put a finger into his open mouth and stick it. \\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.47', 7, 'uk.m.10519',

not give way because there will be plenty of opportunity for hon. members to speak, but only if we restrain ourselves on interventions.\\n           the facts are that at 12 to 14 weeks the auditory system of the foetus is complete. at 18 weeks it can certainly recognise its mother\\'s voice and reacts to light as well as to sound. it has learnt to put its hands before its eyes to shield them from moving light or over its ears to protect them against loud noise.\\n           yet, although the miracle of human life has developed to that point at 18 weeks, the human foetus has no rights at that stage. our abortion law, unlike those of other civilised countries, permits thousands of perfectly normal healthy children of that gestation to be destroyed, not that i consider gestational age to be of great importance when considering the moral implications of abortion, or even of viability.\\n           there is precious little sense on this subject where our existing law is concerned. as has been said, procuring an abortion at 28 weeks has been recognised since 1929 as the crime of \"child destruction\". however, we now know that at 23 or 24 weeks babies born prematurely are capable of surviving, and do so survive. the only difference between babies born at 24 weeks, or for that matter after 28 weeks, and those born at 18 weeks, is that the latter are smaller. almost everything else is the same.\\n           therefore, the question that the bill\\'s opponents must face is surely, \"why should it not also be a crime to destroy an unborn baby at the gestational age of 18 weeks?\" that question must be answered, because late abortions, the outlawing of which is the purpose of the bill, clearly involve the destruction of sentient human beings, who not only react to outside stimuli and can feel pain, but who have none of the protection that they would have only a few weeks later. where is the logic and the morality of that? the question must be answered by those who oppose the bill.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.49', 2, 'uk.m.10649', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', ' rose —\\n        ',

        it is a lottery as to whether or not, because of the late stage of its development, the baby of 18 weeks or more will be aborted in the most cruel way with its limbs torn from its body and its head crushed, as many doctors and nurses have testified. that revolting procedure — the house must face up to what late abortion really means — is described in detail by dr. margaret white, a general practitioner, magistrate and very distinguished member of the general medical council, in her book entitled \"two million silent killings\". she explains that with late abortions, the baby is already of a size and its bones have hardened to such an extent that: with the pliers the baby is torn limb from limb and pulled out in pieces. the skull is crushed, as it is much too large and too firm to be pulled out intact. it is the unpleasant duty of the nurse to assemble the broken parts of the body, to be sure that no pieces are left behind in the womb. at that stage, too, the mother is not unaffected. some of the most poignant letters i have received over the years have been from women pressurised into abortions. long afterwards, they suffer both physical and emotional damage. only last week i received a letter from one of my constituents, whom i do not know. she had previously had an abortion and then had another, this time at 19 weeks. she wrote: i did not do it lightly—nevertheless, i made the choice —the wrong one. it was so easy to get an abortion. if i had known the true facts of what happens to the baby being aborted, i would definitely never have had it done. also if the abortion bill limited it to 18 weeks then my child would be alive today. it has left a scar forever. may i now deal with what is probably the most emotive argument about the bill and one that is often misrepresented. the hon. member for mossley hill has made it clear that the bill will not affect termination of pregnancies where severe disability incompatible with sustaining life has been diagnosed, and i am glad that he has done that. indeed, the bill will protect those babies whose disability is compatible with life and is treatable. we have to be careful to distinguish between the two.\\n           some of the most gifted, delightful and lovable people in our society were born handicapped and might have been deprived of the right to live if their abnormality had been detected before birth as it can be nowadays. in our hearts all of us know that to be true. who among us would not have been moved by the story in the times on 20 january about the award of the whitbread book of the year prize to a young spastic boy who can neither speak nor hear well? he cannot move himself, and types with a stick attached to his forehead. he used his acceptance speech,

treads upon his brother and silences him before he can draw one breath of this world's fresh air? those of us who support the bill must be sensitive—i believe that i am sensitive—to the views of those who want to be sure that it will not bar the way to termination in those cases where it can be established that the handicap is likely to be so severe that the child, if born, would be incapable of sustaining life in any meaningful sense. here, medical technology—some of us have been watching it closely in recent years—comes to our aid. it has certainly not stood still since the abortion act became law 21 years ago.\\n           many of the disabilities that opponents of the bill regularly cite as requiring the test of amniocentesis can now be detected much earlier, indeed as early as the eighth of 10th week of pregnancy, by a variety of methods. we may have to find—i am ready to join in the search—a formula that will safeguard the position of a woman for whom tests have begun before the 18th week but which for some reason are not complete before that time. that is a matter to which we must address ourselves in committee. that is the message i have received from many of my right hon. and hon. friends.\\n           i know that we are being told by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, the british medical association and other learned bodies that they are opposed to the bill. however, before we fall over ourselves in considering the weight of their opinion, it is important for the house to realise that it is not shared by the majority of gynaecologists. a recent survey of about 700 gynaecologists, accounting for 40 per cent. of all those involved in that specialty in britain, revealed that one third supported the recommendation of the royal college and the bma that the upper limit for abortion should be 24 weeks, but a substantial majority, nearly two in three—64 per cent. — would like to see the upper limit for abortion reduced from 28 weeks to 20 weeks or less with exceptions made when the mother's life is in danger or for severe foetal abnormality.\\n           there is much more i should like to say, but there are many others who wish to speak. let me emphasise once again that the bill does not undermine the essential principles of the 1967 act. as one who has a vivid memory of the debates in 1966 and 1967, i must echo what was said by the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale that it was never his intention, nor was it the intention of parliament at the time, to legislate for what we have today, which is virtually abortion on demand.\\n           it is right to consider what should be done about babies likely to be born with severe handicaps, but in our compassion for all who are likely to suffer from some handicap, we should not allow ourselves to forget that the overwhelming majority of babies being aborted at present at 18 weeks or later would, if born and not destroyed because they are momentarily inconvenient, be perfectly normal, healthy children. those children, too, cry out for our compassion. for that reason alone, the bill deserves the support of the house.\\n

today. i am aware that the time is limited. moreover, i am a statistician as a result of part of my medical training and i know that statistics can be manipulated by people who are not experts to say whatever they like, and can be manipulated even more readily by those who are experts. therefore, it is specious to quote reams of data at each other today.\\n           i should like to go back to the start of my medical career, when i was a student in 1968. that is when i first experienced the workings of the abortion act 1967. the first girl i saw was 15 years old. she did not really know what it was all about and she did not understand what happened. she just knew that she wanted to go back to a normal life and that she did not want to bear a child, and she did not. the other woman was in her early 40s with a large number of children. she could not face the reality of bearing another child and she, too, was relieved of that burden. that is what the 1967 act gave women in this country. it gave them an element of choice.\\n           having started clinical work in 1968, i have no direct experience of illegal abortions. illegal abortions in this country effectively ended with the passing of the 1967 act. i have heard plenty of reports from older doctors and nurses about what went on before, and i do not want to see a return to that.\\n           i believe that the bill concerns certain basic principles. first, is abortion a moral or an ethical thing to do? if so, who should decide whether an abortion should be carried out? thirdly, what constraints should society place on that decision — i believe that the sponsor of the bill would like us to believe that that is the major concern of his bill.\\n           i believe that abortion is both moral—that is, right for the individual woman to decide upon—and ethical: it is a correct procedure for a doctor to perform at a woman\\'s request. at present, the decision to carry out an abortion is given to the medical profession alone to make, at the request of the woman. i believe that a change in that practice is long overdue. the constraints relate to the reason for the abortion and the age of the foetus at the time the abortion is carried out. surely those two issues are the nub of the argument today.\\n           we all agree that there should be an upper limit beyond which an abortion, the destruction of a foetus, cannot and should not take place. at present, the law places that limit at 28 weeks and medical practice effectively places it at 26 weeks. the bill would reduce that limit to 18 weeks, or, as has been clearly illustrated, effectively closer to 16 weeks. i believe that that would be wrong, and my belief is supported by the vast majority of my profession, and, i believe, by society.\\n           i could quote reams of examples about this matter—conversations i have had with women, women i have treated or whom i have referred for an abortion during my medical career. i could quote letters that i have received from my colleagues in branches of our profession —including gynaecologists—pointing out the damage that will be done not only to women who are at risk to bearing a handicapped foetus — i accept that they are the minority—but to many young women if the bill is passed. by young, i do not mean girls under 16. for many girls under the age of 21 — single, possibly of low intelligence and in desperate social circumstances—the possibility of having a child is a serious prospect —handicapped or not. for many women who have already borne children, a further burden may be more than they are prepared to bear and more than society should expect them to bear.\\n           women have complex reasons for delaying the decision that they take to seek an abortion. i believe that the law should reflect that and should give them the chance to come forward at a later stage, post 18 weeks. i do not see any case for depriving them of their right to undergo an abortion if they so choose. i believe that their rights supersede those of the foetus at the developmental stage that we are discussing.\\n           i do not believe that we should be in the business of bringing more and more unwanted children into our society. i believe that, ultimately, a woman must have the last say on whether she wants to bear a handicapped child. it is a specious argument to look at handicapped children who exist now and say that it would be wrong to kill them. of course it would be wrong, but it is right and proper for the woman and her husband to be able to make the choice: \"i will not bear a handicapped child.\" we are in danger of taking away that right. we are not taking away the right of an already born handicapped child to live. those children are entitled to all the compassion, understanding and help that society can give. so often, society does not offer that help because we are not prepared to put the money into that care.\\n           i believe that it is high time that we looked at the workings of the 1967 act. for what it is worth, my view is that women should have open access to abortion and, if we must use the pejorative term, to \"abortion on demand\". i call it \"abortion on request\" and it should be carried out up to an agreed stage of about 12 weeks. i believe that, on the present grounds, women should be entitled to have an abortion up to roughly 24 weeks.\\n           the system also needs overhauling. it is a system that lets girls down and does not give them the armament they need to make the decisions that would stop a pregnancy in the first place. we need to look at the availability of facilities for abortion, to ensure that women do not have to experience the delays that we know occur in many areas. above all, we need to look at our attitude towards women and women\\'s rights.\\n           it is time for a formal review of the system, not some ad hoc measure brought before the house in the form of a private member\\'s bill. we need something along the lines of the warnock commission report on which we will have an opportunity to vote later in the session. that is the correct, reasonable and civilised way in which to bring about a change in the law on abortion, and i believe that that is long overdue.\\n           the bill is not the way to make a reasoned change in the 1967 act. frankly, i do not trust the bill or its supporters to accept any amendment. they are not in the business of providing compromises, they are in the business of stopping abortion at 18 weeks. i do not trust them and i hope that others who have listened to this debate will likewise vote against the bill to defeat it today.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'],

[an hon. member: \"what about mencap?\"] figures can be bandied about, but the arguments given by all the organisations are balanced for and against.\\n           the argument often used against the bill is that a woman has the right to choose. we have never been so well informed about contraception as we are today, so woman has the right to choose not to become pregnant. once she has become pregnant she does not have an automatic right to destroy the child in her womb, the child has rights too. the child has rights in law. there have been cases in which people have sued on behalf of the unborn child and won.\\n           choice should not be given only to one person. there is no one to speak for the child but us. we have a heavy responsibility in that regard. because the child\\'s

mackay) who first spoke against the motion. he spoke about not trusting those on the committee if the bill were passed today, and he made tremendous play on the question of choice. representing people in the province who have voted in different ways for choice, and he represents the northern ireland office which does not listen to the choice of the voters, he had fair gall in making that point.\\n

clause to that effect. therefore, i take this opportunity to repeat that, by and large, the bulk of people in northern ireland, irrespective of their religious outlook or political convictions, have no desire to see the 1967 act extended to northern ireland.\\n           today we are debating the alton bill. the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale (mr. steel), the leader of

motive which is not on the face of the bill, thus departing from the principle of the bill. for that reason he was basically arguing against himself. i understood that he agreed with a reduction in the upper age limit for abortions. that is the principle of the bill, and i support it.\\n           i welcomed several of the quiet arguments against the bill which have put on the record issues which must be faced. however, we are debating in a moral climate which must be understood. we have moved into a moral climate where it is tempting to call evil good. a decade ago, for example,

for fight alton\\'s bill.\\n           many people who may have an open mind on abortion are nevertheless convinced that we should have better counselling which gives people a choice. i represent a constituency where, thanks to the fine work of the life movement, carers have provided a hostel where young women are given a choice and the back-up to make that choice calmly, rather than being drawn into the mentality of what i call this disposable generation.\\n           when we speak of choice we must also remember the choice for life of those who have the potential for life. it is ludicrous to spend millions of pounds, correctly in my judgment, on helping doctors in perinatal cases to give youngsters a chance of life and at the same time to create a climate of opinion which has allowed nearly 3 million human beings with potential to be denied such a choice.\\n           for those reasons, i support the principle of the bill and i leave it to the committee to work out the points of

poll of gynaecologists, but it was a dishonest poll. it did not refer to spina bifida, which is one of the most serious disabilities that can be detected principally by ultrasound scanning after 18 weeks. the bill lacks compassion. why should mothers be forced to carry a child with spina bifida, when 70 per cent. of such children die in agony before five, and have to be sedated because of their

for parliament to decide whether it wishes to pass another bill. that is democracy. that is what the law is about.\\n           on the argument about the right to choose, what about the rights of the unborn child? since it cannot exercise those rights for itself, is it not the job of the elected parliament to exercise them on its behalf? it is the job of parliament to protect the rights of the unborn child, and it is the right of parliament to legislate on the matter.\\n           i have heard all the arguments against the bill. some have already been exercised this morning and more will be exercised as the day proceeds. some are perfectly valid arguments, but some are absolute rubbish, including the suggestion that if the bill became law we would return to back-street abortions. before 1967, back-street abortions were usually carried out earlier in the pregnancy, not after 18 weeks. as nearly 50 per cent. of abortions that take place after 18 weeks are carried out on women who are shipped to britain by air and sea because they cannot obtain abortions in their own countries, britain has become the country of back-street abortions for the rest of europe. in 1986, of the 8,276 abortions after 18 weeks, 3,688 were carried out on women who came to britain from abroad.\\n           the opponents of the bill tell us that many late abortions are carried out on girls aged under 16 who were scared or did not recognise their pregnancy. that is absolute rubbish. the fact is that, in 1986, only 4·7 per cent. of abortions on residents from 18 weeks onwards were on girls aged under 16.\\n           one thing is certain: 88 per cent. of abortions after 18 weeks are carried out in private clinics for private profit. it is staggering to hear what labour members say about the bill. all these people who are supposed to be ardent socialists want to propagate a system that allows abortion for private profit—in private clinics not on the nhs—with millions of pounds changing hands. that is the system which these marvellous socialists, on the front bench as well as the back benches, want to propagate. what sort of socialists are they? they talk rubbish.\\n           we are told that 18 weeks was picked out of the air. by 18 weeks, a foetus is fully formed, with all major organs, except its lungs, functioning.\\n           what of the handicapped child? i confess that that is the most difficult area to defend, but first let me deal with a fact which the hon. member for bolton, north-east (mr. thurnham) refused to acknowledge. in 1986, of 8,276 abortions after 18 weeks, only 7·8 per cent. were performed because the child was likely to be born handicapped. despite all their pious speeches in defence of the handicapped, hon. members ignore the 92 per cent. who were denied life because they were aborted after 18 weeks. they refuse to face that fact.\\n           it must be wrong to discriminate against an individual at any stage of life simply because he or she does not meet the standards of physical or mental perfection set by others. we who support the bill are accused of a lack of compassion. is it compassionate to take the life of a handicapped child? i repeat that 92 per cent. of abortions after 18 weeks are carried out not because the child was likely to be born handicapped. of the remaining 7·8 per cent. of abortions some would continue to be allowed under the bill. most abnormalities can be detected in fewer than 18 weeks—indeed, in 10 weeks—with the results being made available after a maximum of two weeks. indeed, i put it to the minister that a death certificate should be issued after an abortion that is carried out after 18 weeks stating the precise cause of death.\\n           i support the bill because i believe in human life. as the right hon. member for castle point (sir b. braine) said, abortion after 18 weeks is murder in the womb.\\n           my right hon. friend the member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale (mr. steel) said that he was not sure about the view of the church of england. he quoted the church of england when introducing his bill. yesterday, i and other hon. members received a letter saying that the general synod of the church of england —i hope that i have the correct figures—voted by 247 to two in favour of the bill. if it was right for my right hon. friend to quote the church of england in 1965, it is right for me to quote it in 1988. again, 66 per cent. of gynaecologists were in favour. some hon. members may shout, \"it was phoney. how many were done?\" we can all quote those who are in favour. opponents of the bill quote the bma. i do not want to embarrass my right hon. friend — that has never been part of my function — but, in 1970, he said: they\"— that is, doctors— cannot dictate to parliament what should be the provisions of an abortion act.\"—[ official report, 13 february 1970; vol. 795, c. 1693.] of course, that was when they were agin him. now that they are for him—at least, he thinks that they are for him—he is in favour of quoting the bma and doctors. but the gynaecologists\\' opinion poll — it was a representative sample — showed that well over 60 per cent. were in favour of today\\'s bill.\\n           a child is entitled to have life. a child is entitled to be given the right to breathe, the right to love and the right to live. i am not a roman catholic, but i claim to be a christian. this is a matter of human and christian concern. that is why i hope that the bill will be given a second reading and why i commend it to the house.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.90', 745, 'uk.m.21695', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'the hon. member for rochdale (mr. smith) seemed to imply that abortion was available on demand. if that is so, the existing law is being broken, and action can be taken. like other hon. members, i dislike abortion. i am naturally prejudiced against it. nevertheless, i shall vote against the bill.\\n           what matters is not so much what i think or whether i am for or against abortion, but in what medical and social circumstances should abortion be allowed. if the law does not appear to be reasonable, there is bound to be a reversion to back-street abortionists, with all the health dangers that that implies. on the one hand, the law should discourage abortion, but, on the other hand, it should accept medical realities and be merciful towards social realities. in short, the law must represent a balance, and the abortion act 1967 succeeded in doing that.\\n           on the basis of what information i as a layman have been able to gather since the matter came up for discussion again, i agree with the hon. member for kirkcaldy (dr. moonie). in a perfect world, there is much to be said for freedom of choice up to 12 weeks, but thereafter abortion should be allowed up to 24 weeks but only for medical reasons. the trouble is that we do not live in a perfect world.\\n           if every young girl were intelligent, decisive, understanding, aware and rich and could effectively communicate with her parents, if every woman over 40 who became pregnant without wishing to do so realised immediately what happened, if every woman at times of stress could be rational, if the national health service were perfect, and if doctors were infallible in judgment and opinion, the restrictions to 12 and 24 weeks might be acceptable. but that is not the world in which we live. we live in a world in which some women of all ages are frightened, unwise, indecisive, uncertain, anguished, full of second thoughts, and impoverished, and in which the national health service and, occasionally, doctors are not perfect.\\n           a 12-week limit on freedom of choice would be too restrictive and would be certain to lead to more illegal abortions. a 24-week limit for medical reasons could rule out a small number of the most necessary abortions.\\n           we have been reminded by the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale (mr. steel) that, in any case, the 1967 act operates in conjunction with the infant life (preservation) act 1929. that act is the source of the 28-week limit and presumes that a foetus of 28 weeks is capable of being born alive. however, if it can be shown that a foetus of a lower age-27 weeks or even less—is similarly capable and is aborted, an offence would have been committed, because the life of a child capable of being born alive would have been destroyed.\\n           the 1929 act appears to me to be very strong. i have been reminded by the library that it draws a firm distinction between capable of being born alive and capable of surviving\". it may be the case that, apart from healthy babies, some handicapped babies are capable of being born alive\", but are not capable of surviving for more than a brief period. none the less, if they were capable of being born alive\", an offence could be committed if such a foetus were aborted.\\n           the 1929 act is very strong. it should be a reassurance to those who are worried about apparently late abortions. furthermore, it should not be forgotten that, under the 1967 act, the minister for health can make regulations. indeed, the current regulations no longer license private clinics to carry out abortions over 24 weeks, and those carrying out abortions over 20 weeks must be specially approved.\\n           a doctor must, therefore, act with the greatest care in respect of any late abortions— probably those over 20 weeks—for fear of transgressing the law. in addition, if it is judged necessary, it is always possible for the dhss to introduce still more stringent regulations.\\n           thus, it seems to me far better to leave well alone. the grounds for abortion set out in the 1967 act are, in my judgment, much more precise than the grounds in this bill. the flexibility of the 1967 act, coupled with the 1929 act, provides a balance between the interests of the mother and those of the unborn child. i shall, therefore, vote against the

position. we are talking about people who claim the right to impose their conscience on other people whose conscience says otherwise. there are people who say in conscience that there should be no abortion but who introduce a bill that says that abortion can be allowed up to 18 weeks. where are the morality, conscience and ethics of that? it is a fudge and a muddle, and it is leading to a

deliberately put in a provision that says that abortion would be al lowed up to 28 weeks only if the child would be born dead. the hon. gentleman has the cheek—because, as he tells us, he taught

this talk of care and love for disabled children. as has been said, residential homes all over the country are full of disabled children for whom no one cares. the divorce rate of couples who bear disabled children is high — and who is left to care for those children? the women.\\n           let us be clear about the existing law. there has been a lot of pretence and falsity about it. the law provides that it is an offence to abort a foetus capable of being born alive. as medical technology has changed and it has become possible to preserve the life of babies born very early, naturally the law and practice have changed. the number of post-24-week abortions has diminished massively as it has become possible to preserve the life of 24-week babies.\\n           i wonder whether hon. members really know about 24-week-old babies. only 15 per cent. of them survive, and a third of them are brain-damaged. those babies are on the very brink of life. the units that do such lovely work and care for those precious babies attempt to preserve their lives. the babies are kept in plastic boxes with tubes in their bodies. there is much evidence now that if they do survive they are emotionally hurt and damaged because they are not nurtured and cuddled in the way that babies need. they are on the brink of life, and medical practice already takes account of their survival rate.\\n           two thirds of post-24-week abortions are for severe foetal abnormalities. the bill does not provide for that, but we are told that it will be adjusted in committee. we are told about the other hard cases. many involve very young girls who have been sexually abused in their families. they do not know that they are pregnant, or do not reveal it until late, and so have abortions after 24 weeks. we are told about menopausal women who have brought up their families and loved them and do not realise that they are pregnant — they think that their periods have stopped because of the menopause. such women would be forced by hon. members who claim to know better about their lives, their bodies and their families to bear those children. it is a disgrace. let me say to hon. members who believe in a 24-week limit that we already have that limit with exceptions. that is the practice now. i should like to see some changes, as there is no doubt that late abortions take place unnecessarily.\\n           i should like to say something about private clinics. in my region, which is one of the worst in the country, many doctors and nurses in the national health service refuse to perform abortions to which women are entitled legally, so women go to charitable clinics to get their legal rights. no one makes any profit whatsoever, and the work is done with care, in the interests of the lives of those women. the cheap, snide remarks about people performing abortions for profit are not true. the issue is too important for such cheapskate lies to be thrown about the

new right. the growing new right in britain is saying that women should stay at home and bear children and care for elderly and disabled people. they are not in favour of public expenditure; they want

of the bill wanted a 24-week limit with exceptions and wanted to prevent late abortions beyond that limit, he would have brought in a different bill. there is much that we can do. we could have, as many other countries have, self-referral up to 12 weeks. many women have abortions post-12 weeks because of delays in the national health service. the health service should be required to plan for the number of woman who will come for abortions so that the current delays will be reduced. such things could be done to prevent late abortions. we have a 24-week limit, with exceptions for very hard cases.\\n           a bill is to come from the house of lords which will enable us to have that position. if today's bill is voted for, we will have an 18-week limit, which really means 16 weeks, with no exception for foetal abnormality unless the child would die. we are told that concessions may be made in committee, but if the bill is passed with a large majority the committee will be dominated

point. this matter is sensitive and controversial. the abortion act 1967 was of great importance, and the leader of the liberal party, the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale (mr. steel) deserves full credit for what he did then. the act removed many social ills which we all hated and has given us 20 years of comparative stability in dealing with the problems and arguments that go on.\\n           hon. members can set an example on this matter by moving ahead with consensus. it is apparant that the debate on the bill is not producing that. it has been said that the various alternatives could be fully discussed in committee. we all know what happens with the composition of private member's bills committees—without any disrespect to the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton)—and we know the difficulties of taking up on report matters which have been fully debated in committee, but that is part of our constitutional proceedings. if the bill goes through second reading to committee, it will be extremely difficult to debate any other position in the house.\\n           we have a great opportunity to look at the problem from the point of view of moving ahead with consensus. the hon. gentleman has not disguised the fact that, because of his religious beliefs, he is entirely opposed to abortion. the position of the synod of the church of england has been mentioned. i am a member of the church of england and i understand that position, but i cannot help noting that there is much picking and choosing as to which view of the synod of the church of england one accepts on a particular subject.\\n           however, allowing for that, i am aware of the religious beliefs that are expressed and held most strongly. crusades do not always lead to the most desirable results, as we know from history. above all, they lead to considerable intolerance. it is essential that we in this house should be tolerant of those outside whose ethical and religious views do not coincide with our own, and on this subject, there are a considerable number of our fellow citizens whose views do not coincide with our own.\\n           the 1967 act was based on a combination of provisions from the infant life (preservation) act 1929 and new provisions. the way ahead on the basis of consensus is now very clear. the 1929 act could be amended to give a limit of 24 weeks, which would in fact mean 22 weeks. such a proposal would gain the support of the whole medical profession, as cited in opinion polls and on television. according to all my inquiries, the medical profession accepts that a limit of 24 weeks—in practice 22 weeks — would deal with the advances in medicine over the past 20 years and at the same time with the practical arrangements available for dealing with these problems. if the house had been able to give a lead with a bill containing that proposal, that bill would have gained overall agreement and we could then have moved forward to another period.\\n           the particular problems mentioned, such as that of private clinics, need to be dealt with in some other way. they are controversial in themselves and are not affected by the bill. the problem of private clinics can be dealt with separately, through the health service or, if the house so wishes, by legislation. my greatest concern is that, after 20 years of stability, we should now take advantage of the advances in medicine and the practical arrangements that can be made—which in some cases may be lacking—to take a further step forward. i wish that that had been the purpose of the bill. as it is not, i shall oppose the bill, although i shall strongly support any bill from another place that reduces the limit to 24 weeks—in effect 22 weeks. that would gain the overall acceptance of the medical profession, of whose advice the house should take great note.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'],

conflicting views; it is correspondingly difficult for any minister to speak in a debate such as this. in his opening speech, the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton), fairly acknowledged the difficulties of the subject. he also stated clearly, and i thought rightly, that the bill does not itself set out to challenge the principle of legal abortion. he rightly made it clear that he thinks that abortion should not be legal, but he recognises that it is; indeed, a large part of his case rested on the fact that he did not propose to reverse the basic position. the hon. gentleman presented the bill as one that attempts not to return to the pre-1967 position but to modify the working of the law to make it more acceptable to the substantial body of opinion—whatever its exact size, none of us can dispute that it is substantial —that is affronted by the scale of abortion in recent years, and particularly by abortion at a relatively late stage in pregnancy. he argued that the gain from achieving a change in the balance would outweigh the contrary arguments adduced in the debate.\\n           i would say to the hon. member for birmingham, ladywood (ms. short) that the hon. gentleman is at least entitled to seek the judgment of the house on the proposal that he has put before it, rather than on what is in his mind but which he has not brought before the house.\\n           i think that the house already knows that which i must state clearly, that the government have no collective view on the merits of the proposal by the hon. member for mossley hill. the considerations involved are clearly both moral and practical. some hon. members will see the moral considerations as overriding, while others will see as paramount the practical considerations. i think it is fair to say that most hon. members who have spoken will not see the matter in such a clear-cut way, but will want to strike a balance between the two conflicting sets of considerations. at the end of the day, each hon. member will have to decide for himself or herself what the balance should be and how we should vote on the bill.\\n           in such a debate, my role as minister for health is not to speak for the government in the ordinary sense, but to set before the house such advice as i can give from the advice available to me, which i think might help hon. members to make a decision. i must necessarily concentrate on the practical issues, because being minister for health gives me no special status to advise others on matters of conscience or morality.\\n           first, i shall comment on the legal position. it has been clearly recognised in the debate that the bill represents a clear change in principle from the abortion legislation introduced by the right hon. member for tweeddale, ettrick and lauderdale and passed in 1967. that is because the abortion act 1967 contains no upper limit for the gestational age at which an abortion may be performed. it must be accepted as a matter of law that to introduce such a limit is to introduce a distinct and new concept compared with the present position.\\n           as hon. members have said, the infant life (preservation) act 1929 applies in england and wales and protects any foetus capable of being born alive. it also contains a rebuttable presumption, and the fact that it is rebuttable is significant. it is that a foetus of 28 weeks gestation is capable of being born alive. as the house knows, in the light of our capacity to keep very young infants alive, the government have given their support, and similar support has just been echoed by my right hon. friend the member for old bexley and sidcup (mr. heath), for a measure currently under discussion in another place. that measure seeks to reduce the gestational age at which this presumption is made from 28 weeks to 24 weeks. however, it is a proposition of a different kind from the one that is now before the house, because the bill before the house would make illegal all abortions after the 17th completed week of pregnancy, except in cases where it was necessary to save the life of the mother or if the life of the child could not be sustained.\\n           i shall make the point a little clearer. under the infant life (preservation) act—this is why i emphasised the word \"rebuttable\" — it is open to a doctor who has performed an abortion outside the limits thought to be provided by the infant life (preservation) act to prove that the child was not capable of being born alive. the onus of proof at that point is shifted; the house ought to bear that significant point in mind.\\n           i know that many hon. members wish to speak and i shall try to keep my speech brief. i had intended to spend a few moments advising the house as clearly as i can on the views about the current capacity of a foetus to be born alive. i shall say only that i am advised that the 22nd gestational week is considered by doctors to be the earliest time at which there is the slighest possibility of a foetus being born alive, because before then the lungs are not mature enough to function, even if ventilated.\\n           the house will be aware that the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, as well as the british paediatric association, the royal college of general practitioners, the royal college of midwives and the british medical association, produced a report in 1985 on foetal viability and clinical practice. that report recommended that the age at which a foetus is considered viable should be reduced from 28 weeks to 24 weeks. earlier this year, that recommendation was confirmed by that same group of organisations when they looked again at their 1985 report.\\n           alongside the support that i have already said the government have extended to the proposition in the form of a bill—not a government bill—introduced in the other place, the department has taken a number of significant steps effectively to implement the recommendation about 24 weeks. we have done that in two ways. first —this has already been referred to, but i should make it clear — we have made it a condition of approval for private sector nursing homes that no abortions are carried out after 24 weeks. the position is less clear in the nhs, but the department has arranged for the report to be drawn to the attention of the fellows and members of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists.\\n           as has been said on several occasions, the number of abortions after 24 weeks is now very small. on the latest figures for 1986, there were 29 at the 25th week or above. hon. members will have their own views about whether a number as small as even 29 is to be dismissed, bearing in mind that we are talking about individuals who will have their own views and circumstances, including in a large number of cases the fact that by then they will know that their baby is likely to be born handicapped. however, i think all hon. members will accept that on those figures, and with the continuing likelihood of a further decline in the number of abortions occurring so late, the practical effect of introducing a 24-week limit into the abortion act would be small, according to our current experience.\\n        ',

for mossley hill pointed to the fact that many abortions at 18 weeks and over are performed on foreign women. the exact statistic is that, out of the 8,276 abortions in england and wales at 18 weeks and over in 1986, 3,688 were to non-residents. for this purpose, non-residents include women from scotland, northern ireland, the channel islands and the isle of man, as well as women from foreign countries. abortions performed on women resident in foreign countries amounted to 3,461, which was 42 per cent. of the total. the vast majority of those women came from france, spain and the irish republic.\\n           that reflects—in one case it would be more accurate to say that it reflected—the difficulties that women have in obtaining abortions in those countries. in eire, abortion is illegal. in france, abortion is available on demand up to 10 weeks gestation, hut is severely restricted after that. however, in spain a law legalising abortion in certain circumstances was passed in 1985. the numbers of women coming to this country from spain are now dropping rapidly.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.110',

the number of deaths from criminal abortions has dropped to nil in recent years. it is equally the case—i want to recognise this clearly — that because the bill would not affect the vast majority of

handicap issue and the question of tests. obviously, completely new tests may eventually become available that may alter the position, but, as i am advised, the position on the main tests currently available is as follows. the first test, serum alphafetoprotein, is usually done at 16 weeks. it is a test on the mother's blood to identify women who are more likely than average to have a foetus with an open neural tube defect, particularly a proportion of spina bifida cases. the test usually shows up as abnormal in an encephaly. amniocentesis is normally done at 16 weeks. it is used to assist in confirming the presence of a foetus with open neural tube defect, or to give cells that can be cultured to determine whether there is a genetic or chromosomal abnormality if there is reason to suspect that they may be present.\\n           that cell culture takes two to three weeks, and if it fails, as it sometimes does, the test may need to be repeated. abortion stemming from the findings is seldom possible much before 20 weeks, and in latter tests it sometimes may be as late as 24 weeks.\\n           untra sound scanning is mostly carried out at 16 to 18 weeks. the later it is done, the more accurate it is in assessing foetal abnormality. its main uses are to assist in determining the gestational age, which may be important in interpreting other tests for foetal abnormality, to detect multiple pregnancy and to see abnormalities of foetal structure.\\n           the test that has perhaps been referred to most in the debate, and in which there is most interest in the future, is chorionic villus biopsy, which is normally carried out at the earlier stage of between 8 and 12 weeks gestation. it is a relatively new procedure and can be used as an alternative to later examination of cells in amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis at between 16 and 18 weeks. it is used for the detection of genetic or chromosomal abnormalities if there is reason to suspect that they may be present. i am told that it is not an alternative to the procedures of alphafetoprotein testing or ultrasound scanning.\\n           the house must bear in mind that, as yet, chorionic villus biopsy is not universally available, and that its safety and accuracy are still being studied. clinical experience so far shows that, in general, results are accurate, although a small percentage of chromosome abnormalities need to be confirmed later by amniocentesis. there may be a problem regarding safety, in that miscarriage after amniocentesis is between 1 and 2 per cent., whereas after chorionic villus biopsy it appears to be twice that figure. sometimes, there is the further problem of infection following this procedure.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0,

obstetricians may be expected to want to offer a choice of chorionic villus biopsy or amniocentesis when women whose previous family history shows the need for genetic or chromosome studies present early enough in pregnancy. women would be likely to be told that, although there are occasionally problems with accuracy and a somewhat higher miscarriage rate, chorionic villus biopsy can provide a good indication of whether the foetus has chromosomol or gene abnormalities that are otherwise detectable through amniocentesis.\\n           it can do so early in pregnancy, thus making possible .the

since the 1967 act, during which back-street abortions, as the minister said, have completely disappeared and a new generaton of young women and men has grown up with a law that has allowed women — often with difficulty even under the present act and often with unnecessary delays—to obtain a termination safely and legally.\\n           let me dispel two myths that have been referred to here and in the press during the past few weeks. the first myth is that the present act gives women the right to choose. it does not. two doctors must agree, and the need to obtain an abortion must comply with one of the provisions in the act. abortion is not another method of contraception. that is another thing that is widely said, and quite untrue. anyone who believes that can have no idea of the agony of mind that all women undergo before making the momentous decision to have an abortion.\\n           the second myth is that women opt for an abortion on trivial grounds, such as that it would restrict their social activities or affect their figures. they are much more serious people than their critics give them credit for. certainly an unintended pregnancy, often as a result of contraceptive failure, will give many women much to think about. the hon. member for birmingham, edgbaston (dame j. knight) referred to the choice that women have of being able to take contraceptive pills or use contraceptive devices. i am sure i do not have to remind her that there is such a thing as contraceptive failure, and that quite a number of women have had to resort to an abortion in the end because of it.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.131', 28, 'uk.m.22530', 'uk.p.Con', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i said that

fear into the minds of women about the effectiveness of the contraceptive devices they are using — of the pill, for example. what about the cuts in family planning services that are being made? i was in stevenage about 10 days ago and visited its family planning clinic, which is faced with a 50 per cent. cut in resources over the next 12 months. that will mean an increase in the number of women who may become pregnant as a result of not having proper treatment.\\n           whatever the reason for an unintended pregnancy, it affects the mental and physical health of a woman in terms of her children or other family responsibilities, adding further strains to an already over-strained household income. damp, overcrowded housing conditions or homelessness may well be factors that must also be considered. social research has proved many times that those factors have a direct impact on mental and physical health.\\n           the british system of support for pregnant women is not all that good. indeed, it is about the worst in western europe. we have cut the maternity grant for all but the most needy and deprived — those on supplementary benefit—and even that is insufficient to provide the required diet for a pregnant woman. girls aged under 16 are not given even that meagre benefit.\\n           one of my constituents is a simple parent with a violent husband. she has three children, the oldest of whom is aged l4½. they live in a freezing, hard-to-let house. the house is so cold that they live effectively in one room. last december, the 14-year-old daughter gave birth to a premature baby. the baby is ailing. the local hospital cannot keep it in, although its health demands that it returns to hospital frequently. that baby has been born and is physically perfect, although it is weak. some people have tremendous stresses and strains on their lives. they might have forgiven that 14-year-old girl, and her mother, for having an abortion in those circumstances. i certainly would, and i hope that hon. members who do not always agree with me would. that baby is loved, and i hope that it will survive.\\n           i do not like the suggestion that those of us who opposed the bill do not care about disabled people. our record of care and concern for disabled people is as good as that of anyone else. i hope that no one will run away with the idea that there is any difference.\\n           many hon. members have mentioned amendments that might be tabled to the bill in committee. it is said that a limit of 24 weeks might be acceptable. the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton) has hinted that amendments might be accepted in committee. but he drafted his bill with remarkable precision. had he been thinking about extending the time limit, he would not have tried to define the limit almost to the day. i beg the house to consider the words of the bill. it is not an 18-week bill, but a 17-week bill. it says: a woman's pregnancy may be terminated in accordance with section 1 of the abortion act 1967 at any time up to the beginning of the 18th week of gestation. that is the seventh day of the 17th week. i do not know how anyone could be so precise about the period of gestation. if the hon. gentleman now believes that a later limit may be acceptable, or that he could live with it, he should have introduced an entirely different bill, or introduced none at all.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.133', 60, 'uk.m.16469', 'uk.p.LDem', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', \"i

will not accept the repeat of a matter that has been properly discussed in committee.\\n           let me consider the remainder of the bill and the way in which it is worded. clause 1(2) allows terminations up to the end of 28 weeks. thank goodness for something. however, it is restrictive in the extreme. it allows abortion to save the life of a mother. it allows abortion if a child is likely to be born dead or with abnormalities that are so serious that life cannot be independently sustained. in the briefing that he circulated to all hon. members, the hon. gentleman listed 11 types of handicapping disorder to demonstrate how his exemption clause will affect each group. i am informed by professor marcus pembrey, mothercare professor of paediatric genetics at london university, that over 2,000 different conditions can now be detected during pregnancy. who will decide which conditions will be exempted?\\n           hon. members who attended professor pembrey's presentation in the house a few weeks ago were visibly shaken by the examples of severe abnormality and multiple handicap that the professor assured us will fall outside the exemption as it is phrased in the bill. how can, say, 16 or 20 hon. members sit in committee and decide? we are not doctors. we have some doctors in the house, but they are not necessarily specialists. how can we, as lay people, decide between different kinds of handicap, the names of which we probably cannot even pronounce, let alone understand? i would much rather leave that decision to informed medical opinion. that is where it should be left.\\n           the hon. gentleman has done one service for us. practically everyone in the country now knows what an amniocentesis test is, that it cannot take place until the 16th week and that results are not available until 20 weeks. perhaps, as a result of the debate that has gone on in the country, many more women will want to have an amniocentesis test because they have now heard of it, particularly if they are in any doubt about their pregnancies. we have the amniocentesis test, and the ultrasound screening to which the minister referred, but it does not provide certain results until the 18th to 20th week, or even later.\\n           there are known cases in which abnormalities or lack of development appear to be indicated by early ultrasound screening. if the pregnancy is continued with careful screening and back-up, further tests can reveal and have revealed that such abnormality has disappeared. if the bill is passed with a much earlier upper time limit, it is entirely possible that, because they are cautious and worried, doctors will unnecessarily abort and that women will unnecessarily lose children whom they want. that is another reason why 18 weeks is a ridiculous time to put into the bill.\\n           i am sorry that those hon. members who take a restrictive view of abortion were not present on tuesday last in the grand committee room to hear the moving and humbling testimony of mothers who have had abortions because they decided not to continue with their pregnancies after foetal abnormalities were detected. some hon. members were there. we heard from mothers who have since had or are going to have perfect babies. they said that if, because of the law, they had been forced to carry on with their earlier pregnancies and were now, against their will, trying to cope with handicapped children, they would never have risked having another child. they still grieve over the loss of their first baby, but they are all glad that the back-up of screening and our present humane and compassionate laws gave them the opportunity to make their individual choice and to go on with confidence to have more children. who will sit in judgment on the first such woman to seek an illegal abortion, if the bill is passed?\\n           nothing has been said this morning about mental handicap. it is specifically excluded from the bill, because the hon. member for mossley hill has excluded the reference to mental health which is in the original act. there are approximately 160,000 severely mentally handicapped people in this country and almost 1 million mildly mentally handicapped people in england and wales. as a society, we try to support their desire to live an ordinary life within the community, and that is right. that includes allowing them and helping them to develop relationships with the opposite sex and, for some, at some stage, marriage. sadly, it also means being at risk or being exploited by others in the community.\\n           the diagnosis of pregnancy in mentally handicapped women is often very delayed because of their unawareness of their condition and because they fail to seek medical advice. a child born to a mentally handicapped mother runs a high risk of being mentally handicapped and of having other congenital defects of varying severity. pregnancy, delivery and fostering or adoption can have devastating effects on a mentally handicapped woman and her partner and, more commonly, on her aging parents who have devoted all their young lives to the care of their child. any reduction in the upper time limit for therapeutic abortion would have a traumatic effect on this small but important group of people.\\n           i wish to refer briefly to another group of people. i received a letter, dated 4 january, from dr. lindsey allan, senior lecturer in paediatric cardiology at guy's hospital. she says that, since 1980, her unit has specialised in the detection of congenital heart disease in early foetal life. with present technology, the optimum time for foetal cardiac examination is about 18–20 weeks gestation. major heart disease can be accurately detected from this time on. at least 25% of children born with heart defects will die in the first 10 years of their life, often after a restricted existence, chequered with repeated hospital investigation and major heart surgery. those children would certainly be excluded under the exclusion clause of the bill because they would be born alive and, in other respects, able to exist independently, but they would die before they were 10 years old.\\n           dr. allan goes on to say: faced with the prospect of a very poor long-term prognosis for their child, the majority of parents elect termination of pregnancy — 32 of a possible group of 40 parents made this choice in 1987. \\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.137', 2, 'uk.m.16469',

others, that have appealed to the house to vote against it. there are lists of royal colleges and organisations for the handicapped. it was somewhat sharp practice for those hon. members—one of whom

handicapped, that person still has the right to live and is classified as a separate human being with full civil rights. we all accept that if a child is damaged because something goes wrong at birth, such as oxygen failure, that child is a human being with fully established civil rights, and has the right to live, no matter how handicapped.\\n           we do not allow a woman to choose whether to continue a pregnancy when she is more than 28 weeks pregnant. we already say that there must be some restriction of one individual's right of determination over another's right to live. i support the

strongly that the 1967 act was a muddle. the 1967 act said that what is in the womb is not life because a woman has a right of abortion under certain loose circumstances. it also said that perhaps it is life, and perhaps we should protect it, so we shall define the circumstances in which a woman can have an abortion, be they ever so loose. it fudged the issue. we must decide when life is life and must be fully and absolutely respected, as hon. members would respect each other's lives. it has been widely accepted that babies survive at 24 weeks, although it would be conceded by my hon. friends, that it is a massive struggle and only a minority survive, but they survive.\\n           i find it deeply objectionable— i will not use a pejorative word such as obscene— that we have a law that permits two babies to leave their mother's womb at 24 weeks; one is cherished while its life is fought over, and all the medical resources in the country are poured into saving it and its parents desperately want it to live, while the other is wilfully destroyed, being taken from its mother's womb unnaturally at the same age. i find that impossible to accept as a mark of a civilised

even reflected in our language. i have never heard a woman who lost a baby prematurely say that she lost her foetus; she says she has lost her baby. yet when we decide that we will wilfully destroy a 24-week-old baby, we call it a foetus. that is a dual standard. i am concerned that the abortion act 1967 legislated for that standard, and i want to see a revision.\\n           where do we draw the line? is it at the presently recorded lowest survival rate of 24 weeks for permanent survival and 23 weeks for temporary survival, or at the point where we think medical science will move in the foreseeable future, or do we recognise as life the time when a child is fully formed, is sentient and can feel pain and react to stimuli? we have all reached different decisions of conscience. the bill is a valid attempt to set down a line, and i support the line that the bill has set down.\\n           i recognise fully that other hon. members have different opinions. for the sake of the 92 per cent. of healthy children who are aborted over the age of 18 weeks, i would not stick doctrinally to a position where the exceptions were so narrow that the bill would be lost through that. i would rather compromise, even if it goes against what i personally believe, in order to save that 92 per cent. i am sorry that my hon. friend the member for berkshire, east (mr. mackay) is not here to

draw. to be perfectly honest, i would draw the line below the one that the hon. member for mossley hill has drawn, but if in order to save a certain proportion of unborn life i must accept a slightly higher line, i will, with reluctance but straightforwardly, accept that line. all that i ask is that this important bill, which fills a gap that the 1967 act left unaddressed and attempts to define the rights of individuals who cannot speak for themselves, should have a chance to be fully examined and to return to the house for final approval or disapproval. i would say to my hon. friend the

the purposes of this debate—came top of the ballot. if every hon. member had the right to introduce a private member\\'s bill, we should not be faced with the dilemma that confronts my hon. friend the member for mossley hill. he believes in a principle. he won the place in the ballot; it was not me or any other hon. member.\\n           my hon. friend had to say to the organisations outside the house, \"if you wish me to place this matter before parliament, you will have to accept that, in framing the bill that i propose, i shall not be able to compromise on one matter.\" that matter was the question of handicap. my hon. friend was imprisoned in that position because of his experience of teaching handicapped children for six years. my hon. friends may find that difficult to stomach, but they must understand that if one cannot secure any other route to abortion reform, one has no option but to accept offers from hon. members who are prepared to offer their private member\\'s slot for reform that meets our objectives.\\n           before i speak to the bill in detail, i should like to say something about the labour party and what has happened in the past few weeks. we have been told that the labour party has exerted pressure on its members. i want to make it absolutely clear that that is not the case. i address myself to those outside the house who have misrepresented this debate and this argument in a most grotesque way when i say that the letter from the general secretary, mr. larry whitty, was a fair and reasonable letter setting out the labour party\\'s policy. he was absolutely right to send that letter, and he said, as the great majority of members of the party would say, that it is for hon. members to decide for themselves.\\n           then we were told that the labour chief whip had sent out a letter over christmas issuing instructions. that is not true; it never happened. i received the letter, which pointed out that two important private members\\' bills were to be debated at the beginning of january and expressed the hope that there would be a substantial attendance for those debates. i say again to those who have misrepresented these matters outside the house that that is the truth, and i say it as a supporter of the bill. i hope that that information will be taken back to groups around the country.\\n           let me deal with the so-called demand for a three-line whip. i have not heard a demand for a three-line whip. it has never been part of the argument that there should be a three-line whip. but i understand why, in certain circumstances, there should be a three-line whip. if the labour party takes a position, it is entitled—although it has not done so to date—to demand a three-line whip on such matters. hon. members who want to be true to their conscience have the right to decide what they want to do if they find that a three-line whip has been imposed upon them. that is their right, and my right and it is for me to decide whether to vote aye or no. if i believe in something, i shall apply what is for me an honourable tradition of the house and cast my vote accordingly.\\n           one of the fiercest opponents of the bill, my hon. friend the member for preston (mrs. wise), voted, against a three-line whip, on a very important measure in 1978 — the finance bill. she expressed her view according to her conscience and judgment and was not penalised for so doing. if the party thinks that in these matters voting should be whipped, i do not take exception to that. i say to people outside the house and to people in the strangers\\' gallery that this is a matter for one\\'s conscience but that even a three-line whip allows one to follow one\\'s conscience.\\n           no one will ever drive me into a lobby in support of a measure with which i do not agree. some hon. members who support the bill, but particularly some of those who oppose it, are quick to flex their muscles when speaking about matters in which they think conscience is important.\\n           i joined the labour party for a specific reason. in the mid 1960s i built my socialism on my perception of life and on the importance that i gave to life issues. i opposed hanging and was in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament. that was one of the things that brought me into the labour party. i supported life issues from my first days in the party, and that was one of the crucial building blocks on which i built my socialism. for many of us, that is an immutable position. as long as we remain in the political process and are able to advocate these matters we shall cast our votes in favour of reform of the law on an issue of this nature. that is because we believe in a principle. however, that does not detract from our right to recognise that some hon. members, such as the hon. member for maidstone (miss widdecombe), feel equally fiercely about such issues. she has the right to put a compromise before the house, knowing that it will be heard throughout the house for what it is.\\n           i have outlined my building blocks, but they are also the building blocks for people throughout the labour movement. many people in the movement believe in the life tradition and support my position. in the last few weeks they have written to me and said that, although the party has taken a decision that they cannot accept, they are still socialists. in formulating their case those people have drawn on exactly the same strands in their philosophy as those strands in my philosophy that hold me together politically. they are faced with the same conflicts.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4.1.153', 6,

those people are confronted by conflicts. on the one hand, we believe in a principle while, on the other, we know that thousands of women simply cannot find the courage to face the social difficulties that arise and have to proceed with an unwanted pregnancy. i strongly blame the government for that. my hon. friend the member for cynon valley (mrs. clwyd) said at a dinner the other night that she sat through a bill or some meeting at which reference was made to an amendment moved in a committee dealing with social security reform. she said that conservatives had refused to accept the responsibility for funding families in which children were in their earliest years.\\n           that is the contradiction for us in the labour party who believe in the life tradition. we want reform of the law, but the other side of the argument is that many women come to us asking how we can possibly want reform of the law when the very framework and nature of the society that is developing under the government does not provide the essential support services to ensure at least some help for families who find themselves in this position. that is the conflict that confronts us. in the letters that i have received in the last few weeks, people, especially labour people, have repeatedly spoken specifically about these matters.\\n           i have heard references to the photograph which was circulated in the newspaper advertisements that we placed in the national press and which was portrayed on hundreds of thousands of postcards that were sent throughout the united kingdom. i suggest that my hon. friends who oppose the bill were distressed by the photograph because it was so graphic in its detail. it was a beautiful photograph of an 18-week foetus. it was clear, precise in colour and produced by the swedish photographer nielsson.\\n           the campaign concentrated on that photograph because we wanted to draw the attention of the british people and, indeed, of hon. members to the fact that we are not talking in grey abstract terms; we are talking about a child who is fully formed in the womb. there was no other way in which we could express, in any detail, what the debate was about. that is why the photograph was used and why the lobby decided that that was the way in which the campaign should be presented. — [interruption.] if there were any words to which my hon. friends might have taken exception, i do not know what they were. however, during the campaign all sides may have used words that we may later regret. indeed, one such phrase was \"foreign woman.\" i used it. i regretted that from day one because it denoted disrespect, but i have heard it used again in our arguments today. however, i agree that some language should have been modified or not used in the way in which it was.\\n           my hon. friend the member for barking (ms. richardson) referred to a bill that she brought before the house in 1981. i agonised long and hard over that bill. i am convinced now that in principle she is right. if we are to bring in legislation that will draw women into earlier abortions, we must set up the arrangements to facilitate that. every time that a young woman is stopped from having an abortion in a clinic in, say, birmingham, we cannot see that as a gain for the life movement. it is not a gain—it is cheating around the rules. we must ensure that, in the event that we set in place legislation—i hope—that the bill goes through—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'],

there are many examples of handicapped children who have grown up to make contributions to our society.\\n           i am being quick because there are others who want to speak, but i should say that this debate has caused me a great deal of heart-searching. fifty years ago, a mother of 40 had a child who was born a spastic. that child was me, the member of parliament for hayes and harlington. i am concerned because i believe that, if the technology that is available now had been available 50 years ago, a doctor may well have said to my mother, \"you are 40 years old and you are carrying a disabled child. there is brain damage. please have it aborted.\" opposition members may wish that had happened; i do not know. i am saying that my right to life came about because the technology was not available to help a doctor advise my mother about whether to allow me to live.\\n           i am a spastic. of course i am nowhere near as bad as christopher nolan, but i have to cope with the stresses and strains of minor disability. however, there was loving care from my mother in my home. by the age of nine, she had taught me how to do up my shoelaces because i could not use my hands properly. she told me that i could take part in sport and lead a normal life. she told me that, if she had her way, which she did, i would make some sort of success of my life. i suppose that having arrived here as a spastic with cerebral palsy is a measure of success.\\n           i have dealt mainly with handicap because people have said that mothers should have the right to decide whether to have a handicapped child. we are talking about a life inside a woman. the doctors advising that women could he wrong. that child could be born, survive and understand what is going on. christopher nolan represents the reason why we should not have any abortions at all. however, i understand and am concerned about incest and rape and the implication of a child being born as a result. i do not know the answer, but i do know that life is important from the minute that conception takes place. of course ladies have rights and we must consider them, but they also have obligations and responsibilities that they have to face up to.\\n           the hon. member for barking (ms richardson) raised the issue of the mentally handicapped having children. perhaps in this enlightened society we should be thinking about telling such people that they should not have children and helping them to enjoy a full life. we cannot say that they have the right to have children and then say that they can have an abortion. that is inconsistent.\\n           by its very nature, abortion is wrong. abortion at any time is wrong. i support the alton bill, if i can call it that, because he is making a move in the right direction. please let us not use handicapped or potentially handicapped children inside a woman\\'s womb as a reason for taking a particular point of view. they have a right to life. in many ways, they lead a more fulfilled life than we do. i am convinced that that applies to christopher nolan, in his own way.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0),

campaigns that women have been fighting for many years. indeed, it has already been said that not only did we have to campaign for legal abortion, but we have had to campaign continually against repeated attacks on our abortion rights. the bill represents the thin edge of the wedge; if it is passed, it will lead to further attacks on women\\'s right to legal abortion.\\n           if we were to win those other campaigns for which we are fighting, we would have a more civilised society, there would be few abortions, and late terminations would all but disappear. to achieve that end, we need improved sex education. we need contraceptives of all kinds, freely available and free. we need better housing and employment and training opportunities. we need safer childbirth—our record is not among the best in the advanced world. we must do away with some of the more recent \"conveyor belt practices\" connected with childbirth in hospitals, which have a traumatic effect on the baby during birth. we want nursery provision for young children. we want money for medical research into foetal abnormalities to discover them at an earlier stage. we need money for disabled people and money to provide facilities for them. we need money from the government. as of right, for women who are carers of children, the disabled, the sick and the old.\\n           if we win those campaigns, women will be able to have their children and we shall have a civilised society in which the rearing of children will be the joy that it should be. nowadays, all too often the birth of an unwanted child leads to child abuse, and that is something we should not forget.\\n           last week, i sent the hon. member for liverpool, mossley hill (mr. alton) a copy of a letter that i had received. i received many sad letters, but i was especially struck by this one, perhaps because it came from an old man. perhaps it was naive of me to send a copy of that letter to the hon. member for mossley hill, or perhaps it was a reflex action after 40 years of teaching, to try to make people face up to the consequences of their activities. that old man told me that he had for many years been looking after his handicapped son of 35, who is mentally disabled. the father was bitter and told how his wife had died in her fifties; he put that down to the strain of looking after their handicapped child. he was sad, he was tired, he was despairing, and above all he was haunted by the fear of what would happen to his handicapped son when he died. i have met many people with handicapped children who are haunted by that fear. it is another factor that has not been considered in this debate.\\n           but the central issue, the most important question to consider, is whether women should have control over their bodies—the right to decide what happens within their bodies—or whether they should be controlled by others. earlier in the debate, a conservative member raised the question of class. money gives one a lot of rights. those women, who have a lot of money and education, have the right to get round the restrictions of any kind of bill. if this bill is passed, such women will be able to find abortionists and will find a way to have their damaged foetuses aborted even at a late stage. however, poorer women would lose their rights. i am concerned for the rights of poorer women not only to have abortions, but to have children. those two things are connected.\\n           some years ago, i was in a women\\'s hospital for a check-up. i was shocked to see the number of women there for sterilisation operations. an unduly large proportion of them were black or asian women. i went all round the ward asking the women why they were having this operation, and most of them had been advised by their doctor to have it as a form of contraception. it is because of my experiences as a young woman, long before 1967, that i am in favour of abortion on request in an adequate health sevice. it would solve almost all the problems of late terminations.\\n           i do not know whether some hon. members understand that no woman approaches abortion lightly. for the first few days after a woman has had a baby, her body trembles when she hears the baby cry. that is nature\\'s way of tying the mother to the baby. this bonding starts from conception, so it is physically impossible for any woman to approach abortion lightly. they approach it after giving serious consideration to the factors involved.\\n           we have all heard about the pre-1967 period and the gin, hot baths, quinine pills, knitting needles and soap suds. we know that the best doctors—those who were caring and kind—were often criminalised and struck off the register.\\n           however hon. members may not appreciate the constant shadow that was cast over the lives of women, both married and unmarried, by the fear of unwanted pregnancy. every month, my generation and my mother\\'s generation worried about becoming pregnant, especially if their period was late. they felt caged, trapped and frightened. they wondered what to do and where they would find someone who would give them an abortion if they could not cope with, or afford to have, another child.\\n           the bill will lead to the criminalisation of women and doctors once again. hon. members who are wavering about how to vote should think about their wives, girlfriends, daughters and granddaughters. they should vote for their choice to have control over their bodies; they should vote against this bill.\\n

more than 40 years, i have been a pastoral minister in a working-class district of east belfast, and i know the anguish. i speak as one who has had the experience of sitting with young women faced with this problem. i have tried to counsel them and tell them that everything will not be over when they have an abortion. i have in my hand a poem which one of them sent to me, and it is the saddest communication that i have ever received. a young unmarried women who became pregnant decided that an abortion was the best way out for her and two months later she wrote: there is no more happiness any more  those days belong now behind a closed door  darkness and despair now take its place  i hate being a member of the human race that young woman\\'s heart was completely broken.\\n           therefore, there is another side to having abortions; there is an aftermath and a harvest. i emphasis that those who adopt the same position as i do feel deeply and understand with compassion the heart-rending decisions that are being made by those people, but there is a more excellent way.\\n           the purpose of abortion must be questioned. is it for the convenience of others or for the good of the child? that is the prime question that must be asked. it is simply not enough to say in reply that children are unwanted, so should be destroyed. no one has the right to adopt that attitude. the gruesome act of abortion as it has been delineated here today has been repudiated, and it has been said that those facts should not be brought into the debate. but we are talking about a child—a real person—who is being destroyed. that a child should be destroyed within the mother\\'s womb in that way is something about which we must righteously protest.\\n           those who are ardent campaigners for women\\'s rights indict anti-abortionists as taking from women the right to exercise control over their fertility, but that is another matter from control over life itself, and that must be emphasised. easy-going tolerance has contributed much to the current vague estimation of the value of life. it does not occur to many that what they call tolerance is in reality a sheer lack of conviction.\\n           it is not particularly significant if a person with no great convictions says that he or she is tolerant. tolerance is a virtue only if a person believes in something strongly, yet respects the rights of another to disagree. true christian tolerance does not play footsie with the truth. a good law will not make good people—and we all know that—but evil law not only legalises evil but prevents the development of good and tears down the nation\\'s morality.\\n           the old saying that one cannot make men love by law is true. but christian realism is not content with that, because it knows that love in social terms is expressed in justice for all, and that \"all\" includes the unborn child. the bill calls for an immediate and definite response. the

the only serious question for the legislator. we shall answer it today. i repeat it because it is stark, harsh and real, and we shall choose our answer to it when we choose which lobby to enter. how

gentleman seeks to introduce the heavy hand of regulation into human behaviour. human conduct is largely defined by habit and arises spontaneously to be tested and refined in our courts of law. whenever this issue has been tested in a court of law, the court has come down on the side of the woman. it has not accepted the precedence of an unborn child over the mother. in the latest case in which this was tested, when a young man brought a case against his girl friend who was some 20 weeks pregnant, the court ruled in favour of the young woman, so we are not a society that has no organisation or laws apart from those decided in this house.\\n           the campaign that has been conducted by the hon. member for mossley hill is largely based on emotion and on some very unpleasant, aesthetically revolting suggestions which have been made by hon. members on both sides of the house. if those conditions apply to abortions, i am sure that we all deplore them, but they are no reason for denying a woman the right to have a termination if, after consulting her family, her doctors and, where appropriate, her religious advisers, she decides to have an abortion. it ill behoves the house to remove that right from her.\\n           i appeal to my fellow conservative members, who are prevaricating on an issue of personal rights. the conservative party takes great pride in having reduced the role of the state in people's lives during the past decade. we are rolling back the state, yet the bill would push us back decades into the darker realms of human conduct to the time when the most common cause of female mortality was badly conducted abortions.\\n           british women are solidly against the bill—\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0),

can also mention the show of hands on a television programme yesterday, which showed that 90 per cent. of a balanced audience was in favour of a woman's right to choose. it should be noted that every responsible medical society opposes the bill, including the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists, the royal college of midwives, the royal college of general practitioners, the british medical association, the british paediatric association and the clinical genetics society. they are not back-street abortionists making money out of foreign women, with whose plight i sympathise; they are some of the most responsible bodies in the land and they oppose the bill.\\n           many other people oppose the bill. with some of my colleagues—far too few—i attended a moving meeting conducted by parents of handicapped children who have had to live with the problem. i shall not repeat the arguments about physically and mentally handicapped children. suffice it to say that some of those parents consider it a mercy that children born with appalling difficulties, who live their lives in pain and sorrow and who die young, are now capable of not being born. that is not just my view; it is the view of the parents who attended that meeting.\\n           many times, the hon. member for mossley hill has trotted out examples of handicapped people who have lived and who are pleased to have lived. i am sure that we all take pleasure in that. but we heard from a young woman with a genetic disorder whose blood must be changed several times a month, who has a pump under her skin to keep her going, who develops extremely painful lumps in her stomach and who is constantly in pain. she told us that she would rather not be alive. for every case that the hon. gentleman raised, there is another case. i agree that it is only part of the argument, but it is an extremely potent and important point.\\n           it is a matter of civil rights. it is a matter of a woman's right to decide her own future and her own fertility. this chamber should not lightly take that right from her. those who consider that abortion is wrong should test their prejudices in a court of law. abortion matters should be decided in a court of law, not in the house, where our prejudices and religious attitudes are being used in a variety of ways in an attempt to influence the bill.\\n           the hon. member for mossley hill poses as a caring progressive. his bill will bring misery and suffering to thousands of families. those who really care, those who work with the situation, those who have lived with the situation, and even those who were born in the situation oppose him. i beg the house to oppose the bill.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0),

of his bill. in particular, i waited for him to define what he meant when he said that a woman\\'s pregnancy may be terminated up to the beginning of the 18th week of gestation. i waited for him to tell us what the 18th week of gestation is and how he would go about proving it. there is no legal definition of pregnancy. as a legal matter, the 18th week of gestation does not exist. how would the hon. gentleman define it? the hon. gentleman may ask how we define 28 weeks. in practice, we do not; it is not necessary.\\n           the present state of the law is not that abortion is legal up to 28 weeks. section 1(1) of the infant life (preservation) act 1929 states: any person who, with intent to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive, by any wilful act causes a child to die before it has an existence independent of its mother, shall be guilty of felony\". the term is: a child capable of being born alive\". the law in such cases is applied case by case. a doctor who performs an abortion after 24 weeks must be ready to justify in the courts that the child was not capable of being born alive. this bill would not allow a case-by-case analysis. it is a general assertion that there is a particular day on which an abortion will become criminal. the hon. gentleman does not tell us which day.\\n           which day represents the 18th week of gestation? supporters of the bill do not know. doctors do not know. the woman concerned does not really know. in any case, the woman is in the best position to say, and she is the one to be criminalised, so she cannot be expected to be co-operative.\\n           at the moment, the law is flexible. it puts a medical matter in the proper position to be argued medically, even if it has to be done in the courts. the bill destroys that. if hon. members pass the bill, we will criminalize thousands of women and their doctors and be careless of the capacity to prove what was being asserted. that would be irresponsible.\\n           we have been told a great deal about the possibility of amending the bill in committee. i listened carefully to the hon. member for mossley hill, and i shall tell hon. members what he is offering. he said that it would be \"proper to examine\" how to \"rationalise the law\". he said \"examine\", not \"agree with you\". he said that if it would result in a \"useful measure\", he would not be intransigent, but he also made clear that his view of a useful measure is not likely to be that of the house or of the people outside.\\n           in the past, when we have sought to use the procedures of the house to examine in detail proposals for changing the abortion laws, we have been accused of procedural abuse. i have served on committees of the house which have dealt with abortion. i have been guilty not of procedural abuse, but of trying to examine the nature and detail of the bill. i do not believe that the house will give a second reading to the bill, but, if it does, and we come to consider the matter in detail, we shall be abused.\\n           my hon. friend the member for workington (mr. campbell-savours) says that the matter will be considered in committee and that it is a matter of compromise and give and take. the quality of his intervention in this matter can be judged by his comment earlier today that, from the beginning, he regretted the introduction of the subject of foreign women. i have a letter from my hon. friend, dated 17 october 1987, which states: the reasons we have chosen 18 weeks are as follows. the concluding sentence of his first paragraph states: over half of these abortions are on foreign women. he did not regret the matter sufficiently.\\n           the offers to amend the bill, being made so generously in the house today, arise for only one reason. the sponsors have calculated that they cannot win with the bill as it stands at present, so they are trying to make us believe that the bill, which was not published until 18 december 1987, will suddenly, by 22 january 1988, be subject to wholesale change.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1988, 1, 22, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1988-01-22.4'],

offered merely procedural gambles. it is a procedural ploy to persuade us to give way because its supporters cannot push through the bill they have actually presented to the house.\\n           this is a most important matter. we are dealing with the lives and happiness of many people and we should not subject them to a mere procedural gamble in the house. it is also very difficult to get matters which have been considered in committee back on to the floor of the house. we do so by all sorts of ploys, such as slightly changing the words. how can we change the words \"24 weeks\"? they do not

we do not neglect the fact that people also have a right to happiness. unlike the sponsors of the bill, on tuesday, in the grand committee room, we listened to the parents of handicapped children. they said that they had their abortions out of love and described watching their children die. the hon. member for birmingham, edgbaston (dame j. knight) says that those women have a choice—to remain childless. that will happen if the bill is passed. we say that women should have the choice of termination of pregnancy and then to go on to bear a healthy child if possible.\\n           i am not ducking the issue of those terminations that are not the result of foetal handicap. women can be driven to desperation for reasons other than foetal handicap. in addition to the list of those who have said that the legislation is wrong, the faculty of community medicine tells us —if hon. members have read the brief—what happens to babies who are unwanted.\\n           the remarkable consensus on this issue stretches from every woman labour member right across to the conservative women\\'s national committee. that consensus arises not because we have suddenly all become the same sort of

medical practitioners to terminate pregnancies which have lasted for less than twenty-four weeks. i apologise to the house for bringing before it yet again an issue which many people may feel has been well aired. i remind hon. members that we have spent a great deal of time in this session discussing a matter that concerns many people in this country, and have failed to change one section, one comma or one full stop of the abortion act 1967. yet, when the house debated the subject, it was quite clear that many hon. members on both sides felt that there was room for change in the 1967 act. because of the almost obstinate view of people on both sides of the argument, that they will not give way or compromise at all, i feel that no progress has been made in achieving any sort of reasonable compromise to deal with the problems that many of us feel should be tackled.\\n           i do not believe that a ten-minute bill of this kind will fundamentally alter the reasons why women are forced to have abortions, and i am convinced that as a society we must do something about the stigmas that are attached to one-parent families and to those who feel that it is impossible to cope with having a child and who are driven into the hands of the abortionists. i also believe that the contraceptive services which we offer leave a great deal to be desired. but the fact that there is now one abortion every four minutes in this country must surely convince right hon. and hon. members that the time has come to look again at the way in which our legislation is working and to challenge the sort of suppositions upon which it has been based.\\n           whether or not this bill is given the opportunity of being debated further, i am sure that many hon. members will continue to have sincerely held views either for or against abortion. however, i am certain that there cannot be many hon. members whose views have changed since we took a vote only a few weeks ago on whether the length of pregnancy at which an abortion can take place should be reduced. that is the matter to which i want hon. members to address their minds. i am certain that there is a need to reduce the time at which an abortion can take place from the present 28-week limit. personally, i should like to see it lower than 24 weeks, and i voted accordingly. however, when the question was put to the house, the vote was lost by 298 to 120, a majority of 178. when a further vote was taken on the 24-week limit, it was agreed to by 275 to 172, thus demonstrating that a clear majority of the house was in favour of a reduction from 28 weeks to 24 weeks. that is why i believe that we must introduce a series of one-clause bills in order to amend the legislation, and i make it quite clear to those who hold views that are the opposite of my own that this is not the end of the argument.\\n           indeed, the minister himself accepted that if further evidence is brought forward it may be necessary to look at a time limit lower than 24 weeks. therefore, there can never be an end to this argument, and my bill will not stop hon. members from introducing further amendments and further bills. i believe that there is room for this bill, which the majority of hon. members supported just a few weeks ago. in evidence, i refer hon. members to the lane committee, which said: numerous organisations and individuals have recommended an upper limit on the period of gestation at which abortion may lawfully take place. their principal reasons for so doing may be summarised as follows:— | (1) to encourage early application for, and performance of, abortion and thus to avoid or minimise the risks of the operation, which increase substantially after the first trimester of pregnancy. | (2) to spare the patient and the medical and nursing staff the revulsion and distress occasioned by later abortions, such reactions becoming progressively more severe as the fetus assumes an increasingly human form and movements may be seen. | (3) to avoid the destruction of a well-developed fetus and particularly one which might survive termination of pregnancy.\" |  mrs. justice lane had this to say in her recommendations: informed opinion is, and the committee agrees, that a maximum gestational age of twenty-eight weeks for abortion is too high, having regard to modern methods of sustaining prematurely-born infants. viability must be a question of fact in each case but, while it may be theoretically possible for a fetus to survive at twenty-four weeks\\' gestation, in practice there is little hope of survival at a gestational age of less than twenty-six weeks. an upper limit of twenty-four weeks\\' gestation for abortion should afford protection for any fetus with a real chance of survival independently of its mother. further research may justify a reduction of this period\". indeed, that is one of the reasons why in the amendment, which he accepted and supported, the minister talked in terms of exceptions being made and the possibility of further reductions in the future. the committee recommended that the abortion act should be amended to authorise abortion up to the twenty-fourth week of pregnancy and not thereafter\". a leader in the times , commenting on that, said: there is still room for medical argument about whether it is necessary to stipulate 20 weeks to secure that objective, or whether 22 or 24 weeks would do; but there should be little disagreement about the objective itself.  the guardian newspaper said of abortions: two out of every 1,000 are carried out on women who have been pregnant for over 24 weeks. about 200 in a year. but both mrs. justice lane\\'s committee, which spent three years reviewing our abortion procedures, and the world health organisation have recommended a limit of 24 weeks. in opening, i said that a number of right hon. and hon. members had tried to amend the legislation since my right hon. friend the member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) introduced the 1967 act. i must say that i opposed his views then within the political party of which i am a member, and i have consistently taken that view. however, i am pleased that today both he and i are sponsors of this bill, which demonstrates that there is support on both sides of the argument for the change.\\n           since 1967, many attempts have been made to change the legislation. on 15 july 1969, the right hon. member for chelmsford (mr. st. john-stevas), now leader of the house, failed to get a first reading for his bill by 210 votes to 199. the abortion law (reform) bill in the 1969–70 session, in the name of the hon. member for rye (mr. godman irvine), was talked out on second reading. numerous other attempts were made, but i shall not go into them as my time is running out.\\n           i believe that there is a need for this change. i hope that hon. members will support the bill, which seeks to amend the law on abortion so as to enable registered medical practitioners to terminate pregnancies which have lasted for less than twenty-four weeks. \\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 4, 22, 0, 0),

this issue. there are those such as the hon. member for liverpool, edgehill (mr. alton) whose moral principles make them oppose abortion in all circumstances. there are many whose moral principles

concerns, between concern for the life and health of the mother and the life of the foetus. we thought then that we had achieved an appropriate balance.\\n           the arguments that i advance today are addressed not to those who are confirmed in their view on either extreme but rather to those in the middle who accepted that balance but who may consider that, in the light of events since then, it is time to change. to those who argue that perhaps we ought to do so in order to give finality to the argument, i must point out that the hon. member for edge hill has already destroyed that argument by indicating that his bill would not be the last enactment upon the subject, and that those who are opposed to abortion would continue to introduce bills in the future.\\n           i suggest that those hon. members who want finality vote strongly against the bill today so that the house can show to the country that the balance which was achieved in 1967 was the right one and ought to continue.\\n           i address most of my arguments to the point that has been made in favour of the bill, namely, that, because it is now possible to save a foetus at a much earlier period than it was in 1967, we ought to reduce the top limit in order to avoid the circumstances in which, because of an abortion, a child may come into the world who was capable of living but who was then put to death. i want to make it as plain as i can that that has never been the law. it will not be the law if we pass the bill. indeed, there has never been an occasion when it has been permissible for a viable foetus that is capable of living to come into the world and for it then legitimately to be put to death.\\n           it would be an offence under the infant life (preservation) act, and it would be an offence of murder if it were done deliberately. it would be an offence of manslaughter if the consultant or doctor who brought that child into the world were to neglect it, and thereby imperil its life. for that reason, since 1975 the regulations for carrying out abortions have insisted that whenever an abortion takes place after 20 weeks gestation it should take place in circumstances where there is the machinery to resuscitate the foetus if it is capable of living.\\n           we are not discussing the question—so emotively put in much of the propaganda—whether foetuses will be put to death after they have been born. if a foetus is capable of living, it must continue to live. the argument about a 28-week limit is misconceived. no limit is laid down in the abortion act 1967. the limit of 28 weeks is laid down in the infant life (preservation) act 1929. it is stated there that it is an offence to kill a child capable of being born alive. if an abortion takes place after 28 weeks of pregnancy the presumption is against the accused, that the child would have been borne alive, and the accused has to refute that presumption. that has always been a rebuttable presumption, and from 1965 onwards it was always possible for legitimate abortion to be carried out after 28 weeks, which was not an offence under the infant life (preservation) act.\\n           the difference between the corrie bill—if i may so call it—and this bill is that that arguable presumption was removed. any abortion carried out after 24 or 28 weeks would have been an offence. if people argue about whether that offence is desirable, they should then consider the circumstances. at present, very few abortions take place after 24 weeks. only 183 such abortions took place in 1977, and of those the majority were dictated by the circumstances of the life or health of the foetus or of the life or health of the mother. some people now say that we should shift the moral balance so that the time limit is held at 24 weeks or less. incidentally, this bill does not say that the limit should be 24 weeks or less. it says that the limit should be less than 24 weeks, which means 23 weeks, and when the two weeks that consultants allow as a buffer period are taken off, the limit is 21 weeks. if we say that the balance must be held at 21 weeks we are shifting the balance of moral concern from the life and the health of the mother, and the life and health of the other children, towards the foetus.\\n           given the circumstances that i have indicated, i do not believe that a foetus that is capable of being born alive will ever be destroyed, and that that is the right balance to hold. it means that we would stop the abortion of a foetus that would be born dead, and we would do so merely on the grounds of the moral concern of some people against the interest of the health and life of the mother and other children and towards the foetus. i do not believe that that is a desirable thesis.\\n           we should now say to the country as a whole, and to all those who campaigned against the 1967 bill, that we struck the right balance in 1967. it is the right balance for us now and we should hold to it in the future, and we should tell our constituents that. let us now vote against the bill in order to make that plain.\\n        ',

information from the government before we can proceed to an orderly debate on the first item of business. the composition and balance of the proposed select committee, the time that it is expected to take gathering evidence, particularly its terms of reference and scope, at which the leader of the house undertook to have another look, are matters about which we need to know more as early as possible if we are to have a constructive debate and come to a sensible conclusion.\\n           therefore, may i through you, mr. deputy speaker, ask whether the minister intends to give the house any information on this innovation in parliamentary practice which is being thrust upon us today and whether he will do so at an early stage in the forthcoming debate?\\n        \",

that the bill be now read a second time.\\n           i hope that the house will allow me to leave the explanation of the clauses and subsections to my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse), who has given me great help and assistance, together with the hon. member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine).\\n           the bill is an amending measure to the principal act, the abortion act 1967, which was sponsored by the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel). i do not want to waste the time of the house by going through the small print, because my hon. friend the member for pontypool, with his legal knowledge, will do a much better job.\\n           it is fair to state at the outset that had i been a member of this house in 1967 i would have voted for the original abortion bill. i take no hard line on abortion. however, i would have been in that lobby to get that legislation put on the statute book. therefore, i want to make it clear that, although there has been some talk about what is intended, i take no hard line on abortion. until such time as the \"new jerusalem\" comes along with no bad housing, no poverty and no alcoholic husbands, i insist that abortion must be made available for women with problems.\\n           i first became aware of the problems of the previous act in the 1970 election, when, although a liberal member had introduced it, the backlash fell upon the labour government. the labour government have some responsibility for the act because of their generosity in giving time for it to be debated. what concerns most people is the abuses which have come about because of the act. this is now a public scandal, especially in scotland. since the house was responsible for putting through the act, it is its duty to see exactly how it is working.\\n           the act has been working now for seven or eight years and public opinion demands that we look at it again. i recognise that many hon. members will think that i am not going far enough, and that many people with strong religious beliefs want the act repealed altogether. i and my fellow sponsors could not agree to that. however, on the other side of the coin, many people want abortion on demand. we hear the shrill voice of the guardian demanding this, but many people do not want it. we have tried to steer a middle course between the two contending lobbies and to produce a consensus bill. we can do a great deal to assuage public concern and perhaps end this persistent controversy. i wish to contain it, not to inflame it.\\n           the abuses which cause so much public concern operate largely in the private sector. most of the profound misgivings in the wider community, whatever view might be held about abortion, relate to late abortions. we must also consider the position of the live foetus or potentially live foetus and how it is disposed of, whether for research or even perhaps for commercial purposes.\\n           the base of commercial operators is the growing number of foreign women who are lured into britain in the knowledge that for cash a group of doctors will perform illegal abortions on request, totally ignoring the criteria of the act. i must stress this foreign traffic, not because i am anti-german, anti-french or anti-italian, but because of one of the comments in the lane report. i disagree with a good deal of the report, but i agree with it when it says: it would undoubtedly be more difficult, if not impossible, to ensure their implementation in respect of non-resident women\". the reference there is to counselling, after-care and making sure that these women get the attention they should have.\\n           we are not talking here about a marginal number of cases from abroad. the figures show that in 1971 the notified number of foreign women coming here was 30,000; in 1972 it was 49,000 and in 1973 it was 56,000. the house is too sophisticated, i think, to accept those figures. the lane committee had no doubt that they were incorrect. in paragraph 126, it said: because we are convinced that within the private sector some abortions are performed without any certificate being completed or without notification being given, we recommend that expert advice be taken as to the improvement of forms of certification and notification and as to the recording of these, so that an efficient check upon them may be made. the minister will no doubt give his views on that important matter, but there is general agreement that the figures for abortions for non-residents represent a gross understatement.\\n           investigations by the metropolitan police, reported in 1973, suggest that these figures represent only half the number of abortions carried out. they believe that the traffic in these clinics is worth £10 million a year. many of these women are treated worse than cattle. nine or 10 days ago, when the house debated the slaughter of animals, there was great emotion. i am delighted to see that so many hon. members have stayed today for this important bill.\\n           we are not concerned only with foreign women. we want a tighter control on these clinics, to ensure that skilled and ethical medical staff work in them. that is why the bill would provide for a precondition of approval of clinics by the secretary of state, with an adviser who was or had been a consultant approved by the secretary of state and with experience in the national health service. this would ensure that someone at a clinic had direct responsibility for supervising clinical procedures and for the appointment of doctors.\\n           women who go into these clinics are entitled to feel sure that they are properly conducted medically and surgically and that they are within the law. women are entitled to proper privacy, and to feel sure that they have had a genuine pregnancy test; society is entitled to be satisfied that the clinics are charging proper rates, keeping proper accounts and paying tax. the bill seeks to ensure that the survelliance and conduct of these private clinics accords with the standards i have mentioned.\\n           apart from the clinics themselves, the bill seeks to deal with parasitic pregnancy advising and referral bureaux which have acted as agents for existing private clinics. many are run by touting taxi drivers, former taxi drivers or spurious charities.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.4', 1, 'uk.m.21722', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'touts.\\n

run by non-medical people. the police have said that criminal gangs are suspected of having an interest. hijacking by touts and package deals for terminations have been practised by many of these agencies. the bill does not attempt to abolish them. what it does is make certain that only doctors and bureaux approved by the secretary of state will be permitted to give advice for payment and it lays down the proper criteria which would be required before approval could be given.\\n           it is, however, useless to seek to ensure the security of women, whether at private clinics or at bureaux, unless we alter the law to overcome the serious enforcement difficulties which at present exist and ensure that the will of the house operates properly in the private sector. there is no hidden intention behind the bill. the pro-abortion lobby has been talking about clauses of which it is suspicious. i and my fellow sponsors give our word to the house that no tricks are being played. we want to make the 1967 act work as it was intended to work.\\n           the other overriding aim of the bill is to end the situation in which it is possible for unborn children to be slain even though they have reached a stage at which modern techniques might enable them to survive. the whole of scotland was deeply shocked on 19th and 20th january 1969 when we were about to burn a live baby. i can repeat what a jury in the glasgow high court unanimously recommended—that in all cases, an infant approaching or of viable age must be subject to resuscitation, and secondly that legislation should be introduced prohibiting abortion when the foetus is approaching or has reached a state of viability. this matter caused great abhorrence in scotland.\\n           the house will readily agree with me that there should be no abortion after a gestation period of 20 weeks. we have taken this advice from sir john peel's report. he presided over a group of distinguished scientists and lawyers who were directing their attention to public concern about experiments on the foetus or foetus material. the other recommendations made by the peel committee we have placed in statutory form in part iii of the bill, as we believe that it will be the general wish that such sensitive experiments should be carried out under a proper code of conduct.\\n           i recognise that a bill of this kind put forward by a private member is bound to be ambitious, perhaps even over-ambitious. i know, too, that it is important on this occasion that we get amending legislation. if, therefore, i receive what i regard as an appropriate undertaking when the minister speaks later, it is right that i should tell the house immediately that i have it in mind, at a later stage in the debate, to ask the leave of the house to withdraw the bill. i am quite sure that the house will agree to this with the promises coming from the government.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0),

short speeches and rarely speak for more than 10 minutes. however, i may transgress a little today as there is much to be said on this subject.\\n           first, we should try to get the facts of the situation since 1967 clearly established in our minds. i want to remind the house that one of the main reasons why parliament passed the 1967 act was that we were determined as a house to stamp out from this country the scourge of criminal abortion. we can look back over the official figures of deaths of women in this country from abortion. we can see that they have been falling steadily from the high point of 62 in 1960, before the act, to the very small figure of 12 deaths last year from abortion, of which only six were from criminal abortion.\\n           there is ample evidence from the medical profession that criminal abortion has been virtually eliminated from britain. some members who met members of the medical profession in a room downstairs earlier this week were told of a renal dialysis unit which was set up in a hospital in london just before the 1967 act specially to deal with the after-effects on women who had taken drugs in an attempt to abort themselves. happily, that unit is now closed through lack of patients.\\n           we were told of the eye consultant who finds that in his practice he no longer has to deal with the effects on women who have either partially lost or in some cases wholly lost their sight through overdoses of quinine. such cases no longer come to him. we were told by a general practitioner in north london that in the course of his ordinary practice he used to have four or five patients a year who were tragic cases of sterility or were suffering from severe physical damage as a result of criminal abortion. he no longer has such cases.\\n           the official home office records show that there has been a drastic reduction in the number of criminal prosecutions each year for abortion offences. all of this is on the good side. it is necessary for the house to take a balanced view of the good and the bad in the working of the 1967 act.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'],

is the actual physical risk of abortion to women. in 1973 the overall death rate from legal abortion—abortion carried out under the legislation passed by the house—was 4 per 100,000, whereas the maternal mortality in the same year was 11 per 100.000. we must keep these figures in mind when looking at the overall picture following the passage of the 1967 act.\\n           no doubt there will be many references to the report of the lane committee. i quote paragraph 605 of the report: for the reasons we have outlined above, and which are much more fully dealt with in the body of the report, we are unanimous in supporting the act and its provisions. we have no doubt that the gains facilitated by the act have much outweighed any disadvantages for which it has been criticised. the problems which we have identified in its working, and they are admittedly considerable, are problems for which solutions should be sought by administrative and professional action, and by better education of the public. they are not, we believe, indications that the grounds set out in the act should be amended in a restrictive way. to do so when the number of unwanted pregnancies is increasing and before comprehensive services are available to all who need them would be to increase the sum of human suffering and ill-health, and probably to drive more women to seek the squalid and dangerous help of the back-street abortionist. again, we must not overlook that fundamental conclusion of the lane committee when we are considering the criticisms which we must make, and i shall come on to make them, of how the act has been working.\\n           secondly, it is right that we should look at the level of abortion since the passage of the act. it is true that as facilities have been improving, both in the national health service and among particularly the charitable organisations operating in the private sector, the abortion figures in britain since 1968 have been on the increase. however, there have been those in the house who in times past have gone on forecasting that these figures are bound to go on increasing all the time and the time will shortly come when we have a quarter of a million abortions a year.\\n           it must, therefore, be with some relief that the house notes that in 1974 we saw the first downturn in the number of abortions under the act—163,000, a decrease of 3,000—in england and wales over the year before and that in scotland in two years running the numbers of abortions have decreased.\\n           it is not only the number of abortions that matters. the

200,000—nobody really knows. it must therefore be an estimate. what we know is that the figure of maternal deaths from abortion has substantially decreased since the operation of the act and, therefore, the criminal section must have decreased.\\n           i was coming on to say that the house must look at the law in britain in relation to the law in other countries. the standard method of measurement for this is the number of abortions as a ratio of the number of live births. one then gets a figure for the rate of abortion in britain compared with the rate of abortion in some other countries.\\n           the latest year for which i have comparative figures—they are taken from an american publication—is 1972, so i concede that the figures may be two years out of date and there may be some slight variation since. in 1972 the figure of abortions in england and wales was 154 per 1,000 live births. in norway in the same year it was 186 per 1,000 live births. in finland it was 337 per 1,000 live births. in japan it was 375. in california it was 369. in new york it was 650.\\n           if one goes behind the iron curtain to countries where there is no proper family planning provision, one finds that in bulgaria there were 985 abortions per 1,000 live births and in hungary the extraordinary figure of 1,228 abortions per 1,000 live births. in other words, the rate of abortion there was higher than the number of live births.\\n           therefore, the point i am making is that for people to use the very simple and attractive slogan \"london, the abortion capital

overall international picture and then the picture painted of london will be seen not to be correct.\\n           then the house is entitled to look at what is happening to the state of the abortion law in other parts of the world since we ourselves made changes. i should like to give the house a few examples. in austria a new abortion law came into force on 1st january of this year. it permits legal abortion at the request of the patient in the first three months of pregnancy. in denmark since 1973 legal abortion has been available at the request of the patient during the first three months of pregnancy and thereafter on medical indications. in france a new law was approved by the senate in december and abortion will be available at the request of the patient during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy, provided that she has consulted a doctor and a social worker.\\n           in west germany a new law has just been passed by the parliament and is now before the constitutional court. it makes abortion available at the request of the patient during the first three months of pregnancy. sweden further liberalised its law last year. abortion is available at the request of the patient up to 18 weeks and thereafter on medical indications. in new york abortion is available on request up to 24 weeks. in the netherlands the existing law is now interpreted to permit abortion at the request of the patient up to 12 weeks.\\n           already there are developments in other countries. in norway the state of the law is being considered. norway's existing law is similar to ours and a new bill is being introduced to make abortion available on request up to three months. in belgium the government have agreed in principle to liberalise the abortion law, but the terms of the new bill have not yet been published. in italy there is great controversy over a bill which was tabled last month, and there is considerable controversy within that country.\\n           while on the subject of italy, i think it right to draw attention to a report in the guardian from its correspondent there saying that in italy it is estimated that, because 2,000 women a year die as a result of illegal abortion, abortion being totally illegal in italy, there must be something like 2 million criminal abortions a year in that country. looking round the world in abortion terms, therefore, i think one can say that we are a less hypocritical society with our existing abortion law than one whose law pretends that abortion does not exist but which allows a scandal of that kind to go on.\\n        \",

paragraph 443: much of the adverse criticism is justified: in consequence of the abortion act a situation has arisen in which a very small number, of perhaps about 20 or 30 members, of the medical profession and those associated with them have brought considerable reproach on this country, both at home and abroad. i agree with that conclusion. it was never the intention of the house when we passed the act that we should have a situation in which commercial referral agencies would establish themselves in association with private clinics, and in which doctors on a moneymaking basis could advertise abroad, bringing people here and paying back-handers to taxi drivers, in order to make as much money as possible. whatever varying views may be held in the house on the abortion issue itself, this is a trade which is repulsive and repugnant to public opinion, and it is certainly far from parliament's intention in the 1967 act.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0),

 while it is the responsibility of the house to decide the ethical basis on which the law should rest, in my view it is the responsibility of the government, once parliament decides the ethical basis of the law, to ensure that the law is administered fairly and competently and without abuse.\\n           i think that one can sum up the basic ethical attitude to abortion both in the house and among the public generally in this way. there are, broadly, three views. there are those who equate abortion virtually with murder, who do not accept that abortion should be allowed under the law except to save the life of the woman. that is a view held by a number of hon. members, and it is reflected in much of the correspondence which we all receive. next, there is the extreme opposite view which says—particularly in international women\\'s year—that abortion should not be a matter controlled or decided by the medical profession but that, up to a certain stage of pregnancy, it should be the right of the individual woman to decide for herself. that also is a view held by some hon. members and by some people outside.\\n           the view which was embodied in the 1967 act, however, was neither of those. it was simply the view—it is my personal view too—that abortion is something which should be judged in each individual case, being decided according to the facts in each individual case.\\n           if that remains the view of the house and we wish to project it forward in our law, this is an issue on which the government should remain neutral. but once the house has affirmed that as its wish and intention, the government cannot, i believe, remain neutral on the administration of the law.\\n           i have always held that view, and in 1969 i went to see the then secretary of state for social services, the late dick crossman, to discuss the abuses of the act. i suppose that i might as well get my version of the meeting on record before it appears elsewhere. the hon. member for west lothian (mr. dalyell), who was his pps at the time, was present at the meeting and will, no doubt, correct me if i am wrong.\\n           i put it to dick crossman that when the act was passed in 1967 one of its provisions was that the minister would approve private clinics for the time being. that was the phrase in the act. i argued with him that the intention of parliament was that the minister should have the right to withdraw approval from any place in respect of which he had reason to suspect that it was being operated against public or parliamentary opinion. he did not have to have any standard of proof. he did not have to have any particular reasons stated. he had total power under the 1967 act.\\n           dick crossman argued that he was advised to the contrary. i think that \"advised\" is the important expression, in view of what he had had to say about civil servants. he was, he said, advised to the contrary, and his powers were limited to matters such as making sure that the sheets were changed regularly, that there was the right number of beds per room and the like.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0),

of course, sir george godber was the person advising the minister.\\n           i recognise that i must draw my speech to a close, and i turn now to another matter of concern which is covered in the bill—the hon. member for pollok referred to it specifically—namely, the vexed question of the legal definition of viability. there is a great deal of misunderstanding about this. the 1967 act made no change in the law on this matter. the law of viability is established by the infant life (preservation) act 1929. the attention of the medical profession was drawn to that act and the principle was reasserted in the 1967 act. however, there is misunderstanding even about what the 1929 act says.\\n           the infant life (preservation) act establishes that it is an offence of child destruction and murder to destroy a viable foetus, and it then says that for the purposes of that act it is assumed that any foetus of 28 weeks\\' age must by definition be viable. but there is no counter-assumption, there is nothing in the law saying that, therefore, any foetus of less than 28 weeks is assumed to be nonviable. this is an extremely important point. i very much agree here with the peel committee\\'s report and the lane committee\\'s report, both of which found that developments in medical science since 1929 obviously made it essential to say that the 28-weeks presumption in the 1929 act was out of date and that the period must be reduced.\\n           my submission is that that has nothing to do with the abortion act. the home office and the department of health and social security must make up their mind what the limit shall be, and this must affect a whole range of matters—abortion, registration of deaths, and so on—but that is a matter for government decision: and it is not for an inexpert house to decide what is the right limit to lay down. certainly i am not in disagreement with the hon. member for pollok when he says that, in principle, it is time that legislation—it must be by legislation—was introduced dealing with this matter.\\n           clause 1 of the bill would be retrogressive. i remind the hon. member that the adjectives \"serious\" and \"grave\" which he seeks to introduce were in the original draft of my bill when i presented it to the house in 1967. these adjectives did not appear in the act because of the advice we had during the passage of the bill. all of that advice was against those words.\\n           i quote from the joint submission of the british medical association and the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists published in the british medical journal of 31st december 1966. this influenced the house. this is what it said: provided the above safeguards are incorporated it is both unnecessary and undesirable to frame the indications for termination too narrowly. the requirements that the risk has to be serious and the injury to health grave in clause 1(1)( a ) are capable of causing considerable difficulties in practice and may mean that terminations carried out on certain medical indications which are accepted under current medical practice would become questionable in future.

that any such alterations in the wording would result in a better implementation of the intention of parliament as we understand it to have been. prosecution for breaches of the act based upon an absence of medical 'opinion formed in good faith' would hardly be rendered any less difficult than it is now if other limiting words were substituted. accordingly, we do not recommend any relevant amendment of the act. one of the most serious criticisms of the bill is that the words in clause 1 have to be read in conjunction with clause 11. some hon. members will have received a memorandum from the haldane society of lawyers on this point. it says of clause 11, and i agree with it: clause 11 shifts the burden of proof on to a doctor to prove that the statutory requirements have been complied with, once it is proved that he or she has carried out or assisted at an abortion. this breaks the fundamental principle of our law, that it is for the prosecution to prove a defendant's guilt, rather than for a defendant to prove his or her innocence. i must tell the hon. member for pollok that what i fear, if the house were to approve the bill as it stands, is that the combined effect of trying to redefine the grounds set out in the 1967 act and clause 11—putting an onus of proof on to the medical practitioner—would be bound to cause a whole new area of uncertainty among the medical profession. it would be bound to cause a substantial reduction in the availability of safe, legal abortions under the national health service.\\n           it would be a paradox if the hon. member's bill became law and the result was, first, an increase in illegal abortions as people were turned away by the medical profession under the terms of the new act, and secondly even more ridiculous, if those who had been making money out of the 1967 act were to turn their trade in reverse and organise flights of women to other countries in europe where abortion is now more readily available.\\n           it is right that from time to time the house should reassess its view on the state of the law on abortion. it is just as right that it should do this as it was right that we reviewed a few weeks ago our minds and attitudes on the question of capital punishment. thereafter, once we have settled the matter and decided what the law is, the responsibility lies with the government to see that it is administered properly. if the hon. member decides to seek leave to withdraw his bill i hope that the house will grant that leave.\\n           i am not at all hostile to the select committee

of the principles involved. all hon. members who have participated, as many of us have, in this abortion controversy over the years are painfully aware that there exist in britain two highly vocal minorities and two utterly irreconcilable lobbies. they are ceaselessly importuning public opinion, for ever seeking to influence and manipulate the media and hon. members.\\n           they have only one feature in common—they both represent only a small proportion of our electors. as has been said, on the one hand a small proportion believes in abortion on demand while on the other a small proportion believes that only a grave risk to the life of the mother can justify any abortion. the view that was confirmed by the lane committee, that only a small minority wanted abortion on demand, has yet again been corroborated in the figures proffered to us by gallup in the past fortnight, when only 18 per cent. declared a belief that abortion should be so available and 12 per cent. declared that it should not be allowed in any circumstances.\\n           both these minorities are passionately convinced that they are right. the abortionists claim that they are the liberators of women, bringing an extension of their freedom. the opponents of abortion declare that it brings them not freedom but enslavement to the selfishness of a narcissistic lover, fearful of taking steps towards potential parenthood and maturation, even as it enslaves a woman to the husband who treats her as a convenience to be periodically flushed out.\\n           the pro-abortionist speaks of women's rights; the anti-abortionist speaks of women's needs. the abortionist claims concern for the unmarried mother forced to have an unwanted child she cannot tend, while the anti-abortionist challenges that claim and insists that it masks a punitive victorian attitude, offering an unmarried mother the scalpel and not the social aid she requires.\\n           the abortionist pleads the case of the woman with many children living in intolerable housing conditions, while the opponent says that that establishes a case for better housing or vasectomoy for the husband. when the abortionists assert, as they do, the dignity of a woman's demand that she alone must have the option the anti-abortionist becomes the advocate of the right to life of the unborn child. the abortionist regards the operation as safe and usually as a triviality. the anti-abortionist produces evidence to establish that it is a trauma bringing the threat of subsequent sterility.\\n           both declare their opponents to be reactionaries. one declares the other adversary to be nostalgically yearning for the old restrictive morality that denied woman her equality. the retort is made that turning life into death is the ultimate hallmark of the reactionary and that a genuine progressive does not yield to defeatism but fights for the creation of a society where every child, whether born in a manger or a palace, can be warmly received.\\n           the abortionist points the finger at the delinquency rate and its link with the unwanted and the deprived child. the anti-abortionist denies the necessity for any child to be unwanted in britain and draws our attention to the long waiting list of would-be adopters. one insists that without untrammelled access to abortion a woman can be crushed by anxiety and the quality of her personal relationship severely diminished. the other insists that the ease of abortion coarsens our society and undermines respect for the sanctity of life and is the penultimate step to euthanasia and a hitlerian disregard for the disabled, the weak and the aged.\\n           the partisans on both sides in this issue are highly confident of the justice and morality of their cause. they yield not one inch to the other.\\n           it is my hope that the house will be impatient with those who, however well motivated, seek in this debate to detain the house with yet further rehearsals of all the well-worn and passionately held arguments. although the bill inevitably disappoints those at both ends of the abortionist spectrum, the sponsors of the bill, whatever their personal philosophies, religions or prejudices, have determinedly set out with the objective of eschewing, if possible, the old arguments. we recognise, however, if gallup is right, that the overwhelming majority of opinion of the nation generally believes that abortion is necessary but necessary only on particular grounds.\\n           the bill retains the existing grounds for abortion. i shall come to the point made by the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel), the sponsor of the 1967 bill. i assert that the bill now before the house retains the existing grounds for abortion. in no way does it attack or modify the existing environmental clause. its objectives are clear and unmarked. first, it seeks to end abuse by ensuring that parliament's intentions of 1967 are genuinely carried out. secondly, it seeks to respond to the repugnancy that comes from the public against the abortion of late pregnancies and to ensure that when experiments are conducted they are not conducted upon what sir john peel's committee and most of us would regard as an unborn child.\\n           of course, there is a gap which must always exist between the intentions behind a bill and the fulfilment of those intentions in cold print. these dangers increase when a private member's bill is drafted without the sophisticated assistance of the skilled parliamentary draftsmen. inevitably errors or unintentional interpretations creep in that are often far removed from the wishes of the sponsors. but if there is no other method open to the sponsors they must plod on in the hope that in committee, as outside bodies make their importunings, a more relevant measure will be able to emerge to the house on report.\\n           inevitably, there is always a danger of such a bill becoming very much an ad hoc affair, as i well know from my own experience. i am sure that the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles will acknowledge that many of the problems we are now dealing with stem not from wicked intentions but from good intentions which have been frustrated. the evils of which we are largely complaining—a large section of the house complains of them—emerge from the interstices of the original act and from unintended gaps in the clause.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'],

in the distance, but they are tolling for the avaricious who have sought to create a repugnant industry based on women in difficulty. if the government had not grasped the nettle it would have been necessary for me to go through the bill ad seriatim, but in view of developments i would rather pinpoint some of the matters that have aroused great controversy. some of them have already been identified. perhaps it will be of some assistance to the select committee to be appointed if i do so, because i am sure that all the views that are expressed in this debate will act as a sounding board for those members upon whom will fall the onerous task of sitting upon the committee.\\n           i begin with a point raised by the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles on clause 1( a )(ii). he seemed to think that it was material to restrict the existing ground upon which an abortion can be given. that is not the intention. on the contrary, the passage is an attempt to ensure that the existing grounds are observed. at present the risk to the life of a woman or of injury to her physical or mental health has to be measured against the risk which would result if the pregnancy went the full term. that is the provision of the parent act. that measure was inserted not by the hon. gentleman but by the house of lords to assist the courts in deciding whether a criminal abortion had taken place.\\n           unfortunately, some people have used that insertion to frustrate the will of parliament. on public platforms a small number of doctors have said that it permits them to give abortion on demand. they have said again this week that the very small statistical risk to the life of a woman in childbirth is slightly higher than the risk to the life of a woman from induced abortion during the first 12 weeks, and they have used that argument to justify abortion on demand in any pregnancy.\\n           the figures of deaths due to childbirth and the figures of death due to medically induced abortion are not comparable, because deaths due to childbirth usually occur in women suffering from disease or other abnormality, whereas deaths due to abortion in the early stages of pregnancy would usually occur in a healthy woman—[an hon. member: \"that is a specious argument.\"] if it is a specious argument, it shows how important it is that there should be a change. if the statistical argument is correct, it means that we have unwittingly given abortion on demand, and the present position adds considerably to the heavy enforcement difficulties which already exist.\\n           it is no use the hon. gentleman pointing out how few are the cases of criminal abortion. cases are not brought because the law, as it stands, cannot be enforced and cases cannot be proceeded with. that is the unsatisfactory feature of the whole procedure. one idiosyncratic professor made clear in the press conference which was given by the abortion on demand group this week that he has no qualms about interpreting the act in this statistical manner. he also said that if we altered the act he would defy the law.\\n           the serious point is not that a way-out professor takes that view but that the fact that the view can be held gives immunity to every shady abortionist doctor who may exist in the private sector. faced with that strategy to impose upon the house a wish contrary to that laid down, we have ended within the bill the measuring test and, instead, we have said that the risk to the life of a woman should be grave. the house may not like that but if we leave it as \"risk\" it is clear that the people who are using these strategems now will say \"any risk\". that would mean that we were back to square one. therefore, we put the view that there should be some qualifying adjective. we suggest that there should be a qualifying word—\"serious\" \"grave\", \"substantial\".\\n           the hon. gentleman used the phrase \"substantial\" in his bill to measure the likelihood of a child being born malformed or maladjusted, and the term \"substantial\" is used within the bill governing that aspect. so, whether or not we use that word, the fact is, if we are serious and say that we want to have abortion on certain conditions but not on demand, we are faced, and the select committee will be faced, with having to consider not limiting the grounds for abortion but complying with the will of the house, which is that those other grounds should not continue to be frustrated by people who are camouflaging their intentions by saying that they do not want change because they are able to so manipulate the bill that they can provide abortion on demand—demand with cash.\\n           the intention of clause 1( b ) has been wilfully misrepresented. it surely cannot be satisfactory that private clinics which are defying the law should have no one directly responsible who can be brought before the general medical council or be pinpointed as having responsibility for the proper conduct of a clinic. that is necessary not only for law enforcement but for the women who place themselves in the hands of the clinic. it seemed to the sponsors to be perfectly reasonable that a nursing home should have a consultant adviser who is perhaps on a part-time national health service contract or retired and who in his private capacity can be under contract with the nursing home to supervise clinical procedures, the appointment of medical staff, and the use of the clinic by other doctors.\\n           clause 2 was mentioned by the hon. gentleman. it deals with foreign women who come to this country for the specific purpose of having an abortion. the latest figures, which are well above 50,000, i view with some scepticism. i wonder whether there is growing alarm about this trade as we become more aware of it and public opinion shows its repugnance. is that leading to a decrease in notifications rather than a genuine drop? both the lane committee and the metropolitan police have made it abundantly clear that they know that the notifications are spurious. although we can depend upon the genuineness of notifications coming from within the national health service, we cannot depend on the figures coming from the private sector, which has one eye on the inland revenue and one on the ball. if the police are right, about 100,000 abortions a year may be performed on foreign women who come here for that purpose. are the sponsors right and is the country right in demanding an end to this trade, or are the complacent or defeatist suggestions of the lane committee the last word on the subject? the select committee will have to consider this.\\n           the lane committee put forward the view—which would not appeal to many of my hon. friends and fellow-countrymen—that we cannot do anything that would offend against common market regulations. that argument no longer stands, and in my judgment it never did as, since the publication of the lane report, france has passed a law not much less stringent than the terms of the bill to deal with women who come into france to have abortions.\\n           will this trade fade away? the lane report suggested that it would if there was legislation less strong than that proposed in clauses 4 and 5. would it fade away if advertising were controlled? with such a restriction, would it be more difficult for the agencies which lure women from the continent to this country? thirdly, the lane committee suggested that the law was changing in other countries and, therefore, we could be reassured that this trade would not continue.\\n           i think that is taking a very complacent view. if we look at the french law on these matters, it makes it abundantly clear that the french authorities will not permit an abortion beyond 10 weeks. even if this bill went through, the period in this country would be reduced to 20 weeks, so that there is a huge gap in that respect. therefore, it is naïve to believe that other countries will pass identical abortion laws to our own. there are so many different abortion laws being passed that, if we leave the law as it is, people who want to evade the laws in their own country will try to come here.\\n           people who talk glibly about the french introducing much more permissive legislation than ours have never studied the french act. under the french legislation a minor is prohibited from having an abortion at all. i do not know whether those who are so anxious to support the private sector and to keep those abortion clinics going ever study the facts. i do not want to see hordes of teenagers coming here from other countries to have abortions—operations which in their own countries would be regarded as improper.\\n           if the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles, instead of merely looking at his brief on this matter, takes a look at the french legislation, he will find that it contains far more stringent requirements. it provides that a woman must go to her doctor to ask for an abortion and will be provided with a dossier which she will have to produce to the social agency. the social agency will consider within that dossier all the alternatives available to the woman. the point i am making is that it is too complacent of people merely to believe that the passing of other abortion laws in other lands will automatically lead to a serious diminution in the number of girls who want to come to the united kingdom for abortions.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975,

matter within the bill. i do not believe anybody can be at all happy with the present position and all will surely want the matter to be reviewed by the select committee. i refer to the situation referred to recently in articles in the times as a result of correspondence with the department. the view appears to be coming into existence that if a man is at present in an appointment, that is satisfactory and the conscience clause goes. but it seems to be becoming the practice that the conscience clause is little used. in other words, men or women who apply for appointments find that because they have a genuine conscientious objection they cannot gain appointments within the national health service. i believe that this is profoundly disturbing. there are gynaecologists who believe that their rôle is to bring life into this world and who find it too repugnant that their task should include the ending of life.\\n           in previous legislation the onus of proof related to whether a man had a genuine conscientious objection. the onus was on the man who objected. this put a heavy burden on the individual, and i emphasise that a practice is now growing up where a man finds that he cannot obtain an appointment because of conscience. that surely is a situation of which the house cannot approve and it will have to be dealt with by the select committee.\\n        ',

friday. my brief experience of private members' bills is that more often we are encouraged to speak longer rather than shorter for certain well-established procedural reasons. however, today is different.\\n           the speech by the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) was useful to the house because it gave us a resumé, obviously from his own point of view, of the workings of the act since 1967. i think it was useful to set the scene for this debate.\\n           i agree with the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse) that the abuses known to hon. members who have taken an interest in the subject must be removed, that that is the demand of public opinion and that the sooner it is done the better. if i may use his analogy, i do not think i shall follow him any further into the bush now.\\n           there is widespread agreement that changes must be made. since 1967 there have been three attempts at closing one of the particularly unpleasant loopholes which i believe everyone agrees should be closed. my hon. friend the member for ravensbourne (mr. hunt) introduced his medical services (referral) bill in 1972 to try to have the referral agencies and bureaux controlled by charitable bodies. he found that he was in difficulties with that bill.\\n           i tried on two occasions to introduce my own private member's bill to tie up this area more tightly and to bring it within the control of the secretary of state. i welcome the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) to the club which is trying to deal with this area, because in clause 5 of his bill he makes a very sincere attempt to do so. my only doubts about the bill concern two clauses. but the hon. member for pollok should be congratulated on giving us the opportunity to debate this subject.\\n           there has been a common feeling in the discussions since 1967 on the three private members' bills to deal with this loophole. it may be that in many ways it has been concentrated on because it is a simple one to close. therefore, i think it is an even greater pity that it was not done before.\\n           in my last private member's bill i managed to obtain support from people on both sides of the argument, from both the pro- and the anti-abortionists. that was perhaps useful. the need to end the scandals going on in this area is a matter about which the house should seek urgent action to be taken quickly.\\n           the fact that totally unscrupulous people, even though probably only a few, are still operating in this area brings into disrepute the whole work done by the referral agencies and the excellent work done by the charitable british pregnancy advisory service, with branches in liverpool, brighton, leamington and in other parts of the country. they have done a great deal of work in helping people, charging a modest fee of £50 for termination, including the stay in hospital. the unscrupulous bodies need to be brought under control quickly. this area has been described as the unacceptable face of the abortion world, and i think the house today wishes to see it dealt with very quickly. i support that.\\n           i note that the hon. member for pollok proposes a number of refinements. he has gone a little further than i did in my private member's bill. that is to be applauded and is a matter at which the house should look. the tragedy is that if only parliament had passed one of those three private members' bills—it does not matter which, but mine preferably because it brought them all together—those loopholes would have been closed and this unattractive traffic would have been stopped. however, that is past history. we must ensure that we deal with the problem now.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0,

the house together on the one theme that i believe is common ground. when i started to do something about amending the abortion act, i recognised that if we went too far—as perhaps the hon. member for pollok will see if his bill goes forward—we would find ourselves in the most awful muddle and would have to fight the battles of 1967 all over again. perhaps that would end only in stalemate.\\n           i hope that the house will decide to set up the select committee and pay great attention to its report. i hope that the select committee will take evidence from the good charitable agencies such as the bpas, and i hope too that its members will go out and investigate some of the bad aspects. they should see the taxi touts and take evidence on the ground, if they can. only by going around—as i have found it possible to do—will they see what is happening. this bill, however, seeks to go a little further, and there are two matters on which i wish to concentrate.\\n           clause 2 deals with foreigners. when i came to consider what amendments should be made to the abortion act, this was an aspect which struck me at the time. everyone has been worried for a considerable time—certainly worried in the superficial sense—about the fact that our capital city is coming to be known as the abortion centre of the world. however, the more one considers the problem, the more difficult it is to deal with, the more illogicality begins to creep in and the more we get into what might be described as a cat's cradle situation.\\n           is there any fairness in saying that british people can have abortions legally in this country but that foreigners cannot? in any event, how do we establish who is a foreigner? as far as i know, doctors do not ask their patients for their passports. the hon. member for loughborough (mr. cronin), as a distinguished member of the profession, will confirm, i am sure, that it is not the practice to ask patients for their passports. we do not have identity cards.\\n           such a provision would throw up immense administrative difficulties. what is more, it would throw an immense burden of enforcement on to the medical profession. linked with the administrative difficulties there are moral difficulties in deciding whether it is right to say that foreigners can no longer have abortions legally.\\n           then there are practical linguistic difficulties. a great many foreigners have become naturalised. many of them from european countries still have guttural accents. with a provision of this kind in the abortion legislation, they would be assumed to be foreigners. if they protested and said that they were naturalised, they would be asked for their papers. that is not the kind of imposition which we want to put upon the medical profession. i understand the views of those who say that there should be such a provision. however, i say that it should be considered in practical and moral terms.\\n           perhaps the most difficult problem relates to clause 7. the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles dealt very well with the difficulties involved in the 20-week upper limit.\\n           we all agree that since the passing of the 1929 infant life (preservation) act medical science has advanced. foetuses born very early which in 1929 would have died can now be preserved in an incubator.\\n           the problem is whether we can take a decision of this kind in a private member's bill, and that is one aspect which troubles me slightly. if we had consultations with the medical profession, my guess is that no one would expect any unanimity of opinion about what the upper limit should be. in any event, such consultations could be undertaken only under the auspices of the secretary of state for social services. when we are dealing with a tricky matter of this kind, i do not think that it is possible for it to be done by a private member's bill. certainly i would not seek to judge whether it should be 20 weeks or 24 weeks.\\n           in a lay sense, i was convinced by what the lane committee said about it. it came down in the end in favour of 24 weeks. but a select committee can consider that and call evidence about it, and in the end the government will have to have consultations. after all, the government are the doctors' employer. the right hon. lady can send for the doctors. we cannot. i accept that a select committee can do so, and it may be that that would be one of the advantages of adopting the procedure suggested by the government.\\n        \",

may recommend much more than the bill includes. it may go much further. it seems to me that if a select committee is to consider the working of the abortion act, it will want a pretty wide writ.\\n

that the select committee should look into and take evidence about the proposals in the bill. if that is done, the abuses referred to by the hon. member for pontypool will have a better chance of

is a subject on which there are strongly held and sincerely held views on all sides of the house. it is a subject on which there is no division on party lines. traditionally, legislation in this

a select committee offers a way of ensuring that any future legislation to amend the 1967 act will be soundly based.\\n           i now deal with the lane committee\\'s report. it was received at the end of 1973, and there has been extensive consultation on many of its recommendations. it is a major report, and it deserves detailed study by the house. the lane committee concluded that by facilitating a greatly increased number of abortions the 1967 act has relieved a vast amount of individual suffering. in the committee\\'s view the act has also helped to focus attention on the paramount need for preventive action, for more education in sexual life and its responsibilities and for the widespread provision of contraceptive advice and facilities. i am glad to say that the government are now embarking on the introduction of a free and comprehensive family planning service—something which i must say to the house in my view is long overdue and should have preceded and not followed the 1967 act, but that is no fault of the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel).\\n           the committee has rightly drawn attention to the strain imposed on the national health service by the increased number of women seeking legal abortion since the passing of the act and the marked inequalities over the country in the provision of services, and this worries many hon. members. the committee recognised that shortages of resources are only one of the reasons for this and that inequalities in provision cannot be abolished altogether. this is an inevitable feature of legislation that requires the exercise of medical discretion and clinical judgment.\\n           the point about conscience, which my hon. friend raised, is a serious one. the letters were quoted only in part, and i should be happy to place copies of them in the library. discussions have taken place with the medical profession, and we have an agreed procedure. this is a complex issue and it is one of the matters which the select committee might wish to examine.\\n           i come now to the immediate issue before the house today, namely, private sector abortions. the committee acknowledges that the private sector has enabled many patients to have treatment in privacy and with the amenities they want and has compensated to a considerable extent for deficiencies in the provision of services by the nhs. at the same time it points out that the private sector has contributed to the inequalities of which many responsible people complain. it concludes that a small number of doctors and their financial backers have used the act to make large sums of money, that there have been instances of gross irresponsibility in private medical practice, and that in some parts of the commercial private sector the provisions of the act have been flouted and abortion on request has been provided. the committee is convinced that these abuses have been confined to a small number of doctors, but these are serious charges and the government have taken action on them.\\n           since taking office my right hon. friend and i have made a rigorous reappraisal of the whole approval system. we are both convinced that the private sector has not operated in the way that the act intended. we have already taken action to tighten up on abuses in the private sector, and i shall deal with these in some detail. we will certainly not rest until all exploitation of patients has been stopped and abuses of the act curbed. we intend using our existing powers to their utmost to control the activities of the private abortion sector, and we do not intend waiting until any new legislation is recommended by the select committee. on the principle of the need to prevent abuse in the private sector, the government agree with the sponsors of the bill and are ready to consider legislation.\\n           it is, however, fair to point out that in the lane committee\\'s view the great majority of the abortions which have been carried out in the nhs and many in the private sector have been fully justified under the act.\\n           the sponsors of the bill have seen the prevention of abuse in the private sector as one of their main objectives. clause 5 of the bill picks up the main provision of the private member\\'s bill sponsored by the hon. member for surrey, north-west (mr. grylls), who has just spoken. it adds some other provisions, some of which need to be examined in depth, but the government supported the previous bill and it was recommended by the lane committee. apart from some detailed points, the government support the principle of legislation in the important area of pregnancy advice bureaux. we will see what by administrative means we can do about the matter in the meantime.\\n           clause 6 lays down statutory conditions for approval of private clinics. this is at present dealt with administratively under section 1(3) of the abortion act. there are some strong arguments for retaining the flexibility that comes with the administrative means, and the lane committee recommended continuing with the existing system. but if the select committee decided to recommend legislation the government would be content to have statutory powers, though they would like to retain as much flexibility as possible to respond rapidly to meet changing circumstances and any new potential abuse.\\n           there is, therefore, considerable common ground between the sponsors and the government and, indeed, the lane report on the need for legislation to cover the private sector. from the con tributions that have already been made, i think that the majority of members of the house want to see an end to abuse in the private sector, whatever views they take on the 1967 act. we have, as i have already said, taken vigorous action to toughen up our administrative procedures only recently.\\n           firstly, we have registered only until 31st march private clinics where abortion is a major aspect of their work. a letter was sent on 3rd january to the 28 nursing homes with six or more beds, or more than 25 per cent. of their total beds, approved under the abortion act. the letter asked for information on such matters as the facilities and treatment provided for patients, the fees charged, relationships with pregnancy advisory bureaux, and the intake of foreign patients. nursing homes were also asked to comment on a list of proposed conditions for pregnancy advisory bureaux. replies have now been received from all but one of these nursing homes.\\n           on the same day a letter was sent to some 70 bureaux and referral agencies known or believed to be giving advice and aid on obtaining abortions setting out proposed conditions. less than half of these agencies have replied. obviously we cannot approve those who have not.\\n           the nursing homes concerned fall into a number of broadly distinct types. many clinics regard themselves as providing facilities for consultants to treat their private patients, although there may be a fairly small number of such consultants who use the clinics\\' facilities regularly.\\n           we already have a fairly effective system for keeping medical and surgical facilities and practice under surveillance. in fact we can stop an abortion taking place in a private operating theatre, but we have little power to stop the gastrectomy or another more major surgical operation in the same private operating theatre. this is something which we shall have to look at as part of an overall policy to the private sector of medical care. fees are an obvious area for exploitation in the private sector, and reports of some fees have been absurdly high.\\n           the government will now consider, after consulting the medical profession, specifying for each nursing home a fair fee for a termination or for provision of facilities as a condition for continued approval under the abortion act.\\n           we may also decide to go further and require all approved nursing homes to quote a fixed comprehensive fee. this move would help to standardise charges and to ensure that prospective clients know approximately how much an abortion costs. i would naturally wish to discuss such a proposition with the medical profession but i thought that this example would give an indication of the areas and ways in which we could possibly act by administrative means.\\n           in general, the clinics which employ their own medical staff also provide counselling and assessment. the clinics which provide only facilities receive most of their patients from independent consultants. the smaller agencies appear to exist by referring clients to these consultants.\\n           well-conducted nursing homes would almost universally welcome an approved list of approved bureaux and would be willing to give assurances that they would not accept patients referred by bureaux which were not on this list.\\n           many of the bureaux which replied to our letter wished to apply for inclusion on an approved list and were prepared to operate under conditions required by the department. the complete list of conditions has not been finalised, and some points will need further consideration, but we are determined, in any period which will elapse before legislation is enacted, to tighten up considerably on pregnancy advice bureaux. there has been some argument about our powers under administrative means. no doubt interpretation differs but, given the general feeling of the house, it seems that we would be well within our powers in taking these measures.\\n           i come now to perhaps the most controversial aspect of the abortion act and the lane committee\\'s report—whether or not there should be any restrictive amendments made to the grounds for abortion. this matter is also raised by the present bill. the lane committee, at the end of two and a half years—i think i owe it to the committee to make this quotation, although it has in part been quoted before—concluded: we are unanimous in supporting the act and its provisions. we have no doubt that the gains facilitated by the act have much outweighed any disadvantages for which it has been criticised. the problems which we have identified in its working, and they are admittedly considerable, are problems for which solutions should be sought by administrative and professional action, and by better education of the public. they are not, we believe, indications that the grounds set out in the act should be amended in a restrictive way. to do so when the number of unwanted pregnancies is increasing and before comprehensive services are available to all who need them would be to increase the sum of human suffering and ill-health, and probably drive more women to seek the squalid and dangerous help of the back-street abortionist. the committee was unanimous in its conclusion that there should be no restrictive amendment to the grounds for abortion set out in the act.\\n           my hon. friend\\'s bill makes a provision which, if implemented, would remove from the criteria for abortion the balance of risk between pregnancy and termination of pregnancy and qualify the risks as \"grave\" or \"serious\".\\n           the effect of the provision is restrictive and is therefore contrary to the central conclusion of the lane committee that there should be no restrictive amendment of the grounds for abortion set out in the act. the lane committee reports to this house and legislation is framed in this house. it is right that a serious report recommending legislation should be considered first by a select committee and then by this house as a whole.\\n           the full import of this provision is not apparent unless it is read with the provisions of clause 11 which places upon the doctor the onus of proof that he has complied with the requirements of the act. the words in section 1(1)( a ) of the present act, greater than if the pregnancy were terminated\", were inserted as a result of an amendment moved by the then lord chief justice, lord parker. he argued that, as there was always some risk involved in either terminating a pregnancy or allowing it to go to term, what was needed was some means of balancing those risks. he argued further that, given that this was the test in each case, qualification of risk such as \"serious\" substantial \"or\"real\" was unnecessary, though he could see a case for the addition of \"substantially\" before \"greater\" in his amendment.\\n           lord parker also put forward the argument that a particular patient might exhibit, for example, a blood or respiratory condition which might make the risk of termination and pregnancy very great and that in such a case a balance of risks was essential.\\n           at the time of the passage of the present act there was no statistical evidence as to whether the relative risks involved in pregnancy or termination of pregnancy, without sterilisation, before three months of pregnancy carried less risk of fatality than that of completing the pregnancy.\\n           on the other hand, the risks of fatality from operative methods associated with later terminations are greater than the risk involved in allowing a pregnancy to go to term. thus it has been argued that for terminations in the first trimester the balance of risk in the present act has defeated parliament\\'s purpose as there has been reliance by some doctors on the statistical arguments alone in deciding whether the grounds for abortion are satisfied.\\n           although the lane committee thought this practice unacceptable, it did not consider that the deletion of the words \"greater than if the pregnancy were terminated\" or that the addition of adjectives describing the risk would result in a better implementation of the intentions of parliament. the adjectives used in the bill now before the house are, in the opinion of some lawyers and professional bodies, so vague as to be meaningless. i must stress that i believe this provision needs to be very carefuly examined by the select committee. it appears from many comments both today and and at other times—although it is a matter for the house to decide—that the bill would be far more acceptable if these parts were to be substantially redrafted. i welcome the readiness of the sponsors to consider this aspect of the bill.\\n           the lane committee made a recommendation that an upper time limit for abortion should be set at 24 weeks gestation without exception. this recommendation is directly relevant to clause 7 of my hon. friend\\'s bill. this clause seeks to enact a time limit for abortion of 20 weeks, subject to one qualification, where the limit would be 24 weeks. i think it is relevant for the house to be aware of the size of the problem in discussing this issue. later terminations are rare; less than 1 per cent. of all abortions are performed at 20 weeks or more gestation, and less than one-fifth of 1 per cent. at 24 weeks or more.\\n           views have been put to us by the medical profession both for and against some reduction of the time limit from the present 28 weeks, but we have received no unanimous view as to what should be considered as the minimal gestational age for foetal viability. for example, the lane committee, as i have said, recommended an upper time limit of 24 weeks, and the peel advisory group on the use of foetuses and foetal material for research recommended that the minimum limit for viability for human foetuses should be regarded as 20 weeks. in addition, the world health organisation is considering setting an international definition of viability. in view of the need for time to consider carefully all the factors involved and the possibility that on the question of the age of viability we may find ourselves out of step with international practice if we take a decision now, the government\\'s view is that the select committee might wish to have evidence on this before reaching a decision on how to legislate in this area.\\n           we do, of course, appreciate and share the concern expressed by many responsible people about late terminations. we are considering whether it is within our administrative powers to go some way to meet this concern, particularly in respect of the private sector. one possibility, for example, that i would wish to discuss with the medical profession is to restrict late terminations—that is, later than 20 weeks—to nhs hospitals where the full obstetrics and gynaecological facilities are always available.\\n           i come finally to the extremely difficult question of restricting abortions for foreign women. abortions on foreign women are almost always carried out in clinics in london and the south-east in which foreign women form a majority of the patients. these clinics in the main provide facilities for doctors rather than a comprehensive service and are, therefore, uninformative on the routes of referral of such patients. it is within this area that abuses of the 1967 act undoubtedly do take place, and the introduction of an approved list of advisory bureaux, together with a requirement that nursing homes provide a comprehensive service at an approved cost, should do something to curtail such abuse. at least, i hope the house will feel that we are doing our best.\\n           furthermore, the drawing up of this approved list of bureaux, together with a requirement that nursing homes provide terminations at a fixed comprehensive cost, should also do much to standardise the facilities available for women seeking abortion, to reduce the number of small-scale agencies, and to limit the areas of exploitation of patients. the question is, however, whether there should be legislative controls. clause 2 in conjunction with clause 7 of my hon. friend\\'s bill will prohibit foreign women receiving treatment for abortions in this country. clause 7 makes the upper time limit for abortion 20 weeks and clause 2 lays down a residence qualification of 20 weeks.\\n           to ban foreign women coming to this country for abortion was considered by the lane committee but on balance was rejected. it would be to single out this form of therapeutical treatment for discrimination whilst allowing foreigners to come here for every other form of medical treatment. therapeutic abortion, like sterilisation and certain forms of contraception, is regarded as being medical treatment, and doctors consider their first duty to be to the patient, regardless of nationality and, some would say, residence. it would be for the doctor to decide whether or not the person satisfies the residence test—a difficult burden to ask a doctor to attempt to enforce. the select committee will almost certainly wish to examine the new french legislation, which envisages some restriction on foreign women but the exact method is not yet clear.\\n           there has been a continuing trend towards the introduction of more liberal abortion laws in some countries, and for the first time since the abortion act the number of foreign women here needing abortions fell in 1974. there is clear evidence that once a country passes an abortion law numbers from that country and sometimes surrounding countries appear to fall. france since 1972 has always provided the largest single group of patients: in 1974 it was 36,541. to many people this is a very high figure which raises serious questions about the need to have a statutory ban, but it may well drop considerably following the introduction of the new laws.\\n        ',

k. joseph), who was secretary of state in 1971, recognised the extent of public concern by his decision to set up the lane committee. in our february manifesto last year, we accepted that there should be legislation to implement recommendations of that committee, and we have not moved from that position. but, while we favour legislation without any unnecessary delay, we share the view expressed by the minister on behalf of the government that the decision is essentially one which hon. members must take on a free vote and in the light of their consciences and the opinions which they have formed on the evidence available to them.\\n           i confine my remarks only to testing the efficacy of the procedure which the government have now proposed—with one preamble. much attention has been

not be prolonged.\\n           we have before us today a bill which admittedly may have flaws, and they may be flaws of principle as well as of detail. hon. members who have spoken in the debate, the minister among them, have touched upon the question of the 20-weeks' provision which the bill seeks to substitute for the present 28 weeks. there was certainly some evidence in what the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) was saying that we in this country are somewhat out of line with international practice in going so far over the three-month limit. i know at least one doctor who, having practised in this area for many years, takes the view that 14 weeks should be the normal maximum permitted limit for termination of pregnancy. but this is not a matter on which we, as lay people, should be dogmatic, nor can we form any useful view without hearing a good deal of evidence.\\n           on the question of administrability—[ interruption. ] i am not trying to be dogmatic. on the administrability the bill, particularly the part applying to foreigners, i share some of the doubts about the way in which the provisions could be enforced as they are defined, and the way in which they could be further refined if that was thought necessary. it may well be that there is something there which would detain any committee which was to consider the proposal—as might the particular proposal concerning the burden of proof. here there are, as in almost any bill, matters for debate and discussion which would no doubt take a good deal of time away from the floor of the house, where we discuss the desirability of the bill as a whole, into some sort of committee.\\n           but the house must now judge whether the government's proposition in their motion is the best way of proceeding in the way that we want to move. i thought that the recommendation of this procedure by the leader of the house yesterday on the ground that it had been found very useful in railway legislation in the nineteenth century was not the strongest i have ever heard. perhaps there are better precedents. the house will have to make up its mind about this matter. it will also want to know the time scale. we have had an assurance that the government will find time for debate on tuesday if objection is taken at the intervening stages today and if the present motion were put down again on monday. that at least is good news. however, i must press further and ask when the selection of the membership of the select committee will be made, and, if objections were taken to that—as is conceivable—would the government be equally forthcoming with time for a debate?\\n           the house may agree with me that the balance of representation on this relatively small committee might be a matter of contention and could be thought to have a bearing on the likely unanimity of any report which the committee might produce, or the time taken to produce it. in that there may also be scope for delay if the government were not wholly forthcoming, as we hope they might prove to be.\\n           looking specifically at the government's motion, i find it possible to find flaws in that, because we are not really left with a clear injunction upon the committee in terms which all of us would accept as being a reflection of the urgency we attach to this matter. we have had an assurance from the minister that the government would be sympathetic to carrying the committee over into another session if that need should arise. i would far sooner see an injunction laid upon the committee that it should seek to report in this session. the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse) shakes his head. it may be because he foresees that the committee could find itself embroiled in taking a very large quantity of evidence. when the leader of the house commended the government's motion to the house yesterday, he said that it would be possible for the roman catholic church to give evidence to the select committee. this led me to have a look at the evidence which the lane committee had taken. i detect that the catholic interest was represented at very powerful levels in the evidence to that committee. the committee took a mass of evidence, written and verbal. it took a great deal of time—two and a half years, as we have been reminded.\\n           it would be an insult to a select committee to suggest that it is as capable, as someone once said of royal commissions, of taking minutes and wasting years. but i wonder whether the government's motion is close enough to the point to reflect the wishes of the house. i should like to see a motion which enabled the select committee—if that is the decision of the house—to take account of evidence which has already been given, perhaps even to confine its own further taking of evidence to testing the evidence which has been given, and not to going again over all the ground or inviting a whole number of people to repeat their evidence. i put this point to the house as one which it may want to bear in mind in the decision that it takes.\\n           again, i wonder whether the minister is right in his understanding of the likely terms of reference of the select committee. he told us that he thought it possible, for instance, that the matter of conscience was one on which the committee could taken evidence. my understanding is that the scope of the committee is not so wide. it seems to me that if the committee is enjoined to report on the proposals in the bill before us—and there is no mention of the matter of conscience in the bill—it would be outside the power of the committee to take evidence or to report on that point. if the minister thinks that this is an important point—i gather that he does; if so, i share his view—i hope that he will agree that the government may need to consider drawing the terms of their motion a little more precisely so that there is no room left for doubt.\\n           the correspondence exchanged between the minister and my hon. friend the member for hornsey (mr. rossi) is a matter of considerable importance. i am glad that the whole exchange is to be placed in the library. i know that the concern it has caused will remain until there has been a further and more detailed probing of the exact state of affairs. but it would be a most unfortunate state if the select committee—if it is to be set up—were not able to go over that ground as well.\\n           so i must ask the minister, or whoever is responsible for putting government motions on the order paper—we see some very odd motions tabled from time to time—whether they might not consider that if they have to return with another motion on tuesday it should be drawn slightly more widely.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.102', 46, 'uk.m.21725', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'The Minister of State, Department of

that hon. members on both sides will take the view that they wish to proceed more urgently, that they wish to take the chance that a bill or parts of a bill to amend the present law can be hammered

the government for action. i hope that the minister is under no misapprehension about that. i hope that in all the ways by which the government respond to these pressures and the offers they make they are genuinely seeking to get what the hon. gentleman himself described as sensible legislation now. if that is his objective, it is one that i endorse. i for one have no wish to be party to or to vote

support the act for which the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) was responsible, who are on record as doing so and who very recently welcomed the publication of the lane report and supported its proposals.\\n           my hon. friends are concerned with the abuses in the private sector, as we all know. it is very interesting to see that conservative members are now prepared to come out and speak against the private sector. we have not noticed very much enthusiasm for that when we have been urging the secretary of state to proceed with the elimination of private practice.\\n           we are very concerned that the government shall have regard for the clearly expressed view of women who are working class women, who are by and large the main beneficiaries of the 1967 act. this is tremendously important, because it means that since that act was introduced working-class women are able to get what better-off women have always been able to get. better-off women have never been inhibited when they have wanted to remove an unwanted pregnancy for frivolous reasons. i do not believe that our women are concerned with ending unwanted pregnancies for frivolous reasons, but better-off women have always been able to do this.\\n           since the beginning of time women have always been able to rid themselves of unwanted pregnancies, though one would think from listening to the longwinded speeches of the sponsors of the bill, making their comments both inside the house and outside, that this is a new development since the act was introduced and that this is an example of the permissive society that the act has brought about. this is not so and it has no foundation in fact.\\n           the principal sponsor of the bill, my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white), said very little in his introductory speech about his bill. perhaps that is not surprising, because not only is it full of drafting failings but it is very clear that the intention of this amending bill is to undermine the original act to such an extent as to make it unworkable and more draconian for women. that is one of our major reasons for opposing it.\\n           i shall not say anything about page 1, because that was well ventilated by my hon. friend the minister. on page 2 my hon. friend the member for pollok seeks to prescribe which consultants shall be involved. he does not clarify the sort of consultant whom he thinks might be able to preside over premises. it could be a geriatrician, i suppose. i wonder whether my hon. friend would be satisfied with that, because he merely says a consultant within the national health service\". paragraph ( c ) states: a registered medical practitioner approved by the secretary of state as being of like status to such a consultant\". a consultant is a consultant or he is not a consultant. what is a person of like status to … a consultant\"? i do not understand it, and my hon. friend did not attempt to explain it.\\n           clause 2 would seem to prohibit foreign women from coming here and having terminations in this country except after a period of 20 weeks had elapsed. that seems to be an extraordinary aim. one of the aims and objectives of a sensible, liberal, safe abortion policy is to have terminations carried out absolutely as soon as possible.\\n           clause 2, if it were accepted, would mean that a foreign student or au pair girl or a foreign woman of any kind who came to this country, say, 15 weeks pregnant would have to wait another five weeks or more before she could have her pregnancy terminated. she would not be eligible until then. so what would happen to her? would she then be sent back? how would she be dealt with? how would the doctor examine her credentials—passport, or other documentation—to satisfy himself? is this a burden which should be placed upon doctors in the carrying out of their professional work?\\n           the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles has already spoken of the more liberal abortion laws introduced by many countries since 1967. it is the catholic countries which are supplying the largest number of women coming to this country for termination of pregnancy. they come from ireland—in fact, from both parts of ireland—and above all from france, which last year gave us the largest figure, 36,000 from spain and from italy.\\n           italian women are now pressing for an abortion law themselves, and it may well be that they will get it. they have managed to get divorce law reform. i am sure also that the introduction of the french act will lead to a reduction in the numbers. indeed, from all these areas there will, i believe, be a dramatic fall in the numbers coming here by the end of this year.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.111', 65, 'uk.m.10647', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'will not the hon. lady acknowledge

deal of the literature sent to members of parliament during the past few weeks. over 80 per cent. of terminations in all sectors take place before the thirteenth week. this is a development which we should all welcome, since it means that the terminations can be carried out fairly simply, by new and simpler methods, without the risks attached to termination at a later stage.\\n           only less than 1 per cent. of the total number of terminations take place after the twentieth week—between the twentieth and the twenty-eighth week. so what are we making such heavy weather about?\\n

is a development which can be greatly welcomed, and that is why clause 2 is so unacceptable.\\n           i am concerned also about clause 5(2), a provision which could well interfere with the work of the charitable trusts, which all, i believe, accept as filling the need which ought to be met by the national health service. only because of the shortcomings of the health service are private clinics able to function. because of the abuses in the private sector, the expensive sector, the british pregnancy advisory service, for example, set up its clinics and nursing homes. these services are helping a large number of women who have legal grounds for termination. i emphasise that. they are women with legal grounds under the act who are unable to have termination carried out in the national health service because of the religious objections or other objections of the consultant gynaecologist in charge.\\n           the figures given by the registrar-general are illuminating. if nothing else, they show my right hon. friend the secretary of state where she ought to be taking urgent action if she is to send the bill to a select committee to look into all aspects of the lane report and this proposed measure. she cannot do that without looking at the deficiencies in her department and the service which it provides.\\n           i take first the birmingham figures. in 1973, in the birmingham region only 2,300 women had a termination in a national health service hospital, and twice that number had to go into the private sector in the region, which meant that they went probably to the bpas or to private clinics in the region. but the same number again, nearly 5,000, had to go into the private sector outside the region altogether. that is a pattern which one sees repeated throughout all the regional hospital board areas as they then were.\\n           liverpool is very low on the list because of the attitude of professor jeffcoate, a well known anti-abortionist. in liverpool itself in 1973 there were only 1,450 terminations, and 559 of those were done in nhs hospitals in the region, while a much larger number, 629, had to be done in non-nhs hospitals, and almost another 300 women had to go out of the region for termination in the private sector elsewhere.\\n           i note the figures for my own area, and i note also the interesting record for brighton. in the brighton area there were 535 terminations, only 108 being done in nhs hospitals and 414 being done in the private sector.\\n           the deficiencies in the national health service provision, for which my right hon. friend is responsible, are driving women into the private sector. they may go into the private charitable sector, where they are well treated and where the fees are waived for a woman who cannot afford to pay, the maximum fee being about £50, which is nothing in comparison with harley street and wimpole street fees. they are being driven also into those sectors of private medicine about which we are most concerned and in which the major abuses occur. i repeat that the secretary of state and the house itself ought to give urgent consideration to the provision being made within the national health service.\\n           next, i add my voice to the protests already made about clause 11, which would put an unwelcome burden of proof on the consultant, coupled with the proposal that any anonymous person could lay charges against a doctor who might well be acting within the terms of the act and carrying out an entirely legal termination. such a person would not have to have his or her name disclosed.\\n           that is quite appalling. a confirmed anti-abortionist could crucify a gynaecologist who carried out a perfectly legal operation under the act. we all know that actions for libel or slander are a very expensive business, and a doctor's whole reputation would be put at risk.\\n           there are, therefore, serious objections to this amending bill, and there are many matters which will have to be considered if the matter goes to a select committee.\\n           i refer now to the enormous amount of extraordinary material with which members of parliament have been inundated of late, material which gives very distorted pictures of foetuses and which paints in lurid language the effect of termination on the foetus or on the woman in relation to her future health and psychological condition.\\n           it is well to bear in mind, if we are talking about terminations before the thirteenth week—and about 80 per cent. of terminations in this country take place before then—that the size of the foetus is 6 cm or 2⅜ in. if termination takes place at 16 weeks, which is the point when quickening occurs, the foetus is 4¾ in. it is important to keep these matters in perspective. at 12 weeks the foetus weight ½ oz.\\n           let us have no more lurid propaganda about babies crying on the way to the incinerator, as was mentioned in that disgusting little book by two gutter journalists, using methods that everyone must condemn. the results have been checked and checked again and found to be absolutely false. let us have no more propaganda about foetuses lying on the slab waiting to be killed. this is disgraceful. members of parliament are not to be taken in and deluded by this kind of disgusting, ill-founded and unscientific propaganda.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.118', 777, 'uk.m.17372', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i hope that the

congratulate the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) on presenting the bill and on his speech today. i am sorry that the bill has apparently now disappeared and that a private members\\' day has been altered into a government day. i have been in this house long enough—[ interruption. ] a dear friend of mine on the opposition front bench says that i have been a back bencher too long. that may well be due to one of two causes. one may be that i have stuck by my principles ever since i have been here and another may be that one or two of my friends in high places were stupid enough to leave me on the back benches. that does not really matter.\\n           there are two points i wish to raise. first i want to talk about the conscience clause, which does not appear in this bill. i regret that. i admit that it is an infinitely difficult matter to put into words and to avoid the dreadful things that are now happening in the hospitals and the national health service because there is no protection for people who cannot, in conscience, do things that they believe are disgusting, sad, dreadful and immoral. there is no protection for them.\\n           it has been fashionable to read parts of the lane report today. one piece was so fashionable that it was read twice. i am sorry that the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) has left the chamber, because he used the extract in question. then it was read again by the minister, who made a charming contribution. i want to read a different part, which deals with the question of conscience.\\n           paragraph 607 says: there is of course another decision for the individual conscience and that is whether or not to take any part in abortion work. no doctor or nurse is required to participate in the treatment authorised by the act, if he or she has a conscientious objection to it on religious or ethical grounds. this is entirely proper, it is a traditional freedom which must be jealously guarded, and we have found that generally it is being very well respected. i draw attention to \"jealously guarded\". what is said later shows that the committee has no idea how to guard that.\\n           it goe on to say: where there is disagreement between what the individual wishes to avoid and has to do, it is far more often that he has been driven by his own feelings of loyalty and fairness to his colleagues, and by a perception of the patients\\' needs, into conflict with his sense of the wrongness of abortion than because he has been under any duress from seniors to take part in the work. i wish i could take that completely at its face value and believe that there are not large numbers of nurses, more nurses than doctors perhaps, who abhor the work they have to carry out.\\n           the report goes on to say: should priority be given to the individual\\'s claim for religious tolerance and his right conscientiously to refuse to take part in abortion work, or to the obligation of the n.h.s. to provide a service for its patients who need abortion? we have stated the view that sometimes the needs of the many must take priority and that inevitably some who refuse this work may not obtain a particular appointment: but we came to this conclusion with great reluctance and hope that the occasions for such a decision will be rare. may i ask the minister, who was kind enough to say to me that he could not stay, to look at this whole matter deeply and carefully when the bill is referred to the select committee? i believe it is something that is greatly troubling some of the most conscientious nurses and doctors in the entire profession. the profession cannot afford to lose people who have a strong moral opinion on the work they do.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2,

part of the female sex of this country, yet the opposition front bench is completely empty. that shows a frivolity and indifference that should not be tolerated.\\n           we must deal with this subject unemotionally and objectively. we must disregard most of the literature which has been flooding our post during the past week or two. there are probably two main types of objectors to the 1967 act. there are those who think that abortion legislation should be of a punitive nature to reduce immorality or sexual activity. i think most of us feel some impatience with that attitude. obviously, the time to influence such matters is by appropriate education, long before pregnancy takes place. on the other hand, there are many people who regard the rights of the unborn child as deserving much more attention than they now receive. many of us here, too, feel strongly about this, although it is a difficult subject. we are particularly indebted to my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) for bringing forward this bill and enabling us to discuss what has been becoming in many ways a scandalous situation.\\n           i am worried about my hon. friend\\'s bill because parts of it seem totally impracticable. further, it goes well beyond the recommendations of the lane committee. the lane committee sat from 1971 to the end of 1973. it was presided over by a lady of exceptional intelligence, experience and humanity. it was staffed by top people in the gynaecology specialty, by distinguished lawyers and by distinguished members of the nursing profession. this house should give more attention to the lane committee\\'s recommendations than is indicated in the bill now before us.\\n           it is accepted by everyone that there is now a wide range of reasons for abortion which are agreed by the medical profession. there is no hope of putting back the clock and of putting abortion in the same situation as it was in before the 1967 act. however, there have been some serious abuses of the 1967 act about which we are all concerned and to which the select committee must give careful consideration.\\n           the first abuse which i deal with is, i believe, due to a failure on the part of the department of health and social security. i do not often agree with my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short), but there is no doubt that it is scandalous that there should be such an uneven distribution of abortion facilities throughout the country. this is one of the difficulties about the conscience situation. it is an absurd situation, for example, that in newcastle there should be twice as many abortions performed as in birmingham. it is monstrous that in some hospitals abortions are a rarity. such hospitals are flouting the intention of the 1967 act. i suggest that that is a matter which the department should consider carefully. if the act is to be applied it should be applied justly and evenly throughout the country. it cannot be said that it is now being applied in such a way.\\n           that is one of the first abuses that could be changed forthwith by administrative action by the department. it could deal with the conscience clause referred to by the hon. member for yarmouth by making supplementary appointments so that those gynaecologists whose consciences do not permit them to perform abortions may be supplemented by colleagues who do not have the same conscience problem.\\n           we have talked about foreign traffic. we have heard from my hon. friend the minister of state that there are difficulties about ending that traffic. i believe that the difficulties can be overcome. it would not be all that difficult to ensure that people who are reasonably suspected of being foreigners should at least provide passports or some evidence that they are british before being entitled to receive an abortion under the national health service or privately.\\n           the most important matter before us is the failure to recognise the rights of the unborn child. this is the great objection that so many people on both sides of the house rightly have. the bill does an excellent service in providing legislation for stopping abortions after 24 weeks and putting serious impediments in their way in terms of professional co-operation after 20 weeks. at that stage one is very close to infanticide.\\n           on the other hand, we must be careful in weighing up the rights of the unborn child against the rights of the mother and the rights of the rest of the family in the early stages of pregnancy. there is no escaping from the fact that the foetus in the early stages of pregnancy bears no resemblance to a human being. it is no use pretending that it is a human being. it is only a potential human being. one of the curious laws of nature is that human beings in reproduction reproduce the development of the human being in evolution. as in evolution human beings develop from being worm-like, fish-like and monkey-like animals. exactly the same thing happens inside the female uterus.\\n           one has to have a sense of proportion in interpreting the rights of the unborn child when it is merely a potential child, and its interests have to be weighed against those of a real live mother and a real family. the matter must be considered carefully. it is a difficult subject on which i do not pretend to have final opinions.\\n           the real abuse of the 1967 act is the rather too free interpretation of the words \"injury to mental health\". that leaves a wide scope. it is possible for unscrupulous or irresponsible doctors to interpret that phrase so widely that, in effect, patients have abortion on demand, as happens so much in the private sector.\\n           how can legislation overcome that problem? assessing injury done to mental health is a complex professional matter. there are many psychiatric criteria of what a given pregnancy can do to a person\\'s mental health. it is impossible for any legislative assembly to lay down strict rules about that. it must be a matter for the decision of the doctors concerned. it is impossible to legislate to ensure that doctors adhere to defined psychiatric criteria.\\n           in common sense terms we have to face the fact that if a woman is determined to get rid of her unborn child there is no way of stopping her. it is ridiculous to think that legislation will achieve that. if she is rich she can do it more easily, but i am not so concerned about rich women. i remember when i was a young surgeon responsible for emergency operations the number of young women who were brought to me desperately ill and harassed to the point of nervous breakdown because they had stuck a knitting needle or some other infected instrument into themselves. that was a common occurrence. we do not want that situation ever to happen again. it would certainly happen again if we had too strict criteria for termination pregnancy.\\n           abortion must be largely a matter of medical judgment. it is unwise to attempt to give detailed instructions, or even any clinical instructions, to doctors in terms of the bill. the bill mentions \"grave risk to life\". how is that to be interpreted? the bill mentions— risk of serious injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant women … or her family\". the insertion of such adjectives seriously interferes with the clinical freedom of the doctors concerned and leads to immense difficulties.\\n        ',

been registered for not less than five years. a doctor is a doctor. what can be more absurd than to have special categories of doctors in circumstances like this? as soon as a man is registered he become responsible for affairs of life and death every week, every day, yet for the purposes of the termination of pregnancy he has to have a five years' registration. an attempt to divide the medical profession in that way is completely impractical. i suggest that the select committee should remember that.\\n           there should be no harassment of doctors. doctors in the national health service do not like terminating pregnancies. it is regarded as a detestable chore. no doubt other considerations apply in the private sector. a young registrar in a gynaecological department who is faced with the termination of a pregnancy has to be certain that there is a grave risk to the life of the pregnant woman if the pregnancy is not terminated. if someone informs against him the onus of proof is on him that he has not committed an offence which will bring him up to six months' imprisonment or a fine of £1,000. i can imagine no more absurd situation and no more serious restriction of clinical freedom, particularly among young doctors. this is one of the most absurd parts of the bill.\\n           my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east suggested that there are doctors in the private sector who make vast profits. we must face the fact that that is because the national health service is letting the patients down because of inadequate facilities. there would be no booming private sector in abortions if there were at least reasonable facilities in the national health service—which there are not.\\n           i hope that the select committee when it investigates this matter will recognise its own limitations in forming opinions on delicate and complex professional matters. i hope that it will adhere to the lane report as much as possible. the lane committee is the most authoritative body of opinion we could possibly have. finally, the select committee must remember that, although this is a difficult and serious social problem, there are grave limitations to what can be done by legislation. legislation might well produce much more harm than good.\\n        \", datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'],

go on with the process of shaping our own destiny without reference to any higher being than man, deciding ourselves how many children shall be born, when and in what varieties, which lives are worth continuing and which should be put out. … or we draw back, seeking to understand and fall in with our creator's purpose for us rather than to pursue our own; in true humility praying, as the founder of our religion and our civilisation taught us: thy will be done. this is what the abortion controversy is about, and what the euthenasia controversy will be about when, as must inevitably happen soon, it arises. i welcome the bill. i think that in some degree it will remove the abuses of the 1967 act—and nearly all contributors to this debate have agreed that there are abuses. after the

of us were pioneering to have a rational public debate on this subject.\\n           i was much impressed with the speech made by my hon. friend the member for loughborough (mr. cronin). he spoke from the point of view of the doctor. i speak as a doctor\\'s wife, and my husband used to work in a very poor part of the east end of london. one of the most satisfactory transformations in the social life of the people who were his patients has been the new attitude towards the termination of pregnancy. in those days women would come into his surgery with their calendars and obviously they had suffered dread month after month.\\n           my hon. friend was quite right to emphasise the awful decision which faced doctors in the days before the law was changed. i am sure that we never had any reliable statistics on this topic. it is said that there is a great increase in the number of abortions. i submit that nobody can say that there is an increase, because nobody knew how many there were before. i remember that my husband hardly ever put \"abortion\" on a death certificate because it always shamed the family, quite apart from the husband. it would be \"septicaemia\" or some other replacement. so we cannot say that there are now more abortions than there were.\\n           i remember my husband being called out to see a girl who had undergone an abortion and who had interfered with herself in a horrible way. my husband got the girl into hospital and she died there. the next thing that happened was that a policeman arrived and said to my husband \"you sent her into hospital and were the last doctor to see her\". my husband replied \"i can only say that if i had carried out the operation it would not have gone septic\". but it was days before that cloud was lifted from the family. i am sure that the amending legislation which is before the house will re-create that situation and will make it difficult for a doctor to give an abortion to which a woman is entitled because he might be afraid of being caught by the legislation.\\n           of course there are abuses in the private sector, and i wish that some of my friends in the medical profession were more alert to the total abuse and overcharging in the private sector as a whole. it is not only in this speciality that there is abuse.\\n           i should like to say a word about the situation of the foreign woman as affected by this legislation. a doctor has not only to be satisfied on the difficult judgment of grave injury and serious risk and so on but has to find out about the woman\\'s nationality. how does he police that task? the woman may say \"i speak in an odd way because i come from southern ireland\", or she may say \"i do not speak english very well because i am german but married to an english husband.\" has the doctor to obtain the husband\\'s birth certificate or passport? [an hon. member: \"her own passport.\"] it is certainly a new situation and i hope that the bma will pronounce on the desirability of patients having to take passports to their doctor.\\n           in case i cannot persuade the house of these arguments, i should like to quote from a letter which i received from a distinguished gynaecologist who is a constituent. he said: any national has always been able to seek medical and surgical help in the uk and increasing numbers … come here for this purpose because we have such good medical ability. this being so, why should women seeking abortion be singled out in this way? i need hardly point out that a doctor should see and attend anyone with a total disregard of nationality; race; colour; creed or social position. it is entirely contrary to medical ethics and honour to make discriminaitons. the words of that doctor put the dilemma very fairly indeed.\\n           we have heard a lot of statistics today. i sometimes wonder whether we are talking about women at all. perhaps if there had been more women members of parliament present today on the opposition benches, we might have heard a wider variety of contribution. i must remind the house that this is international women\\'s year.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.136', 5, 'uk.m.17860', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'one would never have guessed!\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.137', 173, 'uk.m.17922', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i hear what my hon. friend says, but one would almost think that references to foreign women bring some strangely polluting element to parliament.\\n           i submit that it is an extremely traumatic experience for a woman to have to go through an abortion at all, and she must be particularly desperate to have to come to this country to have it carried out. she is in need of help and compassion. it is astonishing that we in the house of commons should seek to celebrate international women\\'s year by making this differentiation. if a foreign gentleman comes to london to have his prostate fixed, he does not get sent home. how can we divide the specialities of medicine?

some of us who saw the opposition there was in the house to any woman having any sort of abortion in those days should say a word on this occasion.\\n           i counsel a degree of humility in the house in the way we approach this problem. i believe that it is not certain that amendments to the law are the best way to deal with this problem. the lane committee very sensibly spelt out the abuses it thought should be cleared up by professional and administrative action. the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) mentioned the crossman doctrine—mr. crossman had only very restricted grounds on which he could tighten up all clinics—which has now been proved wrong, and there may be a completely new attitude from the department of health in tidying up the private sector.\\n           i agreed with my hon. friend the member for loughborough (mr. cronin) when he said that we should keep our feet on the ground. we are not in a position where, simply by passing laws, we can decide whether women have abortions. what we shall tend to decide is whether women have safe or unsafe abortions. if we restrict the law, the tendency will be to force the women to have unsafe abortions.\\n           the second reason why, as a man, i think that we should be very careful to preserve a decent humility is the prospect of 600-odd men, some of them very elderly and others deep into the menopause, attempting to lay down to half of the population, which is scandalously under-represented in the house anyway, how that half of the population should deal with a matter which is absolutely crucial and personal to them. looked at objectively, that prospect is a little grotesque.\\n           i am not saying that we should not pass laws. all i say is that we should do so with a decent humility. let me take the example of foreign women. there will be a number of foreign women who have arrived in britain only recently, not hav ing come especially for abortions. but they will ask for abortions. if they are to be denied them, it could be brutally unfair since many of the will have probably been impregnated by englishmen. simply to take the national status of the women as an absolute blanket reason for stopping them having abortions is a heartless act which this house would not wish to go in for.\\n           i am extremely pleased that the government and the minister of state have at least agreed to take substantial responsibility themselves for dealing with these matters. in 1976, if i may say so—and the minister of state was then a backbench member of the committee—the government did not take nearly enough responsibility for clearing up these problems. if the introduction of the bill has done anything, it has forced the government to deal with the private sector in this regard—and i hope in other regards as well—and allowed us to accept the recommendation of the lane report that the abortion act, apart from these specific abuses, is working and should remain in force as it is at the moment.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.149', 626, 'uk.m.10591', 'uk.p.Con', 0, 'NaN',

much the same way. i put to him the possibility, which i hope he and others will reflect upon, that the abortion act 1967 and a number of social measures passed at the same time were also of an extremely heartless nature in that they created a situation and a moral climate which resulted in immeasurable unhappiness to a great many of our people. i say \"immeasurable\" because it cannot be measured by statistics and it cannot be checked by referring to a government report. we have no idea of the mental agonies suffered by mothers who have had abortions. we shall never know the statistics. i suggest that that is a matter which should be reflected upon and thought about.\\n           the sponsors of the bill are a mixed bag. i am one of them. we have all approached it in different ways. the reason why i agreed to sponsor it and why i support what the hon. member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) has done is precisely to deal with the point which was made so ably by the hon. member for holborn and st. pancras, south (mrs. jeger) and by the hon. member for loughborough (mr. cronin). they pointed out how difficult it was to draw a legal distinction between a situation of having abortion on demand and a situation of having no abortion at all.\\n           the hon. member for loughborough said that if we put into the subsection the word \"grave\" it would be difficult to decide how to allow doctors to make a decision. he said that he did not want a situation where in, say, newcastle it was more permissive whereas in birmingham it was less. he also said that we must give doctors total discretion. however, it is impossible to have both uniformity of practice and total freedom or discretion for the medical profession.\\n           the hon. member for holborn and st. pancras, south spoke about women coming to this country. she pointed out the difficulty of trying to draw a distinction between having complete abortion on demand and no abortion at all. this is the difficulty which has been partly created by the 1967 act. although the hon. member for loughborough can see difficulty in the use of the word \"grave\", for the medical profession in some areas it is difficult to draw a distinction in terms of the 1967 act. the only argument of the hon. member for loughborough is that, if we have the 1967 act, those doctors who wish to interpret it as being a situation of abortion on demand do not need to fear the consequences. i fear that the act can be interpreted as meaning virtually abortion on demand and that those who practise abortion

liberalisation in some parts of the world. what he did not say was that those who were amongst the first to liberalise have been seen to go into reverse. he spoke of the situation behind the iron curtain. i remind him of the present situation in romania, which was one of the first pioneers of abortion on demand. in that country in 1965 there were four abortions for every live birth. romania has now totally reversed its policy. it is forbidden for any woman under the age of 45 to have an abortion other than for therapeutic reasons. there is a warning there for us.\\n        ',

       on 21st december last, representatives of the roman catholic church, the church of england and nonconformist churches and chapels held a peaceful demonstration, led by the bishop of burnley. it is wrong to think that the argument about the destruction of baby life is inspired by the roman catholic church. it is that church which has taken the lead in this matter, and in my opinion, for what it is worth, it deserves full marks for so doing.\\n           one must take heed of what the other churches are doing. i have been sent a statement by paul cavadino, an oxford graduate who is involved in social work at a beggarly salary on behalf of the likes of people for whom we should all have due regard. a joint statement on the lane report was issued by the board for social responsibility of the church of england and the division of social responsibility of the methodist church. it said: it is all the more regrettable that the committee\"— that is, the lane committee— were prevented from considering changes in the conditions for legal abortion, since the conditions as laid down in the 1967 act, and particularly the social clause, have attracted widespread criticism. a judgment on the abortion law must include an assessment of the moral and legal principles underlying it, and this the committee were precluded from doing\". that is a fair judgment, and when my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse) was speaking i intervened to say that the terms of reference of the lane committee were totally inadequate. it is nonsense for certain hon. members to say that the lane committee\\'s report is adequate. it could not be, and it had no right to be.\\n           remembering my promise to be brief i now come to my second and final point but, before enlarging on it perhaps i may tell the house that paul cavadino has made a realistic survey of the situation and that had time been at my disposal i should have liked to make the report to the house that he has made to me.\\n           it grieves me very much that young girls of 14, 15, 16 and 17 are having abortions in the manner that we know.

the tender age of, say, 15, came home and said that she was in this condition. who could truthfully say \"i do not really mind\"?\\n           there is a strong bingo element in our society today, and there has been a considerable decline in the christian pattern of discipline. i do not think anyone can deny that the influence of the home, which should be transcendent, has decreased alarmingly, and the influence of the church has decreased with it. those two factors go together, and there is no doubt that we in this house should be aware of them. we should attempt to circumvent the circumstances that prevail by seeing to it that, as responsible members of society, we face the challenges confronting us, which is what i believe we are doing now.\\n           i compliment my hon. friend the minister of state on taking this matter on board. the difficult situation facing us should be dealt with by a bill which at the end of the day should be the responsibility of a responsible state. i am

  the hon. member for loughborough (mr. cronin) began his contribution to the debate by saying that all hon. members had received a lot of information through the post from various bodies concerned about abortion, both those for and those against it. he went on to say that he disregarded all this information. that was an unfortunate comment, because it is my view that we should pay heed to the

with respect and good will to all hon. members, whether pro- or anti-abortionists.\\n           to the first group i suggest that if anyone objects to this or, indeed, any amending bill to the 1967 abortion act, he is in effect saying two things. the first is that the 1967 act is absolutely perfect and not susceptible of change or amendment. the second is that that perfect act, that most ideal piece of legislation ever made in the history of mankind has been scrupulously and perfectly observed and that it cannot be amended.\\n           we all know that that is not true. there are many abuses under the act. my hon. friend the member for holborn and st. pancras, south (mrs. jeger), for whom i have the greatest respect, asked one hon. member to produce the evidence of these abuses. i have not got chapter and verse, but i assure my hon. friend that there have been many abuses. for example, i do not believe that the conscience clause has been observed. i think that we all know that gynaecologists and nurses have been victimised in their own professions for not carrying out abortions. i will not go into all these lurid allusions. i want to see an end to all private clinics which charge extortionate fees, and so on.\\n           i suggest to those who are against the bill that all these matters can be dealt with in committee. they are all committee points. they do not militate against the principle that the 1967 act is capable of being, and certainly ought to be, amended.\\n           i voted against the 1967 bill—i had not the slightest compunction in doing so—and would again. however, i suggest to those who, like me, are in favour of this bill that they should be more careful. i could make a powerful theological case against all abortion. i could prove—it would take me until well after 4 o\\'clock—that the foetus is alive, is individual and distinct, is human, is a person, and, being a person, has the right to live. i believe that this right to live is not derived from any human agency—not even from the parents—but is god-given. but what is the use of pressing those arguments on people who do not share my theology? therefore, i believe that in a public debate in a pluralistic society people should not develop those arguments.\\n           similarly, we should be careful about the language that we use. language sometimes makes it impossible for people who disagree with one\\'s views to listen to them. we should not talk about mass murder, genocide, the slaughter of the innocents, or even make a reference to belsen or auschwitz. that cannot convince those who do not agree with us. indeed, they will stop their ears and become indignant. why should they not? i do not believe that any hon. member would dream for a moment of wishing to terminate life. these are not the arguments that we should use.\\n           i should also like to hear from those who have such great respect for life in the womb what respect they have for life elsewhere, for life in the slums, for example, or in degrading conditions at work or in the motorway folly. i should like to hear their views on the h-bomb, which is no great respecter of life. on both sides of the house we should be careful of our language, whether we are for or against the bill.\\n           this is why i am glad that the government intend to set up a select committee. i had it in mind, as had many other hon. members, to come here specifically to vote for the bill. perhaps they feel disappointed that they will not now be given the chance to do so. [hon. members: \"how do you know?\"] i was about to say that they might be tempted to vote against the withdrawal of the bill. i think that that would be wrong on practical grounds. if the bill goes into a standing committee, god alone knows when it will be discussed. i can speak of this matter with some authority because i am the chairman of the committee of selection and i know that six or eight other bills are already well ahead of this one.\\n           what we should do is take up the government\\'s offer to send the bill to a select committee. but i repeat: let us all give one another the credit for being sincere in our views.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.162', 2, 'NaN', 'NaN', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', ' rose —\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.163', 17, 'uk.m.22185', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'chairman', 'chair', 'the rev.—no, i am sorry: it is the rev. alan clark, i am afraid.

you have awarded me.\\n           i was not in the house when the 1967 act was passed, but i welcome the opportunity to speak on it in general terms as i know that my constituents would wish me to do. those of us who argue against the practice of indiscriminate abortion face the fact that we do so when the climate of opinion, the abundance of statistics, much of the articulacy of argument—i do not have in mind the hon. member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short)—is against us.\\n           none the less, although our arguments are sometimes stigmatised as emotive, which i take to be a pejorative word for \"emotional\", and there is no harm in emotion, or specious, which i take to be an adjective which is simply applied to an argument which convinces one but which one does not like. i feel that they echo a deep opinion in the people of this country.\\n           of course, the case that the unborn child is, so to speak, the property of the mother has a superficial credibility because she conceived it. it must be admitted, however, that the act which leads to conception can take place on a very great number of occasions without conception occurring. i would agree with the hon. member for western isles (mr. stewart) that there is no denying the fact that an enormous number of people, not necessarily of the catholic faith, believe that conception is the gift of god, and that what god gives only god can take away. one of the curious paradoxes of fashionable argument these days is that so many people who argue against capital punishment, for example, on the ground that man cannot set himself up as a surrogate of god are none the less only to ready to assume that status when it comes to terminating pregnancies at a late stage.\\n           before becoming a member of the house i was on the governing body of one of the largest groups of teaching hospitals in the country. i had direct personal experience of the great distaste which is felt by large numbers of medical staff and nurses at having, day in and day out, to undertake these tasks, which the hon. member for loughborough (mr. cronin) described as a disgusting chore. i know also of the effect on recruitment for the nursing profession that these obligations have had.\\n           i believe also that the house should look very carefully at the question of what happens to the foetuses. over 60,000 foetuses a year have to be disposed of, and some are in a very advanced and well-formed state. i was present in the house a few days ago when a very unsatisfactory, as i thought, answer was given on the question of medical experiments on foetuses. a curious word was introduced by the minister when he spoke of the \"viability\" of the foetus. no one seemed to know what that meant. it is certainly not a medical term. it is part of the \"new speak\" which is affecting the whole of this subject. the hon. member for wolverhampton, north-east would not use the word \"abortion\", or she tended to avoid it whenever she could. she used the word \"termination\", which is slightly longer and more cumbersome and does not give rise to the curious chill of horror which the word \"abortion\" rightly arouses in so many people, even at this time.\\n           there is another point that we must consider which is of fundamental importance. where an unborn baby is over a certain age, we have to ask ourselves about its feelings, its identity and its receptivity. i am not concerned with its legal status, but we are here on the murky frontiers of medical knowledge. can anyone really assert that an unborn baby of 28 weeks has a smaller life force than a paralysed octogenarian in a wheelchair? cannot the two be compared? may not the day come when they will be compared?\\n           i support the bill. not only are its detailed provisions desirable, but may it be the first stage in a process which will ultimately revise an act which many people in this country regard as profoundly corrupt and evil.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.167', 619, 'uk.m.21895', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i say straight away that

which all ordinary people know about—pregnancies, babies and family life. many hon. members are married and have families. it has been said that many of the men in the house are perhaps suffering from

until the last assembly. i believe that the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) quoted in his speech on the second reading of his measure from part of the first deliverance to the church of scotland. the council has seen the way the act is working out and, in common with other people, is worried about the abuses which have already become so apparent.\\n           next, i have a letter here which comes on behalf of the archbishops of canterbury and york. can one get higher than that in that establishment? the letter says: they … welcome the opportunity which parliament

glad to hear what was said by the hon. member for dunbartonshire, west (mr. campbell), with whom i am largely in agreement, as i was with the remarks of the hon. member for plymouth, sutton (mr. clark).\\n           this whole subject has to be approached with a great measure of compassion. all who are implicated in the matters covered by the bill need the compassion of every hon. member. it is easy to come down severely on one side or the other, but it should be remembered by all that the mother has an opportunity to state her case and to express her intense feelings in this matter but that the unborn child has no opportunity to speak. that child cannot put forth its viewpoint. it is only right that we should try to see this matter in the light of the sanctity of human life.\\n           while in this pluralistic society we will not convince anyone who takes a different view on a particular theological or moral issue, it has to be acknowledged that the child must have feelings and those feelings must be respected. i am with those who raise their voices in the house today in condemnation of what has taken place under the present abortion laws.\\n           i would have liked to have seen this bill voted on. it seems a great pity that at the last minute the government have suggested that it should go to a select committee. we must, however, be realistic. it is quite probable that the select committee will be able to put forward its recommendations in a shorter time than would be necessary for the bill to go through all its stages. i feel that the decision to refer the subject to the select committee will at least give everyone who has strong convictions on the subject an opportunity to voice them and to ensure that something will be done.\\n           i hope that the committee will be set up speedily and will get down to its task quickly and that the house will be able to debate its findings this session. i urge upon the minister the necessity for a stricter administration of the present laws. i urge upon him the necessity to tighten up the act. where he has the power, i trust that he will use it so that the abuses of which we have heard will be brought to a speedy end.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.175', 1260, 'uk.m.18240', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'this has been a deeply serious debate on a subject on which most hon. members feel strongly. i congratulate my hon. friend the member for glasgow, pollok (mr. white) on bringing forward his bill and giving us the opportunity to debate it and the lane report at the same time. at this crucial stage of the debate, may i remind the house what the bill is about and what it is not about, in the terms stressed by my hon. friends, the main sponsors of the bill.\\n           the bill does not deal with the merits of abortion per se. it does not suggest that abortion is wrong. there is thus no challenge intended to the principles underlying the 1967 act. the bill does not deny the right of a woman to have an abortion in certain circumstances. opponents of the bill, such as myself, have to accept the good faith of the sponsors.\\n           equally, the sponsors have to accept that the debate is not about abortion on demand, as it seemed to be at one point. the 1967 act does not sanction abortion. any allegations by the sponsors to this effect have to do with the workings of the act and not with the act itself. i was delighted to hear the minister say that he believes it is possible to strengthen the workings of the act by administrative means. what the bill and the debate are about are, first, whether the allegations of abuses and defects in the 1967 act are well founded and, secondly, if they are well-founded, whether this bill is the best way to deal with them. the allegations of abuses and defects have been gone into at great length and it is clear that on all sides there is general agreement that certainly in the private sector there have been abuses. no one would deny that. the minister has indicated how he thinks it is possible to take action and that he is already trying by administrative means to do something about abuses.\\n           a second abuse, if that is the correct term, is the influx of foreign women. as has been already pointed out, they are mainly women from continental catholic countries. they have been the principle victims of exploitation by unscrupulous british clinics and doctors. that is an abuse that must be tackled. but in so far as britain, especially london and the south-east, has been able to provide relief where justified for thousands of foreign women with unwanted pregnancies with all the suffering that unwanted pregnancies would involve, and in so far as the continental countries are now modifying their laws or introducing new laws and giving similar facilities to their women, i think that rather than continually harping on the terrible abuses which we all know take place—\"london, the abortion capital of the world\"—we must take modest satisfaction in the thought that where justified we have helped to give a lead to ending the misery that has been felt by women in all countries and at all times because of unwanted pregnancies.\\n           my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse) seems to think that the new laws will not materially alter the numbers of foreign women coming into this country because of the different stage at which abortion can be carried out. that is not the view of the derby chapter of the society for the protection of unborn children. i believe that its views are correct.\\n           my hon. friend was reminded by my hon. friend the member for wolverhampton, north-east (mrs. short) that the majority of pregnancies are terminated within 13 weeks.\\n           if my hon. friend the member for pontypool considers the statistics in the lane report, he will see in vol. ii, at page 77, that over 50 per cent. of women in social classes i and ii tend to have abortions in 10 weeks or less. the operative figure in the new french act is 10 weeks. if we assume that most of the foreign girls who come or who have come to britain for an abortion are reasonably well off and come from families corresponding roughly to our social classes i and ii—only those girls can afford to come and pay the fees that the clinics are charging—i suggest that the new continental laws, in particular the new french law, france being the country from which most of the foreign girls seeking abortions here originate, will greatly reduce the number of foreign girls coming to this country and also the opportunity for exploitation.\\n           another alleged defect of the 1967 act is that women can have abortions in this country up to 28 weeks. that is something that the bill seeks to amend by instituting a limit of 20 weeks. as the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) has said, the figure of 28 weeks appears not in the 1967 act but in the totally different act of 1929. as the minister has explained, that act has ramifications beyond abortion.\\n           i accept—i am sure that many hon. members who are opposed to the bill also accept—that the advances of medical science since 1929 demand a hard look at the age at which a foetus becomes viable. i agree, incidentally, with those who express some repugnance at the word \"viable\". the lane committee suggested that we should have a period of 24 weeks. it is important that all the medical and legal implications of the 1929 act should be considered together by the select committee and that they should not be put forward as they appear in the bill. this is a highly technical matter which is difficult for us to settle on the floor of the house here and now.\\n           finally, and most importantly, there is the question of the addition of the words \"grave\" and \"serious\" to the definition in the 1967 act. it is generally agreed by all hon members that bills have two effects, legal and declaratory. the sponsors of the bill will have to admit that whatever their legal intentions, the declaratory effect of this amending bill, coupled with its other internal restrictions, will be to deter the great bulk of practitioners from carrying out the great bulk of abortions.\\n           i do not want to bandy figures. i do not know whether the suggestions is correct which was reported in the times yesterday—it was a suggestion made by a medical specialist—that abortions among british women would be reduced from 100,000 to 20,000. however, i believe that there would be a substantial reduction.\\n           we all know who will be the sufferers. they will not be the richer women who obtained abortions legally and safely even before 1967. they will be the poor, the young, the under-educated and all the underprivileged people whom my hon. friends the members for pollok and for pontypool try particularly to help. as before, they will have to resort to self-inflicted or back-street abortions, with all the physical dangers and mental traumas that those methods imply. i am sure that no hon. member on either side of the house would want to vote for legislation which would have that kind of class impact.\\n           for all those reasons, i am glad that the sponsors have agreed to withdraw the bill and i hope that their wishes will be respected by all hon. members. if they withdraw the bill. i, for one and, i am sure, many hon. members who have doubts about it will be prepared to support the government\\'s motion for the setting up of a select committee.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'],

before he rose to his feet, and i accept in good faith what he told us.\\n           as the hon. member for pontypool (mr. abse) reminded us in an eloquent speech, there are those, who take up positions on the extremes of the argument, for whom the issue is very clear. on the one hand, there are those who see abortion as the cold-blooded murder of an unborn child, a hideous crime not to be justified in any circumstances, save perhaps where the mother\\'s life is in danger. on the other hand, there are those who see it as a woman\\'s basic right not to bear an unwanted child—in a sense, an act of liberation.\\n           in considering this bill, however, we are not concerned with the extremes of the argument. the bill does not seek to limit the existing grounds for a lawful abortion. it does not seek in any way to limit the \"social\" subsection in the 1967 act. the bill\\'s purpose is to improve and strengthen the act in the sense that parliament originally intended.\\n           it has two main aims. the first aim is to end abuses in the private sector which have caused deep public concern and anxiety to the medical profession. the second aim is to implement the peel report, which recommended a code of practice to govern research on foetuses.\\n           the house was indebted to the hon. member for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles (mr. steel) for his review of the working of the 1967 act. that act rightly sought to end the chaos and uncertainty that had prevailed previously in the law on abortion. its purpose was to end the terrible toll of suffering and misery caused by illegal abortions. it sought to spell out the grounds on which it would be lawful to terminate a pregnancy. what it did not set out to provide was legalisation of abortion on demand. whatever may have been said in the house today on that subject, the authors of the 1967 act made that very plain at the time.\\n           indeed the lane committee, whose members were unanimously in favour of the 1967 act, confirmed in paragraph 189 of its report: it would be contrary to the conditions for abortion laid down in the act that it should be obtainable solely at the wish of the woman.… that is the present legal position and nobody has suggested otherwise.\\n           it is, however, a measure of the weakness of the 1967 act that the committee went on to say that the criteria for abortion as expressed in the act were imprecise and could be widely interpreted and that some practitioners interpret the act to mean that termination is possible in every case. in fact, some doctors, relying on the statistical argument to which i shall refer in a moment, sometimes agree to an abortion without even seeing the patient. the lane committee condemned that practice as wholly unethical. that being so, it is not surprising, when considering abortion in the commercial private sector, as it has been allowed to develop under the 1967 act, that in some parts of that sector the lane committee found that the legislation had been flouted and that abortion on request had been the rule.\\n           the hon. member for pontypool and i said in 1967 that this was precisely what would happen. our fears have been fully realised. the fact is that many foreign women who come to great britain do so from countries where abortion is unlawful. but much more to the point—and this goes to the root of the bill—is that they are obtaining abortions here for money on a basis which the 1967 act never intended.\\n           my own view is that it was singularly unfortunate that the lane committee, having heard all the evidence, could not bring itself to recommend that abuses, which it recognised and put on record, should be remedied by amending legislation. an evil recognised and not dealt with is an evil compounded. at least the bill recognises the evil and seeks to do something about it. clearly, if the lane committee was correct that there was abuse—and all the evidence supports that view—parliament cannot be indifferent to the way in which its intentions have been flouted, and are being flouted, and parliament must do something about it.\\n           the question is \"how?\". the minister thought that the bill was wrong in clause 1 to qualify the words \"risk to … life\" and \"injury to … health\" as criteria for abortion. the hon. member for loughborough (mr. cronin), in a most interesting and moving speech, supported that view.\\n           i concede that the argument is finely balanced, but the reality is that pro-abortion doctors are openly boasting that the 1967 act is drawn in such a way that abortion on demand is quite possible. let me quote, for example, one leading gynaecologist who said publicly that he was certain that … abortion on demand does not contravene the abortion act … the act allowed abortion when the risk of permitting that pregnancy to continue was greater than the risk of abortion —i ask hon. members to ponder those words— when an abortion is carried out in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it is safer than allowing the pregnancy to go to term. those words are crucial to an understanding of the problem.\\n           now section 1(1)( a ) refers to the risk to a woman\\'s life and health being greater than if the pregnancy were terminated. and it is true that there is a small statistical risk to the life of a woman in childbirth which is slightly higher than the statistical risk to the life of a woman from induced abortion during the first 12 weeks. however, i ask the house to consider where that leads us and where it has led the country. we are asked to believe that statistically it is safer for a woman to have an abortion than to have a baby. on that basis the act can be used, and is being used, to justify abortion on request.\\n           it is, however, a false argument, because the deaths due to childbirth and those due to medically induced abortion are not comparable. i am advised that the first usually occurs in women suffering from disease or some other abnormality, while the second occurs in perfectly healthy women who would not have died had they not undergone the operation.\\n           clearly, those who have used that statistical basis to justify what they do are flouting the law. they know what they are doing; they are flouting the intentions of the 1967 act. indeed, the lane committee said, in paragraph 201 of its report, that it was quite wrong for the statistical view to be taken. i submit, however, that as long as that situation stands uncorrected it is almost certain that no prosecution can be brought under the act, for the doctor can shelter behind its ambiguities.\\n           more than once the police have reported that it is impossible to enforce the provisions of the act, for this reason. woman detective chief inspector brenda reeve writing in the 1973 edition of the police college magazine said: i feel that the incidence of illegal abortions by medical practitioners since april 1968 has increased quite considerably. an estimation, albeit a guess but based on evidence acquired in investigations, is that the actual number of abortions carried out by doctors is in fact twice the number quoted in the national statistics.… further, many that are notified are in fact unlawful for the reason that they do not fall strictly within the terms of section 1 of the 1967 act. that is the reality. the conclusion of that officer was that … unless the law is amended such enforcement of the act will remain virtually impossible. the purpose of clause 1(1)( b ) of this bill is to remedy that situation by removing uncertainty.\\n           frankly, i see no reason or excuse for not providing statutory controls and more effective surveillance of what goes on in private abortion clinics. the minister thinks that this can be done by regulation. the provisions in the bill ensure that the woman seeking a termination will have proper medical advice and treatment from the outset from persons who, if they close their eyes and ears to illegal and unethical procedures, can be summoned before the general medical council. that is not a situation which obtains now.\\n           it is not sufficient to say that this matter can be dealt with by administrative action. it is necessary to write safeguards into the law. the minister told us that he had made inquiries, leading him to draw up regulations to govern private clinics. such regulations have long been required. why was action left until january 1975. the abuses have been known for a long time. the lane committee said that there was a need for a proper licensing system for pregnancy advisory and referral bureaux. the bill provides such a system. the lane committee admitted that a scandalous situation existed but proposed no legislative action. the minister has admitted that a scandalous situation exists and promises to deal with it through administrative means.\\n           i submit that there is a strong argument against administrative and in favour of statutory action. the minister\\'s heart is in the right place, and i do not doubt the sincerity of what he said today. but ministers come and go. in view of the deep public concern on the subject, we think it right to insist that a licensing system is governed by statute.\\n           i turn briefly to two further matters which have been causing concern, especially to the medical profession. i refer first to the upper limit for safe abortion. earlier today the minister had some reservations about the provision in clause 7 which puts an end to abortion at a very late stage of pregnancy—a practice which has attracted very high fees to abortion clinics in the commercial private sector.\\n           i do not believe that anyone wants to adopt a dogmatic position on this, especially as the matter is likely to be referred to a select committee. but the peel committee recommended that, unless there was grave risk to the life or health of the mother, a gestation period of 20 weeks should be regarded as the safe limit. that was done because many people view with horror the deliberate killing of unborn children who have reached a stage where, with modern techniques which are being improved constantly, they are capable of survival. that is the point, and it is one to which some of the most distinguished gynaecologists in the land have given careful thought.\\n           no one in the medical world believes that the upper limit of 28 weeks which obtains at present is right. the lane committee thought that it should be reduced to 24 weeks, and it is relevant to remind the house that the british medical association said in its comments on the lane report: even with the reduction from 28 to 24 weeks, however, the position still exists that owing to an error in the calculation of dates a foetus intended for destruction could be born alive and be capable of functioning as a self-sustaining whole independently of any connection with the mother. that is the considered view of the british medical association. accordingly, we urge in the bill that the law should reflect that sound medical advice.\\n           secondly, i wish to refer to the question of experiment on aborted foetuses which may be alive and capable of independent existence. clause 8 deals with experiments on a foetus. it implements the code of practice recommended by the peel committee, which the lane committee supported.\\n           a number of hon. members have spoken with justifiable anger about what is happening in this connection in the private sector. it is impossible to measure the disgust which is felt about what is happening in some of these private abortion clinics. one advantage of setting up a select committee is that it can do what a standing committee of this house cannot do. it will be able to send for the tapes of some of the recorded conversations of these so-called doctors. it will be able to send for evidence over the widest possible area in order that these terrible practices may be judged properly. i feel sure that the whole house will agree that it is right that the law should be tightened up in this respect.\\n           it is all very well saying that this is a matter that can be left to administrative regulation. the trouble about that is that the police are convinced that it is impossible to get a conviction against those who are abusing the 1967 act unless women who have had an abortion know that their identity will not be revealed. to the best of my knowledge—perhaps the minister will correct me if i am wrong—no doctor has been convicted under the act. in any event, how does one get witnesses in cases where a private abortion clinic caters almost solely for foreign women who are here today and gone tomorrow? indeed, it is difficult to think of an area of wrongdoing in which there is greater justification for providing safeguards of this kind.\\n           i can understand the misgivings of the hon. members for loughborough and for roxburgh, selkirk and peebles about the onus of proof. the relevant provision in the bill does not mean that a person is in peril if he can show that he acted in good faith. only those flouting the law are in danger. this, however, is a matter on which it would be proper for the select committee to have the views of the medical profession, the home office, the police, and so on.\\n           it is of the utmost importance that the safeguards should be there to protect women who in some cases come from a long way off in fear and in a state of anxiety. whatever the outcome of her journey—it may be an abortion—a woman in this condition needs the best possible advice, care and treatment, and that is the purpose of the bill.\\n           i end—[hon. members: \"hear, hear.\"] i have been here all day, and i have listened carefully to a range of excellent and moving speeches on a subject which is of the greatest possible concern to all our constituents. i hope, therefore, that the house will take this matter very seriously indeed.\\n           i end, as i began, by saying that the bill does not interfere with the central purpose of the 1967 act. rather does it seek to strengthen that purpose, to put beyond doubt the original intention of parliament and to put an end to the evils that prevail in certain parts of the private sector. no doubt the bill can be improved. it may be that the best course is to send it to a select committee. but of one thing i am certain. public opinion on this subject is now so aroused that it will not tolerate any further long drawn-out delay in correcting a shameful and corrupt situation. i commend the purpose of the bill to the house.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1975, 2, 7, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4'], ['uk.proc.d.1975-02-07.4.1.184', 21, 'uk.m.19810', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'in view

effect of leaving out the whole of clause 1(4). that subsection did two things. first, it removed section 1(4) of the abortion act 1967—the principal act. secondly, it dealt with the statutory instrument procedure. therefore, by accepting that amendment the house, whether it realised what it was doing or not, not only declined to allow the statutory instrument procedure but decided to leave untouched section 1(4) of the principal act.\\n           that subsection provides for what might be called the emergency procedure. it provides that section 1(3) and so much of subsection (1) as relates to the opinion of two registered medical practitioners, shall not apply to the termination of a pregnancy by a registered medical practitioner in a case where he is of the opinion, formed in good faith, that the termination is immediately necessary to\"— for example— save the life … of the pregnant woman. accordingly, that subsection remains in the act, and provision remains in that measure for what is to happen in the event of an emergency termination. the next amendment to be considered by the house is no. 90, which seeks to amend clause 2. if we examine clause 2 and amendment no. 90 we find that they both deal with the emergency situation which is already dealt with by section 1(4) of the abortion act.\\n           whether the amendment is carried, whether the bill remains in its original form with clause 2 as it stands, or whether it is amended by leaving out a substantial part of the clause and inserting the words which, as i understand it, are now accepted by the promoter, the fact is that clause 2 will cover precisely the same subject as is already covered by section 1(4) of the abortion act. therefore, we will have double provision for the same subject. there will be provision in the original act and again in the bill as it stands.\\n           if the bill is passed we shall be sending to another place a measure that is complete nonsense. that is because it will be dealing with emergency termination in a way that appears in section 1 of the principal act and in the new section that is proposed to be added as a result of clause 2.\\n           that is clearly something that the house could not contemplate. for that reason alone, it would be necessary to pass an amendment which would clear up that matter altogether. that argument could perhaps be described as technical, in the sense that the other place, if the bill reaches it, could put the matter right. however, it is surely preferable for it to be put right in this place rather than to send to the other place a bill that is so seriously technically defective.\\n           however, the purpose of the amendment is twofold, and its second purpose is one of substance. the hon. member for buckingham, possibly because he did not wait to hear the explanation, did not fully appreciate the substantial purpose of the new subsection. during out last discussion there was a great deal of talk about possible compromise. indeed, the promoter of the bill put his name to a number of amendments, indicating that, the house having passed the 24-week amendment, and subject to one or two differences, he would be prepared to jettison the rest of the bill. many hon. members on both sides of the house who oppose a major part of the bill seemed to be willing to accept that compromise, and expressed themselves in those terms.\\n           unfortunately, a difficulty arose, because when the house debated the grouped amendments it voted for the word \"substantially\" by a majority of three votes, at the very last minute after it had heard the views of the attorney-general as expressed by the minister. i believe that it voted for that word on the basis that all the minister and the attorney-general had meant was that the use of the word \"substantially\" was a way of avoiding the difficulty in the minds of some conservative members—\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 14, 0,

produce the situation in which, in order for an abortion to be lawful, apart from the time limitation, there must be a considerably greater risk to the life of the pregnant mother than would be the case if the abortion did not take place. if there were some greater risk to the life of the mother, but not so much greater, the requirement for the preservation of the foetus in law would be higher than that for the preservation of the life of the pregnant woman.\\n           i do not believe that the house wanted to do that, but it reached that position because of the way matters turned out.

devizes (mr. morrison) suggested that the advice of the minister on the last occasion when he intervened to say why the government would not oppose the word \"substantially\" was legally correct. that may or may not be true but the minister did not give any reason for that advice. he pointed out that the attorney-general had not explained the significance of the word \"substantially\". some of the bill\\'s opponents felt strongly that the advice given to the house on that occasion was legally incorrect.\\n           i cannot pretend that this amendment corrects the wrong done by leaving the word \"substantially\" in the bill. this is simply an ameliorative provision that does not correct the wrong done by leaving in \"substantially\". i signed the amendment in that spirit, but i cannot pretend that if it were passed that would mean that all my doubts and reservations about the bill would be removed. that would not be the case, and i wish to explain why.\\n           the reason why i supported the 1967 act was that it struck a proper balance between the interests of the mother and the other children of the family and the interests of the foetus. i thought that the preservation of a proper balance was morally correct. i do not see that it is right to destroy the life of the foetus at the will of the mother. equally, i do not see that it is right to put at risk the health of the mother and the other children without serious consideration being given to their interests.\\n           it seems to me that a proper balance is one of probabilities between those interests. we left that balance in the 1967 act. when we included the word \"substantially\" in the bill we moved sharply towards the interests of the foetus and against the interests of the mother and the other children being considered. that is why i do not feel that i can allow the bill to go through without expressing the strongest opposition to it.\\n           in this clause it seems to me that we are trying to go back a little way only. it is ludicrous to assert, as some hon. members have, that because doctors are saying that the pattern of pregnancies in the past has shown that there is a 51–49 chance that the presence of a particular rubella will lead to deformity in the child or that a blockage of the passage may cause the death of the mother, it is necessary for us to include the word \"substantially\". i do not believe that that is how doctors work. to meet that fear, the amendment seeks to provide that even though that was the pattern of past events, the presence of a rubella or a blockage in the passage would provide a supervening factor.\\n           it would not be enough in such a case for the prosecution in an action against a consultant to call a doctor to give evidence to the effect that on past records the foetus or the mother were all right in 51 per cent of the cases, or even in 60 per cent. of the cases. the consultant who was on trial would be able to say that the clinical indications were that the life of the mother was in danger or that there was a risk to the health of the unborn child.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 14, 0, 0),

mother to claim an abortion is pre-eminent, but that does not mean that that is the law. any medical practitioner who conducted an abortion on that basis would be in breach of the 1967 act and would

the mother or the children of the family, and that involves, to some extent, such a balance.\\n           no doctor of integrity will carry out an abortion if the risk to the life of the mother is 1

the possibility of ending up in court, so they will sheer off from giving abortions. that is intolerably immoral. if, on the impartial and unbiased assessment of a woman's condition, a doctor thinks that it is right for her to have an abortion under the 1967 act, he should not be frightened off because he thinks that he might find himself in court. that is an intolerable situation, and i am

amendment seeks to meet. it does not appear convincing when their reaction to that problem is simply to move the closure and seek to steamroller the bill through, irrespective of the argument. i shall not labour the point, but if ever sponsors deserved to lose their bill it is the sponsors of this bill, after the way in which they have behaved this morning.\\n           i shall not seek to repeat at length the arguments put forward by my right hon. and learned friend the member for dulwich—he made them perfectly clear—but i wonder whether the hon. member for edgbaston was listening to him. she said that she was anxious that the house should not seek to put gobbledegook on the statute book. my right hon. and learned friend explained that that is precisely what would happen if the bill went forward in its present form. if that happens, the same problem will be dealt with on the statute book in two different places, with provisions that may be held to be inconsistent.\\n           i was one of those who, with my right hon. and learned friend the member for dulwich, had responsibility for five years for the condition of the statute book. we know that for one reason or another—because there was a late amendment, because there was not sufficient time, because someone perhaps wanted to use the statute book for cosmetic purposes—from time to time something reaches the statute book which later causes litigants a great deal of trouble. i must not complain—the legal profession does very well out of it—but it presents the courts with a real problem of construction.\\n           the house is normally responsible enough, wherever possible, to try to ensure that that does not happen, but if the bill proceeds unamended that is precisely what will happen. if the hon. member for edgbaston is anxious for us not to put gobbledegook on the statute book i hope that she will vote for the amendment, because that is the first thing that it seeks to achieve.\\n           the second and quite independent reason for the amendment is to try to remedy the problem that i thought most hon. members recognised when we debated the matter a fortnight ago. like my right hon. and learned friend the member for aberavon, i am still puzzled by the reasoning behind the insertion of the word \"substantially\". i am puzzled, first, because i do not think that there is a problem that it is designed to meet. virtually every lawyer in the house who has spoken on this subject has agreed that if it is designed to meet what is called the statistical argument applied by a doctor, that argument in any event rests upon a misconstruction of the 1967 act.\\n           it represents in the first place a sheer error of logic, i should have thought, on any showing, because to apply statistics relating to a substantial undifferentiated group of things or people to a particular individual situation that we know is distinguished by certain factors is simply a fallacious approach. as i suggested earlier, it would be like arguing that since most people die in bed it is safer to climb mount everest than to go to bed. it would therefore be a logical fallacy. but we also know that it would be a misconstruction of the act. if there were ever any doubt of that, we may be encouraged by the fact that the lane committee came down clearly in favour of that construction.\\n           it was therefore difficult to know to what it was that the insertion of the word was directed. for that reason, some of us would have welcomed the views of the attorney-general, so that we could have known whether he thought that there was genuinely a problem.\\n           some hon. members have done less than justice to what the minister for health said in the last debate. i have looked particularly carefully at his advice. he said: some hon. members are anxious that the wording of the criteria should not be capable of a purely statistical interpretation\". he did not say that in his view they were capable of that interpretation, still less that that was the correct interpretation. he went on: if the house feels that there should be some change to make this clear…it would be best achieved…\"—[ official report, 29 february 1980; vol. 979, c. 1726.] so, in fairness, the minister was not purporting to advise the house that that was the correct interpretation, or that there was a

problem. if there were a genuine problem—i do not believe that there is—that would not solve it.\\n           but the matter was debated and the house decided that the word \"substantially\" should remain in the bill. however, i am sure that those hon. members who listened to that debate feel that a problem remains. my right hon. and learned friend the member for aberavon referred to the risk involved. a doctor may arrive at a bona fide conclusion, but he runs the risk that it will be reconsidered by a jury. if that jury arrives at a different conclusion in good faith, he may find that he has committed a criminal offence. doctors will therefore be reluctant to carry out abortions.\\n           my right hon. and learned friend has corrected the gobbledegook in the bill. in addition, he has found a method of alleviating that problem. he has said that if the justification for keeping \"substantially\" in the bill is to deal with the statistical approach it follows that if a doctor does not use that approach the word \"substantially\" is not needed. in those circumstances the word \"substantially\" should be taken out.\\n           the hon. member for edgbaston seems to find this subject funny. every hon. member is entitled to his or her brand of humour, some of us believe that a problem exists. that problem could spell out tragedy for many people. we have not heard why

responsibility to ensure that the bill proceeds in a manner that is technically correct. there should be no obvious technical defects, and we have tried hard to meet the genuine problems that have arisen as a result of the last debate.\\n           at the beginning of the debate i thought that in a spirit of tolerance we might have had a meeting of minds. however, i no longer believe that that

of the points made by the member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine). i always listen carefully to what the hon. gentleman says. i remember the days when he was a junior minister. i think that his attitude towards this matter was slightly different then from what it is today. he then paid great attention to what the british medical association felt, and i think that he still has a high regard for the medical profession. however, it ill becomes the hon. gentleman to insinuate or imply that there is widespread abuse of an act of parliament. the hon. gentleman appreciates that there is no perfect act of parliament. regardless of what it is that we enact, there will always be loopholes for abuse, but one does not plug such loopholes by making it impossible or extremeley difficult for people who require the services to obtain them. the hon. gentleman must accept that.\\n           the hon. gentleman talked about phoney statistics. that was a rather graphic way of describing what really applies to all statistics. he is right to suggest that the statistics could be phoney. i pointed out in an earlier intervention that a whole range of conditions is taken into consideration by a doctor. the general statistical argument is only one factor in the specific statistical indication that applies in any individual case. for example, if i were a gynaecologist who carried out abortions i would make a distinction between statistics in the case of a young healthy woman and those applying to an older woman. i would take into consideration not only the age of such patients but their history, as well as their physical and mental examinations.\\n           a whole series of statistics is built up. it would be wrong—i am sure that it is wrong within the terms of the 1967 act —for a doctor to perform an abortion under the cloak of the so-called general statistical rule. i certainly would play no part in that.\\n           like my hon. friend the member for york (mr. lyon), i do not think that the amendment is as good as leaving the original act alone, but at least it would undo some of the potential damage that could be caused if the word \"substantially\" was left in. it would mean that in forming an opinion, a doctor would regard the word \"substantially\" as being omitted from the subsection. however, many other factors would be involved, because as i have indicated, each case is considered on its merits and on the condition of the individual patient.\\n           i cross swords with my hon. friend the member for york on the question of a substantial risk. it is not always the case that a 1 in 100 risk of a patient dying is not a substantial risk.for example, in conditions of grave seriousness, such as a cancer operation, a 1 in 100 risk is not a big risk. it is a small risk, because the mortality rate from the condition is very high. but in other circumstances, a 1 in 100 risk is not an acceptable one. it might be too high a risk. all i am saying is that it is extremely difficult to arrive at any kind of yardstick by which this could be judged.\\n           we are entering the realm of the doctor\\'s clinical judgment, but whether one agrees with everything that the medical profession does is another story. however, such opinions interfere with clinical judgment, and that is the great problem with regard to the clause and what the amendment seeks to do. it is an extremely dangerous prospect from the medical point of view. i would hate to be placed in a situation in which, before i performed any kind of operation or gave advice to a patient, i would have to take legal advice first.\\n           legal advice does not relate to the medical risk, but rather to what the legal risk is. that could well apply in the case of a gynaecologist who refused to carry out an abortion because he did not think that the risk was substantial. i gave an example earlier of a woman with a moderate or even mild degree of high blood pressure. the gynaecologist might consider that the degree of high blood pressure was not sufficient to warrant the word \"substantial\". but what would happen if the woman died? by definition, it must have been substantial. if the patient\\'s husband then raised an action against the doctor for not carrying out the abortion—and that is a situation that could well happen—the doctor would be placed in an extremely difficult position.\\n           it would take only one such case for the gynaecologist to seek legal opinion, not on the medical aspect but on the legal aspect. the legal opinion would have to say \"in my opinion the following is the lesser of the two legal risks, but it is up to you, as a doctor, to decide what the medical risk is\". that is a catch 22 situation. in such circumstances, i do not believe that a doctor should be placed in a different situation from that in which he is placed with regard to other operations. surgeons per- form many extremely serious operations, such as heart, brain or kidney operations, but they are not subject to a law or regulation that says that the doctor must take other considerations into account. that is perfectly right.\\n           the argument could be—this is the nub of the whole debate—that in this instance doctors are dealing with something entirely different. in this case we are dealing with people who are totally opposed to abortion. i do not accept that such people believe in abortion in certain circumstances. they do not want abortions at all. what they consider to be unborn life takes total precedence over anything else. i can appreciate that point of view, and i can understand that some people hold that conviction very deeply. they say that there are no circumstances whatever in which abortion is permissible. i can understand that, but they should not cloak that fundamental attitude in an aura of wanting to improve the act, when they really want to destroy it.\\n        ',

have already had considerable differences of opinion on the question whether good faith is an objective or subjective assessment. the mere fact that there is debate about that is sufficient to put doctors off. i might be satisfied with the words \"good faith\" were it not that there are many people who would love to get at any doctor if the bill went through in its original form. in view of the opposition to the 1967 act, manifest over the past few years, there may be a certain amount of vindictiveness. the situation is slightly different from what it was. i do not accept that the words \"good faith\" are sufficient to protect the doctor.\\n           i can understand the ethical aspect. i am not in favour of abortion on demand or request. i am not in favour of any operation on request. it should be for discussion between the patient, doctor and others concerned. although i respect contrary views, i cannot see, in a matter affecting the life or health of my patient, that abortion differs substantially —if i may use the word—from any other condition that i am entitled to consider as a doctor. that may be a fundamental difference between me and those who consider that a regard for human life must apply from the very moment of conception. i respect their views, but i do not see it that way, and i believe that the vast majority of the people in the country agree with me.\\n           phoney statistics have been produced. i have a letter claiming that the statistics that i gave in an article can be matched with statistics to prove the opposite. it depends on the questions asked. if i were asked whether i believed in killing unborn babies, my answer would be \"no\". some people say that abortion is killing unborn babies. that is another argument, and i do not agree with it.\\n           the promoter of the bill has been bemused by many of the machinations and debates from both sides of the house in the past few months. i respect his sincerity, but it is

and that they have more support than they really have. we all fall into that trap from time to time. when 20 or 30 people shout something at us, we imagine that they represent millions.\\n           from my experience in medical practice over a long period, in parliament, and from representing two constituencies, i have no doubt that the vast majority do not agree. if one walks only among one\\'s

without standing behind it himself. because of a decision taken at our last sitting we need clarification about the consequences of accepting the amendment.\\n           it is most reprehensible that the attorney-general is not here today. perhaps he has stayed away because he does not like the bill. he did not vote for it on second reading. as i understand it, the duties of a law officer are to help the house impartially both about the things that he likes and those that he does not like. even if the attorney-general does not like this bill, that is no excuse for his not coming here to assist the house.\\n           i support the amendment of my right hon. and learned friend the member for dulwich for reasons that i have advocated throughout the proceedings of the bill. my reasons are that i believe that doctors should have the discretion to exercise their clinical judgment and that any attempt to hedge round the exercise of that judgment does not make life easy either for doctors or their patients and it is the patient for whom we should have the greatest care. if we attempt to curtail that discretion there is a little more profit for the lawyers but life is made harder for doctors and patients. that happens every time we try to put an arbituary limitation on the judgment of the doctor.\\n           we should recall that the views of two doctors are required in this context and that those views must be exercised in good faith. there is a double safeguard; there are two doctors and they must both act in good faith. when we attempt to put artificial constraints on doctors—in language universally condemned as obscure—we are being unhelpful.\\n           i fully understand why the hon. member for birmingham, edgbaston (mrs. knight) did not wish to give way to hon. members who wished to intervene during her speech. when one has had too much to drink before driving one does not wish to wind down the window when the \"copper\" comes along. one does not wish to be caught out. the hon. lady knew that she was in danger of being caught out if she gave way when she referred to the language in the bill as being gobbledegook. in so far as there is gobbledegook in this bill it is the fault of the sponsor. the bill is not a big bill, but in committee the sponsor himself admitted that no fewer than seven clauses were so badly drafted that they were incapable of amendment. they had to be taken out and redrafted.\\n           there was an eighth clause, which was found by the opponents of the bill to be out of order as being beyond the scope of the long title. it had to be put in order by an amendment moved by the opponents of the bill. we all regretted that the sponsor of the bill fell ill, but before the hon. gentleman became ill he said that he intended to rip out clause 4 and replace it with a new clause. that was because the first clause 4 was gobbledegook. he did not use that word, but that is what he meant. he felt that the wording was no good, and he intended to seek the advice of the department in order to draft a new clause 4 that was not gobbledegook.\\n           unhappily the hon. gentleman became ill and the bill was left in the care of his lion. friends. they liked the gobbledegook and did not want the sponsor\\'s new clause 4. there was a classic occasion when the committee was due to meet but could not do so because there was not a quorum. hon. gentlemen were arguing amongst themselves and were unable to agree which clause 4 they wished to discuss. the result was that they did not go into committee at all. it therefore lies ill in the mouths of those hon. members who support the bill—least of all in the mouth of the hon. member for edgbaston—to talk about other people being responsible for putting gobbledegook into the bill.\\n           i hope that something can be salvaged of this wreck along the lines suggested by the hon. member for windsor and maidenhead (dr. glyn) and by my hon. friend the member for pontypool (mr. abse). talks were held at an early stage designed to produce a bill that would meet the general will of the house as expressed in a statement by five privy councillors and as has been expressed by other people inside and outside this house. that attempt at a compromise broke down because some of the supporters of the bill, though not all of them—there are hawks and \"wets\" among the bill\\'s supporters as there are in the government—were unwilling to give up the word \"substantially\". that was when the compromise attempt broke down.\\n           12.45 pm\\n           we must now ask ourselves whether an acceptance of the bill with the amendment of my right hon. and learned friend is a real solution. some hon. members have suggested that that might be the case, but my hon. friend the member for york (mr. lyon) demolished that suggestion in what i thought was a masterly speech. he showed in a masterly analysis that it was not the case that the bill would cease to be obnoxious merely because of the addition of the amendment of my right hon. and learned friend. i cast no slur upon the amendment; i support it, because it offers some improvement. but that improvement does not alter the fact that the word \"substantially\" remains. that is where the damage is done.\\n           a suggestion was made by the under-secretary of state that something might be done about this issue in another place. i thought that his intervention came somewhat late. he might have sought to make that point before the closure was moved, since he did not know that his intervention was going to be prevented the closure.\\n           at one stage i was attracted to the idea, but i resiled from it because i have become increasingly conscious that no one who relies on the other place doing something can guarantee to deliver. the other place is showing increasing tendencies to be unpredictable and, occasion- ally, to behave in a way contrary to the upbringing of its members.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 14, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-03-14.3'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-03-14.3.3.179', 2, 'uk.m.17986', 'uk.p.Lab', 0, 'NaN', 'mp', 'almost

24-weeks proposal and no further clauses, that would have ended the matter. that may well be his personal view, but is not the view of the organisations which, outside this place, are conducting a tremendous lobby on the subject.\\n           on 13 february one of those organisations, called \"life\", issued a circular, presumably to its agents and allies, in which it said, among other things: our final political objective is full repeal of the 1967 abortion act and its replacement by a statute giving full legal protection to all unborn children from conception onwards. since 1974 we have had our own draft bill ready for a brave mp to take on. it is a wonder, in view of that, that the hon. member who sponsored the bill was unable to take advantage of the offer that is implied by the organisation. many of us who participated in the committee stage, and some of my hon. friends who have longer histories on previous bills on this subject, have always been aware that the real architects of these measures are those who will never be content until the 1967 act has been removed from the statute book.\\n           there was not a lot of talk in committee about compromise. the membership was divided 12 to five in favour of the bill, so that it was possible for the sponsor to achieve virtually anything. in the final analysis it is votes that count, and the sponsor and his hon. friends were well aware of that.\\n           my hon. friends the members for bethnal green and bow (mr. mikardo) and for barking (miss richardson) made various perfectly reasonable approaches in committee on certain clauses, but the supporters of the bill were fairly confident—at some stages supremely confident—that they would succeed. they were misled by the hon. member for essex, south east (sir b. braine) into believing—particularly when the hon. member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) became ill—that, given his guidance, the bill could be successfully concluded. but even given that, the bill was always acknowledged to be a part measure towards achieving that ultimate objective.\\n           the circular from \"life\" continued: so mr. corrie\\'s bill is a long way from our final objective. we particularly object to the clause that openly discriminates against handicapped children. nevertheless, we decided to support the bill in its original form because if it becomes law it would save the lives of thousands of unborn children\", and so on. so we do not have to go far to realise that the comments of my hon. friend the member for pontypool about the future of this bill or any other private member\\'s legislation designed to subvert the purposes of the 1967 act were unrealistic.\\n           i should like to refer to a telegram received this morning. it reads: i want to bring to your attention a statement which was today endorsed by the tuc women\\'s conference in brighton. the 50th tuc women\\'s conference is dismayed that parliament seems prepared to sacrifice the livelihoods of the children of broken marriages in order to curtail further a woman\\'s rights to control her own fertility. conference today repeats its total opposition to mr. corrie\\'s abortion (amendment) bill and urges all mps to heed the advice of the whole trade union movement to reject this bill. we plead with the commons at this eleventh hour to consider the pain and suffering which will be inflicted on so many women and their families if this proposal becomes law, and to reject the bill. the tuc repeats its wholehearted support for the 1967 abortion act and

1967 act relating to the period of gestation we can all happily go away feeling that, for the time being at least, the house will not be forced to consider abortion again. this is a complete misconception. as long as organisations such as the society for the protection of the unborn child and \"life\" exist, they will be anxious to deprive women of their right to determine whether they should continue their pregnancies. we shall continue to have this sort of attempt to change the 1967 act in radical ways and finally to repeal it completely. this will deprive women of their fundamental rights.\\n        ', datetime.datetime(1980, 3, 14, 0, 0), 'uk.proc.d.1980-03-14.3'], ['uk.proc.d.1980-03-14.3.3.184', 596, 'uk.m.16386', 'uk.p.Lab', 1, 'NaN', 'mp', 'i shall be brief, mr.

hon. and learned friend the member for dulwich (mr. silkin) has been able to formulate an amendment which, to some extent, will ameliorate the damage caused two weeks ago when the house decided to retain the word \"substantially\".\\n           there is no doubt that the bill, without the amendment, is very dangerous. i shall not repeat all the arguments about the 24-week period. we have had a decision on that. the house then voted, albeit by only three votes, to retain the word \"substantially\", and this sent a chill of horror down the backs of many people when they realised what the house had done. many of them were prepared to accept the 24-week provision, but they cannot accept the word \"substantially\" because that makes this an illiberal bill.\\n           because of this, the trades union congress women\\'s conference at brighton this week sent a telegram to a number of hon. members. my hon. friend the member for preston, south (mr. thorne) has just quoted it and i am sorry that you did not allow him to finish it, mr deputy speaker. that telegram was sent also to the hon. member for bute and north ayrshire (mr. corrie) because the conference felt that not only labour members should know how they felt but that the sponsors of the bill should realise the deep feelings of a large group of women on this issue.\\n           my hon. friend the member for preston, south also referred to the do-it-yourself kits. in many ways it is significant that these kits have appeared in the eight months since we began discussing this restrictive bill, during which we have talked about the possibility of a return to back-street abortions if it becomes law. i am sure that our discussions and the appearance of these kits are connected. had we not had the bill, and had we had just one year free from any discussion of abortion, whoever is manufacturing these kits—a reprehensible action—may not have thought of doing so. the manufacturers saw this bill as a chance to jump on the bandwagon and cash in on the problems that the hon. member for bute and north ayreshire has caused for many women by bringing forward this bill.\\n           i am sorry that i am not able to make my next point in the presence of the hon. member for essex, south-east (sir b. braine), as he has left the chamber. he made constant reference to the fact that he believed that we had abortion on demand in this country. i absolutely refute that. had we had abortion on demand, we should have had a much greater spread of national health services\\' facilities, and facilities and clinics for the bpas, which at present do not cover the whole country. there is certainly not abortion on demand.\\n           the sponsors of the bill base their claim on the fact that one doctor—dr. peter huntingford—has said that from time to time he has performed abortions on women as requested. we all know that at his clinic women must be referred by a gp in the first place. he cannot just take in any woman who comes to him without a reference from a gp. also, the fact that one doctor says that he has performed abortions on demand does not mean that this is a generality.\\n        ',

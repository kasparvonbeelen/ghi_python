POP 72 Board of Works for the Poplar District. ANNUAL REPORT, YEAR 1896, ON The Sanitary Condition of the Parishes of POPLAR and BROMLEY within the Poplar District with Vital Statistics, BY FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Diplomate in Public Health, Medical Officer. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDIAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE SOUTH DISTRICT, Comprising the Parishes of All Saints, Poplar, and Bromley Saint Leonard. To the Chairman and Members of the Board of Works for the Poplar District. Gentlemen, I have the honour of placing before you my fourth Annual Report, which includes the annual reports of the Sanitary Inspectors for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley, and the report of the Inspector of Nuisances in Manufactories and Workshops. This report, in accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, deals with the year 1896, which year, for registration purposes, covers a period of 53 weeks, and ended on the 2nd January, 1897. VITAL STATISTICS. In my report for the year 1895, the population estimated to the middle of that year for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley, and calculated in the manner as stated on the second page of that report, was found to be 57,508 and 72,658 respectively. The quinquennial census 2 for the year 1896, which was taken to enable certain taxation arrangements to be adequately dealt with, showed that the estimated population of the parish of Poplar was slightly under-estimated, and that of Bromley considerably over-estimated. This census also showed that the estimated population of Registration London at the beginning of the year 1896 in use by the Registrar General, was 14,463 more than it should be if worked out upon the figures of the quinquennial census for 1896 and the census for 1891. The Registrar General based his figures upon the enumerations of the years 1881 and 1891. The Poplar and Bromley figures were also based upon the enumerations of the figures of the censuses for those years, and estimated as if the population increased in the same ratio per million of the metropolitan population for the year under observation. The following figures were the estimated populations to the middle of the year 1896 based upon the censuses of 1881 and 1891, before the census of 1896 was obtained:— Registration Poplar. Bromley. London. 4,435,955 57,782 73,295 but after the quinquennial census of 1896 the populations estimated to the middle of the year, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1891 and 1896 being maintained, are— Registration Poplar. Bromley. London. 4,421,492* 57,829 69,803 being 59.2 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 49.6 per acre in Poplar, and 114.8 in Bromley, and these estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present report. The rates for past years have been calculated upon amended estimated populations, and, with the exception of that for the year * Afterwards amended to 4,421,955. 3 1896, cannot be fairly compared with the rates as given in the unamended annual returns of the Registrar General. Decennial Census Returns of Poplar and Bromley, 1801 to 1891, and the quinquennial Census of 1896. Years. Population of Poplar. Population of Bromley. Population of Registration London. 1801 4493 2684 958,863 1811 7701 3581 1,138,815 1821 12,223 4360 1,378,947 1831 16,849 4846 1,654,994 1841 20,342 6154 1,948,417 1851 28,348 11,789 2,362,236 1861 41,632 24,062 2,803,989 1871 48,611 41,710 3,254,260 1881 53,521 64,114 3,815,544 1891 56,317 70,002 4,211,743 1896 57,759 69,821 4.411,271 The decrease in the population of Bromley may doubtless be partially accounted for by the closing of the houses in Ammiel Terrace and Ammiel Street, and, of the adjoining houses in the High Street, by the demolition and closing of the houses in the "Anne Street area," the demolition of the houses in Duff's Fields, and also on the East India Dock Road for the "Iron Bridge Improvement." It is possible that the decrease in the population may be accounted for by the action of the landlords in increasing the rents (as they threatened to do on account of the work they have had to carry out since the enforcement of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891), the tenants having to go to cheaper districts, and the houses being not so overcrowded. It will be noticed that the estimated population of Bromley to the middle of the year is lower than the enumerated population at the quarter of the year: these figures are, without doubt, not actually correct, as no houses had been closed or pulled down: but they must remain and form the basis upon which to work out the various rates, in order to compare the different rates of London and its sanitary areas, the populations of which are estimated upon the same theory. If the 4 actual population of Bromley is higher than that at which it is estimated, as possibly it is, the various death rates would be lower; even with the population of this parish as estimated, it will be seen later on that the death rate is only 20.3 per 1000, with a zymotic death rate of 3.6 per 1000: and comparing these rates with those of the other Metropolitan Eastern Districts, Table V., page 15, Bromley stands well. The births during the 53 weeks were:— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 1016 1015 2031 Bromley 1287 1328 2615 Totals 2 303 2343 4646 Of these births 85 were illegitimate in Poplar, 52 males and 33 females. In Bromley there were 44 illegitimate births, 23 males and 21 females. The annual birth rate per 1000 living being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. Poplar 33.3 34.7 35.1 Bromley 36.3 37.9 37.4 During the year the marriages of 2048 persons were registered in Poplar and Bromley, giving an annual rate of 16.0 per 1000 of the estimated population, the rate for England and Wales being 15,7 and for London 18.0. The annual marriage rate per 1000 living being:— 1894 1895. 1896. Poplar and Bromley 14.07 13.7 16.0 In the 53 weeks, 1040 deaths were registered in Poplar, and 1857 in Bromley; from the 1040 deaths which took place in Poplar there 5 must be deducted 69 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 280 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1251 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1857 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 620 deaths of non-parishioners, and adding 185 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1422. The 1251 deaths in Poplar included 21 illegitimate children—15 male and 6 female—and the 1422 deaths in Bromley included 20 illegitimate children—11 male and 9 female. Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 702 549 1251 Bromley 728 694 1422 Totals 1430 1243 2673 The excess of births was as follows:— Males. Females. Total gain. Poplar 314 466 780 Bromley 559 634 1193 Totals 873 1100 1973 The male deaths in the two parishes exceeded those of the female by 187 and the female births exceeded those of the male by 40. In order to compare the death rates and other rates for the two parishes, I have gone back to the year 1885, and have estimated the populations to the middle of the succeeding years upon the known censuses of 1881, 1891 and 1896, so as to obtain, as far as possible, accurate populations to work upon. These rates cannot be fairly compared with those of London, given by the Registrar General in his annual reports, inasmuch as the populations given in these reports are estimated upon the censuses of 1871, 1881 and 1891, and based upon the theory, that the rate of change which prevailed between those censuses would be maintained. The rates for the year 1896 can be fairly compared with those of London, as the 6 lations have been estimated in the manner described upon the second page of my annual report for the year 1895. The following figures give the amended estimated populations, number of deaths and death rates, between the years 1885 and 1896 inclusive:— Year. Amended estimated population to middle of year. Number of deaths. Death rate per per 1000 living. 1885. Poplar 54,708 1206 22.0 Bromley 66,616 1342 20.1 121,324 2548 21.0 1886.

Poplar 57,829 1251 21.6 Bromley 69,803 1422 20.3 127,632 2673 20.9 To compare these death rates with those of the whole of the Metropolis cannot be a fair criterion, as the class of inhabitants in the various Metropolitan Sanitary areas varies; but the death rates, as given above, ought to be compared with those of districts the inhabitants of which belong mainly to the same class and have the same surroundings, such as Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, St. George-in-the-East, Limehouse, Mile End Old Town. In the above rates it will be seen that the death rate of Bromley has been as low as 15.6 per 1000 living, and that of Poplar as high as 27.4 per 1000 living; this high rate occurred in the year 1890, singular to say, after the severe floodings of 1889 and 1890. To analyse the cause of the variation in the death rates of past years would take a longer time than could possibly be given in this report as there are so many factors to be considered; but it is well to 8 remember that the death rate which speaks mostly respecting the sanitary condition of a district is the zymotic death rate, and as diarrhoea is one of the diseases included among those forming the zymotic group, and is a complaint the prevalence of which depends greatly upon the heat of the earth, it almost necessarily follows that the zymotic death rate will be high during hot summers, and more especially when the seasons are accompanied by drought; under such conditions the general death rate becomes high. Deaths from respiratory diseases such as laryngitis, simple croup, emphysema, asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia and pleurisy are dependent to a great extent upon climatic changes, and the death rate from those complaints would be increased during a severe cold season. The following are death rates per 1000 living from the seven principal Zymotic diseases (see Tables VIII. and IX. pages 19 and 20) and Respiratory diseases:— Poplar. Bromley. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1894. 1895. 1896. Respiratory Diseases 3.3 5.2 4.0 4.3 6.0 4.4 Zymotic Diseases 2.4 4.3 3.6 3.3 4.0 3.6 In studying these rates, it would be well to look at the general death rates for the corresponding years to see how they vary, and also to remember the frost at the beginning of the year 1895; later on the heat and drought; and the heat and drought of the year 1896. The summer of the year 1894 was a very wet and cold one; that of the year 1893 was very hot, and accompanied by drought. On page 35 will be found the number of deaths from Diarrhoea for each of the past four years. Diarrhoea was very prevalent in the year 1893, which was also a great year for scarlet fever (see page 26). The spread of these diseases may, beyond doubt, be attributed to the fact that the Asylums Boards Authorities were much pushed to provide sufficient accommodation. Deaths from scarlet fever and diarrhoea were high, hence the death rate rose. 9 Two Sanitary Committees of urgency were called during the summer vacation, to enquire into the statements made by the Press as to the increase of fever, etc., in the district during the short supply of water by the East London Waterworks Company. There was no question that the sewers and drains were not properly flushed; that, during this time of drought and short water-supply, very foul sewer-gas escaped from the sewer ventilators, and water-closets were also not properly flushed. A short water-supply, with ill-flushed drains and sewers during a hot dry summer, must have a tendency to vitiate the public health, and ought not to be passed over without notice when death rates for particular years are being considered. There were 361 deaths of children under one year of age, belonging to Poplar, and 441 deaths, under one year of age, belonging to Bromley. The death rates of children, under one year of age, per 1000 births for the past three years being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. Poplar 152 190 177 Bromley 152 184 168 The number of deaths, from one year to 65 years of age, was 691 for Poplar, and 790 for Bromley. The annual death rates per 1000 living for the past three years being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. Poplar 11.37 14.0 11.94 Bromley 11.46 12.34 11.31 The number of deaths, over 65 years, was 199 for Poplar, and 191 for Bromley. The annual death rates per 1000 living for the past three years being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. Poplar 3.0 4.1 3.4 Bromley 2.2 2.9 2.7 10 11 TABLE I.

Notifications and Hospital Accommodation, Outworkers, and Port Sanitary Authorities Notifications. There were 656 notifications of infectious diseases in Poplar, and 964 in Bromley; these totals do not include 69 second notifications, forwarded for the two parishes. The notification rate per 1000 living being:— 1894 1895 1896 Poplar ... 10.6 ... 13.6 ... 11.3 Bromley ... 12.9 ... 11.9 ... 13.8 Seven of the infectious cases, viz.—two of scarlet fever, two of typhoid fever, and three of diphtheria—were notified from premises where milk was sold. The usual steps were taken to prevent the sale of the milk until after the disinfection of the premises and utensils. During the past year there was difficulty in obtaining the removal of infectious cases to the Asylums Boards Hospital, on account ot want of accommodation, patients remaining many days at their homes after notice to the Asylums Board had been given. Diphtheria cases suffered mostly from want of isolation, and in the instance of such cases awaiting removal, the Asylums Board sent a warrant for AntiToxic Serum to be forwarded to the practitioner attending the case, in order that he might obtain Anti-Toxic Serum from certain hospitals, to be employed in the treatment of the patient, if necessary, with the consent of the patient or of responsible relations. The Asylums Board also issued special forms of application for removal to be used in times of pressure. This difficulty in obtaining prompt isolation of infectious cases occurred also in 1893 and 1895. During these times of want of accomodation the same steps were taken as mentioned in previous reports. 25 Ten outworkers in Bromley were connected with infectious cases notified. The usual notices were served. No notices from Port Sanitary Authorities were received. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT. The following figures give the number of premises disinfected, and the number of times the Board's apparatus was used for the two parishes, some thousands of articles being disinfected. Private premises. Board's apparatus. Poplar 474 364 Bromley 690 590 1164 954 SMALL POX. There were no notifications of small pox received from Bromley, but eight cases were notified from Poplar. Seven of these patients were removed to the hospital, two were sent back as not having the disease, and one case, treated at home, turned out not to be small pox at all, so that really only five cases of small pox occurred, and these existed in one family at 109 East Ferry Road. The complaint was contracted by the mother visiting her daughter in Canning Town, who was suffering from small pox. The father caught the disease from the mother; the brother also visited his sister and contracted small pox, and his wife was also attacked, in addition to their little girl aged two years. The usual disinfection steps were taken. Mr. Hitchins the Vaccination Officer has kindly furnished me with the following statistics :— January to June, 1896. Births. ( Notified.) Dead. Vaccinations.

Seven cases occurred in the Poplar Union Workhouse, five in the Sick Asylum, and one in the Scandinavian Sailors' Home; all these cases were removed. The three cases which happened at the Poplar Hospital were those of nurses, and they were removed to the London Fever Hospital Eighty-two cases were removed to the Asylums Boards' Hospitals from Poplar, and 170 cases from Bromley. CONTINUED AND TYPHOID FEVERS. Six cases of continued fever were notified in Bromley, and no case in Poplar. No deaths occurred from this disease. The typhoid fever cases were— 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. Poplar 80 72 56 ... 85 Bromley .. 218 84 80 68 298 *56 136 153 27 The 85 cases in Poplar were notified from 68 houses, and the 68 cases in Bromley from 54 premises; in the first instance, 21 housedrains were found defective, and in the second 14. the smoke-test being used. Twenty-four cases (including one from Poplar Union Workhouse) in Poplar, and 36 in Bromley were removed to various hospitals as follows : — Poplar. Asylums Boards' Hospitals ... ... ... 19 St. Bartholomew's Hospital ... ... ... 1 London Hospital ... ... ... ... 4 24 Bromley. Asylums Boards' Hospitals ... .. ... 22 St. Bartholomew's Hospital ... ... ... 2 London Hospital ... ... ... ... 9 Guy's Hospital ... ... ... ... 2 East London Hospital for Children ... ... 1 36 Two of the cases notified in Poplar were from the Poplar Union Workhouse; one of these cases was removed to an Asylums Boards' Hospital, and the other to the Sick Asylum. A case was also notified from the City of London Union Infirmary in Bromley. Twelve Poplar parishioners died from typhoid fever, and 10 fatal cases occurred in Bromley. Under the heading of diphtheria will be found information as to the distribution, &c., of the typhoid fever cases. The risk incurred of contracting disease by eating oysters, which have been laid in water liable to sewage contamination, is fully recognised. Typhoid fever has been proved in many cases, to have been due to eating uncooked oysters and mussels, taken from such sources. Legislation appears to be urgently required on this matter, more 28 especially, as crude sewage is turned into the sea, near the mouths of rivers. Typhoid fever, engendered in this manner, is one of the many outcomes of impoverishing the land, by robbing it of its natural rights, viz., nitrification of fcecal and waste matter. Deuteronomy 23, 12. "Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go forth abroad : 13. And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon ; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee." The grandest hygienic law ever enacted; involving a principle which ought to remain for all time, and be the basis of perfect sanitation. DIPHTHERIA (INCLUDING MEMBRANOUS CROUP). 160 cases of diphtheria and 10 cases of membranous croup were notified in Poplar, and 348 cases of diphtheria and 8 cases of membranous croup were notified in Bromley. The diphtheria and membranous croup patients, classified according to sex and schoolage, were as follows :— Males. Females. South Poplar 26 25 North Poplar - 54 65 South Bromley ... ... 89 120 North Bromley ... 62 85 231 295 3 to 10 years. Total. School age cases. Males. Females. Per 100 cases notified.

Of the total 526 cases notified, 121 were 29 isolated in hospitals. The 170 cases notified from Poplar belonged to 146 houses, of which 54 were found by the smoke test to have defective drains, and the 356 cases notified in Bromley were from 295 houses, of which number 70 were found to have defective drains; in conjunction with this, it has to be remembered, that, as the drains were only tested with smoke, those houses where no defects were revealed might still have defective drains, in those instances in which the pipes are covered with a deep layer of earth, and soil pollution might be going on to an alarming extent, and contaminating the ground air.

The above statistics appear to bear out some of these views, viz., that during a period of rainfall, causing the sewers to be well flushed, more especially when the atmospheric temperature is not high, the tendency of diphtheria to prevail is lessened. The question must be naturally asked, why does diphtheria prevail when such a large amount of sanitary work is being carried out in respect to houses, inasmuch as their drains are being intercepted, ventilated, and their rain water pipes disconnected. The answer to this query must be: That the sewers ought to be ventilated, more especially as by modern sanitation the sewer gases are more and more confined in the sewers, and the gases escape in large doses by means of the street ventilators. Defective and foul street gullies and foetid accumulations in the road channels are also the means by which the air becomes polluted. The advice given by your Surveyor, Mr. Oxtoby, to build flushing tanks at the heads of the shallow sewers (which advice has been carried out in two or three instances), when fully adopted, will no doubt be greatly beneficial to the public health, and will save the ratepayers money, by obviating the necessity of constantly breaking open the roads, in order to clear the sewers, which, in this District, have a shallow fall. The Surveyor's recommendation to pave the street channels, will also prevent emanations from polluted ground, in many cases very near the houses. It is necessary to impress upon the public the danger of piling vegetable refuse, &c., in heaps, in their back gardens and yards, which practice is so commonly found to exist. This refuse should be dug into the ground to nitrify, so as to become food for plants, &c., or should be put into pails supplied by the Board, to be carted away, and should not be left as a festering mass, causing diphtheria and diarrhoea. All the structural sanitary work possible, such as rectifying defective drains, affording under-floor ventilation, and covering sites of houses with concrete, will not prevent disease, if back yards and gardens remain in a constantly foul condition. At the beginning of the year 32 1897, the Board resolved to erect a "destructor" to destroy the refuse of the district. To burn matter of any kind and thereby to impoverish the land is doubtless wrong, if such waste material can be properly returned to decompose (nitrify) in the soil; but when unfortunately thtough congested states of districts—our present mode of existing—no land is available in order to utilise such refuse as manure, and it can only be disposed of by taking it to " shoots," where it is allowed to putrify and pollute the air of other districts with germs and noxious gases, burning (until some other wiser and practical method is discovered), is certainly the better of the two evils for the disposal of it. Had this method of getting rid of refuse been resorted to in years gone by, instead of using it for making up roads and sites of houses (the latter not being covered with concrete), diphtheria, diarrhoea, and other diseases might not have been so prevalent. We are now reaping the evils of what has been badly sown for us in past years. Lately in digging a trench for laying down a new sewer in Poplar, " made ground" was come upon about eight feet down, which on contact with the air " fired." This certainly was not a healthy subsoil upon which to build, even if covered with concrete. The destructor will also abolish the shocking and inhuman horrors of the dust-yard, pitiful to think of—viz., the unnatural and revolting spectacle of the gentler sex—mothers, daughters, and sisters—standing and working, all day, knee deep, in filth and garbage. A most important step and one in the right direction has been advanced by your Surveyor, in obtaining the sanction of the Board to try some experiments respecting sewer ventilation. At the present time, whilst this report is going through the press, experiments are being tried with a lamp invented by Mr. Gibbon, and named the " Multitubular Sanitary Lamp," the object of which is to create an up-draft from the sewer, to destroy the microbes, and at the same time to give light. The lamp is fixed upon the top of a hollow post, the base of which is attached to a pipe leading from the crown of the 33 sewer, so that the lamp-post is in direct communication with the sewer and forms an upshaft The lamp is made of copper, and has a gas jet playing upon the under-surface of a chamber, which chamber, styled by Mr. Gibbon " the hot air furnace," has tubes running through it into a dome shaped compartment, in the top of which is the outlet for the sewer air. At the point where the lamp is fixed upon the post, Mr. Gibbon was advised to have two layers of fine wire gauze about an inch and a half apart to prevent the flame extending to the sewer, in the event of the sewer air containing any inflammable gas. The gas jet playing upon the under surface of the " hot air furnace," the whole of the copper portion of the lamp becomes heated by conduction. A thermometer placed in the upper chamber registers 360° F. The air in the two chambers, becoming rarefied, escapes through the outlet at the top of the lamp and is replaced by air from the sewer. In the lamp under trial, glass-windows and a door have been made in the shaft, whereby an anemometer can be inserted, in order that the number of cubic feet of air passing from the sewer may be calculated, and the door also enables samples of the sewer air to be obtained before it passes through the lamp. Provision is made to collect, for testing purposes, the sewer air after it has passed through the lamp. It will be most interesting to learn the result of the bacteriological examinations of the air, and to hear the report of your Surveyor, Mr. Oxtoby. Should this report be favourable, there will be no doubt that the universal adoption of such an invention for ventilating the sewers and killing the microbes, will be a great advance in sanitation, and with " King's patent gully," the most efficient apparatus I know of, for trapping gullies—also an invention of a Poplar parishioner—honour will be due to the Poplar district for furthering the interests of sanitary science. INFLUENZA. Six deaths occurred in Poplar from influenza, and nine deaths from the same complaint happened in Bromley. 34 WHOOPING COUGH. Fifty-seven deaths were registered in Poplar from whooping cough, and they all occurred in children under five years of age. In Bromley 65 deaths were registered: four of these did not belong to the parish, and one death was notified from an outlying institution. So that 62 deaths from whooping cough must be credited to Bromley, 61 of which were of children under five years. For death rates see Table IV. page 14. The following figures give the number of deaths which occurred in the past four years :— 1893. 1894. 1895- 1896. Poplar 24 16 31 • 57 Bromley ... 32 .. 32 29 62 Totals ■ 56 48 60 119 MEASLES. Forty-seven deaths from measles happened in Poplar and two deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 49 deaths, 46 of which were in children under five years. In Bromley 42 deaths were registered, 11 of these deaths occurring in the Sick Asylum, all of children under five years : but as 10 of these children did not belong to the parish, 32 represents the number of deaths from measles belonging to Bromley. For death rates see Table IV. page 14. Deaths from measles were as follows during the past four years :— 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. Poplar 12 c_n 00 82 49 Bromley ... 20 95 • 105 32 Totals ... 32 i53 187 81 A large number of children at one time of the year were away from the " Cubitt Town " Board School with measles, but there was no need 35 to take steps to close the school. The Medical Officer of the School Board was acquainted with the existence of the disease. DIARRHCEA. Fifty-nine deaths from diarrhoea with two from outlying institutions belong to the Poplar parish, giving a total of 61 deaths, 57 of which occurred in children under five years. In Bromley 73 deaths happened, two of which did not belong to the parish, and one was notified from an outlying institution, giving a total of 72 deaths, 67 of which occurred in children under five years of age. For death rates see Table IV., page 14. Deaths from diarrhoea for the past four years were as follows:— 1893. 1894. I895- 1896.

Comparing the above figures with those on page 29, giving the mean average temperature of the air during the second and third quarters for those periods of the respective years, the temperature is seen to be lowest for those periods in the year 1894, in which the deaths from diarrhoea were few. One death from English cholera occurred in Bromley in the case of a patient aged 60 years. The deceased had been ailing in health for nearly a year, and had given up work owing to weakness. 36 The usual annual letter was received from the Medical Officer of the London County Council, stating that he was authorised to send to Dr. Klein material from any case of suspected Asiatic cholera to be examined bacteriologically.

Grosvenor, County Council, and Hanbury Buildings. In the year 1894 the actual number of inhabitants of Grosvenor Buildings was ascertained to be 1764 persons in 512 tenements. This year, at the time of my enquiry, 535 tenements were occupied out of a total of 542. The County Council Buildings contain 50 tenements, and at the end of the year all these were occupied. In 1895 there were 175 inhabitants (93 adults and 82 children) in 48 tenements. Hanbury Buildings contain 35 two-roomed tenements, of which 33 were occupied at the end of the year with 140 inhabitants.

In my last annual report a description was given respecting the position of these premises. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND COW-HOUSES. Fifteen slaughter-houses (nine in Poplar and six in Bromley); and twelve cow-houses (five in Poplar and seven in Bromley), were inspected upon receiving notices from the owners of their intention to apply for the renewal of their licenses to the London County Council. In no instance was the Board advised to oppose the license. SANITARY INSPECTORS WORK, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. During the year 3995 intimations, 1449 statutory notices, 475 final notices (complimentary) were served, 4074 drains were tested, 6337 inspections and 23,104 re-inspections were made. The Inspectors' reports are appended to this report. Two cases of overcrowding were reported to the Committee, and the necessary notices were directed to be served. Certificates were authorised to be signed under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, that there were proper and sufficient water supplies at 14 newly erected houses. The Committee's attention was called to the condition of the Ditches at Millwall, and the same were ordered to be cleansed. On the 10th July, I reported to the Committee respecting the condition of the banks of the River Lea, suggesting that the Conservancy ought to cleanse the banks of Bow Creek, as at low tide they were covered with thick, black, slimy, filthy mud, and emitted odours no doubt dangerous to health. The Committee directed the Clerk to report upon the matter, more particularly with regard to the action-at-law by the Board against the Corporation of West Ham, and at a later meeting the Committee directed the Clerk to write to the Lea Conservancy Board, calling attention to the condition of the foreshore of the River within the Poplar District.

The summons was applied for in order to remedy the defective roof and the dirty and dilapidated condition of some of the rooms. The Magistrate, Mr. Mead, on more than one occasion, stated, when filthy condition of rooms was included on summonses, that he would not make orders on owners to cleanse rooms, the nuisance being caused by the "act" of the tenants. In the above case he raised the question, by whose "act" the rooms became dirty. He was informed that under Section 4 of the Public Health (London) Act the owner was liable, the tenants being weekly, and the nuisance existed by the owner's " sufferance." Mr. Mead made a seven days abatement order and gave a guinea costs. It is clear that in the case of premises let in tenements, which have constantly changing weekly tenants of a poor character, the owner ought to see that the walls and ceilings of the rooms are kept in a sanitary condition. In conclusion I must thank the Board and Sanitary Committee for the support and co-operation which the officials of the Sanitary Staff have invariably received at their hands in respect of all matters which it has been their duty to bring under the notice of the Acting Authority.

(2) 7, Highland Street. (4) 5, Tetley Street. (5) 117, Kerbey Street. Of the above Nos. (1) and (2) were withdrawn: 2s. cost of summons paid by owner of 5, Andrew Street. (3) and (4) 21 day Abatement Order made in each case, and 5s. costs paid as ordered by owner of stables, (5) 14 day Abatement Order made with 5s. costs. I also reported penalties inflicted for infringements of Board's byelaws and London County Council's bye-laws as follows:— 178, Chrisp Street, 30 shillings. 164, Abbott Road, 3 ,, 15, Highland Street, „ „ 294, Brunswick Road, „ „ 28, Glencoe Street, ,, ,, The infringements were—not paving yard until after service of Board's notice and summons, and for not giving notice to Clerk previous to undertaking work of refitting closets. The market places and stalls were regularly inspected, and I have on several occasions, on the vendor's application, examined the fruit, fish, &c., purchased by them at the markets, and when found unsound, had the same destroyed, as unfit for food, and gave the necessary certificate to that effect. On a complaint of overcrowding, &c., of premises, 78, Tetley Street, I visited the same, February 1st, 1896, and found:—First floor back room, recently occupied by six aliens, one woman, three men, and two children. In a case, in the yard, I discovered 5¾ lbs. of brawn, in a stinking condition, said to be made for purpose of sale, and 52 had been prepared in room as above. I seized the meat, and took the same to the police-court. Owner was accordingly summoned, and on consenting to have the brawn destroyed, the summons was withdrawn. On the 7th March, I was summoned to the Thames Police Court to show cause why the Magistrate's order made, closing the premises 4, Prospect Place, as unfit for human habitation, should not be cancelled, as these premises had undergone sanitary repair. On inspection with yourself, it was found that several sanitary works were still outstanding. The work having been completed, the order was rescinded. Upon the application for renewals of the annual licenses, in October, the Cow and Slaughterhouses were forthwith re-inspected, and the works, where necessary, executed. Licensed Slaughterhouses 2 Licensed Cowhouses 3 I have further to report, that in the month of January, 1896, seven bodies of persons who died, at the Poplar Hospital, were removed to the Poplar Mortuary, for the convenience of relatives, and the holding of inquests thereon, when needed. The Coroner's officer, on the part of the London County Council, has undertaken the future removals. By direction of Mr. Young, the Board's analyst, I obtained 52 samples of food, &c., for analysis. Legal proceedings were taken against one vendor, which resulted in a penalty being inflicted of 30s. with 23s. costs. The vendor in another case, to avoid prosecution, gave up the business, and moved away from the neighbourhood. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Asso. San.

In pursuance of your committees instructio is, I inspected all the P.H. urinals in my district, and am pleased to inform you that in each case where a nuisance existed, it was remedied. In several cases, a water supply was fixed without any demur from the landlord. In compliance with your Committee's instructions, summonses, were taken out for infringements of the London County Council Bye-laws, viz. 28th July, two summonses, in which the owner was fined 12s. in each case; September 16th, two summonses, owners fined 12s. and 5s. respectively. The Solicitor, who represented the Defendant who was fined 12s. asked Mr. Mead, the Magistrate, to state a Case for the Higher Court, which application was refused. I am pleased to say that the above cases, have had the desired effect, i.e. in preventing owners and builders in fitting, or refixing, any sanitary apparatus, without the supervision of your Inspector. On the 25th August, I attended before Mr. Dickinson, at the Thames Police Court, when a summons was heard, to rescind a closing order, which had been made some years previous, against the owners of 1, 2, and 3 Elizabeth Cottages, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 Sophia Street. In company with yourself, I inspected the premises almost daily, during the time they were under repair, which was done to your satisfaction), the houses having been redrained and put into a thorough sanitary state. The rescinding order was granted. Several cases of overcrowding have been abated in my district, upon the service of an "intimation." 57 I have on two occasions, summoned the owner of a fish offal van, for carting fish offal through the streets during prohibited hours ; the first offence, was on the 15th October, 1896, (two summonses) one for removing during prohibited hours, and the other, for not having a properly covered vessel for removing same, a fine of 20s. with 2s. costs was inflicted in each case. The same owner, was summoned a second time, for a similar offence, on the 10th November, 1896 and fined or distress, in seven days and I have not seen the Defendant's van since. By directions of Mr. Young, the Public Analyst, 1 have purchased 48 samples of food and drugs, for analysis. Legal proceedings, were instituted against 6 of the respective vendors, and in each case a penalty was inflicted ranging from 12s. 6d. to £3. The Markets and Stalls have been regularly inspected throughout the year, and in several instances, I have had meat and fruit, which were exposed for sale, destroyed, and warned the respective vendors, that the next time similar goods were exposed that I would seize the same, and take legal proceedings against the vendors. In one case, a poor woman, brought to me a piece of salt meat, which she had bought from a butcher in Chrisp Street. It had been cooked, and there was a doubt, whether the Magistrate would convict. I went with the woman to the vendor, and suggested, that he should give her a piece of wholesome beef, in its place, which he readily did. I destroyed the bad piece, and warned the vendor. I have also made periodical inspections throughout the year, of the Cow and Slaughter Houses, in my district, and in every case, found them in a fair sanitary condition, clean and with a good water supply. The Licensed Slaughter Houses number 6 The Licensed Cowhouses „ 4 During the year three summonses have been taken out under the Public Health London Act, 1891, against owners for non-compliance with notices served; one was withdrawn, the works having been 58 completed before the day of hearing. In each of the other cases, an abatement order was made, with 31s. 6d. costs and 12s. costs respectively. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Poplar North Division.

WYATT, 8, Mornington Road, Bow Road. CLERK OF THE BOARD: ROBERT FOSKETT. 5 POPLAR and STEPNEY SICK ASYLUM DISTRICT. IN submitting the Report and Statistics for the year ending Lady-Day, 1897, it may not be uninteresting to review the history of the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum District from its commencement. The circumstances connected with the treatment and classification of the indoor poor of the Metropolis prior to 1867 and the revelations of Mr. James Greenwood, the story of whose experiences when in the guise of an amateur casual, as recorded in the press caused no small sensation at the time, the memory of which will probably be fresh in the minds of many. It was to these that may partly be ascribed the passing of the Metropolitan Poor Act of 1867—known at the time as Mr. Gathorne Hardy's Act—an Act which led to an almost entire subversion of the system of Poor Relief, which, since the passing of the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 had been in operation in the Metropolis. By the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, authority was given for the Metropolis to be divided into Districts for the provision of Asylums for the "reception and relief of the Sick, Insane, Infirm, or other class or classes of the Poor chargeable in Unions and Parishes of the Metropolis," and thus remove from the Workhouses and place under separate management such of the inmates 6 who might require medical attendance and professional nursing; hence the establishment of Sick Asylum Districts. When, however, the Poor Law Board attempted to enforce the provisions of the Act relative to the formation of these Districts, considerable opposition arose on the question of expense ; and most of the orders directing their formation were, in deference to public opinion, revoked, and the Boards of Management dissolved. It was, nevertheless, felt that an Asylum for this large Eastern District was a matter of immediate importance, and on the 10th August, 1868, an order was issued under the seal of the Poor Law Board authorising the purchase of a piece of land on which to build, and sanctioning the borrowing of the money necessary for the payment of the same. There are at the present time but two Sick Asylum Districts in the Metropolis, namely the Central London Sick Asylum District comprising the Strand and the Westminster Unions and the Parish of St. Giles and StGeorge, Bloomsbury, the Asylum for which District accommodates 264 patients, and is situated in Cleveland Street, W., and the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum District, comprising the Poplar and Stepney Unions. It should, however, be stated that whilst the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, has been the means of permanently establishing but two Sick Asylum Districts, the care of the sick poor of the Metropolis generally has by no means been overlooked, for, almost without an exception, since the passing of the Act of Parliament referred to, the several Unions and Parishes of the Metropolis have provided separate Infirmaries for the reception of their sick poor, such establishments being placed under direct Medical administration. On the 30th August, 1869, the Managers accepted the tender of Mr. Robert Mann for the erection of the 7 Asylum according to the plans and specifications prepared by Messrs. A. & C. Harston, the amount of his tender being £29,932, the lowest of twelve competitors; the highest tender was £34,308. The total cost of the Land, Buildings and Furniture was as under, namely:— £ Land 7,200 Building and Engineers' work 47,000 Furniture and Fittings 9,663 £63,863 The above amount was borrowed under the authority of the Poor Law Board, and the Loans obtained from the London Life Association at per cent., the interest being payable half-yearly, and the principal by thirty equal annual instalments. On Monday the 7th August, 1871, upwards of three years after the formation of the District, the Asylum was opened for the reception of patients, and on the 4th April, 1873, Mr. Stansfeld, the then President of the Local Government Board visited the Asylum without notice, and at the conclusion of its inspection made the following entry in the Visitors' Book:— "I have for the first time visited this admirably, I "might almost say perfectly, managed and model "Institution, and I desire to record the great "satisfaction which I have derived from my "visit." The area of the Sick Asylum District is 2,798 acres and at the time of the formation of the District contained a population of 135,768. At the last census taken this population had risen to 224,124, an increase of 65 per cent. As might be expected, this increase made itself felt in the accommodation provided in the Sick Asylum, and difficulty naturally arose in 8 finding room for all the cases presented for admission. To meet this requirement the Managers decided, with the consent of the Local Government Board, to increase the accommodation by the addition of two pavilions, the erection of a Nurses' Home, and the provision of additional day-room accommodation. The estimated cost of this additional accommodation was £28,000, which amount the Managers borrowed under the authority of the Local Government Board, to be repaid by equal annual instalments of principal and interest combined. The money was borrowed from the Provident Clerks Mutual Life Assurance Association. The total amount of the Loans now borrowed amounts to £91,863 Contemplated Additions. During the past year the Managers have had it in contemplation to erect a new Porter's Lodge at the Asylum entrance, and to adapt the present Porter's Lodge into receiving wards. Also to provide sundry additional accommodation in the Administrative Block. Plans for the execution of these works have been prepared by Messrs. J. & S. F. Clarkson, of Poplar, and have been approved by the Local Government Board. At the time of writing this report the plans are in the hands of the Local Government Board for the purpose of having the Board's seal attached; immediately on the return of these plans the Managers will proceed to take the necessary steps for carrying out the works. New Managers for the three years ending Lady-Day, 1899. At Lady-Day, 1896, the present Board of Management came into office, having been elected for three years under the Poor Law Board's order of the 23rd April, 1868. The first meeting of the new Board was held on the 31st March, 1896, when the Managers elected as Chairman for their term of office Dr. Thomas Power, and as Vice-chairman 9 Mr. George B. Hatfield. During the year Mr. George Lansbury, one of the Managers elected by the Poplar Board of Guardians resigned his office, and to fill the vacancy thus caused the Guardians on the 12th August elected the Rev. John T. Wyatt. The first meeting of the Managers subsequent to that date was held on the 8th September, when Mr. Wyatt was present and took part in the proceedings. A table showing the attendances of the Managers at the various Board and Committee Meetings during the year has been prepared, and will be found on page 16 of this report. Managers. At the close of the current year the staff numbered 170 persons, of whom 92 were resident, and 78 nonresident. The particulars relating to each member of the staff will be found in Appendix II. During the year 43 appointments have been made and 30 officers have left the Managers' service, namely:— Staff. 23 Resigned. 1 Promoted to another office. 1 Death. 1 Superannuation. 4 Dismissed. With regard to the Nursing Staff 37 candidates applied for the office of probationer nurse, thirteen of whom have been appointed; of these two left at the expiration of their two months preliminary probation, one by reason of ill-health, and one on account of unsuitability for the office. In connection with the preliminary probation of the Probationer Nurses the managers have found from experience that the two months' trial agreed upon when the regulations were first adopted did not afford sufficient opportunity for deciding as to the suitability of the candidates for the work, and at the request of the Probationer Nurses. Term of preliminary probation extended. 10 Medical Superintendent and the Matron, and with the assent of the Local Government Board, they have extended the period from two months to three months. Tennis Court &c. for Staff. During the year the Managers have had under consideration the question of the recreation of the Nurses and other members of the Staff, and with the consent of the Local Government Board, have arranged to construct a tennis court for out-door recreation, and have also made proper provision in the Nurses' Home for indoor amusements. Examination of Probationer Nurses. With regard to the examination of the Probationer Nurses at the close of their first year's service, the Managers were pleased to receive a satisfactory report from the Medical Superintendent. From this report it appeared that those who had attended the full course of lectures had done exceedingly well, and that out of a total maximum of 300 marks only one Probationer had obtained less than two-thirds of that number, and that three of the probationers had obtained respectively 283, 281 and 277 marks. Appointment of Scrubbers and Laundrywomen. In connection with the appointment of scrubbers and Laundrywomen, the Guardians of the Poplar and Stepney Unions have, at the request of the Managers, sent from time to time the names of deserving widows and other poor persons who could be recommended for work, and these have, where possible, been appointed. Superannuation Act. On the 30th September last the Poor Law Officers' Superannuation Act came into operation, having obtained the Royal Assent on the 14th August. The question of superannuation had been from time to time during the previous fifty years before the members of the Poor Law Service, and various Members of the Government, and in 1893 a scheme was unanimously agreed to for securing certainty of superannuation to Poor Law Officers, based on the ground that every officer was required to 11 bute out of his or her salary and emoluments, a per centage amount, which sum should be credited to the common fund of the Union, Parish or District as the case might be. Superannuation Act, continued. The Bill as it present stands was introduced into Parliament and its second reading carried without a division on the 18th March, 1896, between 500 and 600 petitions having been presented in its favour from Boards of Guardians and others, while four petitions only were presented against it. An Amendment to the Bill is now before Parliament, and at the time of writing this report had passed the second reading in the House of Commons. The principal object of this Bill is to remove what is considered a hardship to female officers, especially nurses, scrubbers, and domestic servants, inasmuch as they are compelled to contribute on appointment, and are a class of officers not likely to avail themselves hereafter of the benefits of superannuation, as they would be unable to to do so until either they had attained the age of 60 years, and had completed an aggregate service of 40 years, or had reached the full age of 65 years, unless they had previously become incapacitated from performing their duty by reason of permanent infirmity of body. With regard to institutions similar in character to the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, where large numbers of young women come in for training only and who in many cases would be unlikely to continue as Poor Law Officers, a hardship was naturally felt, and it is to remedy this grievance that the Amendment Bill to last year's Act of Parliament has been introduced into the House of Commons. 12 Superannuation Act, continued. It may be interesting to note that the amount contributed by the officers of the Sick Asylum towards the Superannuation Fund for the half-year during which the Act has been in force is £63 9s. 2d. As may be imagined, the work necessitated by the passing of the Superannuation Act is very heavy, entailing the keeping of an additional set of books, some of an intricate character, a separate account having now to be kept with each officer. This involves much correspondence also, in the testing of the previous Poor Law service of each official, and naturally throws much additional labour in the office of the Clerk of the Board. The Poor Law Service is, however, to be congratulated on the passing of the Act of Parliament, and thus settling a question of vital interest to all concerned, and one which has been agitating the minds of Poor Law Officers for a number of years. One Officer has been superannuated during the year, namely Harriet Wright, a scrubber, after upwards of 19 years' service. Revision of the Nurses' Time Table. During the year the Managers, at the suggestion of :he Matron, revised the Nurses' time table, a copy of which forms Appendix I. of this report. Day Porters' Leave. The Day Porters' leave has also been revised by allowing each person to have one day off in every seven, the annual holiday of ten days remaining as heretofore. Stocktaker. In connection with the staff the Managers have during the year appointed a Stocktaker under the provisions of the Order of the Local Government Board of the 6th May, 1875. It will be the duty of this official to take account of the stock remaining in store at the close of each quarter, and thus free the Visiting Committee from the duty thrown on its members in connection with the order of accounts. 13 The Managers also propose to appoint a porter with special reference to the tradesmen's entrance, thus doing away with assistance from the patients at that entrance. The Managers have, where practicable, employed direct labour in connection with repairs, and the annual cleaning, whitewashing and painting of the Asylum, and the carpenter's work, instead of employing a tradesmen for this work as had been the custom hitherto. In connection with this departure, the Engineer's title has been altered to Engineer and Superintendent of Labour. Direct Labour. The Managers at the commencement of their term of office, resolved to invite the Press to be present at their meetings, and reports of their proceedings now appear regularly in the columns of the Local Press. Admission of Press. The ladies of the Flower Mission connected with the Deaconess House, Mildmay Park, continue their visits to the Wards of the Asylum periodically, and their kindly work is much appreciated by the patients. Ladies Flower Mission. With a view of liberating the beds at the times of pressure, the Managers have, with the concurrence of the Boards of Guardians of the Unions comprising the District agreed to send lock cases, where the treatment is likely to be prolonged, to the special Lock Hospital. Lock Cases. During the year the Managers have been in communication with the Commissioners of Inland Revenue with regard to action taken by the Surveyor of Taxes in assessing them under Schedule A, with respect to the apartments occupied by officers, instead of, as had been previously the case, the officers themselves. The Commissioners had, in giving instructions that no charge was to be made on the Managers under that schedule in future so long as the circumstances remained the same, reversed the decision of the Surveyor of Taxes from Assessment of Officers' Quarters. Schedule A. 14 which they had appealed. This is a matter of some importance to Poor Law Institutions generally, as it annuls the general principle laid down by the Surveyor of Taxes. Surcharge remitted. The Local Government Board have during the year remitted the surcharge the District Auditor made on the occasion of the audit of the accounts for the halfyear ended in Michaelmas 1895, with respect to the charge of conveyance of the Managers to and from the Board and Committee meetings at the Asylum. Alteration of Assessment of Asylum. In connection with the enlargement of the Asylum and the erection of the Nurse's Home, the assessment of the Asylum by the Parochial authorities has been increased for rateable purposes from £1,930 to £3,273. Alteration of Allocation of Beds. During the year the decision of the Local Government Board has been received with regard to the allocation of beds in the Asylum between the Unions comprising the District, the basis of allocation hitherto being that of the pauperism in the Unions as laid down in article 2 of the Poor Law Board's order of the 7th March, 1871. On the 29th June, 1896, an order was issued by the Local Government Board, rescinding the above-named article, and directing that the 770 beds in the Sick Asylum should be assigned to the component Unions of the District as follows, viz.:— Poplar Union 550 Stepney Union 220 770 The allocation under the original order was:— Poplar Union 593 Stepney Union 177 770 15 In connection with the completion of the extension buildings the Managers have had before them an application from Mr. W. B. Keen, the Trustee in Bankruptcy of the estate of Joseph Holland, the contractor for the works, for a sum to assist him in defraying the loss alleged to have been sustained by him personally in completing the contract. The Managers resisted the claim, not considering, in the interests of the ratepayers' that they were justified in entertaining the application. They have, in consequence, been served with a writ claiming the sum of £16,563 as damages for breach of contract. The Managers have placed their case in the hands of Messrs. Hollams, Sons, Coward and Hawksley, Solicitors, of 30, Mincing Lane, and have instructed them to enter an appearance on their behalf in the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division. Writ for £16,563 in connection with the extension buildings. The accounts show that at the close of the current year (March 27th) there were 697 patients in the Asylum. The number of days' maintenance during the year had been 253,845, and the average death rate in comparison with the number of admissions was 15.9 Days Maintenance. The average cost of each patient for Maintenance per week was 6 88/10 Towards which sum the Metropolitan Common Poor Fund contributes 2 11 The London County Council 2 4 5 3 Nett cost to Union for Maintenance per week 1 58/10 Average cost i6 Board and Committee Meetings held during the year ended Lady-Day 1897, and list Managers' attendances.

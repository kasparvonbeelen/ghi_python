77 WES 6 METROPOLIS LOCAL MANAGEMENT ACT. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES OF ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, during the month of january 1858, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES OF St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, DURING THE MONTH OF JANUARY, 1858, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, During the present month the number of Births registered has been 121 boys and 98 girls, making a total of 219, while the Deaths were 100 males and 88 females. From these numbers, however, must be deducted 7 as coming from other Parishes, which reduces the actual number to 181. In 1857 the Deaths were 171, and the 10 years' average 180-7; but if 18 be added to this average as occurring in an increased population, the numbers will be 198-7, showing that although there is an increase of 10 in comparison with the previous year, yet there is a decrease in reference to the 10 years' average of 17. So many and such various circumstances tend to influence the public health, that it is a matter of difficulty to account for the various fluctuations which from time to time occur. A monthly comparison, however, with previous years, other circumstances being equal, may to a certain extent enlighten us as to the cause of any considerable increase in the number of Deaths. A comparison of January 1858 with that of January in the two previous years, shows an increase of 10 Deaths in each year, the numbers being January 1856—161, 1857—171 and 1858—181, these numbers being doubtless due to an increased population; 1856 was however a 4 remarkably healthy year, as is shown by a reference to 1855 and 1854; thus in January 1855 there were 216, and 1854 205 Deaths : we may therefore fairly consider, that although the death-rate is at present exceedingly high in reference to the population, yet it has decreased as compared with previous years. The following is a corrected Table of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex. REGISTERED BIRTHS AND DEATHS. ST. MARGARET. ST. JOHN. Total of Births in 1 both Parishes.

The houses are generally spacious, well-ventilated, not overcrowded, and the drainage and watersupply efficient; but although this examination was made on an exceedingly cold day, the effluvium from the termination of this Sewer was most sickly and offensive, and in my belief decidedly detrimental to health; indeed I was informed that early in the morning the emanations were of so serious a 5 nature, as to cause the men working in the Gas-factory to be sensibly affected, and during the prevalence of north-easterly winds, the dense volume of smoke from the Lambeth Potteries preventing the escape of these noxious vapours, adds materially to the prejudicial effects of disease. The remedy for this crying evil I must leave in the hands of the Board, having already reported upon it some time since. The following houses have been inspected as under. st. mahgaret. Grovo Row, Palmer's Village 12 houses York Place 10 „ Buckingham Cottages 33 „ st. john. St. Ann's Court 8 houses Bessborough Street 6 „ Rochester Row 19 „ Douglas Street 4 „ Emery's Cottages 3 „ Making a total of 95 houses, 33 of these, namely, Buckingham Cottages have been re-inspected and found in a more cleanly state than before. In consequence of previous inspections of St. Ann's Court, two proper Water Closets were constructed, which although insufficient for the occupants was a great improvement on its previously disgusting condition. Heretofore the inhabitants of both sides of the Court have had access to these Closets, but from some want of arrangement between the owners of the property, those on the south side, numbering 8 houses are without any closet-accommodation whatever; the result is the soil is thrown into the open Court, creating a most disgusting nuisance. There is ample space for the erection of proper Closets for the houses on the south side, the owner of which should be compelled to provide the necessary accommodation. Notices have been issued for the requirements in the other houses, many of which are in a very unsatisfactory state. In addition to the above, 14 houses requiring immediate attention have been examined by Inspector Wood. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, 5, Parliament Street, BARNARD IIOLT.

MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, during the month of february 1858, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John Westminster, DURING THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1858, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I am happy to be enabled to inform you there is a decrease in the number of Deaths of the present as compared with the previous month, and with February of last year. Scarlet Fever, Measles and Hooping Cough have considerably abated, and the diseases of the respiratory organs are diminished. There, however, continues a very large mortality amongst children under 5 years of age, and the present month shows that out of 146 Deaths as arising from every cause and occurring at all ages, no less than 81 have died under 5years: this is so large a proportion that I am endeavouring to ascertain the cause, and as far as [ can at present gather, this mortality appears mainly attributable to the filthy habits of the parents, the overcrowding of rooms, and the general neglect of the children; but a more extended enquiry is necessary before arriving at any definite conclusion. 4 The number of Births registered in February was 97 Males and 85 Females; while the Deaths numbered 79 Males and 67 Females—making a total of 146. The Deaths for a similar period in 1857 amounted to 156, and the average of the previous 10 years to 148; but if this average be raised with a view to comparison for increase of population, the numbers will be 162. The following Table shows the Births and Deaths in each Parish arranged as to Sex :— REGISTERED BIRTHS AND DEATHS. ST. MARGARET. ST. JOHN. Total of Births in both Parishes. Total of Deaths in both Parishes. Deaths in 1857. Deaths last Month. Corrected Deaths in 10 years average. Deaths less than February 1857. Deaths less than 10 years average. Births. Deaths. Births.

The following Deaths occurred in the undermentioned places:— Workhouses. Hospitals. Prisons. Barracks. 12 Westminster 9 House of Correction 1 Grenadier Gds. 1 An examination of the Table of Diseases shows that 14 Deaths have occurred in persons above 70 years of age, and 5 have died from accidents, and although they cannot be sub- stracted from the General Return, yet it points to this fact, that, added to the Deaths as occurring under 5 years, it leaves only 46 as depending upon general causes incidental to puberty and middle age. 5 During the present month 59 houses have been inspected by Inspector Wood in St. John's, and 5 by Inspector Crow in St. Margaret's, but the weather being severe, many of the requirements have been unavoidably postponed. All the defects of the previous month have been remedied in St. John's, and those in St. Margaret's are promised to be completed. My attention has been directed by a Rate-payer to the nuisance arising from frying fish, so as to be an annoyance to the immediate inhabitants; but having conferred with the Solicitor, Mr. Rogers, I regret to find I have no power to interfere.

REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES OF St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH 1858, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, The number of Births registered during the present month was 96 Males and 104 Females—making a total of 200 Births; while the Deaths number 95 Males and 77 Females, or a total of 172 Deaths. The Deaths for the same period in 1857 was 145, and the average of the previous 10 years, 151-9; but if this average be raised with a view to comparison for increase of population, the numbers will be 166—showing an increase both in relation to the previous year, and the average of the last 10 years. This may be to some extent accounted for by the increase in Deaths arising from implication of the organs of respiration, as well those of the Zymotic class, dependant in a great measure upon the rapid variations of temperature which have occurred in the present month. 4 The following is a tabular statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish arranged as to Sex:— REGISTERED BIRTHS AND DEATHS.

Barracks. 18 Westminster 10 House of Correction 3 St. George's 1 Grenadier Gds. 4 In consequence of the prevalence of disease in the neighbourhood of Belgravia, I have examined 67 houses in Milton Terrace, St. James's Terrace, Admiral Terrace and Elizabeth Place, Vanxhall Road, and found many of them with offensive cesspools and defective drainage; the particulars of which will be found in Inspector Wood's report. Notices have been issued in all those instances where nuisances were required to be abated. A complaint having been made by Messrs. Rigby, respecting offensive smells in their offices, I have examined all the houses in Holywell Street abutting on their premises, but without detecting anything that required interference. I believe the offense to arise from old drains running beneath the office floor, which will be required to be removed, and the drains broken up. In addition to the above houses, 14 complaints have been remedied by Inspector Wood, and 1.2 by Inspector Crow. 5 The majority of cases previously reported on, where nuisances injurious to health have been detectel, are remedied; and those now reported upon will be speedily commenced. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, BARNARD HOLT. 5, Parliament Street, March, 1858. 4 remarkably healthy year, as is shown by a reference to 1855 and 1854; thus in January 1855 there were 216, and 1854 205 Deaths: we may therefore fairly consider, that although the death-rate is at present exceedingly high in reference to the population, yet it has decreased as compared with previous years.

The houses are generally spacious, well-ventilated, not overcrowded, and the drainage and watersupply efficient; but although this examination was made on an exceedingly cold day, the effluvium from the termination of this Sewer was most sickly and offensive, and in my belief decidedly detrimental to health; indeed I was informed that early in the morning the emanations were of so serious a 5 nature, as to cause the men working in the Gas-factory to be sensibly affected, and during the prevalence of north-easterly winds, the dense volume of smoke from the Lambeth Potteries preventing the escape of these noxious vapours, adds materially to the prejudicial effects of disease.

In consequence of previous inspections of St. Ann's Court, two proper Water Closets were constructed, which although insufficient for the occupants was a great improvement on its previously disgusting condition. Heretofore the inhabitants of both sides of the Court have had access to these Closets, but from some want of arrangement between the owners of the property, those on the south side, numbering 8 houses are without any closet-accommodation whatever; the result is the soil is thrown into the open Court, creating a most disgusting nuisance. There is ample space for the erection of proper Closets for the houses on the south side, the owner of which should be compelled to provide the necessary accommodation. Notices have been issued for the requirements in the other houses, many of which are in a very unsatisfactory state. In addition to the above, 14 houses requiring immediate attention have been examined by Inspector Wood. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, 5, Parliament Street, BARNARD IIOLT.

Mcdical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, The number of Births registered during the present month was 173, and the Deaths 157. The deaths for a similar period in 1857 amounted to 104, and the average of the previous 10 years to 139-5: if this average, however, be raised with a view to comparison for increase of population, the numbers will be 152. Although the number of Deaths in the present month are 23 less than last month, yet in reference to April 1857, they show the large increase of 45—this being mainly dependant on the great variations of temperature, and the generally ungenial state of the atmosphere during the present month, and are best demonstrated by comparing those diseases most influenced by the weather in the two years, 1857 and 1858. 10 COMPARATIVE TABLE OF 1857. 1858.

The following Deaths occurred in the undermentioned places:— Workhouses. Hospitals. Prisons. Barracks. - - - - 22 Westminster 9 House of Correction 6 HydePark 3 Grenadier Gds. 3 Coldstreams 1 Scotch Fusileers 1 As the main concentration of Hooping Cough and Measles continues in the neighbourhood of the Vauxhall Road, I have inspected a further number of houses in that locality, and have to report that during the month 44 houses have been examined 11 in Mann's Cottages, Saint Andrew's Terrace and Gloucester Terrace, Vauxhall Road, and found many with defective drainage and offensive cesspools. In St. Andrew's Terrace, with one exception, every house has an open privy and cesspool, and the current of air between the houses and those on the opposite side is greatly impeded by a collection of stores of iron, &e. piled between them. In Gloucester Terrace there are many houses in a most offensive state from imperfect and improper drainage. Notices have been issued in all cases requiring improvement. A complaint having been made by the occupier of No. 33, New Street, respecting an offensive smell in the lower room of his house, I attended upon two occasions, and on the last occasion detected a most offensive odour decidedly detrimental to health. The landlord has, however, consented to do all that may be necessary for its removal. My attention has been likewise directed to a nuisance arising from a defective drain and escape of soil under the floor of a house in Lillington Street. To remedy this, it became necessary to apply to the Magistrate, who adjourned the case to this day; but I am happy to state, the owner of the property has consented to do all that is required. Thirty-one complaints of various kinds have been made to Inspector Wood, who has inspected the different premises, and in the majority of instances remedied the existing evils.

Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Hoard of Works. Gentlemen, The number of Births registered during the present month amounts to 73 Males and 67 Females—making a total of 140; while the Deaths are 76 Males and 49 Females, or 125. The Deaths for a similar period last year were 97, and the average of the previous 10 years 123-8: thus it would appear that the Deaths of the present month exceeded those of both last year and the average of the previous 10 years; but from the present return 14 must be deducted—8 as belonging to other parishes, and 6 for deaths arising from accidents; thus reducing the actual number to 111; and if 10 per cent, be added to the 10 years' average for increase of population, it will raise the number from 123.8 to 136. Thus we may fairly consider, that although there is an excess of 14 over the previous year, yet there are 25 less deaths than the ten years' average. Although the corrected Return is high in reference to last year, there is a considerable decrease in comparison with the month of May, for which the numbers were 138. 16 The following is the Monthly account of Births and Deaths occurring during June:— BIRTHS.

I have consequently visited the premises, and reported upon their condition to the Nuisances Removal Committee, which Report will be doubtless laid before you. Although I feel bound to admit Mr. Bowley endeavours to carry on his trade with as little offence as possible, and has always attended to any suggestions that have been made, yet there can be no question that the manufacture of candles and greaves must always be attended with an amount of offence that is a positive nuisance to his immediate neighbours: and although it may not be just to interfere with Mr. Bowley's business as at present carried on, I yet think Mr. Bowley should be prevented enlarging his present premises for the purpose of increasing his trade, and thus adding very greatly to the nuisance already so loudly complained of. Inspector Crow having found it necessary to summon the owner of a marine store depot in Tothill Street, in consequence of a nuisance arising from the removal of putrified fat, I have 17 visited both this and other premises of a similar character, and I find it to be the general custom to keep fat, bones and rags for periods varying from a week to two months, during which time (more especially at the present season,) great offence is occasioned by the decomposing material. I therefore strongly recommend that a notice be served upon the owners of such places, requiring them to remove in properly covered tubs all fat within 24, and all bones within 48 hours of their receipt; and that on no pretence should rags be permitted to accumulate for a longer period than one month. The premises to be limewashed three times in the course of the year. My attention has also been directed to the condition of Mr. Cates's slaughter-house, which I found dirty and offensive, and that pigs were kept in an adjoining shed, creating a great nuisance particularly offensive to the immediate inhabitants, directions have been given for the removal of the pigs, and Mr. Cates has consented to thoroughly cleanse and lime-white the premises, and efficiently repair the pavement. Twenty-three houses have been examined by InspectorCrow during the month, and the several requirements have been completed. The complaint of Mr. Polk, in reference to the tank at the rear of his house, has been met by the landlord consenting to permit the tank to be covered in. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, BARNARD HOLT. 5, Parliament Street, June, 1858. 18 AGES AND CAUSES OF DEATH DURING JUNE. ST. MARGARET'S. Diseases.

MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING MICHAELMAS 1858, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes op St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, DURING THE MONTH OF JULY, 1858, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honor to inform you that the number of Births registered during the present month has been 82 Males and 72 Females—making a total of 154; while the Deaths for a similar period have been 69 Males and 49 Females, or a total of 118. The number of Deaths registered for the same month last year was 109, and the average of the previous 10 years is 139-8. From the present return must however be deducted 4 as belonging to other parishes, and 3 as deaths from accident, thus reducing the actual number to 111, or 2 more than last year, which may still further be reduced if increase of population be considered, which would make the 10 years' average 142, showing a decrease as referrable to July of 31 Deaths. The month has however been proverbially unhealthy, as is shown by the Registrar General's remarks, and a comparison with parishes of a similar size. 4 'The following is a corrected Table of the Births and Deaths as occurring in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— MONTHLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS & DEATHS DURING JULY.

An extract from the Report of the Medical Officer for St. Margaret's, respecting the existence of fever in Loder's Place, having been forwarded to me, I have examined the premises and find the recommendations I had previously made respecting the drainage had been effectually carried out, and that the drainage is now perfect and the court well paved. The houses however require thoroughly cleansing and limewhiting, and the water tank must also be cleansed and be provided with a proper cover. The closets are in a very unsatisfactory state, mainly depending on the filthy habits of the occupants of the houses; and in order to render them as little offensive as possible, I would advise 5 that the present pans be removed, and a cemented closet with a proper fall and water-supply, which should be trapped within a short distance of the seat, be substituted: at the same time the roof should be so constructed as to admit of proper ventilation. Although this will in some degree remedy the evil, yet it will not prevent the existence of fever and other ailments, inasmuch as the rooms are very small, densely populated, and imperfectly ventilated; and so long as there is no power to interfere where rooms are overcrowded, so long will fever prevail, although every other sanitary precaution may be taken. During the month 31 houses have been inspected in St. John's, many in a very filthy state: the details will be found in Inspector Wood's Report. It has also been necessary to attend at the Police Court, in consequence of a quantity of fish having been seized by Inspector Wood, which was totally unfit for human food; the Magistrate upon the evidence fined the owner 20s. In compliance with an application from the Government requesting a Return of all places inspected since January 1857, I have prepared a Return containing all the information they required. I would beg to suggest that, as the Reports are now printed Quarterly, the Tables should be condensed into one Quarterly Sheet.

Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honor to inform you that the united Parishes continue to exhibit a very favourable health Return, the recorded Deaths being less than any previous month in the present year, as well as less than the corresponding month in 1857. The number of Births registered during the present month was 79 Males and 79 Females—making a total of 158; while the Deaths number 65 Males and 52 Females, or a total of 117 Deaths. The Deaths for the corresponding month of 1857 were 131, and of last month 118. From the present return however must be deducted 8—2 as coming from other parishes, and 6 as dependant on accident, thus reducing the actual number to 109, being 22 less than last year, and 9 less than last month. Scarlct Fever has somewhat increased, the Deaths 10 numbering 12 as against 6, but the cases are so equally diffused through the parishes as not to be epidemic. On the other hand, the cases of Diarrhoea arc diminished, and the Deaths from Measles which last month numbered 10, have been reduced to 1. It is also remarkable to notice the gradual diminution in the Deaths from Fever, a disease exceedingly prevalent in these parishes previous to the adoption of sanitary regulations. During the last eight months there have only been 28 Deaths from this disease. The following Table shows the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— ST. MARGARET. ST. JOHN.

Notice has been issued for its immediate remedy. During the present month 105 houses have been inspected in Vine Street, York Buildings, Champion's Alley, Carpenter Street, Lane's Cottages, Carey Street, St. Anne's Street, George Court, Cottage Court, Holland Street, Orchard Street 11 and Horseferry Road: many of them with offensive privies,. defective drainage and cesspools. Although the owners of property in Vine Street have been at considerable expense in endeavouring to render the drainage as effective as possible, yet there is a continual escape of deleterious gases from the back air of the main sewer, in consequence of the majority of the bell-traps being either destroyed or mislaid, and this will I fear be the usual result where such traps are had recourse to. I would therefore urge upon the owners of property to substitute the D for the bell-traps, and also suggest that the notices which may require to be issued in future, should particularly specify how desirable it is that this form of trap should be adopted. The advantages already accruing from sanitary inspections, are at once appreciated by the very limited number of Complaints which are now lodged with the sanitary Inspectors; yet the experience of my last inspection shows the necessity of continued vigilance, even in those localities where the drainage has been amended. Although several of the Slaughter-houses have been visited both by myself and the Members of the Nuisances Removal Committee, it will be better to defer the Report until the entire number have been examined.

Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Worhs. Gentlemen, I have the honor to report to you that the united Parishes still continue to exhibit a remarkable freedom from disease; the month has been an exceedingly healthy one, and the Deaths are less than in any similar month for many years. The main diminution in comparison with the previous year, consists in the subsidence of Diarrhoea, the Deaths from this disease for the present month being but as G against 23. This however will not entirely account for the great difference, which is probaby to be attributed to the remarkable clear state of the atmosphere, and the absence of damp and any very considerable variations in temperature. The three cases of Deaths reported from Fever have been returned as occurring in the Scotts Fusilcer Guards Hospital; the patients however came from the Tower and Portman B arracks, and are consequently omitted in the corrected list. 16 The number of Births registered during the present month was 81 Males and 77 Females—making a total of 158 Births; while the Deaths number 45 Males and 43 Females, or a total of 88. From this however must be deducted 7—6 as belonging to other parishes, and 1 from suicide, leaving but 81 as referrable to disease. The Deaths for the same period in 1857 was 115, and for last month 117, showing a diminution in reference to last year of 34, and in reference to last month of 36.

During the present month all those Slaughter-houses for which applications have been made, have been visited, and I am happy to be enabled to report them in so satisfactory a condition, that it is not desirable to oppose any application; in a few instances suggestions have been made and cheerfully complied with. 17 A Report having been forwarded to me respecting the condition of the houses and their drainage in Maidenhead Court, I immediately visited the premises and found the drainage in perfect order, and a liberal supply of water; the staircases however exceedingly dirty, and the necessary orders have been issued for their repair. I may take this opportunity of mentioning, that in no part of the united Parishes are premises occupied by a class of inhabitants who are so utterly deficient in order and cleanliness: Inspector Crow informed me that the court is regularly swept every morning, but that in a few hours it becomes as filthy as before. Forty-eight houses have been inspected in William Street, Orchard Street, &c. and the different requirements enumerated to the Nuisances Removal Committee.

MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 25TH DECEMBER, 1858, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES OP St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, FOR THE QUARTER ending25th DECEMBER 1858, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honor to inform you that the number of Births registered during the present quarter has been 269 Males and 249 Females; or a total of 518 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 252 Males and 199 Females, making a total of 451 Deaths. From these, however, must be substracted 9 as coming from other parishes, and 11 as arising from accidents, thus reducing the actual number to 431, being 1 Death less than occurred in the same period of 1857: if, however, allowance be made for increase of population, the numbers would be 4.31 as against 506, or 75 less Deaths than would have occurred if the same rate of mortality had existed. 4 The following is a corrected Table of the Births and Deaths occurring in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— QUARTERLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS & DEATHS ENDING DECEMBER 1858.

December 9 11 .. .. .. 2 1 2 Total 35 37 2 1 1 4 2 3 The general prevalence of diseases of the respiratory organs, in addition to that of Scarlet Fever, has materially increased the Quarterly Return of Deaths; yet in comparing the numbers with those of the corresponding Quarter in 1857, the Deaths are found to be 1 less, and if increase of population be considered, would be 75 less:—we may thus fairly consider the Parishes as representing a fair average state of health. The temperature in November having reached 20 degrees below freezing point, greatly increased that month's mortality, as evidenced by the number of Deaths arising from Phthisis, 5 Bronchitis and Pneumonia; and although there is a popular impression that cold weather is healthy, experience proves that it is only persons in the enjoyment of rude health who can with impunity disregard such variations: the old and very voting more especially, when the subjects of disease, being materially influenced by temperature. For the purpose of ascertaining whether any existing cause capable of removal was exercising an undue influence in those localities where Scarlet Fever had been most rife, I visited the majority of the houses in which deaths had occurred, but I was unable to detect anything beyond that which was attributable to the habits of the occupants. In some, the covers from the traps were removed, thus facilitating the escape of noxious gases (arising both from their own and that of the main sewer) into the house, while in others the inhabitants were generally dirty, and the premises in a filthy state; and in one instance, in Allington Street, death appears to have been accelerated by the want of proper necessaries—the parties having refused to enter the Workhouse. In compliance with the section of the Act of Parliament respecting Underground Dwellings, a general survey has been undertaken, and 11 houses have been detected where the requirements of the Act are not complied with: in all, the tenants have been removed, and the parties cautioned not to allow the premises to be so occupied in future. Among the various matters that engage the attention of Officers of Health is that of pig-keeping; and it therefore becomes necessary to consider how far this, as an element of disease, may have an injurious tendency. There can be but one opinion respecting the necessity of preventing the indiscriminate keeping of pigs, and as the Act of Parliament is sufficiently stringent upon the point, it becomes the duty of the Local Authorities to enforce it wherever they may think necessary. In doing this, however, it may be advisable to 6 discriminate between those instances where a nuisance arises and others where no offence can be detected, and it is in reference to this point I think it necessary to give my opinion. In the following list of places where pigs are kept, it will be noticed that in many instances they are permitted to range at large, in spacious premises, and under such circumstances and where the number is small, I do not consider them either a nuisance or injurious to health; but when kept in large numbers, or in a confined space, or near a dwelling or roadway, they are exactly the reverse, and if not likely to engender, add very materially to any existing illness. The following is a list of places where pigs have been kept, but are now removed by order of the Nuisances Removal Committee:— Goddard's yard, 20 pigs in shed. Bird's yard, 4 pigs, clean—no offence. Davis, Ship-court, 8 pigs—to be killed. Hoskins' yard, G pigs—ditto. Birch's yard, 9 pigs, loose, clean—no offence. Earney's yard, 8 pigs—ditto. Yeoman's, Bonner's yard, 7 pigs in cow-shed. Baker's cow-yard, 3 small pigs, loose, clean—no offence. 18, Douglas-street, 3 pigs close to dwelling—removed; has been cautioned before. Jones' cow-yard, 8 pigs in sty—dirty and offensive. Bobbet's cab-yard, 2 small pigs, loose. Langley's yard, 10 small pigs, loose. Lawrence, Cobourg-row, 5 pigs—close and confined; have been three times removed from same place. Herring, 6, Vincent-street, 1 pig. Evans, Marsham-street, 1 pig, in shed. Glover's yard, 1 pig, loose. Wall's yard, 1 pig, ditto. Alexander, Garden-street, 1 pig, ditto. Yaxley, Vauxhall-road, 1 pig, ditto. 7 During the Quarter 223 houses have been inspected; 82 in St. Margaret's and 141 in St. John's—the requirements of which are fully set forth in the books of the Sanitary Inspectors, and I am happy to be enabled to state that Magisterial interference has only been necessary in One instance, and that where there was a disputed ownership: this has been corrected, and the dilapidated premises are now being reinstated. In Bonner's yard the drainage has been effectually remedied, but in consequence of the collections of dung and refuse from a slaughter-house, the yard is constantly dirty and offensive; and for the purpose of securing freedom to the channels and drains, I recommend the erection of one or more dung pits in the most convenient part of the yard. I may take this opportunity of staling, that I entirely concur in the necessity for enforcing the Regulations now drawn up by the Nuisances Removal Committee, for the regulation of Slaughter Houses. Such Regulations have been long required, and I feel convinced, if efficiently carried out, will greatly add to the health of the united Parishes. The works which are now proceeding Under St. Margaret's Church are progressing in a satisfactory manner, and there is not the slightest ground for believing that any offence, much less mischief, can accrue from them : the coffins are carefully removed, and, when completed, will afford the utmost security against any supposed evil.

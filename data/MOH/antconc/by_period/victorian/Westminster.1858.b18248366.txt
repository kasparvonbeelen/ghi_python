WES 11 19 Metropolis Local Management Act. BOARD OF WORKS for the WESTMINSTER DISTRICT. THE SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of the PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD. Westminister: W. BLANCHARD <fe SONS, PRINTERS, 62, MILLBANK STREET. 1858. Board of Works for the Westminister District. THE SECOND ANNUAL REPORT of THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD. 1. Relieved during the past year from the labour of organization, which in the previous year had pressed heavily upon the time of its members, the Board has been enabled, since the date of its last Report, to turn its attention to other and more important matters. Chief among these may be instanced the state and circumstances of the Vauxhall Bridge Road, which, upon inquiry, were found to be of a most anomalous character: the inhabitants, while contributing equally with others to the cost of maintaining the whole District, being, by the operation of the Vauxhall Bridge Company's Act, wholly deprived of the advantages attending a care and supervision by the Board; and being moreover subject to a toll in respect of carriage traffic along the road. After a careful inquiry, the Board, finding it impossible to remedy the serious evils resulting from the preceding facts without an application to Parliament, and having obtained the consent of the Vauxhall Bridge Company, and of the principal owners of property abutting on the road, as signified by their contributing towards the cost, determined to present a Bill to Parliament, having for its object the transfer of the road from the Vauxhall Bridge Company to the local authorities of the respective parishes through which it passes, and making arrangements, enabling this Board, with the consent of the Commissioners of Her Majesty's Woods, &c., and upon certain terms and conditions, to take under their power and control the road from the centre of the entrance to the Penitentiary, to Millbank Row. The Bill has now received the sanction of Parliament, and the Board will immediately proceed to remedy many evils of long standing and the subject of frequent complaint. a 2 4 2. The Board has also turned its attention to improvements in the public thoroughfares of the District; and has caused to be prepared, by its Surveyor, plans and estimates for four such improvements, namely— 1. The removal of the Manor House and adjacent buildings in Grey Coat Place. 2. The removal of the block of buildings obstructing the entrance to William Street, from Great James Street. 3. The removal of the projecting portion of the Guard Room to the Military Hospital in Rochester Row. 4. The opening of a public thoroughfare between the inner and outer portions of Cottage Place, Orchard Street. Upon mature deliberation, however, the Board has determined not at present to incur the expense of these improvements. 3. The Board has also had under its very careful consideration the question of establishing a Public District Slaughterhouse, and a Public Local Market; the former with a view to remedy the evils necessarily attending private Slaughter-houses, and the latter with a view to give the inhabitants of this District the advantages enjoyed by those of provincial towns, with populations far less in number than that of the Westminster District; and also with a view to the removal of street-stalls, which are daily becoming more and more objectionable obstructions to the public thoroughfares of this District. These improvements, on financial and other grounds, the Board has, however, also determined to postpone for the present. 4. The Board, having had reason to believe, upon the report of the Surveyor, that the charge hitherto made by the Water Companies for a supply of Water for Street Watering purposes, was greatly in excess of that made to large private consumers taking a supply by meter, authorized and directed that Officer to obtain such information, and to make such experiments, as he might think necessary for further informing the Board on the subject: and the Surveyor accordingly instituted, during the season 1856-7, a series of experiments, which, together with his 5 deductions therefrom, he embodied in a valuable Report, submitted to the Board in November last; and a copy having been forwarded to the Chelsea Waterworks Company, that body, after some negociation, agreed to reduce their charge from 5s. 9d. to 4s. 6d. per 100 square yards watered, making a saving to the Ratepayers of about £140 per annum. 5. Previous to the passing of the " Metropolis Local Management Act," the District had been subdivided into numerous separate Paving and Lighting Commissions and Trusts; and the Board found in operation at its accession to office a number of Gas Lighting Contracts, each one varying from the other as to its terms and conditions. The Board thought it advisable, at the earliest opportunity, to determine these, with a view to their simplification, and in order to give equal advantages to the inhabitants of every portion of the District, without regard to locality. In pursuance of these views, new Contracts have been entered into with the Chartered, the Equitable, and the Western Gas Companies respectively, for lighting the District from Christmas last. The Board, however, regrets that, in consequence of the combination of the Metropolitan Gas Companies to district out the Metropolis into lighting areas, arbitrarily divided among themselves, and the consequent total cessation of competition, a considerable increase of cost is incurred under this head; and the Board has so strongly felt the necessity for neutralizing the effect of such a combination of powerful Companies, that, in conjunction with other Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards, it has appealed to Parliament for an inquiry into the whole subject of Metropolitan Gas Lighting, and a Committee has been appointed by the House of Commons for the purpose, from whose labours it may confidently be hoped that this question—the importance of which can scarcely be overrated—will be placed on a satisfactory footing. 6. With a view to assist the Board to determine the circumstances under which the Carriage-ways of the District should respectively be paved or macadamized, the Surveyor prepared an elaborate Report upon the subject, containing valuable information, which the Board ordered to be printed and circulated ; and the highly-favourable opinion expressed by the public press, and by Engineers and others interested in the question, have abundantly shown that the Board had not overrated its value. The Board desires to take this opportunity of drawing attention to the 6 desirableness of circulating and exchanging similar information with other Boards, especially wherever actual facts and data are given. Sewerage and House Drainage. 7. The question of Metropolitan Drainage being still undetermined, and there being no urgent need of extensive drainage works in the District (much of the 6f miles, mentioned in the Report of last year as unprovided with Sewers, being, upon a closer investigation, found to be drained by means of Sewers and Drains not shown upon the maps furnished to the Board, and a further portion consisting of roads without inhabited houses), the Board has confined its operations in this department chiefly to the drainage of courts, and to ordinary repairs. The Board, however, draws attention to the fact, that the works executed by itself by no means represent the sum total of works executed within this District, and superintended by its Officers—as, for instance, a length of 316 feet of sewer, constructed by private individuals, at Prince's Gate; the diversion of the sewer in Gore Lane; and the diversion of 200 feet of sewer at Rutland Gate. Plans have also been sanctioned for the construction of 980 feet of brick sewer in the neighbourhood of Exhibition Road. In addition to ordinary repairs and small works, the Board has continued its attention to the drainage and improvement of the small streets and courts; as also to the improvement of Surface Drainage, by the construction of a considerable number of new Gully Drains. 103 Dwelling-houses and premises have been newly drained, during the past year, by private persons, the works being executed under the control 'and supervision of the Board. New Buildings. 8. Plans for 26 New Buildings have also been sanctioned, and their erection superintended by the Surveyor to the Board. Public Urinals. 9. Additional Public Urinals have been erected in Bennett's Yard and Laundry Yard; tliis subject is one of much importance, and will continue to occupy the attention of the Board. 7 Street Paving and Road Repairs. 10. In the course of the past year a considerable sum has been expended in ordinary repairs and small works; and, in addition, many important works have been executed, among which may be instanced the re-forming Causton Street and Wheeler Street, so as to remedy the long-standing inconvenience of a material difference between the levels of these streets, and Ponsonby Place. The laying down new Footpaths in Dorset Place, and Deane's Place. Laying down new Footpaths, and macadamizing the Roadway, in Hudson's Terrace. Paving with tramways and other contrivances, for prevention of nuisances, the entrance gateway to Prince's Mews. Repaving Bennett's Yard. Laying down new Footpaths and macadamizing the Roadway of Grey Coat Place. Relaying the Carriage-way of Montpelier Mews. Relaying the Footpaths and Carriage-way of Delahay Street. Thoroughly repairing the Footpaths along the south side of Knightsbridge Road; and the Footpaths, Channels, and Crossings of Victoria Street. The re-paving the Footpaths and macadamizing the Roadways of Vincent Street and Wilton Street, from Regent Street, to Earl Street, with a view to so adjusting the levels of those streets as to permit the removal of the bar which at presents obstructs the carriage thoroughfare along those Streets. Flagging the undermentioned Courts and Passages, viz.— Maidenhead Court. Simon's Buildings. Artillery Square. Emery's Cottages. Castle Place. Duke's Court. Loder's Place. Harper's Place. Blue Anchor Court. Park Place. Passage at Knightsbridge Green. Works in progress in this Department. 8 Gas Lighting. 11. 127 additional Gas Lamps have been erected, and the lighting of the whole District revised. Street Cleansing and Removal of House Refuse. 12. The Board continues to approve the system of daily cleansing the surface of the streets, and of rapidly removing the House Refuse, and takes this opportunity of calling upon the inhabitants of the District to lend their aid individually in preventing the improper and illegal use of rain-water pipes, which the Board regrets to observe are in some streets used as soil pipes for the discharge of offensive matter on the public pavements: the Board also requests the co-operation of the inhabitants in carrying out the suggestions with reference to cleansing, contained in a Notice which has been extensively circulated throughout the parishes. Street Watering. 13. Allusion has already been made to the reduced cost of this service; and it is therefore unnecessary to do more in this place than draw attention to the advantages enjoyed by the inhabitants of this District, in which the whole of the streets are watered, without reference to locality. Sanitary Measures and Removal of Nuisances. 14. The Report of the Officer of Health, for the past year, is annexed to this Report, and to this the Board desires to draw particular attention. The Board is glad to be able to report that, by the operation of the "Metropolitan Market Act, 1857," applications for Licences to Slaughter-houses are now made to the Justices in Petty Sessions, instead of in the Court of Quarter Sessions as heretofore; and that, in consequence, a considerable saving, both in time and money, is gained, as well by applicants, as by the Board itself. Notices of 37 applications were received for the last Licensing day, 12 of which only were opposed by the Board; and of these, 9 were refused by the Magistrates, and no parties appeared in support of the remaining 3. 9 Under Notices and proceedings by the Board, independently of works executed by parties without the interference of the Board,— 256 cesspools have been emptied and filled up. 87 new water-closets have been constructed or improved. 374 closets, hitherto unsupplied by water, have had water laid on. 168 dust-bins have been constructed. 118 private yards to dwelling-houses have been paved and repaired. 239 houses have been whitewashed and cleansed. 45 new water-butts and cisterns have been fixed. 343 foul drains and privies have been cleansed and repaired. In addition to the above, numerous pigs and other improperlykept animals have been removed; and great attention has been paid to the removal of accumulations of filth, the destruction of unwholesome meat and other provisions, and the removal or abatement of nuisances prejudicially affecting the public health. 15. In pursuance of the 198th Section of the Act, the Account in Abstract and summary Statement of the Receipts and Expenditure of the Board for the past year, together with the Report of the Officer of Health, and a list of the names and addresses of the Members of the Board, and of its Officers, will be found in the Appendices hereto annexed. 25th June, 1858.

SECOND ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES OF ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S., MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, The Monthly Reports with which you have been already furnished have so fully embraced all that has been effected daring the past year, that the present second Annual Report will be chiefly devoted to a comparison between the last and previous years in that for which the appointment I have the honour to hold was mainly instituted, viz.— the comparative health and numerical death-rate occurring amongst the inhabitants of the United Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John. In doing this, I must observe, that no supervision can materially decrease the deaths arising from those infantile diseases which are incidental to childhood; but the hope must be still entertained, and the great object of my appointment is, to ascertain to what extent deaths arising from fever, diarrhasa, bronchitis, pneumonia, &c., which form so large an item in the Annual Return, and which in a great measure result from causes within our control, are capable of being diminished by stringent sanitary measures. I do not purpose to again enter into a consideration of the different elements necessary for the efficient maintenance of health, but simply to revive some of the suggestions I have thought necessary to make during the year. One of the greatest social evils existing in this and other Parishes consists in the indiscriminate intermingling of the sexes, I regret to say, to an extent which must have the most material influence in destroying natural modesty, and blunting those feelings which maintain the social relations of the community. Numerous examples of men, women, and children occupying the same room, and frequently the same bed, have beeu met with and reported, but without remedy; and there not being at present any power to interfere, the most pernicious practices result, and a foundation for prostitution is laid, which is aptly termed the "social evil" of the age. Another point to which I desire to draw your attention consists in the overcrowding of rooms. Incredulous as it may appear, the Legislature have provided a remedy against any house being dangerously 21 overcrowded; but any room in a house may be overcrowded to the serious detriment of its occupants, without the power of interference; and this occurs iu every parish in London except the City of London, where the existence of an old Sewer Act enables the Medical Officer to require all such places to be registered as common lodging-houses, and the number of its inmates to be recorded. How, I may ask, when such practices exist, is it possible to stay the ravages of infectious diseases? But if the inquiry is extended, it will be found that other circumstances materially tend to prevent sanitary improvement. In the majority of houses I have inspected among the lower classes, there is a total absence of any efficient means of ventilation; the windows generally only opening from the bottom, such a draught is occasioned that the occupants prefer breathing the tainted and vitiated atmosphere to the chances of catching cold. In my former Report I suggested the adoption of Arnott's ventilators; but as this is probably found to be expensive, let me impress upon the owners of property the necessity of allowing the windows to open from the top, and perforating the upper panels of the doors, so that an entrance and exit may be afforded for a somewhat purer atmosphere, which would tend very greatly to prevent the spread of disease. The poverty of the majority of the lower orders of society compels them to work hard for their living; and, unless the requirements for the maintenance of health can be afforded them without their being compelled to seek them, I fear little can be done to curtail the death average. In the generality of instauces, the rooms are dirty, small, and badly ventilated; in many, the water is insufficient in quantity, and so inconveniently placed as to be beyond their immediate control; and in a large number the closet accommodation is utterly insufficient: thus, as may be naturally expected, Death finds easy victims in filthy habits, overcrowded rooms, impure air, and insufficient and ineffective water supply. In consequence of the prevalence of disease in the neighbourhood of the Vauxhall Road, my attention has been specially directed to an examination of houses in that locality, but I fail to detect anything, either iu reference to the premises or their drainage, that would enable me to explain why that portion of the Parishes should be more unhealthy thau any other. I have previously reported on the continued offensive odour from the termination of the Scholars' Fond sewer, which is the outlet for the drainage from acres of houses; and I cannot but repeat my conviction, that the unhealthy state is mainly owing to this offensive source. I yet hope an appeal to the proper authorities will cause this crying evil to be abated. In examining the following Table of Deaths, it will be seen that a very large proportion occur under five years of age,—namely, 728 as against 1,559; and if those above seventy were added, it would amount to 890, which thus leaves only 669, or rather less than 1 per cent. as 22 referable to the intermediate ages; I have therefore endeavoured to ascertain if any spccial canse existed why such a high death-rate should occur at such au age; and, in order to satisfy myself respecting many of these deaths, have made special inquiries, but I have failed to attribute them to more than the habits of the parents, the size of the apartments in reference to the number of occupants, the general absence of ventilation, and neglect. In many, the children are confined during the day in close apartments while the parents are seeking a living; while in others the habits of the family are such as to materially contribute to the propagation of disease; and although, with the latter class, everything that can be done to add to their comfort and health may be, their generally filthy habits precludes their reaping the benefits they otherwise would do.

It unquestionably shows the last to have been a more healthy year than any of the previous five years; and, had the Table been continued, it would have proved still more favourable to 1857. Although I am led to hope the adoption of sanitary regulations has had its attendant good, a more extended period must elapse before any definite conclusion can be come to, whether this benefit is to be attributed to what has been already effected, or is dependent upon a generally healthy state of atmosphere; certainly, as far as a comparative opinion can be formed, a great improvement has taken place. In order you may at a glance see what has been accomplished, I have appended a Table of streets, houses, and requirements that have been inspected; and, I am happy to add that, in the majority of instances, the works have been completed in a most satisfactory manner, and without having recourse to magisterial interference. A reference to that Table will show the number of houses inspected, and the nuisances that have been abolished; and, when added to that of the previous year, will, I trust, satisfy you, every precaution has been taken to secure an efficient measure of health. During the year, various suggestions have been made, some of which may, perhaps, be eventually adopted. There is nothing, however, that calls so loudly for improvement as the proper ventilation of the sewers, a matter alluded to in my first Annual Report. In these parishes alone 615 open privies and cesspools have been converted into water-closets, and the soil is rapidly discharged into the main sewers; it consequently follows, that where there was previously a slight, there is now a gigantic evil; and the offence from the private dwellings having been transmitted to the sewers, is, in consequence of its escape through the present gullies, disseminated through the different thoroughfares. I take the liberty of again drawing the attention of the Board to this matter, in the hope that continued agitation of so important a subject may eventually compel the proper authorities to adopt some necessary measures of relief. I feel the inutility of extending this Report into a consideration of questions already dilated upon; I have, therefore, refrained from making in detail observations on the different elements of health; I am content to put before you what has been accomplished, and the apparent result; and, I trust, you will consider as much has been effected as could be, considering the inquisitorial nature of the duties that have devolved upon, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, BARNARD HOLT, Medical Officer of Health. 5, Parliament Street, June, 1858. 26 INSPECTIONS BY MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, AND TABULAR STATEMENT OF HOUSE IMPROVEMENTS.

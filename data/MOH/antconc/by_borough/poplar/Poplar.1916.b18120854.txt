To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir, Madam and Gentlemen, In accordance with the "Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my twenty-fourth Annual Report, which deals with the year 1916, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also that of the Lady Inspector and of the Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The reports of the Lady Health Visitors are also included. VITAL STATISTICS. The population of the Borough, calculated by the Registrar General is 155,095 for the death rate and 168,746 for the birth rate‡:— London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,310,030† 53,874 62,097 39,124 58,616 67,562 42,568 being 66.63 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 46.19 per acre in Poplar Sub-District, 102.50 in Bromley, and 70.40 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1916. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1907 to 1911 are the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, but the rates in Tables IV., V., VI. and VII, have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based * These figures are calculated upon the acreage of the district including the inland water area, not tidal and foreshore, but exclusive of area covered by water they are:— 72.70 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 53.65 for the Sub-District of Poplar, 105.42 for the Sub-District of Bromley, and 72.05 for the Sub-District of Bow.

The following estimates of population have been adopted in the General Register Office, Somerset House, for the calculation of the death rate and birth rate of the Borough for the year 1916: For the death rate 155,095 „ „ birth „ 168,746 The Superintendent of Statistics states that the former is an estimate of the civilian population; the latter of the total population based on the assumption that the ratio between the total and the civilian population is the same in the Borough as in England and Wales as a whole. With a view to approximation to the population amongst which the births have occurred, the total population of England and Wales for this purpose has been calculated by adding to the published estimate for 1914 the natural increase up to the middle of the year 1916.

In the 52 weeks 2,782 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 543 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1,941 in Bromley, and 298 in Bow ; from the 543 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 57 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 434 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 920 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1,941 registered deaths in Bromley in a similar manner, viz., deducting 1,146 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 193 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 988. From the 298 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 2 nonresidents and add 321 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 617 deaths. 8 In dealing separately with the sub-districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II., and III., that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub-districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2,782 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 731 deaths of actual non-residents, and 474 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2,525 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 920 deaths in Poplar included 5 illegitimate children, 3 male and 2 female; the 988 deaths in Bromley included 9 illegitimate children, 6 male and 3 female ; the 617 Bow deaths included 3 illegitimate children, 2 male and 1 female, making a total for the Borough of 17 deaths of illegitimate children.

Copy of letter received from the Principal of The Royal College of St. Katharine. " 13th November, 1916. Dear Dr. Alexander, The work of the College has increased a good deal of late, and I am writing to tell you of various changes and proposals of extension which have been made. At present we have three Infant Consultations weekly at 228, Brunswick Road—on Tuesdays and Fridays at 2.30 p.m., and on Wednesdays at 10 a.m. The Ante-Natal Clinic is on Friday at 10 a.m., and the Dental Clinic on Tuesdays at 4.30 p.m. Infant Consultations are also held at Fern Street School Settlement on Tuesdays at 10 a.m., at Kingsley Hall (temporarily at the Chapel Hall at the corner of Bruce Road) on Thursdays at 2.30 p.m., and at the Church Institute, Newby Place, on Mondays at 2.30 p.m. It is proposed to open another Centre shortly in St. Saviour's Parish, which will probably be held on Thursday mornings. Dr. Harold Waller now gives his whole time to the work of the College, and Dr. Helen Stuart Robertson acts as his Clinical Assistant. At present we have a staff of eleven Health Visitors, but we hope to add one to this number as soon as possible. Sewing classes and cookery demonstrations have been arranged for the mothers at the Centre at Brunswick Road. The Chapter have decided to open an observation ward for infants whose progress is not satisfactory, but who are not eligible for admission to a Children's Hospital as in-patients. A three years' course of training has been arranged in connection with King's College for Women, for educated women to prepare themselves for posts as Health Visitors and Superintendents of Infant Footnote, continued from page 11. by Health Visitors is calculated upon births occurring in one particular year and deaths in that and the following year. The children born in 1910 and dying during 1910-11 are shown in the rate for 1910, so that the diarrhoea months June, July, August and September of 1911 affected not only the children born in 1911, but also those born in 1910 who had not yet reached one year of age, hence the higher rates amongst infants visited during the two years 1910 and 1911. 1908 .. ..

Students reside at St. Katharine's College and attend the lectures at King's College for Women. Yours very truly, (Signed) KATHARINE S. MACQUEEN. The Public Health and Housing Committee through the Council desired to express to H.M. Queen Alexandra, and the Chapter and Principal of the College, gratification at the increasing activities of the College, and appreciation of the valuable work which it is accomplishing in the conservation of infant life in the Borough, and recommended the Council that letters, expressing the Council's appreciation, be forwarded to H.M. Queen Alexandra and the Chapter and Principal of St. Katharine's College. The following reply was received to the letter addressed by order of the Council to H.M. Queen Alexandra, expressing gratification at the increasing activities of the Royal College of St. Katharine and appreciation of the valuable work it is accomplishing in the conservation of infant life in the Borough. " Marlborough House, Pall Mall, 29th January, 1917. Sir, I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, which I have submitted to Queen Alexandra. I am desired by Her Majesty to ask you to be good enough to convey to the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Her Majesty's best thanks for their kind appreciation of the work which is being carried on in the Borough by the Royal College of St. Katharine. Her Majesty rejoices in the fact that it has been found possible to extend the sphere of operations, and she sincerely trusts that, with your Council's continued co-operation and support, the all important and invaluable work of the College in connection with the welfare of Infants may steadily increase and prosper. Her Majesty feels that the success which has been achieved by St. Katharine's College is mainly due to the untiring energy and devotion to duty of Miss MacQueen, the Principal, and her Lady Health Visitors, and the unselfish and able help and advice of Dr. Harold Waller, I am, Sir, Yours faithfully, HENRY STREATFIELD, Colonel. Private Secretary to H.M. Queen Alexandra. J. Buteux Skeggs, Esq." 14 The following letter was also received from Miss MacQueen, Principal of the Royal College of St. Katharine : — “ The Royal College of St. Katharine, Bromley Hall, Brunswick Road, Poplar, E. January 29th, 1917. Dear Sir, I have to acknowledge and thank you for your letter of the 25th, enclosing a copy of your letter to Sir Henry Streatfield, and also for the kind expression of your Council's appreciation of the work which we are doing here. Yours faithfully, K. S. MACQUEEN, Principal. The Royal College of St. Katharine and the Poplar Infant Care Association. Re-arrangement of Areas. The Poplar Infant Care Association desired to concentrate its work, under the Council's Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme, on the Isle of Dogs, and the other part of the area hitherto allocated to the Association under the scheme was transferred to the Royal College of St. Katharine with the oonsent of the Chapter of the College. St. Katharine's College has the staff and means to deal effectually with the enlarged District, and the whole of the area between Bow Road and the Isle of Dogs is now in charge of the College. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the extension of the area of St. Katherine's College would most effectually secure the efficient working of the Maternity Scheme, and that it was at present inadvisable to divide the area in order to bring in other organisations, especially having regard to the necessity of dealing effectually from an administrative and statistical point of view with, infantile diarrhoea and measles. The re-arrangement was approved by the Local Government Board's Inspector. The Committee recommended the Council that the re-arrangement of areas, as stated, in connection with the Council's Maternity Scheme, be approved. 15 Provision of Special Drugs at Maternity Centre. The Public Health and Housing Committee had under consideration the question of provision of special drugs, which the Council may provide at cost price, in connection with the Bow Maternity Centre. The Council's Medical Attendant being in attendance only on one afternoon in each week, it is inadvisable that she should treat patients, but the Committee were of opinion that certain preparations should be supplied at cost price, and approved proposed arrangements made for such provision by a chemist in the immediate vicinity of the Centre, on the order of the Medical Officer in attendance, as follows:— 4 ozs. Virol (in container) 4½d. 3 ,, Extract of Malt (in own cup) 2½d. 3 ,, Cod Liver Oil (in own container) 6d. Dusting Powder, according to prescription Id. In cases where the mother is unable to afford payment the preparation will be supplied free of charge, one half the cost being met by the Local Government Board. The Council has no power to provide foods other than those of the nature of the preparations referred to, which are classed as drugs. The Committee recommended the Council to approve their action. Baby Show. A Baby Show was organised by the Council's Health Visitor, Miss A. E. Hall, and held at the Mayor's Gardens Fete, on July 6th. The Show was extremely well organised and highly successful, and the Public Health and Housing Committee desired to express their indebted, ness to Miss Hall for her action in the matter and congratulated her on the success of her efforts. The Committee were of opinion such functions are valuable, by promoting a spirit of emulation in the healthy rearing of babies, in reducing infantile mortality. Appointment of Clerk in Maternity Department. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the question of clerical assistance in the Health Visiting Department. The Maternity Scheme includes the keeping of records of each case for five years, and between 8,000 and 9,000 birth cards are now being dealt with. With at least twelve whole time Visitors working in the Borough, the clerical work has necessarily increased, and the Health Visitors would be engaged more advantageously in visiting a larger number of cases than in copying out particulars. 16 The Medical Officer suggested the employment for the present of a girl clerk for this purpose—mainly copying work—at a commencing weekly wage of about 15s. per week. One-half the cost would be met by a grant from the Local Government Board. She would also render clerical assistance to the Lady Sanitary Inspector. The Committee recommended that the Medical Officer be empowered to make arrangements for employment of a girl clerk, as proposed. Inspection of Lying-in Homes—London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1915. The London County Council decided to itself proceed with the work of inspection of Lying-in Homes under the Provisions of Part IV. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1915, and not to delegate such inspection to the Borough Council. Resignation and Appointment of Second Health Visitor. Miss Wain, Second Health Visitor, resigned on her appointment as Sister at the Military Hospital at Ladywell, a sealed testimonial was given to her by the Council. Miss N. Brocklehurst was appointed by the Council as Second Health Visitor. Notification of Births Act, 1907. During the year 4,504 notifications were received under the Notification of Births Act, 1907.

The suggested compulsory notification of Ophthalmia Neonatorum was dealt with in extenso in the 1910 Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for Poplar, pages 19-33; special reports had been made upon the compulsory notification by him during 1910 to the Poplar Public Health and Housing Committee, and correspondence on the subject passed between the Poplar Borough Council and the London County Council and the special reports were forwarded to the Local Government Board and the London County Council (see Annual Report 1910; History, Statistics and Aotion of the Poplar Borough Council, etc.). The outcome was that an “Order„ approved by the Local Government Board was made by the London County Council on 7th February, 1911, and came into operation on 13th March 1911, making the notification of Ophthalmia Neonatorum compulsory by Medical Practitioners within the County of London. Then followed " The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1914. The Local Government Board issued an Order, dated 6th February, 1914, under Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, extending the compulsory notification of the disease to every sanitary district in England and Wales. The Regulations require that certain additional information shall be given in each case beyond that required in connection with notifications under the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act. In districts in which the disease was already notifiable (Poplar being one of the districts) a Medioal Practitioner when giving a notification was required by the Regulations to furnish the additional information to which reference has been made. By Article VI. every Certified Midwife attending a child whom she suspects to be suffering from the disease is required to furnish a notification unless the case has already been notified by a Medical Practitioner. The Order came into force on the 1st April, 1914. The Local Government Board had been advised that general notification of this disease was desirable. A large proportion of the blindness contracted in childhood being due to the neglect of proper precautions against the disease, and, in the Board's view, it is important that Medical Officers of Health should have early information of all cases. 18 In the Borough of Poplar, upon receipt of a notification, the case is immediately visited by one of the Health Visitors and is kept under constant observation, and, if necessary, the services of a nurse are procured from one of the Nursing Associations working within the Borough. When it is borne in mind that blindness and damage to the eyes can be prevented by the simplest prophylatic care, the continued blindness of babies in a civilised community becomes a crime. (See Annual Report, 1910, pages 19-33.) In 1915, two cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum were admitted into hospital, and 13 attended as out-patients, the remainder were treated privately. A nurse was required in 5 cases ; in 1916 13 attended Hospitals as out-patients, the remainder were treated privately. A nurse was required in 14 cases. “If a person over the age of 16 years who has the custody, charge or care of any child or young person causes such child to be ill-treated or neglected in a manner likely to cause such child unnecessary suffering to his health (including injury or loss of sight) that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour.”—(Extract from Children's Act, 1908.)

It was estimated at the time of the Medical Officer of Health's Special Report in 1910 that 40 per cent, of the blindness in children in the London County Council's Schools was due to Ophthalmia Neonatorum. 19 AGE MORTALITY. The number of deaths from one year to 65 years of age was 538 for Poplar, 552 for Bromley, and for Bow 322, making a total for the Borough of Poplar of 1,412.

In Column 12 are entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. † "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence-—e.g., casuals—are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (b) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known ; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

For the Fluid supplied to the Works Department a charge of 1d. per gallon is made ; the Public Health Department is credited with this amount although no actual monetary transaction takes place. As applicants now usually bring their own receptacles to the depots, there is also a very appreciable saving in the expense on bottles alone. From October, 1915, for Electrolytic Disinfectant supplied to manufacturers and trading concerns, a charge of 8d. per gallon is to be made through the Electricity Department, the Electricity Undertaking being allowed an amount of 10 per cent. for establishment charges. * See "Comments on Adverse Criticism," Annual Report, 1911. † On page 74 it will be seen that the fluid is made of greater strength and afterwards broken down to half strength for distribution, more electrical current being used.

CANAL BOATS. For the year ended 31st December, 1916, the inspections and reports of the Inspectors respecting registered canal boats and non-registered canal boats were as follows:— Registered. NonRegistered. §Mr. J. Bullock, East Combined Division — — *Mr. J. Johnson, West Combined Division — — §Mr. C. Foad, Poplar South Division — — Mr. H. J. Langley, Bromley North Division — — ‡Mr. Wm. Johnson, Bromley Central Division 1 — †Mr. A. J. Field, Bow East Division 10 19 Mr. W. Boyce, Bow West Division 1 31 12 50 WORKSHOPS,¶ WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES AND OUTWORKERS. Registers and Inspections. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 122 and 123. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. * Mr. J. Johnson reported that on each occasion when passing the portion of canal in his district, no canal boats have been observed. † Mr. Field reported that one registered boat was visited three times. ‡ Mr. Wm. Johnson reported that one registered canal boat was visited twice. The cabin woodwork, cupboards, floors, etc., were dirty and neglected. A letter of caution was sent to the owners. § No canal in Sub-division; deputises when necessary for other Inspectors. ¶ See Footnote, page 121. 121 The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1174, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 122 and Tables C and D, pages 125 and 126. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 177 and 178 and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 151-172. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 71. * A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 125—128) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note-books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops* and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Table A, under "Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 3 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were "Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 122 TABLE A.

House-to-house inspections at all times in the Chinese quarter continue to be made by the Inspector for Houses Let-in-Lodgings; there are now 42 premises, occupied by Chinese, on the Register. The Inspector visits these premises for overcrowding between the hours of 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., as well as at other times, as the occupiers go to bed very late and are not early risers. The work of repairing and cleansing of premises is under constant supervision, and cases of overcrowding are dealt with as they are discovered.

Eleven premises were inspected under Section 17 (1) of the Housing and Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, and in the first place, as a rule, intimations and statutory notices were served upon owners under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in order that the defects might be remedied and thereby prevent "Representations" under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act., 1909, which would be followed by the Council making "Closing Orders." The following is a list of dwelling-houses inspected, and the work executed; but in 5 cases "Representations" were made followed by "Closing Orders":— Premises Inspected.

Closing Orders were made by the Council on the 20th January, 1916, in respect of Nos. 17, 19 and 21, Annabel Street, Poplar, which orders remained operative for a period exceeding three months. The dwelling houses not having been rendered fit for human habitation, the Council, under Section 18 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, made an Order on the 20th July for the demolition of the premises, but that the operation of such Orders be postponed for a period of six months. Closing Orders under the Housing and Town Planning Act were made by the Council on 21st October, 1915, in respect of Nos. 311, 335 and 226, West Ferry Road and No. 3, Ingleheim Cottages. The owner appealed to the Local Government Board, but subsequently abandoned his appeal. The houses not having been made fit for human habitation, the Council, on the 21st September last, ordered notice to be given to the owners to appear before the Committee to show cause why Demolition Orders should not be made. The Public Health and Housing Committee were satisfied the premises had not been rendered fit for habitation, and were of opinion Demolition Orders should be made, but that the operation thereof should be suspended for a period of six months. The Committee recommended the Council on the 16th November that the Seal of the Council be affixed to Demolition Orders, under Section 15 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, in respect of Nos. 311, 335 and 226, West Ferry Road, and 3, Ingleheim Cottages, but that the operation of such Orders be postponed for a period of six months. 142 Letting of Closed Houses—Suggested Amendment of Act. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered representations made by Lewisham Borough Council to the Local Government Board urging that the Board should, at the first convenient opportunity, promote legislation amending the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, by making it a penal offence for the owner of a house in respect of which a closing Order had been made, to allow such house, or any part thereof, to be occupied prior to the determination of the Order. The Committee recommended the Council that the representations made by Lewisham Borough Council be supported. Meeting of a National Congress. A National Congress was convened by the National Housing and Town Planning Council at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on April 11th to April 14th, to consider Home Problems after the War, more especially those problems relating to Housing and Agriculture, and the possibilities of averting unemployment in the Building Trade. WATER. Water Certificates. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—"Bridge House," Bow, and Union Docks, Millwall (three Houses).

LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Verminous Rooms.* Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the Intimations "which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. Eighty-four certificates have been given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 259 rooms have been cleansed of vermin:— Poplar South Division 12 West Combined Division 11 East Combined Division 27 Bromley Central Division 41 Bromley North Division 40 Bow West Division 19 Bow East Division 7 Houses Let in Lodgings 102 No summonses were applied for. * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons, see pages 79-82. 144 Licensed Premises Urinals.

Pans and Traps without Notice. Where w.c. pans and traps are fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders are written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings will be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work is found to have been executed and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. Overcrowding. A certificate was given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting one case of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notice should be served ; 63 cases of overcrowding were abated. Two cases of overcrowding were found in workshops (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 177); 127 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Tibbatts's report, page 179). Legal proceedings were instituted in one instance. General. 7,226 communications were received, and 733 complaints (including 17 smoke) as to nuisances were made. 4,391 communications were despatched. 148 149 Police Court Proceedings No. of Street or Name of Premises or Locality, &c.

Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,539 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 24.75 per cent, of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 381 written intimations, 161 statutory, and 36 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases preceded the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable.

The 16 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food-stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Unsound Food. The market places have been regularly inspected. In no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. Factory and Workshop Acts.

Thirty-four drains were reconstructed wholly or partially on the old lines—or repaired, in most cases including the fixing of new traps and pans and yard gullies. Factories. Improved additional sanitary accommodation has been provided at ten factories in this Division. The increase in employment of female labour was principally the cause of the extra amount of work entailed in furnishing extra accommodation for male and female employees. 173 Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were inspected and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations, and in three instances were recon structed with approved sanitary arrangements. Workshops and Workplaces.

Hairdressing and Shaving Rooms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms were inspected and dealt with where necessary. In every case an antiseptic was in use. Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. Public Health (London) Act—Prosecution. In this case proceedings were taken under the 12th Section of the above Aot—which empowers the Inspector to take proceedings without waiting for the Committee's authorisation. The nuisance being an urgent one, viz., occupied premises, 66, Mellish Street, without water supply. The magistrate made a closing order, with £3 3s. penalty and costs. On the reinstatement of the water supply and completion of other repairs, the order was cancelled by the Court. Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. 174 At one school works of sanitary improvement were found to be necessary in connection with the sanitary offices and accommodation, a written intimation was served on the authorities and the work is in hand at the date of tnis report. At the remaining schools the sanitary condition of the lavatories, conveniences, water supplies and fitting was satisfactory. Tuberculosis and Measles. In addition to the ordinary notification of infectious diseases, in all cases of measles notified from schools and in cases of tuberculosis the homes of the patients were inspected and advice given re isolation and disinfection, to prevent the spread of infection and all insanitary conditions were dealt with. Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. The premises, 3, Ingelheim Cottages, West Ferry Road, closed as unfit for human habitation by an order of the Council under the above Act are still unoccupied. Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale Periodical inspections were made of the following premises:- Bakehouses, 7. Slaughterhouses, 1. Tripe dressers and sausage makers, 8. Dairies and milk shops, 20. Ice cream vendors, 19. Coffee shops and dining rooms, 28. Fish shops, 9. In all cases where cleansing, limewashing, or other works of sanitary improvements were necessary the matter was brought to the notice of the occupiers by written intimation, which in every case was complied with. The regularity of the periodical inspection of these premises has impressed upon the occupiers the necessity of cleanliness and limewashing, etc., of kitchens and places where food is prepared or stored. This was proved by the amount of work already completed or in progress {without notice) at the time of my visits. 175 Riverside Wharves and Food Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the wharves and factories, and records were kept of all unsound foodstuffs and methods of destruction. The total amount of foodstuff, comprising meat, poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables in tins rejected by the consignees and destroyed during the year was 170 cases containing from 10 to 100 tins' per case and 645 loose tins. Eighteen cases of desiccated cocoanut in damaged condition were removed to a factory in West Ferry Road, with a written undertaking that it would not be used for human food, but converted into food for cattle. Exportation of Meat Food Products. In cases where meat food products, prepared or packed in factories in this division for exportation abroad to countries where certificates of origin, etc., are required to accompany each consignment, I have visited the particular factory, under your direction, and examined the articles during preparation and packing prior to signing of certificates by yourself. No notice was received from H.M. Office of Customs under the regulations made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, of food stuff imported by water into this district during the past year, and no infringement of the Act was observed by me. Food Preserving Factories. Army Rations.—During the year, as far as practicable, a daily visitation has been made to the factories in Millwall where Army rations are manufactured in large quantities as follows Meat and Vegetable Rations in tins. Roast Fowl ,, Rabbit ,, Sausages ,, Jams and Marmalade ,, The meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables used have been inspected daily, in the meat stores, cutting, filling and weighing rooms and kitchens, and were sound and of good quality. Samples of finished rations were taken from time to time—the tins opened and contents examined with no 176 cause for complaint. The benches, utensils and floors were washed down daily, and the walls of meat stores and meat cutting room relimewashed when and where necessary. Inspection of Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. One hundred and two samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of 39 milk samples taken three were so adulterated that legal proceedings were taken against the vendors. In two cases fines and penalties were inflicted, viz., 40s. and 41s.; in the third case a written warranty was produced and proved, and the summons was dismissed. Three samples of milk were certified deficient in solids not fat 2.9, 2.9, and 4.7 per cent. respectively. In each case a letter of caution was sent to the vendors. Of 18 samples of butter taken, 10 contained boric acid preservative, but not exceeding 0.3 per cent. Of six samples of margarine, five contained a similar preservative and were certified genuine. One sample of sausage contained 24 grains boric acid to the pound ; a letter of caution was written to the vendor. The remaining samples of various foods and drugs were certified genuine and free from preservative. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 177 Report of Lady Sanitary Inspector. Public Health Department, 31st December, 1916. Sir,— I beg to present my seventeenth Annual Report, which deals with the work done in factories and workshops, among out-workers, and other miscellaneous inspections during 1916. Verminous Children, Scabies and Phthisis. The homes of children reported as attending school in a verminous condition have again received attention. A large number of children have been excluded from school suffering from scabies, many of them have been bathed and the clothing and bedding disinfected at the cleansing station. I have also visited cases of phthisis attending the Dispensary. Workshops. The number of workshops on the register again shows a decrease, this is caused by some having become factories and also small employers have given up their workshops and are now employed in large factories where the work is more regular and more remunerative. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation in the 38 elementary schools in the Borough has been inspected and various defects remedied. Outworkers. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 120 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 271 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar. Two hundred and fifty-five lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. 178 The following is a tabulated statement of further details :— Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1916.

April 24th, 1917 Sir, I beg to present the ninth Annual Report of my work—the second under the Local Government Board's extended scheme for the Prevention of Infantile Mortality. No additions have been made to the scheme since the last report, but a further transference of Case Papers was made on May 1st. The Royal College of St. Katharine undertaking a portion of Poplar, previously undertaken by the Poplar Infant Welfare Association. The visiting areas are now as follows:- Poplar Infant Welfare Association. Undertake all the work south of the first bridges. The Royal College of St. Katharine. Undertake all the work between the first bridges and Bow Road. The Public Health Department Undertake all the work of north of Bow Road.

H. Warren, J.P.). Vouchers were first issued on May 4th. Virol. Extract of Malt. Cod Liver Oil. Dusting-powder. Total. 274 111 18 10 413 Two competitions were held during the year for prizes offered by Dr. Dobson. One for the mother whose infant showed most improvement in a given time, after a series of talks on Food and Food Values, and after demonstrations with model clothes, for the mother who best carried out the principles taught. The chief honours at the Baby Show organised by his Worship the Mayor were carried off by Bow babies. Miscellaneous. The visits under this heading were nearly all paid to cases of births not notified to this Department. Several false addresses had been given —in each case the Registrar affected was communicated with. 185 New Register—Births. The above, which was compiled merely for the use of our own Department, is now being published by well-known publishers, as a Standard Register of Births. Zymotic Enteritis.

The special foods mentioned as being given to the younger infants were Nestles, Cow's milk, Glaxo, Allen & Hanbury's, Mellin's, Neaves', Garman's, Truemilk and Cornflower. To the elder children " anything." 186 Second Health Visitor. Owing to changes in the staff, all the visits paid have been included under one heading. Visiting. Council's Health Visitors.

It will be interesting to note what effect Ante-natal visiting will have upon this rate. Personally, I think the carrying out of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Venereal Diseases will be more likely to effect a reduction. Mothers who worked during pregnancy 71 per cent. „ „ ,, after delivery 9.1 ,, The feeding of the infants visited during the first six months of life was as follows:- (1) Those alive at end of completed year (December, 1915):- Breast-fed 72.47 per cent.

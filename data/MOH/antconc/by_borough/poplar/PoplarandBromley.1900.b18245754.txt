POP 71 Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. for the SOUTH DISTRICT. Comprising the Parishes of All Saints, Poplar, and Bromley St. Leonard. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with "The Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my eighth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1900 and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley, and the Report of the Lady Inspector. VITAL STATISTICS. The populations of the two parishes, estimated to the middle of 2 the year 1900, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1891 and 1896 being maintained, are:— Registration South Poplar or London Isle of Dogs 21,114 South Bromley 37,254 4,589,129 North Poplar 37,887 North Bromley 32,285 Total 59,001 69,539 being 61.5 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 50.6 per acre in Poplar and 114.3 in Bromley. These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report. In calculating the birth and marriage rates, also the general death and zymotic rates, in addition to using the above-mentioned estimated populations, these rates have also been obtained by dealing with populations estimated by deducting the deaths from the enumerated populations and adding the births from the time that the census of 1896 (the end of the first quarter of the year) was taken to the middle of the year 1899. The unknown figures relating to emigration and imigration concerning the parishes have received no consideration. Poplar. Bromley. Census 1896 57.759 69,821 Deaths from first quarter of year 1896 to middle of year 1900 5.516- 6,223- 52,243 63,598 Births for the corresponding period 8,432 + 10,830 + Estimated population (b) to the middle of year 1900 60,675 74,428 For convenience the rates as mentioned above will be styled (a) or (b) according to the respective estimated population used. 3 Poplar. Bromley. (A) 59,001 69,539 (b) 60,675 74,428 When the Census of 1901 is obtained, it will be interesting to see which is the more correct of the two estimated populations.* In calculating with two estimated populations, it is obvious, that when rates are obtained with the lower population, the result will always be greater than if the higher figures had been used, and vice versa. In dealing generally with the rates in this Report, the lower population (a)—except where mentioned—will be used, in order to compare the rates obtained with those of other metropolitan sanitary districts, as the populations of these areas (which form the whole metropolis) are estimated upon the same theory. The births during the 52 weeks were :— Males. Females. Totals.

Treating the 2009 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 752 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 175 deaths in outlying * As against 16.0, 16.3, and 16.5 in the preceeding three years, and an average of 15.6 in the ten years 1890-99. 5 institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1432. The 1399 deaths in Poplar included 10 illegitimate children, 6 male and 4 female, and the 1432 deaths in Bromley included 12 illegitimate children, 4 male and 8 female. Males. Females. Totals.

There were 364 deaths of children under one year of age, belonging to Poplar, and 446 deaths under one year of age, belonging to Bromley. The death rates of children, under one year per 1000 births for the past seven years being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899 1900. Poplar 152 190 177 172 172 183 . 182 Bromley 152 184 168 164 198 174 179 The problem of combating and limiting to some extent the excessive mortality of infants under one year of age could be solved by the Municipal Sterilisation of Milk as is done at St. Helen's, Lancashire. Philanthropic societies for the sale of sterilised humanised milk exist at Fécamp, a small seaside town in Normandy, likewise at Havre. Considerable benefit as regards the saving of infant life has been obtained at St. Helen's. The medical practitioners in the district have co-operated, and recommended the use of the sterilised milk to their patients. At St. Helen's it is stated that during the very hot weather of 1899, when Diarrhoea was so prevalent throughout the whole country, many cases were brought to the depot in the last stage of the disease. In more than one instance the milk seemed to work like magic, and the recoveries were most remarkable. If it were possible to establish creches throughout the district where children could be looked after and fed upon sterilised milk when their mothers are at work, no doubt infant mortality would also be lessened. 8 It is a fact that during the great cotton famine the mortality of children among the Lancashire cotton weavers and spinners was not so high as usual. This was due to the fact that mothers being no longer able to work at the cotton mills had more time to attend to their children. At the Aberdeen Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health, Dr. Templeman, Medical Officer of Health for Dundee, stated that in Dundee, the registrar, at the time of registering the birth, gave the parents leaflets about Infant Hygiene, and the knowledge was spread in that way. He had found on visiting the houses of the poorer people that they had read the leaflet carefully, and were trying to act up to what it contained. I called upon the Registrars of Births and Deaths for Bromley and Poplar, Mr. Butler and Mr. Purdy, and these gentlemen stated that they would be too pleased to distribute like leaflets if supplied with them. Acting upon the instructions of the Sanitary Committee, in order to lessen infantile mortality, I prepared a leaflet upon "Hints regarding the Management of Infants," so as to supply the Registrars of Births and Deaths for Poplar and Bromley. French law on food for babies : "It is not generally known that in France it is a penal offence to give any form of solid food to babies under a year old, unless it be prescribed in writing by a properly qualified medical man. Nurses are also forbidden to use for their charges any sort of feeding bottle having a rubber tube. These and other equally stringent laws have recently been enacted by the French Government; for, in despair of increasing the birthrate of their country, they are now doing their utmost best to save the lives of the comparatively small number of babies born," 9 AGE MORTALITY. The number of deaths from one year to 65 years of age was 763 for Poplar, and 774 for Bromley. The annual death rates per 1000 living for the past seven years being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900.

These leaflets are published by the National Association tor the Prevention of Consumption and other forms of Tuberculosis. With a view to the prevention of Consumption, and to the reduction in the mortality from the disease, it was suggested that a quantity of these leaflets (which had been drawn up under the supervision of the highest medical authorities) should be purchased from the Association, and sent for distribution to district visitors, nurses, and clergymen, also to medical practitioners and others. The Committee directed that 1000 of each of the leaflets in question be purchased and circulated as suggested. The leaflets were forwarded to forty clergymen and two nursing homes in the parishes of Poplar and Bromley. The leaflets were sent with a circular letter, which stated that copies would be supplied for distribution in homes where consumptive cases unfortunately existed. One clergyman referred to the matter from his pulpit, and he wrote, "I am asked on all hands for copies." 11 TABLE I.

ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Notifications and Hospital Accommodation, Outworkers. When the London Government Act came into force the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board wrote, " I am desirous for statistical purposes of recording until the end of the year the weekly extracts from copy notification certificate in as far as possible the same sanitary districts as have existed until the present change. " I should therefore be glad if you would make such arrangements as would allow the copy notifications to be entered on the return sent 27 to this office under the headings of the old areas, until the 29th proximo." There were 738 notifications of infectious diseases in Poplar and 582 in Bromley; these do not include 42 second notifications. Notifications of parishioners from Institutions within the parishes of Poplar and Bromley were as follows :* Total Cases. Notifications. Removals. Puerperal Fever. Scarlatina. Diphtheria.

The London County Council was communicated with 29 and the sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected. Notices ot eight passengers had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities (see Bubonic Plague, page 49). Three outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified 2 in Poplar and 1 in Bromley. The usual notice was given. No difficulty was experienced in obtaining the removal of infectious cases. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT. The following figures give the number of premises disinfected, and the number of times the Board's apparatus was used for the two parishes, some thousands of articles being disinfected. Private premises. Board's apparatus. Poplar 555 553 Bromley 517 513 1072 1066 Upon representing the position in the event of a breakdown of the disinfecting apparatus or the occurrence of an epidemic, the Committee recommended to the then Board that further provision was necessary, and it was resolved that saturated steam (the " Equifex") apparatus be erected and the disinfecting station be extended. At the time of writing this report, the additional building required has been erected and the new apparatus is in working order. The existing Washington Lyon apparatus and boiler have been lagged with wood. SMALL POX. Two cases of small-pox occurred at a house in the parish of Bromley. The first case was a female, aged 33 years, notified on the 21st 3° ruary. The patient was immediately removed, notice given to the Vaccination Officer, and the premises disinfected. The second case was notified on the 9th March, 16 days later, and was a boy, aged 10 years, the son of the first patient. In the Hackney district five in a family, relatives of the above patients, it was stated, had been suffering from the complaint. Five children at home (in the Bromley case), three of whom had been re-vaccinated, were free from Small-pox. Mr. Hitchins, the Vaccination Officer, has kindly furnished me with the following statistics, which are copied from those forwarded to the Local Government Board :— 1899.—January to June.

He was informed that he was suffering from scarlet fever, and that an ambulance had been sent for to take him to a Fever Hospital, and that he ought not to go into the streets, but wait for the ambulance to take him away. In spite of this being repeated to him several times, he persisted in leaving the hospital. No action was taken as the patient was seriously ill. CONTINUED AND TYPHUS FEVERS. One case of continued fever was notified in Bromley, the patient, a man aged 40 years, was removed into the Eastern Fever Hospital, but three days afterwards he was certified to be suffering from typhus fever. He was employed casually as a boilermaker and stevedore. He had been working on board ship in the docks. The wife who was an outworker, had her work stopped, and the garments she had in hand were disinfected before being returned to the workshop. TYPHOID FEVER.

A case removed also from Poplar was notified as puerperal fever. Forty-six specimens of blood from doubtful cases of typhoid fever were forwarded to the Jenner Institute of preventive medicine. In 23 instances (50 per cent.) the typhoid (Widal) reaction was obtained. Fourteen Poplar parishioners died from typhoid fever, and 18 fatal cases occurred among the Bromley patients. As is usual it will be seen that the typhoid fever cases occurred for the most part during the last quarter of the year. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total.

The bacillus diphtherioe was isolated in 43 instances, and the pseudo diphtheritic bacillus in 3 cases. See page 28 as to cases of diphtheria admitted into Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals which were certified as not having the complaint. No deductions have been made in respect of these patients. The 316 cases in Poplar were notified from 255 premises, and the 238 cases in Bromley from 201 premises. Unfortunately a very large number of cases of diphtheria and scarlet fever occurred upon the Isle of Dogs at the end of the year. The diphtheria cases were nearly all centred round the St. John's 36 National School, Roserton Street, Cubitt Town. The scarlet fever cases were more diffused but for the most part occurred in the neighbourhood of St. Luke's School, Millwall. In the infants' department of St. John's School, upon the 12th November, the number on the roll was 113, and with diphtheria there were 15 scholars absent, (13.2 per cent.) In the babies' department, the number on the roll was 73, and with diphtheria there were 6 absent, (8.2 per cent.) On the 19th November, the return from St. John's School showed an increase of scholars absent with diphtheria in the infants' department, making a total of 17 with a roll of 113 in number, and 7 absent in the babies' department with number on the roll of 73. With a view to preventing the spread of the disease I interviewed Messrs. Gordon and Main, two members of the Poplar Borough Council, and recommended the closing forthwith of the infants' and babies' departments of the St. John's School, and the exclusion from the mixed department of any scholars coming from the homes of children who attended the infants' and babies' departments. Under the 88th Article of the Code of Regulations for Day Schools, upon "notice" to the Managers given by Mr. Alderman Main and Mr. Councillor Gordon, my recommendation was carried out. On the nth December, the Rev. Hartley, correspondent for the St. John's National Schools, communicated by writing that "the Managers of St. John's, Isle of Dogs Church Schools, have resolved to proceed at once with the rebuilding of the School offices, and will commence next Monday to lay the new drains for that purpose and pick up the old ones." Under these circumstances, I advised that the whole School be closed on Saturday, 15th December, and be kept closed until 6th January, 1901, with a view to preventing any danger to health likely to arise from the condition of the Schools when the drains were open and the polluted soil was being removed 37 Messrs. Main and Gordon acting upon my advice gave “notice” to the Managers to close the whole School. The late Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, in a memorandum upon the subject of closing public elementary schools, stated : " It is less likely to be useful in a town or compact village (particularly where houses are sublet and yards are in common) where the children of different households, when not at school, spend their time in playing together, and often run in and out of each other's houses. But it must be remembered that children when at play out of doors are brought into much less close association with each other than when at school." whooping-cough. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900.

During the months of March and April a number of cases of measles happened among the scholars in the infants' departmen at the St. Luke's Schools, Millwall. The Head Master was advised to exclude all children who attended from infected houses. On account of measles among the scholars in the infants' department at the St. Luke's Schools, Millwall, and the British Street Board Schools, the Vicar of St. Luke's and the Medical Officer to 38 the School Board for London were communicated with, asking that the Easter vacation might be somewhat prolonged in order that the spread of the disease might be lessened. The class-rooms were disinfected during the holidays. On the 24th May I reported to the Committee :—" By the reports received from the various schools on the Isle of Dogs, measles must be still prevalent in that portion of the district, but the return of absentees is not at present of such a nature as to warrant me advising the closing of any of the departments." On the 28th June I reported that:—" Measles, which has been very general throughout the two parishes, appears by the returns from the various schools to be diminishing." On the 27th September I reported :—Measles is existing in the neighbourhood of the Orchard House. The attendance of the scholars at the Bow Creek School is falling off. I interviewed the Head Mistress, and communicated with the Medical Officer of the London School Board, with a view, if necessary, to the closure of the school." The following figures are the deaths from measles (or the past eight years :— 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. Poplar 12 58 82 49 33 34 39 25 Bromley 20 95 105 32 35 53 44 28 Totals 32 153 187 81 68 87 83 53 A circular letter was received from the London County Council as to whether it is advisable that the Council should include " measles' under the term " dangerous and infectious diseases," for the purposes of sections 68, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 (which sections practically 39 comprise all those relating to dangerous and infectious diseases, with the exception of compulsory notifications) for if they are to be compulsory the sections would have to be made so by an " order " of the London County Council, which would have to be approved by the Local Government Board. I pointed out to the Committee that at present the fact that measles is prevalent in a district where notification is not compulsory can only be learnt through article 148 (2) of the Code of regulations and instructions for the guidance of managers, correspondents, and teachers of the School Board for London, which article states that, any child showing symptoms of an infectious disease, or coming from a house where an infectious disease exists, must be sent home at once, and the Medical Officer of Health for the district must also at the same time be informed of the child's exclusion, and furnished with the name and address of the child and the reason for its exclusion on a form with which the teachers are supplied.* The School Board for London exclude a child suffering from measles for at least one month, and children coming from a house where measles exist who are not themselves suffering are excluded from school for 14 days. Again when measles exists in the district the fact comes to the knowledge of the Medical Officer by the Registrars of Deaths forwarding immediately a copy of the entry made in their registers. The reason why measles was not recommended in the past to be made a notifiable disease by the late Board of Works was that it was felt useless to notify the disease because the patients could not be admitted into the hospitals. It may be mentioned that upon the receipt of the Registrar's returns disinfection is now always offered to persons in houses where a death from measles has occurred, but the offer is scarcely ever accepted. * Unfortunately the Voluntary Schools have no such regulation or instruction. 40 The Committee were of the opinion that it was not advisable that measles should be included as proposed. DIARRHOEA. Deaths from diarrhoea for the past eight years were as follows:— 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900 Poplar 54 20 52 61 46 66 82 48 Bromley 83 29 56 72 68 124 99 92 Totals 137 49 108 133 114 190 181 140 London 3446 1780 3600 3223 4104 4376 4196 For death rates see Tables IX. and X., page 19. Diarrhcea, as usual during the middle of the summer, unfortunately was prevalent. It was no doubt due to the great heat of the summer raising the temperature of the earth, thereby causing fermentation to take place in polluted soils, and the germs being wafted into the air, and entering the human system either by becoming inhaled, or settling upon articles of food. This shows the urgent necessity of keeping the surroundings of dwellings in a sanitary condition, and likewise having the streets well watered and scavenged. A death from infantile cholera, in a child aged seven months, was registered in Bromley. In the autumnal months of October, November, December, its place is taken by typhoid fever. The prevalence of these diseases certainly indicates the sanitary condition of a district. As before stated, in summer the temperature of the earth (maintained 56 degrees F. 4ft. from the surface) is one of the main factors in the cause of diarrhcea in insanitary localities and in the autumnal months when the nights are cold and the days hot, the cold atmospheric air 41 displaces the hot ground air charged with all impurities from defective drains and polluted earth. Incidence of diarrhoea and like diseases—enteritis, gastro-enteritis —is well-known to be particularly heavy among the bottle-fed children, due either to the foul condition of the bottle, or to the sourness of the milk, or to both these causes combined. It is obvious that mother's milk is free from germs. Milk in hot weather, on account of fermentation, is particularly liable to upset bottle-fed children. For the purposes of this report, on the mortality tabular forms which have been supplied by the Local Government Board, there is happily a note* defining for the first time the diseases which have to be classified under the headings of Diarrhoea and Enteritis. By having such diseases classified uniformly throughout the kingdom, it is obvious that comparisons of statistics afford a better idea of the state of districts. * Under the heading of " Diarrhoea" are to be included deaths certified as from diarrhoea, alone or in combination with some other cause of ill-defined nature ; and also deaths certified as from Epidemic enteritis ; Zymotic enteritis; Epidemic diarrhoea. Summer diarrhoea ; Dysentery and dysenteric diarrhoea ; Choleraic diarrhoea, cholera, cholera nostras (in the absence of Asiatic cholera). Under the heading of ''Enteritis" are to be included those certified as from Gastro-enteritis, Muco-enteritis and Gastric catarrh, unless from information obtained by enquiry from the certifying practitioner or otherwise, the Medical Officer of Health should have reason for including such deaths, especially those of infants, under the specific term " Diarrhoea." Deaths from diarrhoea secondary to some other well-defined disease should be included under the latter. 42 INQUESTS AND DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE.

So far as Grosvenor Buildings are concerned, 7 Dispensary medical orders, and 11 orders for the Medical Officer to see patients at their own homes were issued. There were also on the permanent medical relief list 10 persons residing in the Buildings who were entitled to apply for medical attendance at any time.

The sanitary arrangements of the board and private schools were inspected. It was very essential at the time of the year when 45 typhoid fever was likely to prevail that the latrines and urinals of such institutions should be overhauled. The sanitary arrangements of the board schools were on the whole found to be in a tair condition, but those of the Church schools in some instances were far from satisfactory. At the Aberdeen Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health, Professor Hamilton, in his address on the "Dangers of Spreading Disease," stated :— "Schools and Public Places. "With all the improvements which have taken place in the construction of Board schools, I am of opinion that they are still lacking in one particular, and that a most important one, namely, in facilities for frequently cleansing the walls and flooring. My own conviction is that schools ought to be waterproof compartments, as it were, the walls tiled or covered with waterproof cement, the roof and flooring similarly waterproof, and that every schoolroom ought to be hosed or otherwise cleansed at least once a week, that spitting on the floors should be forbidden, and that schoolmasters ought to be specially instructed in the dangers accruing to the practice. The interior of a schoolroom, to my way of thinking, should be constructed on the type of a ship's deck, where impurities may be got rid of bv the free use of water and scrubbing. Ventilation, however good, will never remove the dust which clings to the walls and flooring of such an apartment; indeed in large towns it usually adds to it." Upon enquiry at the various schools in Poplar and Bromley, it was found that the walls and ceilings of the class rooms are cleansed and distempered once in four years, and the walls swept down three times a year. The Committee directed that the attention of the London School Board be called to the remarks of Professor Hamilton, and to the 46 necessity for the more frequent cleansing of the walls and ceilings of their schools. I had an interview with the Medical Officer of the London School Board, who stated that the walls of the schools are distempered every four years and the paint work washed, and every eight years the paint work is repainted. When class rooms are closed on account of the prevalence of infectious disease, the walls are brushed down and the woodwork washed, and the windows kept constantly open. I suggested to the Medical Officer of the London School Board that it would be better that the walls of class rooms should be painted instead of distempered, so that they could be easily and frequently cleansed by washing down with water. Of course, the question of painting the walls, like that of more frequent cleansing, is a matter of expense. I learnt also that during the three vacations the walls are brushed down, the dadoes washed, and the windows cleaned throughout. The class room floors are cleansed every three weeks, but the floors of the babies class rooms are washed every week Should the class rooms be used for "meetings," the floors are scrubbed afterwards if necessary. The windows within reach are cleaned as often as may be necessary. The wash-hand basins and sanitary arrangements are cleansed daily. Where cisterns exist they are cleansed once a year during the summer holidays. 47 The more frequent cleansing and emptying of cisterns can be dealt with under the Poplar Borough Council's bye-laws, which require cisterns "to be emptied and cleansed once at least in every six months, and at such other times as may be necessary to keep the same in a cleanly state and free from pollution." PLAGUE PRECAUTIONS : NOTICES FROM PORT SANITARY AUTHORITIES. A letter was received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board stating: "That the Superintendents of the Board's Ambulance Stations have received instructions to remove forthwith to the South Eastern Hospital any person duly certified to be suffering from plague.' This fact was communicated to the various practitioners in the parishes of Poplar and Bromley and the immediate neighbourhood. With the communication were enclosed copies of the papers forwarded to the medical practitioners in November of last year, viz. : (1) Letter re Plague in Portuguese Ports and other places. (2) Directions for obtaining and sending material from "pestis" for bacterioscopic examination. The medical practitioners were requested to com municate the fact forthwith to the Medical Officer should they remove a case of plague, otherwise than through the Council's offices, so that immediate disinfection might take place. On account of plague appearing to threaten England and Wales, the Local Government Board, on the 19th September, issued an "order" making plague a notifiable disease under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. A communication was also received from the Medical Officer of the London County Council that the Public Health Committee had authorised him to employ for clinical diagnosis tbe services of Mr. James Cantlie, M.B., F.R.C.S., formerly medical officer in one of the plague hospitals in Hong Kong. The Medical Officer of the Council asked that he might be 48 formed of any person in the district who might be suspected to be suffering from plague, and he stated that the Public Health Committee had authorised him to send to Dr. Klein for bacteriological examination, material from any such cases. In his letter he also stated with respect to the provision of refuges for the accommodation of persons who had been in contact or living with persons attacked by plague that the London County Council had in reply to a letter from the Local Government Board, informed the Board that the Council was prepared to provide such accommodation as is necessary. From the"London County Council there was also received a report upon the signs and symptoms of plague by James Cantlie, M.B., F.R.C.S., D.P.H., which report had been ordered by the Public Health Committee to be printed. The London County Council forwarded the report of the Public Health Committee upon "Precautions against Plague in London." From the Local Government Board there was received a General Memorandum on the Proceedings which are advisable in places attacked or threatened by epidemic disease. The Medical Officer of the Local Government Board also forwarded a Plague Memorandum upon (1) Administrative Considerations. (2) Symptoms of Plague. In his communication there were enclosed directions for obtaining and forwarding for bacterioscopic examination material from suspected plague cases. Upon the receipt of the above memorandum I sent to all the medical practitioners of the Poplar Borough a letter enclosing extracts from the Plague Memorandum of the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board. The symptoms of plague, for the information of the practitioners, were set out in full. 49 Notice had been received from the London Port Sanitary Authority that a passenger had arrived from Valencia by ss. "Cortes." He was found to be in fair health when visited. A notice was received from the London Port Sanitary Authority respecting a passenger coming to the Poplar district from Glasgow by the ss. "Dungeness." It was found upon enquiry at the address stated in the notice that the passenger had gone to reside at East Ham, and thereupon the Medical Officer of Health for that district was communicated with. A notice was received from the London Port Sanitary Authority respecting a passenger coming to the Poplar district in the ss. " Hadda," from Glasgow. The passenger arrived in good health. A notice was received from the Bristol Port Sanitary Authority that a passenger, from Smyrna by the ss. " Tremayne '' was coming into the Borough, but at the address given no such person was known. The London Port Sanitary Authority gave notice of a man from Glasgow coming to the parish of Bromley, the address given was his wife's, he did not go there, he went to Canning Town, but his actual residence could not be ascertained. The same Port Sanitary Authority gave notice of another passenger from Glasgow, he had to be traced as he did not go to the address given. Two passengers were notified from a ship on which a case of plague had occurred; one passenger was found at the address given, and kept under observation; the other passenger did not arrive at the address he gave, but a fellow passenger stated he had gone to Ireland. The night watchman (who lived in Poplar) of the ship was also kept under observation. A laundry was also daily visited in the parish of Bromley, where linen from the infected ship had been taken. C 50 I reiterate the remarks I made last year of the great danger to the public, and in fact to the world at large, through passengers not going to the addresses they state, and to seamen being able to tranship within the incubative period (10 days) after having been on a vessel where a plague case existed. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. On the 29th of March I reported to the Sanitary Committee as follows " With respect to houses let in lodgings. Certain streets were " selected, and under clause 5 of the bye-laws, the Clerk gave notice " to the landlords to supply the information necessary for the regis" tration of likely houses therein, the main object being to find out if " the rent or charge payable by each lodger would bring the premises " under the bye-laws. It will be remembered that the London County " Council, in a letter dated 1st July, 1898, asked what steps had been " taken for the enforcement of bye-laws relating to houses let in " lodgings. The letter, moreover, expressed the Council's view that " the rent of tenements, which exempts the houses in the district from " being subject to the bye-laws, is so low as to militate against " their usefulness, and suggested that the Board should consider the " desirability of amending the exempting clauses (see Medical " Officer's Report to the Sanitary Committee 8th September, 1898). " The exemption clauses of the bye-laws are : " 2. In either of the following cases a lodging-house shall be " exempt from the operation of these bye-laws; that is to " say: " (a) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and " exclusive of any charge for the use of such lodger of " any furniture, is at a rate of three shillings per week or " upwards. 51 "(b) Where the rent or charge payable by each lodger, and " inclusive of any charge for the use by such lodger of " any furniture, is at a rate of four shillings per week or " upwards. " The streets chosen were :—In the Parish of Bromley—Eastward " Street, Hawgood Street, and Bartlett Street. In the Parish of " Poplar—Gaselee Street, Stewarts Terrace, Charles Terrace, also " certain houses in Stebondale Street, Norfolk Street, and the West " Ferry Road , No. 30, Manchester Road was also included. The " replies from the landlords (within the meaning of the bye-laws) have " been tabulated as far as possible, there being difficulty as some of " the returns were not according to the form. It will be seen from " the tabulated statement that 4s. 6d. and 5s., also 5s. 6d. are the rents or charges for the most part payable for portions of houses, " and only in a few instances would any of the premises dealt with " come under the Board's bye-laws, with respect to houses let in " lodgings, by lodgers having to pay a rent or charge less than three " shillings per week." The replies and tabulated forms were submitted to the Committee, together with a statement of the rent limitation for exemption adopted . by other local authorities in London. The Committee recommended to the Board that, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, the following be substituted for the exemption clauses of the Board's bye-laws as to houses let in lodgings, viz.:—"A lodging-house shall be exempt from the operation of these bye-laws, until the landlord of such lodging-house shall have been required in pursuance of bye-law 5 to furnish the statement of particulars therein mentioned." In answer to their communication, the Committee at a subsequent meeting considered a letter from the Local Government Board stating their objections to the Board's proposed amended bye-law 52 relating to houses let in lodgings, and the Committee recommended that subject to approval by the Local Government Board, bye-law 5 be amended by the substitution of a rental of 10s. for 3s. in the case of unfurnished lodgings, and of 12s. 6d. for 4s. in the case of furnished lodgings, as the condition of exemption from the operation of the bye-laws. On the 27th of September the Local Government Board repealed the 3s. and 4s. bye-laws, and allowed 10s. and 12s. 6d. in their place. On the 23rd November I reported to the Public Health Committee as follows:— " A register and forms are also being prepared in respect of ' Houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family,' so that the bye-laws may be put into force without delay now that the Local Government Board have sanctioned the exemption clauses. By the gradual enforcement of these bye-laws overcrowding will be abated, and the efficient cleansing of premises brought about." By bringing houses under these bye-laws the Sanitary Inspectors will be able to enter at all times, and cleanliness in such premises will be better enforced. It is well known that Magistrates will not make orders upon landlords for cleansing premises, which would remain dirty unless documents are served upon the tenants, but under the bye-laws the person, whether he be a landlord or not, if he sub-let is bound to cleanse and lime-wash at stated times and as often as may be necessary. The Sanitary Inspector having power to enter such premises at all times " overcrowding " will also be better dealt with, as premises not under such bye-laws can only be entered between the hours of 6 am. and 9 p.m. 53 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. On the 22nd March, in the Board-room, H. T. Steward, Esq., on behalf of one of H.M. Principal Secretaries of State, held a public enquiry, upon oath, with respect to Burford's Court, Tucker's Court, Nelson Court, and certain adjoining premises, which had been officially represented to the London County Council by me as " unhealthy areas," under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890. In July, under Part I. section 5 (2) of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, I made a representation of two "unhealthy areas" in the parish of All Saints, Poplar. These areas I styled (1) Providence Place area, with 67 dwelling houses, and a population of 411; (2) King Street area, with 10 dwelling houses and a smithy, and a population of 49. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS, AND OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. Upon the invitation of the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, a meeting of the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health was held at the offices of the London County Council, and discussed the powers which are now being exercised by the Metropolitan Borough Councils for registering dairymen, and the enforcing of the bye-laws and regulations with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughter-houses, knackers yards, and offensive businesses. These bye laws and regulations were enforced by the London County Council, but are transferred under the London Government Act to the new Metropolitan Borough Councils. Under the London Government Act, 1899, section 6 (4): " It shall be the duty of each Borough Council to enforce within their borough bye-laws and regulations for the time being in force with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughter-houses, knackers' yards, and offensive businesses, and for the purpose of performing this duty, the Borough Council shall in all cases have the 54 same powers of entry as they have in the case of slaughter-houses and knackers' yards, and if the Council make default in performing this duty, the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, shall apply as if the default were a default under that Act." The second schedule, part I., of the same Act, transfers from the London County Council to the Metropolitan Borough Councils, the power under section 28 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of registering dairymen. A return obtained from the Medical Officer of the London County Council showed that the number of milk shops at the time were 109 in Poplar, and 159 in Bromley. A register was prepared and laid before the Public Health Committee. It was customary when a person wished to register as a dairyman or purveyor of milk, at the London County Council, to supply him with a copy of the regulations as to dairies, cow-sheds, and milk stores, so that there could be no excuse on his part that he did not know his obligations. The Committee directed that such a practice should be continued. The inspection of the dairies and milk shops of a district is a most important duty in order to secure the cleanliness of the fixtures and tables of milk stores, milk shops, and the utensils and vessels used for containing milk, so as to preserve the purity of the milk, which is such a staple article of diet. For the carrying out of the registration and inspection of the dairies and milk shops of the borough, the Committee directed that like forms should be adopted. The inspectors visited the registered milk shops and milk stores according to the list forwarded by the London County Council. With several premises which were on the register there was a change of ownership, and no steps had been taken by the milk sellers to have 55 their names registered; and at some premises the sale of milk had been discontinued. In their rounds the inspectors found shops where milk was sold and the milk sellers were not registered. BAKEHOUSES. During the year the bakehouses were twice inspected, and the notices as to limewhiting, &c., were served in those cases considered necessary. At the time of the last inspection there were in Poplar 37 premises used as bakehouses and 8 either unoccupied or not used ; in Bromley 49 used and 9 either unoccupied or not used. SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND COWHOUSES. The slaughterhouses and cowhouses in the parishes of Poplar and Bromley were inspected previous to the owners applying to the London County Council for the renewal of their licenses. When the London Government Act came into operation (the Metropolitan Borough Councils to enforce the bye-laws) a list of slaughterhouses and cowhouses was received from the London County Council as follows :— Slaughterhouses. Name of Licensee. Situation of Premises. Conditions. Woolven, Horace John 18, Bow Road Bretton, Frank 138, „ ... ... Small Cattle. Harvey, Edward William 218, Devons Road.

RE ARRANGEMENT OF SANITARY DIVISIONS. Upon the death of Mr. Raymond, the Committee considered the advisability of dividing the parishes of Poplar and Bromley into five divisions and not appointing another Inspector of Nuisances in Workshops and Factories for the whole district, but that each Inspector should undertake the duty within his division of seeing that the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and other Acts, including the Canal Boats Act, were enforced. It was resolved that the five divisions should be known as " North Bromley," " Central Bromley," " West Combined," "East Combined," " South Poplar," or the " Isle of Dogs." The areas of the various Sanitary divisions to be comprised within the following limits: bromley north division. The boundaries to be, on the West the Parish boundary ; on the North the Parish boundary to River Lea; on the East the Parish 57 boundary to the London Tilbury and Southend Railway, thence along the centre of the London Tilbury and Southend Railway to Devons Road, thence from the centre of Devons Road along the south side of Devons Road to the North London Railway, along the centre of the North London Railway to Limehouse Cut, and along the centre of the Limehouse Cut to the starting point. The whole of Devons Road to be included in this Division. bromley central division. The Western boundary to be the centre of the North London Railway from centre of Willis Street to the south side of Devons Road. The Northern boundary to commence at the North London Railway and follow the south side of Devons Road, and the centre of London Tilbury and Southend Railway to River Lea. The Eastern boundary to be the Parish boundary to the centre of Iron Bridge. The Southern boundary to commence at the centre of the Iron Bridge, and follow the centres of East India Dock Road, Abbott Road, Ettiick Street, Brunswick Road, Desart Street, St. Leonard's Road, and Willis Street to the starting point. west combined division. The Western boundary to start from the south side of the Limehouse entrance to the South West India Dock, and to continue northwards along the Parish boundaries to Limehouse Cut, thence along the centre of Limehouse Cut to North London Railway, then southward along the centres of the North London Railway and the Millwall Extension Railway to the southern boundary of the South West India Dock to the starting point. east combined division The Western boundary to commence at the Millwall Extension Railway at the southern boundary of the South West India Dock, and to proceed northwards along the centres of the said Railway, and the North London Railway, to the centre of Willis Street, 58 thence along the centres of Willis Street, St. Leonards Road, Desart Street, Brunswick Road, Ettrick Street, Abbott Road, and East India Dock Road, to the centre of the Iron Bridge. The Eastern and Southern boundaries to be the Parish boundaries as far as the south side of Blackwall entrance to South West India Dock, and thence along the boundary of South West India Dock to starting point. poplar south division. To comprise that portion of the Poplar Parish, south of the boundary of the South West India Dock. Whilst this Report is being written the Local Government Board have agreed to the above resolution and the Inspectors are to be as follow :— Bromley North Mr. F. J. Anthony. Bromley Central Mr. R. E. Miners. East Combined Mr. J. Bullock. Isle of Dogs, South Poplar Mr. C. Foad. Leaving the West Combined Division to the proposed additional Sanitary Inspector. Before sanctioning the above arrangement, the Local Government Board pointed out that a comparison of the staff of Sanitary Inspectors employed by the late Board of Works, with those in the service of other authorities in the Metropolis showed the average population was upwards of 21,000 in Poplar, whilst the Metropolitan average was about 17,300. Calculated on the Metropolitan average the number of Sanitary Inspectors in the Borough should be 10. The Local Government Board thought it desirable the staff should be increased, but agreed to the proposed arrangement upon the Council promising to consider the proposal to increase the staff in six months time. 59 SMOKE NUISANCE. As to the abatement of the smoke nuisance within the district, upon the Committee considering the matter, I presented the following report: - Smoke Consumption. " The smoke consumption in a district such as Poplar forms a very important item in conserving the health of the inhabitants, and there can be no doubt that the smoke consumption being watched by all the sanitary officers on their respective areas, the nuisance arising from the neglect of such consumption will be more quickly abated. " As explained to the Sanitary Committee at their last meeting great care will have to be observed before instituting legal proceedings for obtaining penalties in respect of smoke nuisances, as it must be ascertained at the time of the nuisance who is the person guilty— the master, under Section 23 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in not having proper appliances, or the servant, under Section 23 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for not using such appliances. Of course, the fuel used will have to be taken into consideration. Section 23 deals with smoke consumption as a specific offence, but Section 24 deems smoke to be a nuisance requiring the service of statutory documents, and the master is held to be responsible even if his servant be negligent." By Section 23 (5) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891 :— " It shall be the duty of every sanitary authority to enforce the provisions of this section and an information shall not be laid for the recovery of any fine under this section except under the direction of a sanitary authority." But by Section 24 of the same Act smoke nuisances. " Shall be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under this Act and the provisions of this Act relating to those nuisances shall apply accordingly." 6o CANAL BOATS AND OTHER VESSELS. The reports of the late Mr. Raymond show that during the year 1900 he had inspected the undermentioned Canal Boat- in the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley :— Date. Name of Vessel. Place. 1899. Dec. 23 Tiger Bromley Lock. 1900. Jan. 4 Champion River Lea. „ 6 Childs Limehouse Cut. „ 13 Irwell do. „ 15 Empress Bromley Lock. „ 18 Water Lily Cook's Wharf. „ 22 Ajax Bromley Lock. „ 27 Albert Limehouse Cut. „ 30 Climax do.

When the Committee were considering how the duties carried out by the late Mr. Raymond could be best executed, upon the question of the inspection of canal boats, I presented the following reports:— " Canal boats run through three out of the five divisions into which it is proposed to divide the parishes of Poplar and Bromley ; the water-courses take a round-about route, and in order to reach such ' boats ' upon the different banks of the water-courses, long circuitous journeys have to be made. The Medical Officer suggested that the inspection of these ' boats ' be carried out in the same way as the abatement of smoke nuisances, viz.: by the Inspectors on the ' spots, ' and that for these reasons the Inspectors of ' North Bromley,' 'Central Bromley,' and 'West Combined' divisions be Inspectors of ' canal boats,' and the Inspectors of the ' East Combined ' and 6i ' Isle of Dogs ' divisions be Deputy Inspectors, and the work of such inspection be carried out under the superintendence of the Medical Officer. " By this arrangement the money allowed for the duties of inspection of canal boats can be equally divided among the Inspectors and included in their respective salaries. " Should one of the Inspectors be appointed as an Inspector under the Canal Boats Act, then the Medical Officer feels that the inspection of the district of the particular Inspector would suffer if canal boats are to be properly and efficiently inspected, as an Inspector cannot be in two places at once, and moreover the appointing of each Sanitary Inspector as an authorised person under the Canal Boats Act, will help to bring about the inspections of any other ' vessels ' which may happen to be in the canal or river at the time, which in other words will be the inspection of non-registered vessels, a matter which has engaged the attention of the Board for some considerable time. ' The Canal Boats Act only deals with registered canal boats, and the officer appointed can only inspect such boats, whereas the Sanitary Inspector can deal under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section no, with any vessel. "'(1) For the purposes of this Act any vessel lying in any river or other water within the district of a sanitary authority shall (subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to the Port Sanitary Authority of the Port of London) be subject to the jurisdiction of that authority in the same manner as if it were a house within such district.' "' (2) The master of any such vessel shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the occupier of such vessel.' " By section 141 : 'The expression 'vessel' includes a boat and every description of vessel used in navigation.' " Therefore for the good working of these two Acts (the Canal Boats Act and the Public Health (London) Act) so that all vessels 62 should be better inspected, it is as well that the appointments should be made as suggested." Whilst this report is being written the Local Government Board have sanctioned each Sanitary Inspector to be an Inspector of canal boats, so that the Inspectors of the East Combined and South Poplar Divisions who have no canals in their districts will be able to carry out the Canal Boats Act when acting as Deputy Sanitary Inspectors in any of the areas. SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Where w.c, pans and traps had been fixed without notice to the Clerk, under clause 14 of the London County Council bye laws, section 39 (1) of the Public Healih (London) Act, 1891, the Committee, in every case brought under their notice, directed that the builder be written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise he would be prosecuted for infringing the bye-law. During the year 17 cases were brought under the notice of the Committee. In four instances, after the ground had been opened, the drains were found defective. Under section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, certificates were authorised to be signed that there were proper and sufficient water supplies at the following newly-erected premises :— 300 and 302 Devons Road; Girls' Club, Follett Street; 1 and 2 Cottage Street (west side); Newly erected cottage (Messrs. Locke, Lancaster & Co., West Ferry Road); Blakeney's Head (P H.) High Street; premises St. Andrew's Wharf, Millwall ; five houses Canton Street; 31 Byron Street (three-storied flat); 80 and 82 Mellish Street; 248 and 250 Brunswick Road.

On the 5th May, whilst inspecting the shops and stalls in Chrisp Street, my attention was drawn to a man selling preserved bananas at id. per bag, from a barrow. I had two bags purchased, and on examining them found them unfit for food of man. I then told the vendor it was my intention to seize them and have them condemned by a magistrate, which was accordingly done ; there were 40 bags and 3 boxes. I invited the vendor to be in attendance at the Police Court on the 7th inst., and he appeared on that date. Mr. Mead, the presiding magistrate, made an order for the bananas to be destroyed, and granted a summons which was heard on the 6th of June, when defendant was fined £2 and 2s. costs. Since the death of the Inspector of Nuisances in manufactories, bakehouses, &c., the whole of the bakehouses in my district have been inspected. Intimations and notices were served where cleansing was required and sanitary defects existed, and in each case the work was executed. Smoke Nuisances from Factories, &c. In every instance where a nuisance has occurred, either on complaint or from personal observation, notices have been served and the nuisances abated for the time being. The whole of the schools in my district have been inspected and where cleansing was required and sanitary defects existed, notices were served and the nuisances abated. 75 Periodical inspections have been made of the premises where milk is sold, and in no instance have the utensils been found to be other than clean. The slaughterhouses and cowhouses have been inspected, and where necessary works were executed, and cleansing, &c. carried out. The licensed slaughterhouses number 5. „ „ cowhouses „ 3. In every case where new w.c. soil pans and traps have been found to be fixed without giving notices in writing to the Clerk of the Board (Infringement of London County Councils Bye-laws), letters were sent to the respective owners ordering them to expose the joints under the pans and traps. This in each case was done, the drain tested with either smoke or chemical test, and in very few instances was the work proved to be defective. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Poplar, North Division. 76 To the Medical Officer of Health, December 31 st, 1900. I beg to submit to you my Annual Report of the sanitary work executed in the south division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December 1900.

In addition to the above, 938 complaints of nuisances and 341 notifications of infectious diseases have been received, and dealt with making a total of 1,633 primary inspections, while 4145 reinspections were made during the year. Of the total of primary inspections, 551 premises were found to be in a fair condition, and 66 per cent, required various works of sanitary improvements. 191 drains were proved defective by the smoke or chemical tests, and in 866 instances the applications of these tests revealed no defects.

Where practicable the water test has been applied to all new drain work. In 34 instances plans were submitted in accordance with the Council's drain regulations. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and in pursuance of the orders of authorization of the late Board of Works, the owner of 117, East Ferry Road was summoned to appear at the Thames Police Court on the 18th of October last and agreed to a 14 days abatement order and to pay 30s. costs, with respect to the defective combined main drain on the said premises. 53 samples of food and drugs have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst; of that number 2 were so much adulterated that it was necessary to take legal proceedings against the respective vendors. The extent of the adulteration, and the result of the prosecutions were as follows :— 79 Butter ... Adulterated with 81.6 per cent, of foreign fat. Vendor fined £10. Milk ... Adulterated with 13 per cent, of water (previous viction). Vendor fined £18 and £,2 2s. costs. By your direction special inspections were made of the bakehouses and schools in my district, which necessitated the service of several notices with the result that various sanitary improvements were executed. The results of these inspections were reported in detail to the Sanitary Committee. Four notices of intention to apply lor renewal of slaughterhouse and cowhouse licenses were received from my district. The premises were forthwith inspected, but in no case was it necessary to serve a notice. The shops, food stores, and stalls have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting diseased and unwholesome food, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Assoc. San. Inst. Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, Poplar South Division. 8o December 31st, 1900. To the Medical Officer of Health. Poplar and Bromley.

By your directions I have obtained 55 samples of food and drugs for analysis. Legal proceedings were instituted against four vendors and convictions were obtained, the penalties inflicted by the presiding magistrates varying from £4 to £6 3s. The nature of articles, extent of adulteration, and results of policecourt proceedings were as follows : Milk Adulterated with 9 per cent, of water, deficient in 83 cream to the extent of 48 per cent. Vendor fined £5 and £1 3s. costs. Butter ... Adulerated with 78 percent, of foreign fat. Vendor fined £4. Butter ... Adulterated with 47.6 per cent, of foreign fat. Vendor fined £4. Milk ... Adulterated with 30 per cent of water. Vendor find £4. Limewater ... From which 26 per cent, of lime had been extracted. The magistrate (Mr. Mead) held that there was no evidence that the Defendant had abstracted any lime and dismissed the summons. Under the Public Health (London) Act 1891, police-court legal proceedings had been taken against the owners of the undermentioned premises for disobeying the Board's notices with the following results :— Powis Road, 4. Fourteen days abatement order with £4 and 15s. cost. On the night of the 17th July I seized 160 tins of condensed milk from a provision shop in Devons Road, Bromley. The tins were all blown, showing that the contents were bad. The magistrate made the condemnation order on the next day. The owner agreed that 50 tins of milk which were springy should be destroyed as trade refuse. It was hoped that the firm who had supplied the shop, keeper could be prosecuted under section 47 (3) of the Public Health (London) Act for selling such condensed milk, but the shopkeeper had written to the firm informing them of the condition of the articles supplied, and as the firm had taken no notice the shopkeeper slated the articles seized were put on one side and were not exposed for sale, or deposited in any place for the purpose of sale, or preparation for sale, therefore under these circumstances it would appear that as the law at present stands a summons would not hold good against the person who supplied the shopkeeper. 84 Also in company with the Medical Officer of Health on the 7th July, I visited a yard adjoining the Childe Harold P.H. in Railway Street, and saw four quarters of beef on a costermonger's barrow. The beef had been deposited on the previous day. The meat was not bad enough to seize but would not keep for any length of time, and as the men in whose possession the meat was found stated that it was going into the Limehouse district, the Medical Officer of Health for that district was communicated with. The markets and stalls have been inspected throughout the year with a view of detecting diseased and unwholesome food, and only in three instances has there been occasion to interfere. Bakehouses. I have also inspected the whole of the bakehouses in my district, and the notices as to defective drains and lime-whiting were served and the nuisances abated. Cow and Slaughter-houses. I have made periodical inspections throughout the year of the above houses. The licensed cow-houses number 3 The licensed slaughter-houses 4 I have made inspections of the under-mentioned schools :— Marner Street, High Street, Old Palace, Knapp Road, Bromley National, Wesleyan, Tidey Street, Priory Street, St. Agnes, R.C I am Sir, Your obedient Servant, FREDK.

I have on several occasions, on tradesmen's F 90 application, examined the articles of food purchased by them at the markets and when found to be unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for food, I saw the same destroyed and dealt with as trade refuse, and have given the necessary certificates to that effect, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visit in such a condition as to justify a seizure. Four notices of intention to apply for renewal of slaughter-house and cow-house licenses were received from my district. The premises have again been inspected, and where necessary various works have been executed on the service of written " intimations " and notices. Since the death of Mr. C. W. Raymond, Inspector of Manufactories, I have by your direction made the periodical inspection of the 31 bakehouses in my district, also dealt with complaints which related to defective drainage, smoke and other nuisances at the several factories. The necessary cleansing of the whole of the bakehouses, and other works o sanitary repair, have been carried out, and precautions taken for the abatement of nuisances complained of in compliance with notices served. I have corrected the register of dairies, milk shops and milk purveyors (92); those found to be non-licensed have since signed forms of application in compliance with your instructions. No other infringement of the bye-laws has been discovered by me. Of the 5 Board Schools, 2 private schools, and 1 church school inspected as directed, it was only found necessary in the last-mentioned case to serve an " intimation " and notice for the nuisances found to exist to be abated. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. ^IJ,, * Bromley, South Division. *

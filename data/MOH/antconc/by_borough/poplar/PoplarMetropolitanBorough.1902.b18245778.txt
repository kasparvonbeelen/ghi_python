ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with "The Sanitary Officer's (London) Order 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my tenth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1902* and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Assistant Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by Members of more than one Family. VITAL STATISTICS- The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1902, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 169,084:— Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,579,110 58,841 68,082 42,161 * The year 1902 for registration purposes covered a period of 53 weeks, and ended on the 3rd January, 1903. 2 being 63.5 (see footnote) inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 72.66 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 54.6 per acre in Poplar parish, 112-5 in Bromley, and 75.9 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1902. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Parish of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three parishes might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. The births during the 53 weeks were:— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 1026 1009 2035 Bromley 1230 1237 2467 Bow 726 662 1388 Totals 2982 2908 5890 Of these births 64 were illegitimate in Poplar, 35 males and 29 females. In Bromley there were 38 illegitimate births, 22 males and 16 females. In Bow there were 5 illegitimate births, 1 male and 4 females, making a total of 107 in the Borough. Of the 2035 births registered in Poplar, 60 occurred in the Poplar Union Workhouse, and of the 2467 registered in Bromley, *These figures are calculated upon the acreage of the district including the water area, but exelusive of area covered by water they are:—93.46 par acre for the Borough of Poplar, 100.01 for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley combined, and 78.07 for Bow. County of London 63.5 (no account being taken of tidal water and foreshore). 3 7 occurred in the Sick Asylum and 25 in the Stepney Union Workhouse, 2 in the City of London Union Infirmary, and 2 in the Poplar Hospital. The annual birth rate per 1000 living being:— Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

Treating the 1901 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 821 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 212 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1292. From the 542 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 33 non-residents and added 275 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 784 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III. that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, that certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 3393 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 564 deaths of actual non-residents and 495 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 3324, upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1248 deaths in Poplar included 4 illegitimate children, 2 male and 2 female; the 1292 deaths in Bromley included 8 illegitimate children, 5 male and 3 female; the 784 Bow deaths included 8 illegitimate children, 0 male and 8 female, making a total for the Borough of 20 deaths of illegitimate children. Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 650 598 1248 Bromley 680 612 1292 Bow 425 359 784 Totals 1755 1569 3324 5 The excess of births was as follows:— Males. Females. Total Gain. Poplar 376 411 787 Bromley 550 625 1175 Bow 301 303 604 Totals 1227 1339 2566 The male births in the Borough exceeded those of the female by 74, but the male deaths exceeded those of the female by 186 which makes a gain of 112 females. At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the year 1901 females also exceeded the males. The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 18 years:—(See page 2.) Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

Two cases of small-pox, two of chicken pox and one of scarlet fever were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected. For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 60. Fifty-six outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified! 12 in Poplar, 24 in Bromley, and 20 in Bow. The usual notices were given. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT.

During the Small-pox epidemic a claim was made in respect of shirts stated to have been damaged during disinfection to the extent of over £100. The Committee inspected a quantity of the shirts. and made enquiries into the allegations. The Committee repudiated liability in respect of the claim for 37 compensation for the shirts stated to have been damaged during disinfection. Proceedings were instituted against the Council at the Thames Police Court, and after two hearings the Magistrate dismissed the summons in respect of the claim of damage to the articles disinfected. The Magistrate held that no unnecessary damage had been done. A letter was received from the Medical Officer of the London County Council asking whether opportunity would be given to the keepers of Common Lodging Houses to free the bedding of their houses from vermin by passing it through the disinfecting oven of the Sanitary Authority. The Committee were informed that a similar request was made in June, 1897, and the reply from the then Committee was that such opportunities should be afforded to keepers of Common Lodging Houses, providing that no interference occurred in the ordinary disinfecting work of the district. The Committee agreed that the same facilities be given as before. A new boiler for the work of disinfection was fixed in the disinfecting house. It was fortunately ordered only just in time as the Dust Destructor had to be shut down for repairs. The question of affording more room for the work at the Disinfecting Station was considered by the Committee with the view of the possibility of an extension of the present plant being necessary at any time. The Surveyor submitted a plan and carried out the alterations and additions affording the necessary accommodation for an additional Disinfector should it be required. The Simplex Appliance Syndicate provided and fixed their Patent Smoke Preventing appliance to the boiler at the Disinfecting Station. 61,365 bottles of disinfectant and 99,250 bags of disinfectant were made up at the Hale Street Yard and distributed to the public from the various depots of the Council. 38 SHELTER. During the year, 1341 persons passed through the Council's Shelter in Yeo Street. SMALL-POX. In September, a "Special Report" was presented to the Council respecting the outbreak of Small-pox which had occurred within the Borough between the 21st September, 1901, and the 6th September, 1902. The "Special Report" gave statistics as to the staff and routine work, number of cases of Small-pox notified and isolated, number of cases removed to the Isolation Wharves of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, but returned home as not having Small-pox, the number of premises from which the cases were notified and the number of Chicken-pox patients notified between the 2nd February and the 6th September. The Report also stated the address, sex and age of each patient, and the date of the notification; date, sex, age, address, and particulars of death were supplied in every fatal case. The expenditure in detail was set out with regard to the maintenance of contacts in their Homes and at the Council's Shelters. A list was also given of Rooms, etc., cleansed and lime-whited by direct labour after cases of Small pox. The above information having already been afforded, there can be no need in this Report to repeat it. A Report in the form of " Remarks with charts of notifications and certain meteorological conditions" relating to Small-pox was also presented to the Council. During the year, 626 cases of Small-pox were notified in the Borough : 200 Poplar, 232 Bromley, and 194 in Bow. See Table XX. There were 30 deaths in Poplar, 30 in Bromley, and 33 in Bow, making a total of 93 deaths for the Borough. 39 The notification and death rates per 1000 of the population being:— Notification. Death.

The "order" took effect seven days after. The "order" had been duly approved by the Local Government Board. The London County Council extended the period of notification of Chicken-pox for six months from the 6th May, which was the date of the expiration of the first order. Upon the expiration of the second "order" the London County Council made the notification of Chicken-pox compulsory in the Administrative County of London for a further period of two calendar months from and including 7th November, 1902. The Committee recommended the Council to enter a strong protest against the further " order " of the London County Council requiring the notification of Chicken-pox for the additional period of two months. The Poplar Borough Council early in September had expressed the opinion that the London County Council's "order" making Chicken-pox a notifiable disease had had little or no result in bringing to light cases of Small-pox, and that apart from this (its primary object) it was not only useless but a cause of unnecessary expense to the ratepayers. Similar representations at the time were made by other borough councils. The arrangement of the 24th February, whereby certain medical men could be called in for the purposes of consultation with regard to doubtful cases of Small-pox, the London County Council paying their fee, was discontinued after 6th November. 41 A letter was received from the Guardians of Poplar Union, expressing regret that the general maintenance of Small-pox Contacts by the Council had been discontinued. The Guardians suggested that the Council should arrange with Medical Practitioners notifying cases, to employ a messenger to go to the Medical Officer of Health or Ambulance Station instead of allowing Contacts to travel on this business. The Committee directed that a circular letter be sent to the Medical Practitioners in the Borough requesting that they should notify Cases by telegram (the cost to be repaid by the Council) and forward their written notifications by post. The Committee expressed also disapproval of the practice of using relatives of patients or other contacts for such services. The Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Paddington directed attention to the proposals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board for establishing an alternative service of ambulances by road between London and Dartford, for conveyance of Small-pox patients, to meet possible interruption of river transport in case of fog or ice. It was pointed out that such a service would involve very heavy charges, the necessary plant, &c., having to be kept in a state of efficiency, and a considerable staff maintained to meet any emergency, while the long journey by road on the occasion of such fogs or exceptionally severe weather as might prevent river transport, would be injurious to the patients removed. The Paddington Council requested the Local Government Board to refuse their consent to the proposal, and asked the Metropolitan Asylums Board to reconsider their proposals. The Public Health Committee concurred with the Paddington Council. A letter was addressed by the Public Health Committee to the Metropolitan Asylums Board respecting the danger incurred by visitors to Small-pox patients. In reply the Metropolitan Asylums 42 Board stated "they have considered the suggestion of the Council that the visitation of patients at the Small pox hospitals should be prohibited. They do not feel that with regard to patients dangerously ill they can adopt such a proposal, and, if attempted, believe the effect of such prohibition would be to delay, if not prevent isolation. The Board have power to make re-vaccination a condition of visiting, but consider it would be unwise to exercise that power. The advisability of re-vaccination is urged by the Medical Officer in every case where a visitor is not already protected, and the names and addresses of all visitors forwarded to the Medical Officer of the district in which they reside. The Board do not feel that any increase in the stringency of the existing regulations is necessary." Mr. Hitchins, the Vaccination Officer, has kindly furnished me with the following statistics, which are copied from those forwarded to the Local Government Board :— 1900 —January to June.

The Poplar Council had already passed a resolution advocating the proposed transfer. The Bermondsey Borough Council wrote suggesting that, in addition to the transfer to the Borough Councils of the powers and 44 duties under the Vaccination Acts, such legislation should provide that all registered Medical Practitioners residing or practising in the Metropolis should act as Public Vaccinators at a uniform fee of 2s. 6d. for each successful case of vaccination or re-vaccination, such fees to be paid by the Borough Councils, and repaid to such Councils from a common fund, either by the London County Council, or the Metropolitan Asylums Board, in the same manner as fees for notifications of infectious diseases under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are spread over the whole County. The Committee endorsed the view expressed by the Bermondsey Council. The Prime Minister, in reply to a question, stated (on the 4th March) that the President of the Local Government Board proposed to renew the Act for a year, and to defer any further legislation to a later Session. The Cost of the Small-pox Epidemic.—A report of the Finance Committee of the Asylums Board lately issued, deals with the cost to the ratepayers of the epidemic of small-pox in 1901-2, for additional hospital accommodation and transport. The estimated total expenditure on the Long Reach Hospital (300 beds) is £61,600, on the Orchard Hospital, £130,676: total, £192,276; this being irrespective of expenditure on the adjacent permanent hospital at Joyce Green. On the Gore Farm Hospitals the expenditure was nearly £232,500; viz., on the "Upper" hospital (for "additional buildings"), £56,183; and on the new "Lower" hospital, £176,288. These two hospitals, which the Council desired to see utilised for the isolation and treatment of persons suffering from consumption, are now lying empty and have been disused for some months. In 1902, the Managers estimated an expenditure in connection with small-pox accommodation and transport of £400,000. This estimate has been exceeded by upwards of £91,000. In addition to these sums, a large amount expended in furnishing and equipping the various buildings has been charged to the current account. 45 SCARLET FEVER.

MUMPS. Owing to the prevalence of Mumps in the Infants' Department of the Byron and Bright Street School, the Medical Officer of the School Board for London advised the closure of Standard la. for a period of three weeks. The Class-rooms A and B of the Infants' Department of the Fairfield Road Board School, and the Class-room D of the Infants' Department, Culloden Street Board School were also closed for a period of three weeks owing to the prevalence of Mumps. With regard to the prevalence of Mumps in Board Schools in the Borough, the offer to disinfect the Schools was declined by the Medical Officer of the School Board for London, as unnecessary, but the Committee were of opinion that in all cases of infectious diseases—whether notifiable or not—occurring in the Schools, the Council's Officers should be allowed to disinfect the premises, and a representation to this effect was made to the School Board for London. 54 DIARRHŒA.* Deaths from diarrhoea for the past ten years were as follows:— Poplar.

So far as Grosvenor Buildings are concerned, 16 Dispensary medical orders, and 23 orders for the Medical Officer to see patients at their own homes were issued. There were also on the permanent medical relief list 21 persons residing in the Buildings who were entitled to apply for medical attendance at any time. The following figures are number of parish medical orders issued during the respective years:— Hanbury Buildings. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. 1902 22 30 11 18 11 5 5 8 Grosvenor Buildings. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. 1902. 77 103 65 48 46 27 28 19 60 60 NOTICES FROM PORT SANITARY AUTHORITIES.

The men were kept under observation. Notice was received from the Port of London Sanitary Authority of eight passengers coming into the Poplar district by the ship s.s. " Minnehaha," from New York. A Small Pox patient was landed from the vessel. The passenger was taken ill on the 2nd January, and removed on the 7th January. Two of these passengers were not admitted at the address given. Two passengers were notified by the s.s. "Anglian," from Boston, United States, as coming to the Poplar district. Two cases of Small Pox were on the vessel from 2nd January to Saturday, 4th January; one man went to the Stepney district, and the other man was believed to have sailed with the ship again on the 11th January. From the Port Sanitary Authority of Bristol, notice was received of a passenger coming from s.s. "Mammon," from Portland, Maine, into the Poplar parish. He was kept under observation.

Three cases of Small Pox and one of Scarlet Fever had occurred on the vessel. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The temporary appointment of Mr. Langley as Assistant Sanitary Inspector, terminated on the 15th October and he was re-appointed for a further period of twelve months. Mr. Langley is specially engaged for work in connection with the enforcement of bye-laws relating to Houses let in Lodgings (see Report, page 146). During the month of April Mr. Langley called upon landlords to carry out the provisions of the 15th Clause of the Bye-laws for houses let in lodgings. This Clause states that " the landlord of a E 62 lodging house shall in the first week in the month of April in every year cause every part of the premises to be cleansed, etc.' In many instances the work was not complied with, and Mr. Langley asked for authority to take out summonses for non-compliance. On July 5th, four summonses were taken out at the Thames Police Court, against the landlord of the houses Nos. 6, 16, 18, and 20 Box Street, Bromley, for allowing his registered houses to remain in a filthy condition after notice had been served on him. Penalties £1, and costs 23s., were obtained in each case. I asked the Committee to consider an amendment of the ByeLaws: Instead of the premises being cleansed once every year, they should be cleansed twice every year; I suggested the Bye-Laws should be amended, so that Lodging-houses shall be cleansed in the first weeks of the months of April and November. The Committee considered the suggestion that the Bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings should be amended by requiring such premises to be cleansed twice a year instead of once as now, I advised that in view of the class of property which is registered under the Bye-laws, and the constant changes of tenants it is desirable such further powers of enforcing cleanliness should be obtained. The Committee recommended to the Council as follows:— That, subject to confirmation by the Local Government Board, Clause 15 of Council's Bye-laws be amended by adding after the words "in the month of April" the words "and November." The Council agreed to the recommendation and the following letter was received from the Local Government Board. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 5th August, 1902. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 10th ultimo, relative to the proposal of the Council of 63 the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar to amend the Bye-laws in force in the Borough with respect to Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and to state that the Board have given consideration to the proposal. The Board direct me to observe that the usual period prescribed by local authorities for cleansing and limewashing houses let in lodgings is once a year, and having regard to the extension in the operation of the Bye-laws in force effected by the series confirmed by the Board in 1900, the Board would, before further considering the present application, be glad to be informed of the reasons which led the Council to regard the proposed requirement as necessary and whether those reasons apply equally to every class of lodgings to which the existing series relate. The Board also wish to be informed whether in the opinion of the Council there is any ground for apprehending that the enforcement of such a requirement as is proposed would tend to an appreciable increase in the rents of houses let in lodgings. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. C. MONRO, Assistant Secretary. The Committee informed the Local Government Board the Amendment of the Bye-laws is intended especially to meet cases of property where tenants and owners are constantly changing, that the reasons for the proposed amendment apply only in the case of the worst class of property in the Borough, and that there is no reason to anticipate any appreciable increase in rents in consequence of the proposed amendment. The London County Council submitted the opinion of Mr. Cripps, K.C., that section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to Bye-laws as to houses let in lodgings, is imperative, and e 2 64 that there is no power to exempt from the operation of bye-laws for the registration of lodging houses any houses so occupied as to come within the lodging house definition. The Poplar Borough Council's Bye-laws contain a clause exempting from the operation of the Bye-laws lodging houses where the rents for each lodging (if furnished) is 12s., or if unfurnished 10s., per week or upwards. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS. The Secretary of State appointed Mr. H. T. Steward to hold the local enquiry under the Housing of the Working Classes Act with reference to Providence Place Area, which is being dealt with by the London County Council, under Part I. of the Act. The enquiry was held at the Council Offices on Friday, 11th April, at 11 o'clock. I attended and gave evidence on behalf of the London County Council. The Committee viewed King Street Area, comprising 10 dwelling houses in King Street, Eagle Place and Prospect Place, and a smithy in King Street, and were of opinion that the area should be dealt with under the Housing of the Working Classes Act as an unhealthy area. King Street area was represented to the London County Council, in conjunction with Providence Place area, in July, 1900, by me, and the London County Council were urged by the Poplar Board of Works to include the two areas in a Scheme under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. The London County Council agreed to deal with Providence Place area, but the Housing Committee were not prepared to recommend the Council to include King Street area as suggested, but considered so small an area should be dealt with by the Borough Council, and subsequently they advised that the area should not be 65 dealt with by a Scheme, but that Closing Orders be obtained ; and they offered to reserve tenements in their Ann Street dwellings for the persons displaced. I expressed to the Committee my opinion that if Closing Orders were obtained under the Public Health (London) Act 1891, the property would probably be patched up sufficiently for the Orders to be cancelled and the dwellings re-let without any permanent inprovement being effected, with the result that the area would have to be subsequently dealt with under a Housing Scheme at a larger cost. The Committee considered the London County Council to have the necessary machinery for preparing and carryingoutSchemes under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, and whether the costs be ultimately thrown upon the Borough Council or not, they were of opinion the work should be undertaken by the London County Council, and the cost should also be met by them. The Committee recommended the Council— That a further representation be made to the London County Council indicating the inability of this Council to deal with King Street Area, and requesting them to take such action as may be possible; and that the representatives of the Borough on the London County Council be asked to support such representation. Whilst this report is being written I represented to the Council as "Unhealthy Dwelling Houses" under Part II. the three premises in Eagle Place and the four in Prospect Place. A Scheme could not be very well made as the vacant land included in the original representation was being used for business purposes. I directed the attention of the Committee to the condition of Burford's Court, which is being dealt with under the Housing of the Working Classes Act by the London County Council. The houses are totally unfit for habitation. The Committee recommended— That the attention of the London County Council be directed to 66 the matter, and they be urged to arrange for the immediate removal of the occupants of the houses. The Committee considered a communication from the London County Council with reference to the Bridge Road Area, which stated the Housing of the Working Classes Committee do not consider the area to be one which can properly be dealt with under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and that in view of the condition of Arnolds Buildings, which are comprised in the area, they are taking steps to obtain the demolition of those buildings as a neglected structure. With regard to the remaining houses comprised in the area, the Committee were of opinion they should be dealt with by the Borough Council under Part II. of the Act. A letter was also received from the Home Office stating that the London County Council had submitted a resolution that the area is not of general importance to the County, and should be dealt with under Part II., and requested that Mr. Ritchie be favoured with the Borough Council's observations on the question whether he should appoint an Arbitrator under Section 73 of the Act to decide how the area shall be dealt with. Section 73 enables the Secretary of State to appoint an Arbitrator to hold a local enquiry and report whether the case is wholly or partially of any and what importance to the County, with power to report that, in the event of the area being dealt with under Part II., the London County Council should contribute to the cost. The Home Secretary would thereupon decide whether the case should be dealt with under Part I. by the County Council, or under Part II. by the Borough Council, subject to a contribution from the County Council if so decided. The Committee considered my representation which deals with a complete area, of which Arnolds Buildings form the chief part, and if these buildings are dealt with in some other way the whole of the conditions connected with the area are totally changed. The Committee did not see that any useful purpose would be 67 served by the appointment of an Arbitartor as suggested, and were o opinion the representation should be considered as a whole, and that responsibility for dealing with the area ought not to be thrown upon the Borough Council by excluding the greater part of the area represented. The Council concurred in this view, and directed that the Home Secretary and the London County Council be so informed. The Home Secretary in reply stated he was informed that plans, etc., had been prepared and tenders invited by the Limehouse and Poplar Workmen's Homes, Ltd., for conversion of Arnolds Buildings into workmen's homes on the Rowton House principle, and that under these circumstan?es the London County Council could not obtain an order for the demolition of the buildings as neglected structures, and that it seemed clear the remainder of the area was too small to be dealt with under Part I. of the Act. As the Committee were informed that the contemplated conversion of Arnolds Buildings had fallen through they recommended— That the London County Council be again urged to deal with the Bridge Road Area as represented by the Medical Officer of Health, under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act; and the facts also submitted by the Home Secretary. CANAL BOATS- During the year 43 registered canal boats and 59 non-registered canal boats were inspected, viz.: Registered Non-registered. By Mr. Johnson, West Combined Division 11 0 Mr. Anthony, Bromley North Division 0 12 Mr. Miners, Bromley Central Division 1 23 Mr. Field, Bow East Division 27 18 Mr. Boyce, Bow West Division 4 6 43 59 68 Mr. Johnson reports that he found the certificate of the boat "Thames" No. 992 to be much torn and dirty; a letter was sent to the owners, Clayton and Sons; also the barge "Stort" No. 285, fore cabin dirty and dilapidated ; an intimation was sent to owner. Mr. Field reported that one boat was wrongly numbered and the master stated he was waiting for the meeting of the Urban District Council to obtain a certificate; this was remedied. He also reported one barge was leaky, allowing water to run into cabin; letters were sent to owners and registration authorities. BAKEHOUSES. The whole of the bakehouses were inspected twice during the year by the Sanitary Inspectors and once by myself. A letter was received from the Secretary of the National Association of Master Bakers and Confectioners respecting the clauses under section 101 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. The Secretary stated it is perfectly clear that under clause 2, an underground bakehouse cannot be so used after January 1st, 1904, unless certified by the Council, but there is nothing in the Act to say when the certificate shall be applied for, nor is there any direction as to the meaning of the word "suitable." The Secretary said: "I shall therefore esteem it a favour if you will let me know whether your Council is taking any action to let the tenants of underground bakehouses know what your requirements are as to suitablity. Also I shall be glad to know if you are prepared to consider applications for certificates at the present time. My Association has no wish whatever to support bakehouses which are detrimental to the public health, but it would point out that any harsh application of section 101 will mean ruin to hundreds of hard-working tradesmen who may have underground bakehouses which are not perhaps perfect, but which, for all practical purposes, are suitable for the manufacture of bread with due regard to the public health." 69 The Committee was advised there was no reason why applications for certificates should not be considered prior to January 1st, 1904, and that every case should be dealt with on its own merits respecting the requirements which will make an underground bakehouse "suitable " before being certified by the Borough Council. There are 117 bakehouses in the Borough: 38 Poplar, 48 Bromley and 31 Bow. Of the 117 bakehouses 40 are "underground," 10 Poplar, 18 Bromley, and 12 Bow. The Committee directed that Bakers be informed that applications for certificates may be considered before January 1st, 1904. The sections relating to bakehouses of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, were printed and served upon the occupier of every underground bakehouse. At the time of writing this report the Sanitary Inspectors are measuring up the underground bakehouses, as to cubic space, light, ventilation, etc. Full details respecting the condition of the underground bakehouses will be presented to the Public Health Committee in due course. The particulars in regard to underground bakehouses, which will be presented to the Public Health Committee, will be as follows:— UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES. 1. Address: 2. Rental: 3. Name of occupier and period of occupation : 4. Name and address of owner: 5. Day or night work : 6. Height above surface of footway or ground adjoining : 7. Length: 8. Breadth : 9. Height: 70 10. Cubic space. 11. Structure and condition of walls: 12. Structure and condition of ceiling: 13. Structure and condition of floors : 14. Windows ; position and superficial area : 15. Light; (can the work be carried on without artificial light?): 16. Ventilation: 17. Position and condition of entrances : 18. Drain inlets: 19. W.C. (Situation, communication and condition); 20.

Number of ovens: 23. Arrangement for flour, potatoes, etc. 24. Arrangement for coal: 25. Arrangement for ashes: The following are the regulations which were recommended by the Committee, and approved by the Council on the 12th March, 1903 (a) The bakehouse shall have a minimum capacity clear of the oven of 1,500 cubic feet, and shall be in every part thereof at least 8 feet high, measured from the floor vertically to the ceiling. It should have at least 3 feet of its height above the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the bakehouse, unless provided with sufficient daylight area, or areas extending below the floor level, and directly communicating with the external air, into which a window, or windows of such underground bakehouse open. In case the floor area exceeds 300 square feet, the height shall be at least 8 feet 6 inches. 71 (b) The surface of the walls shall be smooth and impervious throughout so that the underground bakehouse is free from damp. Every wall of the bakehouse to be constructed with a proper damp course, and if in contact with the soil, must be effectually secured against dampness from that soil. Tiles are best for the portions of the wall, or walls immediately adjacent to the ovens, cement being liable to crack or flake with the heat. (c) The ceiling shall be properly constructed with smooth, even, and impervious material, so as to be impermeable to dust and damp, and durable, e.g., with (a) granite plaster, (b) parian cement, or (c) some other equally efficient material. Any opening into the floor above must be so covered as to prevent the entrance of dust. The floors shall be composed of Portland cement concrete, mixed in the proportion of 1 part of Portland cement to 6 parts of clean Thames ballast, at least 6 inches thick over the entire surface. The surface to be finished with a ¾ths inch layer of Portland cement and granite chippings to pass a ¼th inch gauge mixed in equal proportions, or with other jointless, hard, smooth and impervious paving to the satisfaction of the Authority, so that the underground bakehouse is free from damp. (d) Where possible floors of bakehouses should be laid to proper falls, and be drained by means of a suitable channel to a gulley over which, if practicable, a draw-off tap should be fixed, the gulley being properly dished and placed outside the bakehouse. No gulley shall be within the bakehouse. (e) Any drain or sewer under the bakehouse shall be constructed of gas and watertight pipes (with sound joints). No certificate will be granted for any bakehouse which is subject to floodings from drains or sewers. 72 (f) Water closets shall be outside, totally distinct from, and not communicating directly with, the underground bakehouse (if practicable in open yard and adjoining, connected by a covered way). Water closet accommodation shall be sufficient and suitable, and separate for the use of the two sexes if required. (g) Conveniences for personal ablution shall be provided in a suitable position, and shall include a water-tap and a sink or lavatory basin of an approved character. Note.—These conveniences shall be outside the bakehouse. (h) Provision shall be made for suitable means of access (other than by ladders) to the underground bakehouse in the form of convenient stairs adequately lighted and ventilated, with an external entrance if practicable. Any opening into the shop must be so covered as to prevent the entrance of dust. (i) All areas whether for lighting or draining the bakehouse must be constructed with white glazed bricks or glazed tiles. The lighting of a bakehouse may also be obtained in part by areas opening into the external air, glazed with reflecting prisms, the walls of areas being built in white glazed bricks. No bakehouse will be considered suitable in which it is necessary at all times to illuminate artificially. An underground bakehouse should be provided with one or more windows, opening directly into the external air, or into an area, or areas, so as to be properly lighted by the admission of daylight, by means which shall exclude the entrance of all street or other dust; such windows should have a total area, clear of the sash frames, equal at least to one-eighth of the floor space of the bakehouse, and be so constructed that half at least of each window can be opened. The opening in each case to extend to the top of the window. (j) Ventilation shall be so arranged that the circulation of air is 73 confined to the underground bakehouse. An underground bakehouse shall be properly and effectually ventilated to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Authority by permanent inlets and outlets (other than the windows or staircase) of sufficient size and suitable character, communicating directly with the open air, but in such a way and at such a height above the street level (or ground adjoining) as to prevent as far as possible the entrance into the underground bakehouse of all street or other dust and dirt; the inlet and outlets to be of proper prescribed sizes, and, further, such openings shall not be under the control of the persons employed, and one of the outlets shall be situated in the ceiling over the oven door, if possible, so as to ensure ready extraction of foul air by the heat, the others at such a height as to deliver the air upwards without draughts so as to ensure a constant and equable temperature, say 60 degrees to 65 degrees Fahr., except within half an hour after a batch of bread has been drawn. The standard of ventilation should be such that the carbonic acid gas does not exceed 10 per 10,000 volumes while the work is going on. Note —Ventilation shall be adequate, that is to say, fresh clean air shall be supplied constantly during working hours, so as to provide not less than 3,000 cubic feet of air per hour for each person employed, with any additional amount required for the purposes of combustion, in such a manner as to avoid the occurrence of draughts, and so that the air is sufficiently renewed in all parts of the underground bakehouse. When natural ventilation is not effective or insufficient, ventilation by fans or other artificial means shall be provided so as to produce the above described result. Note.—Where mechanical power is used, the fresh air shall be taken from a height above the level of the adjoining ground of not less than 6 feet and be distributed to different parts of the underground bakehouse in such a manner as to change the air of such bakehouse in all parts. 74 Through ventilation will be insisted upon, and this is not to be obtained from the footway surface of the stallboard of a shop front unless at a height of at least 12 inches from the footway surface, and not even then, when ventilation can be had in any other way. The entering air should be taken from a pure and uncontaminated source (the mouth of inlet to be not less than 6 feet above level of ground). In all cases the air must enter without draught, and in some cases to ensure this, the air may be required to be warmed previous to entering the bakehouse. (k) Dough-troughs and all other furniture and fittings must be mounted on strong ball-bearing castors or wheels, or trestles, so as to be readily movable for cleansing purposes. (l) Provision is to be made for the proper storage of Hour, potatoes, salt, and all other constituents or ingredients used in the bakehouse, elsewhere than in the underground bakehouse itself. Such store places must be strictly and properly kept as the bake house itself. (m) Properly-covered receptacles shall be provided for the storage of all refuse matters, such receptacles to be kept outside the bakehouse, and to be emptied and cleansed once in every 24 hours. No refuse of any kind is to be stored within the bakehouse itself. (n) No animals to be kept in or allowed access to an underground bakehouse. (o) There shall not be in direct communication with the bakehouse, any coal or other cellar, washhouse, room, unpaved yard, or area, which may be a nuisance or cause contamination by foul air, dust, or dirt. (p) The water supply of the bakehouse should be drawn from the rising main and not from a storage cistern. 75 (q) The furnace in connection with the oven is to be provided with a sufficient outlet or flue to carry off any fumes generated in the process of baking. An outlet for heat or steam is to be provided immediately in front of the oven door. The outlet doors of the furnace and the oven doors to be close fitting. Where gas is used in the process of baking, efficient means of ventilation must be provided for carrying off any fumes generated. (r) Provision shall be made for depositing wearing apparel outside underground bakehouse. Before making any alterations with a view to meeting these requirements, the Owners or Occupiers of underground bakehouses shall submit to the Sanitary Authority a specification and plans of. the alterations which they purpose making. Non-compliance with the above requirement shall not necessarily mean that the Sanitary Authority will refuse a certificate, as each underground bakehouse must be dealt with, without prejudice, on its own individual merits. Any alteration to an underground bakehouse should be carried out under the superintendence of a competent advisor. Where a certificate has been granted by the Local Authority, it has been granted subject to be withdrawn, if all the utensils, furniture,. implements, and internal surfaces of an underground bakehouse are not at all times maintained in a cleanly condition, or should there be noncompliance with, or infringement of, any of the regulations under which the Local Authority granted the certificate. SLAUGHTER HOUSES AND COW-HOUSES. Notices were received from the occupiers of slaughter-houses and cow-houses within the Borough of their intention to apply to the London County Council for the renewal of licenses. These premises 76 were inspected, 20 slaughter-houses: 8 Poplar, 5 Bromley, and 7 Bow; and 17 cow-houses: 4 Poplar, 5 Bromley, and 8 Bow. A list of any outstanding defects was forwarded to the London County Council. The Licensing Committee met on the 27th October. No opposition was made by the Public Health Committee to the renewal of any license : POPLAR. SLAUGHTERHOUSES. Reg. No. Address.

At the end of the year there were in the Borough 437 registered premises where milk is sold, 145 Poplar, 183 Bromley, and 109 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see inspector's reports). 27 milkshops had been placed on the register during the years 12 Poplar, 12 Bromley, and 3 Bow. 32 premises were, on account, of change of owner, re-registered as milkshops, 3 Poplar, 24 Bromley, and 5 Bow. F 78 SMOKE NUISANCES. 292 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year—29 Bow East, 17 Bow West, 50 North Bromley, 5 Bromley Central, 13 East combined, 39 West combined, and 139 Poplar South. 80 intimations and 64 statutory notices were served. During the year seven summonses were taken out in respect of Smoke Nuisances. Penalties were inflicted in every instance with the exception of one, when the summons was dismissed on a technical point. See page 91 table of Police Court Proceedings. DRAINAGE AND SEWERS. The Committee considered the question of the drainage of Bridge Road between the dock entrances which discharged into Fletcher's Dry Dock and the Thames. Factories at this spot (employing sometimes 1,000 men) drained direct into the River Thames. The Public Health Department had called the attention of the Thames Conservancy to the condition of the foreshore. Notices to cease such discharge had been served by the Thames Conscrvancy. The Council adopted the scheme proposed by Mr. Heckford, the Borough Surveyor, for the drainage in question to pass into the system the London and India Dock Company were constructing for drainage at the docks. The sewage from the factory premises to be lifted automatically. The Council also adopted the scheme of Mr. Heckford, the Borough Surveyor, with respect to the reconstruction of the Eastern Section of the Isle of Dogs Sewers. The Borough Surveyor's report stated that: "The old sewers consist, for the greater part, of brick sewers of obsolete pattern, ill-designed for their purpose, having no regular gradients, while some of them are amongst the first sewers recorded in the register of the late Board of Works. 79 "The upper portions of the old sewers are also without sufficient fall, due to the fact that in the primary lengths the depths of the outfalls have been kept too high, evidently having been put in to serve the particular area then built upon without regard to the future growth of the district." Mr. Heckford's new system will be constructed upon recognised modern lines, having gradients giving self-cleansing velocities in every case. "The main outfall will be eggshaped, thus adapting itself to the "varying flow of sewage which obtains in a district such as that "concerned, and the size of this sewer will be sufficient for entry "throughout the whole length, thus doing away with the costly "methods of cleansing which have had to be adopted with the "present outfall. The subsidiary sewer will be of stone-ware pipes "with manholes at all junctions of streets, changes of direction or "gradient, etc., with the same idea, viz.: that of having "complete control over them without continually opening up the "roadways." In reply to complaints addressed to the London County Council by Mr. Heckford, the Borough Surveyor, and the Public Health Department with regard to emanations from the London County Council sewer in Cadogan Terrace, the Council stated they are taking steps to provide better means for a permanent ventilation of the sewer, and directions had been given that in the meantime the ventilators complained of shall be frequently and freely deodorised when necessary. The nuisance from the existing sewer gratings being considerable, The Committee recommended— That the London County Council be urged to proceed at once with the construction of the necessary ventilating shaft. F 2 80 THE MUD FIELD, EAST FERRY ROAD. The Committee viewed the mud-field, East Ferry Road, belonging to the Millwall Dock Company. The Committee were of opinion the complaints that the mud-field is a nuisance are fully justified, and that it may be detrimental to health. Upon the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, the Council decided to give notice to the Millwall Dock Company terminating the license for the pipes passing under the East Ferry Road from the Millwall Docks to the mud-field. FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The Board of Agriculture issued regulations under Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, providing that where the proportion of water in a sample of butter exceeds 16 per cent, it shall be presumed, for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved, that the butter is not genuine by reason of the excessive amount of water therein. These regulations came into operation on the fifteenth day of May, 1902. The Battersea Borough Council called attention to the conflicting decisions given in prosecutions under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, in consequence of there being no legal definitions or standards for the several articles of food sold as mixtures, and suggested that some definite limit should be fixed for the composition of such articles, or that the seller should be required to declare the proportions of the constituent parts thereof. They addressed the Local Government Board on the subject, pointing out that there is nothing in the Acts regulating the proportions of the constituents of articles sold as mixtures, and it is a matter of urgent necessity that steps be taken to enforce by legal enactment the recognition of such limits as the Board may see fit to determine. The Committee concurred with the Battersea Borough Council. 81 The Committee considered a circular letter from the Council of the City of Westminster referring to a case in which a Sanitary Inspector was instructed to obtain samples of milk at the place of delivery, under Section 3 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1879. Samples of milk consigned to places within the City were taken at the Railway Depot outside the City, and proceedings for adulteration followed. The summons was dismissed on the ground that Inspectors could not seize at the place of delivery unless such place of delivery was within the district for which they were appointed, and the decision was upheld on appeal. The Westminster City Council suggested that some plan of combined action should be agreed upon, whereby, at the request and expense of the Council of the Borough to which milk is consigned samples might be taken at the Railway Depots by the Inspectors of the Councils of the respective Boroughs in which such depots are situated. The proposed arrangement was approved of by the Committee. The results of the analyses of 369 samples were reported to the Committee during the year 1902. The samples being as follows :— Milk 147 Butter 89 Coffee 49 Mustard 21 Cocoa 25 Pepper 11 Vinegar 12 Cheese 4 Gin 3 Whisky 2 Sugar 1 Oatmeal 1 Lime water 1 Bread 2 Ground ginger 1 Total 369 82 Of these 369 samples 51 (13.8 per cent.) were found to be adulterated as follows:— Milk 31 Butter 10 Mustard 1 Vinegar 1 Sugar 1 Bread 2 Coffee 2 Cocoa 2 Lime water 1 51 In the 147 samples of milk, preservatives were found in 20 instances (13.6 per cent.) as under:— Formalin:—0.02 per cent., 0.02 per cent.

In the 89 samples of butter, preservatives were found in 25 instances (28.0 per cent.) as follows:— Carbonate of soda :—4.9 per cent., 0.21 per cent. Boric acid:—0.3 per cent., 0.38 per cent., 0.3 per cent, 0.39 per cent., 0.24 per cent., 0.3 per cent., 0.3 per cent., 0.1 per cent., 0.3 per cent., 0.2 per cent., 0.05 per cent., 0.15 per cent., 0.19 per cent., 0.3 per cent., 0.8 per cent., 0.22 per cent., 0.43 per cent., 0.3 per cent., 0.1 per cent., 0.4 per cent., 0.24 per cent., 0.44 per cent., 0.04 per cent.

"This Statute, which was introduced into the House of Lords by Lord Monkswell, provides for the first time by public enactment regulations for the burning of human remains. It also enables burial authorities to provide crematoria, in the same manner as they are enabled to provide cemeteries. Hitherto the practice of cremation, which gradually becoming less rare, has been subject only to the rules of the common Law, and crematoria (such as that near Woking) have been provided only by private bodies. Whatever penalties or liabilities may be incurred in connection with an improper cremation are specially reserved by the present Statute (Sect. 8)." This Act enacts that no crematorium shall be constructed nearer than 200 yards to any dwelling house, except by consent in writing of the owner, lessee and occupier of such house, nor within 50 yards of any public highway, nor in the consecrated part of the burial groutid of any burial authority. The regulations as to the maintenance and inspection of the crematoria and all details as to the burning of the body, the disposal of the ashes and a variety of details shall be made by the Secretary of State.

Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., Corner of Fairfield Road, May, 1903. 9 Public Health Department, December 31s/, 1902. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my thirteenth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending December 31st, 1902, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 561 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 340 Do. on house-to-house visitation 239 Do. Canal Boats 10 Re-inspections 2246 Making a total of 3396 Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the " Public Health (London) Act," 1891. Of the total number (1140 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that 47.7 per cent. of the premises thus inspected various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out—requiring the service of 539 written intimations, 425 statutory, and 75 final notices. In many of these cases on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 2 cases it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating attendance at the police-court to ensure enforcement.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you the Annual Summary of the Sanitary work and improvements carried out in the Bow East Division during the year ending December 31st, 1902. Inspections have been made as follows:— On notifications of infectious diseases 289 On complaints of nuisances 640 On house to house visitation 238 Re-inspections 2892 Total 4059 In 477 instances varied Sanitary improvements were necessary, requiring the service of 420 intimations, 127 authorised statutory notices, and the issuing of 1 Police Court summons, supplemented by 2892 re-inspections to secure proper compliance resulting in the following detailed works being executed :— Walls and ceilings of Houses cleaned throughout partially 23 61 Yards and areas paved 1 Yards and areas drained 19 Inlets to drains properly trapped 1 Defective drains repaired 102 Drains opened and cleansed 100 Sink waste pipes properly disconnected from drains 2 Rain water do. do. 3 Water laid on to soil pans of W.C.'s 52 New soil pans provided, where broken or unsuitable 20 Foul soil pans cleansed 23 Roof guttering and rainwater pipes repaired 61 Roofs made watertight 33 Water supplies to houses reinstated 23 102 Water service fittings repaired 6 Water services for domestic purposes altered or repaired 4 Ventilation of W.C.'s improved 3 Nuisances from dampness abated 60 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 30 Public house urinals cleansed and repaired 10 Bye-laws enforced 87 Overcrowding abated 4 Other nuisances remedied, chiefly dilapidations 174 Drains tested by the application of the smoke drain test, of which 23 per cent. were proved defective 438 Cisterns cleaned and covered 4 Inundations — Nuisances from the improper keeping of anima's 2 Dung receptacles provided or repaired 2 Water closets newly constructed 25 DRAINAGE CONSTRUCTIONS AND RECONSTRUCTIONS.

HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION. The house-to-house inspection comprised the whole of the houses in the under-mentioned streets, viz.:— Davey Road. Rothbury Buildings Beachy Road. Remus Road. Mitford Terrace. Kelday Road. Smeed Road. 105 And sections of:— Monier Road. Douro Street. Old Ford Road. High Street. SMALL POX. During the period from January 1st to June 6th, ninety-eight cases of Small-pox occurred within the Bow East Division. The whole of the patients were immediately removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the premises cleansed throughout by the disinfector. The contacts in most cases were confined within doors, and maintained and visited day by day, for purpose of maintenance, and to ascertain if further cases had occurred. On January 23rd, two cases of Small-pox in the Bow West Division were found to be employed at a large factory in the Bow East Division. The factory premises were at once visited, and names and addresses of the whole of the employees engaged in the same rooms, numbering 84, taken, and the Medical Officers of Health of the various districts in which they lived were notified. The employees, with only one or two exceptions, were re-vaccinated, and the work rooms disinfected. The contacts were prevented from going to work by notification to their employers, and were isolated within their own homes or shelter for about 14 days, being maintained and their rent paid by the Council. This arrangement, in the majority of the cases, worked very satisfactorily, and was undoubtedly a strong factor in the prevention of further dissemination of the disease, and if the system had been applied throughout the various Boroughs affected, the good effect must have been beyond expectation, as most of the cases notified in this district were found not to have been contracted within the Borough, unless by direct contact with cases occurring within their own homes. 106 Again, better results would probably have been effected if. by regulation or other provision, it was imperative that all contacts should remain within doors compulsorily, until proved, as far as possible, free from infection. Much extra duty was entailed in the carrying out of the scheme, for which, I believe, we were greatly rewarded by a minimization in the number of cases notified. BAKEHOUSES. The bakehouses throughout the district have been periodically visited, and the conditions in some instances necessitating service of intimation for dirty walls and flooring, accumulations of sweepings or ashes beneath the troughs, and the bi-annual cleansing not carried out at the stated periods. With two exceptions the bakehouses of the district are conducted on the ground level. These have been measured, and specially examined and reported upon, with a view to the enforcement of the New Regulations governing underground bakehouses, about to be put into force, for abolishing or regulating bakehouses situated 3 feet beneath surrounding ground levels. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS, AND OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. The milkshops, numbering 33 on the register, and offensive businesses in the district have been periodically visited; an intimation in the case of offensive business being sufficient to secure amendment. Two general shops were discovered during the year selling milk, but unregistered. In both instances the vendors stated they had registered at the London County Council previous to the duties of Milk Shop Inspection being transferred to the Borough Council, but they were not found on Copy of Register supplied from the London County Council. In five instances, milkshops have changed hands without the 107 incoming tenant registering, through ignorance of existence of regulations. On their attention being directed to infringement, they immediately registered. In three instances, attention has been drawn to rusty or broken condition of measures, resulting in the condition being forthwith remedied. The conditions of storage, vessels, and utensils generally has been very satisfactory. CANAL BOATS. Forty-five boats have been examined; of the registered boats, one only was found in an unsatisfactory condition, the boat being very leaky, admitting water into the cabin, and the master of one being without the required certificate. Of the unregistered barges, the cabins are totally unfitted for use as habitations, for which it is feared many of them are at times improperly used. The registered boats generally were found to be maintained in a cleanly and satisfactory condition, and usually carrying less persons than registered for. It is further noteworthy that the carrying of women and children must be steadily declining, as not one of the boats visited carried either women or children. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP INSPECTIONS. Nuisances arising within the several factories and workshops have been satisfactorily dealt with, and the new systems of drainage in the newly built and other factories have been subjected to severe water test before approval has been granted. SMOKE NUISANCES. The smoke nuisances arising within and without the district have received much attention. In the matter of smoke nuisances arising without the district little improvement is perceptible, but in two instances means have 108 been adopted which apparently have effectively prevented nuisances occurring within the district of the Borough Council. On December 10th, the summons issued by order of Committee against the Saw Mills Company, Ltd., Cook's Road, Stratford, for causing smoke nuisance within the Poplar Borough, was heard before the Stipendiary, and was dismissed without costs on a technical point raised by the magistrate that the notice and summons were not in order, but should have been issued under the Public Health Act, 1875. On the application of Mr. Young, solicitor on behalf of the Council, the magistrate said there was no need to state a case as he would hear any summons in future provided that proceedings should be instituted under the Public Health Act, 1875. Special notices have, therefore, been prepared, and are now served under the Public Health Act, 1875. FLOODING. On J uly 25th and 27th, 1901, very heavy rains were the cause of flooding in the low-lying portion of Hackney Wick, by which 71 houses and other premises in the district were rendered temporarily unfit for habitation. This part of the district seems to suffer on the occurrence of heavy rains, by which the houses are rendered very damp, the water passing beneath the flooring and allowed to soak away through the ground. It is satisfactory to report that, during the past year, no flooding has occurred. No unusual number of cases of infectious diseases have occurred at these premises during the past year. COW AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The cow and slaughter houses in the district have received attention throughout the year, and found satisfactory. 109 MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION. The food supplies within the district have been vigilantly watched. On March 18th, 42 tubs of butter were received by me at the soapworks within my division for conversion to soap. They had been contaminated aboard the s.s. "Hibernia," and condemned by the Port Sanitary Authority. On April 19th, 22 boxes of butter, ex s.s. "Oruba," condemned by the Port Sanitary Authority, were received at the same soapworks for conversion to soap. On April 25th, seven boxes of butter, ex s.s. "Iberian," were similarly received at the same premises. Half a barrel of haddock, several brawns, and one bunch of bananas, have been destroyed with the request and consent of the owners, and certificates provided in respect of same. On December 16th, advice was received by telegram that a vanload of meat was in the district, and was presumed to be unfit for food. On examination with the Medical Officer of Health, a body of beef and two carcases of sheep were found in the van. The meat was found to be apparently not affected by disease and not unfit for food, but the beef was very "plain," and the sheep rather flabby, and would probably have been prohibited from exhibition in the meat markets. COUNTY COUNCIL SEWERS. The ground level ventilators of the County Council sewers running through the district have been from time to time an intolerable nuisance, from the very powerful emanations of sewer gas in Old Ford Road, Cadogan Terrace, Wansbeck Road, and Smeed Road particularly. Representations were made to the L.C.C., and petitions forwarded from aggrieved persons. In the case of H 110 one of the openings in the Old Ford Road, one has been closed, and a ventilating shaft to the top of the Bow Church School substituted with success so far as smells in the streets are concerned, but there still remain other openings which must be a source of much danger to persons living in and using the thoroughfare. In the case of Smeed Road, the three openings have been closed to the advantage of those living or working within the neighbourhood, but no ventilating shaft has been provided. In this length of sewer, a serious explosion, causing upheaval of roadway, occurred during the past year. In the matter of Wansbeck Road and Cadogan Terrace, nothing has been done, the openings remain open, and emit very offensive emanations, and no shaft has been provided. FOOD AND DRUGS. Fifty-two varied samples of food or drugs have been obtained and submitted to the Public Analyst for analyses, of which five were certified to have been adulterated, in four instances convictions were obtained with costs, and in one instance the vendor cautioned. On January 17th, at Thames Police Court, defendant was fined 20s. and 23s. costs for selling milk deficient in cream, to extent of 10 per cent. On February 25th, at Thames Police Court, defendant was fined £2 and costs for selling butter adulterated with 76.4 per cent. of foreign fat. On July 30th, at Thames Police Court, defendant was fined £5 and 23s. costs for selling milk deficient in fat, to the extent of 11.6 per cent. On January 2nd, 1903, at Thames Police Court, defendant was fined 10s. and 23s. costs for selling milk deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 7 per cent. 111 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. In the Division, five houses have been placed on the register of houses let in lodgings: Beachy Road, No. 11, and High Street, Nos 47, 49, 51, 53.

To the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Poplar. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my Tenth Annual Report of the Sanitary work carried out in my district (Bromley, North Division) during the year 1902. 1,257 premises have been inspected, 641 in response to complaint of nuisances, 527 on account of notification of infectious diseases, the remaining being house to house inspection.

Sib, I beg to submit to you my (thirteenth) Annual Report of the Sanitary works executed for the abatement of nuisances which had existed in the Central Division of the parish of Bromley under the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar for the year ended December 31st, 1902. I have inspected 1284 premises, 719 in response to complaints of nuisances, 413 on account of infectious diseases notified, and 152 house-to-house inspections were made. Of the 1284 premises so dealt with, 275 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the remainder, 1009, nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated works of sanitary repairs (see Tabulated List), and 3937 re-inspections were made in the supervision of same. House-to-house visitations were carried out as follows:— Streets. Bartlett Street. Bromley Street. Bromley Cottages. Bromley Place. Chadbourn Street. Cross Street. Dunbar Cottages. Favonia Street. Mauve Street. Thomas Street. Sections of Streets. Abbott Road. Brunswick Road. Bright Street. Burcham Street. Cobden Street. Donald Street. Devas Street. Empson Street. Ettrick Street.

The drains of 298 premises were tested— by means of the smoke test (either with rockets or the machine)—104 drains were found to be defective (not gas-tight), and in the remaining 194 instances no defects were discovered. The water test, where practicable, had been applied to all now work. During the year ended, the drains of the undermentioned new and old premises had been constructed and reconstructed, and (where practicable) intercepted, ventilated, and furnished with means of access for cleansing purposes, in accordance with the London County Council's Drainage Bye-Laws.

Legal Proceedings Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health Committee and Council, it was necessary to apply for five summonses for disregarding statutory notices served. Bartlett Street, Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. "Closing orders" granted—premises unfit for human habitation; £1 5s. costs in the first three cases, and 4s. in each of the others, in all £4 3s. "Closing Orders Rescinded." I was summoned to attend the Thames Police Court on the 1st May and the 7th November, to show cause why the owners of the premises, Nos. 1a, 2, 3, and 4, Wellington Street, and Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, Bartlett Street should not be released from "Closing Orders" made, dated 19th April, 1901, and 8th May, 1902. The premises had been put in thorough habitable repair to your satisfaction. The costs, amounting to £2 18s. and £4 3s. respectively, had been paid. No objection was made and the orders were cancelled. Fifty-one samples of food have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst (Mr. W. C. Young) for analysis. Seven were found to be so much adulterated that legal proceedings were taken, the nature of articles, extent of adulteration, result of prosecution in each case being as. follows:— Butter.—"Adulterated with 81.9 of foreign fat, containing 0.01 per cent. of boric acid. Vendor fined £10 and £1 3s. costs." Milk (1).—"Deficient in cream to the extent of 21 percent and containing 0.01 per cent. of boric acid." 122 Milk (2).—"Deficient in cream to the extent of 26 per cent., and containing 0.02 per cent. of boric acid." Milk (3).—"Deficient in cream to the extent of 20 per cent., adulterated with 2 per cent. of added water." Summons against defendant in the second milk case, who was also dealer of the milk supplied to the purveyor and defendant in the first case. Dismissed, upon the result of the Somerset House Authorities' certificate and their analyst's evidence in support of same. Defendant allowed 3 guineas costs. Summonses in cases (1) and (3) against vendors, also at the Magistrate's suggestion upon the result of the Somerset House analysis, in the last named. Withdrawn. Milk.—"Deficient in fat, and solids not fat, to the extent of 11 and 7.9 per cent. respectively." Vendor fined £2 and £1 3s. costs. Milk.—"Deficient in solids not fat, and fat to the extent of 2.9 and 17 per cent. respectively." Vendor fined £10 and £3 3s. costs. Sugar (Demerara).—"Beet sugar, artificially coloured and not genuine Demerara sugar." Vendor fined 10s. and £1 3s. costs. I have inspected 18 non-registered barges, three registered sailing barges, and one registered canal-boat. The cabins were fairly clean, regulations complied with, and in the last case the papers produced satisfactory. Where a nuisance had occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney belonging to a factory, either on complaint or from my own personal observation, "intimations" and notices have been served, and the nuisances for the time being had been abated, in compliance with same. Where cases of small-pox had occurred in my district, and the families so afflicted had been isolated in accordance with the Committee's instructions, its spread had been greatly checked, for in the majority of cases the quarantine restrictions were faithfully 123 observed, and the constant supervision and immediate removal of each infected person had certainly protected others from coming into personal contact with them. I have on several occasions, upon different tradesmen's application, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found to be unsound, unwholesome, and " unfit for food of man," I saw the same destroyed and dealt with as trade refuse, and I have given certificates to that effect, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale or deposited for the purpose of or of preparation for sale, at the time of my visit, in such a condition as to justify seizure. I have by your direction made the periodical inspection of bakehouses, served " intimations," and, where required, notices for the necessary work of cleansing and sanitary repairs to be carried out. The cowshed at the rear of 27, Abbott Road, dairies, milkshops, and milk purveyor's shops have been periodically inspected and the register corrected. Those found to be non-registered through change of proprietorship had signed forms of application in compliance with your instructions, and had their names inserted in the register. Constant attention has been given to the enforcement of the regulations relating to cleanliness of premises and utensils, etc., but in no case has an infringement been discovered. By your direction frequent inspections have been made of schools in my district, all of which were found to be kept in fair sanitary condition. One notice of intention (Mr. Joseph Gurney, 27, Abbott Road) for renewal of cowhouse licence had been received. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, ,t [Bromley (Central Division). 124 To the Medical Officer of Health, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Public Health Department, 31st December, 1902. Sir, I beg to submit to you my second Annual Report of the Sanitary work and other duties carried out in my West Combined District during the past 12 months, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, summonses applied for, inspections made, etc. In investigating complaints, etc., 1399 houses or other premises have been visited, notifications of infectious diseases necessitating 643 of these visits, and 43 were house-to-house inspections. The total number of re-inspections necessary was 3977. The drains of 155 premises have been tested as to soundness, with either smoke or chemical tests, and in 117 cases were found to be defective, allowing free escape of sewer gas from same ; a number of drains were, on examination, found in so bad a condition that no tests were needed to prove defects. The house-to-house visits were conducted in the undermentioned places:— Birchfield Street. Grundy Street. Chrisp Street. Morris Road. Elizabeth Place. Market Street. Limehouse Causeway. Parris Terrace. Ricardo Street Stainsby Road. During the year the drains of the following premises were taken out and reconstructed, and, where practicable, in order to comply with the bye-laws of the L.C.C. and Borough Council, were intercepted from the sewer, ventilated, and provided with proper means 125 of access for clearing in times of stoppage in same, the whole being thoroughly tested before being passed as sound:— Augusta Street, 5, 7, 27, 44, 46.

West India Road, " Scandinavian Home Annexe." The shops and market stalls from which food-stuffs are purchased in my district have received constant attention, and surprise visits have at times been paid, but, taken as a whole, very little has been found to complain of in connection with same, the vendors preferring to draw my attention to any unwholesome food, and have ??? destroyed sooner than expose it for sale. At different times during the year I have destroyed— 9 cases of unwholesome sardines. 48 boxes of ,, tomatoes. 2 " kits" of „ herrings. Packages of „ bananas. 1 kit of ,, plaice. and odd lots of fruit. Two lots of Valencia raisins (about lour tons), condemned by the Port Sanitary Authority, have been received id my district and the disposal of same carried through. On one occasion I found some children eating some coarse meat, and. on close examination, found it to be "horseflesh." I ascertained where it was purchased and visited the premises. I 2 128 The "Sale of Horseflesh Act "was not being infringed, however, for the shopkeeper said the meat was never sold for " human food," or a ticket would be exhibited as required by the Act. I cautioned the shopkeeper as to the penalties if the Act was not complied with. In only one case have I found it necessary to take Police Court proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. viz.:— Against the owner of No. 3, Latham Street, on account of "no water supply " to the house. The defendant did not appear at court, and was fined £3 and 23s. costs, together with a Closing Order if desired. The whole of the 29 bakehouses in the district have been regularly visited, and, where found necessary, notices have been served requiring the half-yearly cleansing to be put in hand, the same in every case being complied with. The newly printed regulations, as supplied, have been given to each proprietor. The milkshops and dairies have been under regular supervision (numbering 73), and the register amended as required. At times some milk-sellers have had to be cautioned respecting dirty utensils, but never on a second occasion. The cowhouses and slaughterhouses have been properly cleansed and whitened as required, and special inspections paid before renewal of licences. The number now on the register is as under:— Cowhouses 2 Slaughterhouses 3 1 for swine only. Milkshops and dairies 73 Factory and Workshops. All cases of complaints from the L.C.C., and also my own observations as to " Black Smoke " from shafts and chimneys in my 129 district, have been thoroughly investigated. Where any improvement in the fittings or stoking of furnaces or boilers could be effected, this has been readily tried. I have found in two or three instances that the chief cause of black smoke being emitted is the shortage of boiler power, this necessitating the small boilers being worked at their very highest pressure ; thus the constant stoking required to keep up sufficient steam entails a very great amount of care being exercised in order to keep down the smoke. I have not found it necessary to take Police Court proceedings in respect of above during the year, however, the manufacturers seeming anxious not to infringe the Act if possible. In three or four instances (in butchers' shops) gas engines for refrigerating purposes, etc., were found existing, and the " Factory Inspector " communicated with respecting same. Where necessary for any workshops to be cleansed and whitened, notice has been given, and the work put in hand without delay. One extra " workplace " has been added to the list during the year, viz., a carpenter's shop, and the drainage of same reconstructed. A latrine closet has been furnished with automatic flushing apparatus at Messrs. Fletcher's, Ltd., Bridge Road. This I had erected so that in the ensuing year, pending the construction of the Council's new sewer in Bridge Road, it could be easily removed from the river side, where it is at present discharging into the river, and placed in its permanent position. The whole of the premises, together with Messrs. Locke, Lancaster and Company's and Lamb, Beale and Son's, will also then be properly drained and discharged into the new sewer. Food and Drugs Act. Fifty-seven samples of food and drugs have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, 10 of which were 130 returned as adulterated (19 per cent.). Legal proceedings were instituted in each case. The nature of sample, extent of adulteration, and result of proceedings are set out below:— Milk.—Adulterated with 25 per cent. of added water (first offence). Defendant fined £5 and 23s. costs. (Cowshed). Butter.—Adulterated with 84.6 of foreign fat (first offence). Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in cream to extent of 75 per cent. (first offence)- Defendant fined £7 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Adulterated with 16 per cent. of added water and 20 per cent. deficient in cream (second offence). (Cowshed). Defendant fined £10 and £2 2s. costs. Milk.—Adulterated with 16 per cent. of water (first offence). Defendant fined 7s. and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in cream to extent of 18.3 per cent.

Milk.—Deficient in cream to extent of 26.6 per cent. (first offence). Defendant fined £4 and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with 9.8 per cent. of foreign fat, third portion referred to " Somerset House " for analysis ; returned as unadulterated. Summons at Police Court withdrawn, and £5 5s. costs given against Council. Butter.—Adulterated with 77 per cent. of foreign fat (first offence). Defendant fined 20s. and 23s. costs. The new L.C.C. Regulations for ice cream sellers have been distributed both in the English and Italian languages to the respective vendors in the district. 131 Canal Boats Acts. The inspection of canal boats has been carried out as opportunities have occurred. The registered " boats " trade principally to and from Messrs. Grindly and Co.'s Tar Works on the outside between Limehouse and Bromley. The pumps and bulkheads have frequently been inspected, and inquiry made as to any overcrowding of the cabins, but no fault has been found to exist in this respect, and the cabins are usually clean and wholesome. In one instance, however, I had occasion to serve the owners with a " notice" to put the fore cabin of the " Stort " in a habitable condition. The " boat" was laid up for a thorough overhaul forthwith, and on the resumption of her voyages was found to be in first-class condition. One certificate of registration has had to be renewed owing to old one being in such a torn and dirty condition. No case of infectious disease has occurred on any canal boat in my district during the year. Infringement of Bye-Laws. In all cases where drainage work or new pans and traps have been fixed without any notice being given as required, and the same have come under my notice, I have reported the fact to the Public Health Committee, and the ground has been opened up for inspection and testing, and in some cases where defects were found to exist these have been remedied. The two blocks of tenement dwellings in the district have been inspected twice during the year, and some improvements as to W.C.'s and open spaces, etc., have been carried out. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, JOSEPH JOHNSON, R.P.C., Assoc. San. Inst. Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs and Canal Boats Acts. 132 To the Medical Officer of Health.

St. Leonard's Road, " The cooper's Arms," B.H., 37, 70. The shops and stalls in my district have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting unsound and unwholesome food, and in several instances quantities of fish, meat, etc., have been destroyed with the consent of the vendors; also frequently, through the year, a number of cases of fish and fruit have been brought to the Public Health Office by tradespeople and costermongers, who have found on arriving home from the market the contents of the cases were unfit for food of man. The articles of food were destroyed and the usual certificate given, and with one exception the money has been returned by the wholesale vendors. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Police Court proceedings have been instituted against the owners of the undermentioned premises for disobeying the " Notice " of the Council, with the following results:— 12, Benledi Street. Defective drains—14 days' abatement order with £1 12s. 6d. costs. 36, Abbott Road. Defective drains—21 days' abatement order with £1 5s. costs. 18, Dee Street.

Defendant was on the second hearing sent to prison for 20 days ; full particulars of this case were reported to your committee. 136 Under the Bye-Laws of the London County Council, Section 16 (2), Police Court proceedings were instituted against the owner of a van used for the removal of fish offal, the said van not being properly covered so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-two samples of food have been submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis; seven were found to be adulterated and legal proceedings instituted, nature of article, extent of adulteration, and result of proceedings being as follows:— Milk.—Adulterated with 12 per cent. of water.

I have by your direction made periodical inspections of the bakehouses (three of which are underground), which with a few exceptions have been found to be in a clean condition, and the limewashing has been done at least twice in the year in accordance with the Act. Several nuisances were found to exist ; notices were sent, and the same satisfactorily abated. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. Five notices have been received for renewal of licenses. The premises were duly inspected, and where found in an insanitary condition, through want of cleansing, improper water supply, insufficient ventilation, defective drains, inlets to same, and dirty utensils, etc., notices were served and the nuisances abated before the licenses were granted. Periodical inspections have been made with a view of detecting any infringement of the bye-laws. Milkshops and Milk Sellers. I have by your direction made periodical inspections of the above premises, and in many cases found they had not been registered through change of proprietorship. I have supplied them with the necessary forms to fill in so that their names could be entered on the register ; in no single case have I had occasion to complain of dirty utensils; in several cases the measures have been found to be old and much worn. Notices have been served and new ones furnished. Factory and Workshop Acts. Smoke Nuisances. Several complaints had been received during the year in respect of nuisances from black smoke emanating from the shafts and chimneys in the district. The premises were visited with a view 138 to ascertaining the cause, whether there was any smoke-consuming apparatus, and as to the quality of coal, etc., etc. Intimations and statutory notices were duly served, which, with one exception, has had the desired effect. All the shafts and bakehouse chimney in the district have been constantly under observation, and where a nuisance was detected they were dealt with as above. At the following premises special smoke consuming apparatus have been fitted to the furnaces to prevent any nuisance from smoke, which can be done if always used at the time of firing:— Hydraulic Station, East India Dock Wall Road. Bow Creek Oil Mills, Orchard Place. During the year special attention has been given to the fruit shops in the district, with regard to throwing or depositing rotten fruit in the roadway ; and where such has occurred the shopkeeper has been severely cautioned I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector (East Combined Division.) 139 To the Medical Officer of Health, Poplar. 31st December, 1902.

Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 46'7 per cent. Vendor fined £3 and £1 3s. costs. Periodical inspections were made of the bakehouses, cowhouses, dairies, milk shops, and slaughter houses in this division. The results of these inspections were reported in detail to the Public Health Committee. The shops, food stores and stalls have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting diseased and unwholesome food. But 143 in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visit in such condition as to justify seizure. In response to notifications from the Port Sanitary Authority the following food stuffs were examined at premises within the Borough, with results indicated 156 bottles of preserved olives, 102 were unsound and destroyed, 54 sound. 640 tins sardines unsound and destroyed, 17 sound. 140 cases of desiccated cocoanut, 12 tons damaged by water, converted into cattle food. Small-pox. From the commencement to the termination of the epidemic of small-pox, 83 cases were notified from the Poplar South Division, 32 houses were isolated, and 57 families, comprising 169 adults and 102 children, numbering in all 271 persons, were supplied with provisions for periods not less than 15 days. Many fresh cases developed at the houses isolated during the period of quarantine. The number from which more than one case was notified was 18, being more than half the total number of premises closed in this way, the public thoroughfares had been cleared of many contacts and persons who were actually suffering from the disease. Visits to the isolated houses had been made at all hours. In one instance, quarantine was openly disregarded ; in this case, a person left his home during the second week, created a disturbance at a public-house, was taken into custody by the police, and fined by the magistrate. In this case the rent was stopped. Otherwise, much assistance was given by the heads of families in effecting isolation, owing to the dread of the disease, and neigh hours from this cause would willingly act as informants in cases of any persons leaving or visiting during the period of quarantine. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Assoc. San. Inst., Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, Poplar South Division. 144 Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1902. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present to you my third Annual Report of the work done in factories, workshops, and among outworkers during the year 1902. Seven workrooms have been overcrowded, three in Bromley and four in Bow ; this is usually the result of carelessness rather than a desire to evade the law, and has been abated in each case on serving an intimation. During the year one case of insufficient closet accommodation has been reported and a new one constructed, in addition to the three not completed at the close of last year. By Section 107 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, the occupier of every factory or workshop, or of any place from which work is given out, is required to send the names and addresses of all persons employed by him outside to the Borough Council of the district in which the place is situate twice every year. In conformity with this section lists have been received from 45 employers in the Borough. In addition 127 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar. Fifty nine lists have been sent to other Borough Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. From these lists 1098 persons have been visited in their own homes, and by this means a number of small workrooms and domestic workshops have been discovered. The work is frequently done in the living-rooms or kitchen, the state of cleanliness, etc., often being unsatisfactory; but after two or three visits at short intervals a marked improvement is seen, the women being very much afraid of losing their work. 145 The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— Tabulated statement of Inspections of insanitary conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the year ending December 31st, 1902.

Sanitary Inst. L 2 146 To the Medical Officer of Health. 31st December, 1902. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my first Annual Report of the workcarried out by me in the Borough of Poplar, respecting houses let in lodgings. During the early months of the year small-pox was prevalent, and I assisted wherever I possibly could, acting under your instructions. The total number of houses that are on the Register is 281, the number registered during the year being 157. Many of these houses required to be re-registered more than once during the same period. The 281 houses are situated in the various districts of the as per statement below:— Bow 35 Bromley 166 Poplar 68 Millwall and Cubitt Town .. 12 Total 281 The total number of rooms that have had their cubical capacity ascertained being 698. These rooms are either used as day or day and night rooms. One hundred and thirty cases of overcrowding have been found to exist; 125 of these cases have been abated, either by the occupants of the houses having to leave the premises or by distribution of the same throughout the rooms of the house. In the remaining five cases, owing to the capacity of the rooms being such a little short of the standard required by the bye-laws, it was suggested by the Public Health Committee that no action should be taken. 147 One hundred and four night inspections have been made during the year and many overcrowding cases thus revealed. These visits were made at a late hour in the night, and in only two instances did I meet with any difficulty in obtaining access to the premises. Eventually I succeeded in gaining entrance. Particular and constant attention has been paid to those houses where overcrowding cases have been notified. The houses occupied by the Italians are in a most satisfactory condition of cleanliness. One hundred and fifty-four intimations have been served informing landlords of houses being placed upon the Register. One thousand and eighty-four re-inspections of registered houses, and 138 house-to-house inspections have been made. During the year 142 notices for the cleansing of walls and ceilings were served, and much difficulty was experienced in enforcing the bye-laws in this respect without legal proceedings. In many cases the tenants left the premises when the notices were served, thus the houses were left in their dirty condition. Later on in the year these same houses were occupied by new tenants, the houses still remaining in that dirty condition. Eighty-five houses were thoroughly cleansed and 57 were partially cleansed. In all cases, the yard, walls, sculleries, and W.C.'s were lime-washed, and 360 rooms were thoroughly stripped and stopped, and either repapered or colour-washed. Thirty-two final notices were served. Under your instructions I applied for and obtained four summonses at the Thames Police Court against the landlord of Nos. 6, 16, 18, and 20, Box Street, Bromley, for non-compliance with the bye-laws. These houses were in a filthy condition, and for the offence he was ordered by the Magistrate to pay penalties and costs 148 amounting to £8 12s. The above premises were afterwards thoroughly cleansed. The houses I visited in Rook Street and Sophia Street, Poplar, are in a very dirty condition, and require thoroughly cleansing from top to bottom. The following is a tabulated statement of work done :— No. of houses on Register 281 ,, rooms measured 698 „ cases of overcrowding (notified) 130 ,, cases of overcrowding (abated) 125 „ notices for information of houses let in lodgings sent 195 „ notices for information of houses let in lodgings returned 195 „ intimations of houses being placed on Register sent 154 „ houses placed upon Register during year 154 „ re-inspections 1084 ,, house-to-house inspections 138 „ night inspections 104 ,, notices for the cleansing of walls and ceilings served 142 „ final notices served 32 „ houses cleansed .. 85 ,, rooms „ 360 „ sculleries „ 144 ,, yard walls and W.C.'s cleansed 288 ,, houses partially cleansed 57 I remain, Sir, Your obedient servant, HERBERT J.

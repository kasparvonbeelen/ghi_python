Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough during the year 1958. Although the general standard of health of the inhabitants of the Borough has remained satisfactory distress is still caused by the continued shortage of satisfactory housing accommodation. It is of interest to note that although the birth rate has increased slightly, the infant mortality rate has increased by over 50% for which there is no adequate explanation. The Council are still faced with the problem of caravan dwellers on cleared sites in the district on which building has not yet commenced. Despite constant vigilance and the service of Notices on the trespassers, there still exists one large site scheduled for an open space in the London Development plan which is our main source of concern. The extreme difficulty of recruiting Public Health Inspectors has led to restrictions in the activity of the department. Despite this,prelim inary surveys in connection with "Smoke Control" areas under the Clean Air Act were made on six areas to which reference is made in the body of the report. Investigation of the pollution of the river has continued and the condition -6- appears to be slightly better during the current year. This also is referred to in the body of the report. No serious outbreaks of food poisoning were reported during the year and in fact the number of cases notified was about half that reported last year. Notifications of dysentery also were down. Last year I was pleased to report deaths of cancer of the lung in the Borough had been slightly below that of the previous year. This year, however, the figures have again increased, mainly in the 45 - 65 years age group. There is far too much apathy amongst smokers as to this risk and this is not improved by the enormous impact of advertisements by Tobacco Companies on television, the cinema screen and the theatre stage. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health and Baths Committee for their help and encouragement, to the Chief Officers of the Council and their staffs for their co-operation, and finally to Mr. H.W. Luke, Senior Public Health Inspector and Mr. A.A. Hamilton, Chief Clerk and all the other members of the staff of the Public Health Department for their assistance andloyal support at all times. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. C. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. -7- SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 324 but through rehousing and other reasons some 2,600 residents moved from the Borough to other areas and the home population estimated by the Registrar General to number 64,780 at the middle of the year shows a decrease of 2,300 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was 17.1 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 16.6 for 1957. To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar General. Factors are supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 16.3 as compared with 16.4 for England and Wales. The death rate in 1958 was 11.2 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 10.3 for 1957. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 12.6 as compared with 11.7 for England and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 11.9 and 11.5 respectively. The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 33.2 as compared with 21.5 for the previous year. The figures for England and Wales are 22.6 and 23.1 respectively. -8- The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from neoplasms of the lung, which last year showed a slight decrease on previous years has this year shown an increase. Deaths from other diseases showed no significant change from the numbers recorded in 1957.

The domestic water supply for every dwelling in the Borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board, Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The results were uniformly satisfactory throughout the year. Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 in 308 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The District Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows. -13- TABLE II INSPECTIONS.

During the year 44 plans of drainage work to new and existing buildings were submitted and approved. River Pollution. On the whole the condition of the river appears to be slightly better during the current year. The apparent blackness and the emanation of hydrogen sulphide has never been quite so pronounced as in previous years. This is. no doubt, due particularly to two main factors, one an increased amount of water from the upper reaches and, secondly, an improvement in the quality of the effluents from the main sewerage outfalls downstream, and it may well be, with further improvement in the quality of these effluents and the elimination of heated sulphite containing effluents from Power Stations that anaerobic conditions in the middle reaches will cease to exist and a much greater improvement can be expected. Common Lodging Houses. There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 244 males, in the Borough. 12 inspections were made during the year. Seamen's Lodging Houses. There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 13. -18- Personal Cleansing. As in recent years the arrangement was continued with Stepney Borough Council whereby persons requiring personal cleansing was carried out where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. The number of persons cleansed during 1958 was as follows:- Verminous Scabies Total Adults 61 8 69 Children 6 3 9 TOTAL 67 11 78 -19- Disinfection and Disinfestation. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below:- (a) Disinfection:- Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 208 1,830 Tuberculosis 72 542 Scabies 7 86 Miscellaneous 402 3,386 Disinfection for manufacturing firms - 26,240 TOTALS 689 32,084 In addition, 504 tons of waste paper, and 18 tons 13 cwts. of Sterilised Rags were disinfected.

Rodent Control measures throughout the Borough have been carried out under the supervision of the Rodent Officer and a staff of six operatives. Work of the section may be divided into three main categories: - (a) Sewer Maintenance Treatment. (b) Business premises - routine inspection for rodent control. (c) Dwelling houses - complaints from occupiers. Sewer Maintenance. Treatments have been carried out at 6 monthly intervals with the co-operation of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department under the direction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to synchronize with treatments in the neighbouring Authorities' areas. For many years the method of control of rats in the sewers has consisted essentially of poisoning either with zinc phosphide or with arsenous oxide. In the past it has been found that these methods have been r easonably effective but on examination of results of treatments over a number of years, it was obvious that the rat population of the sewers appeared to be static and it was considered that it would be worthwhile to adopt different control methods and, for that purpose, treatment by "Prepared Warfarin" was carried out for our second treatment. This treatment had the approval of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food. The treatment was found to be very satisfactory, large numbers of dead rats being reported lying on the bait trays and benches. From the results of this -21- treatment it would appear that the new method was more effective than the old, and progress has continued to be maintained whereby rat infestation in the sewers has been kept at a minimum level. Business Premises. The Council's Contributory Scheme of Rodent Control in business premises has again continued to function well. The income derived from this Scheme is now £3,533 per annum and the charges made to individual contributors are calculated in units of £5 to £200 dependent on the size of the premises and the storage of rat and mice attractive materials. It must be appreciated that the Borough has extensive river and canal frontages and an immense volume of goods of all description is carried by ship and barge. The Rodent Control staff carry out considerable routine work of inspection and treatment of premises where goods are landed. It is extremely difficult entirely to eliminate the menace of rats, but by constant supervision and treatment, rats and mice in these areas have been reduced and maintained at a minimum which emphasises the general benefits of the Council's Contributory Rodent Scheme Dwelling Houses During the year under review 509 complaints have been received, many of mice infestation. Each complaint has been investigated and treatment or treatments are carried out as may be necessary. Where rat infestation of dwelling houses has been discovered it has usually been found to be due to defects in the drain or sewer and suitable repairs have been effected. -22- This service is carried out by the Council's Staff and no charges are made to occupiers of dwelling houses.

During the year 52 complaints of nuisance from smoke were received. 54 smoke observations were carried out. "SMOKE CONTROL AREAS". In 1957 a recommendation had been made to the Council that the whole Borough should be declared a "Smoke Control" area so that the widely dispersed industrial undertakings could be controlled, together with the proposal that all premises likely to be dealt with by re-development within the next 10 15 years be excluded and the remainder of the property, mostly new post-war development, having been built by this Council and the London County Council should be dealt with in three zones - "Central", Lansbury Estate area, the "South",, Island area and the "North" of the Borough, the last area to be developed as the third phase. Despite acceptance in principle by the Council, it had not been found possible to implement any of these recommendations owing to the acute shortage of staff and the inability to carry out the necessary surveys. This position still obtained to a great extent in 1958 but it was, however, found possible to prepare a plan showing these proposed "Smoke Control" areas, particulars of which were forwarded to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for approval. Details of the areas are as follows: -27- Spanby Road (7.889 acres) 367 dwellings and 284 ancillary buildings. Approximate date ready for occupation March 1962. It is anticipated that one block will be heated by oil firing and that the remainder (12 blocks) will have open fires. Tidey Street. (10.161 acres) 436 dwellings and 335 ancillary buildings. 257 dwellings should be ready for occupation in March 1961 and 179 in March 1962. One block will be heated by oil firing and the remaining blocks will have open fires. Alton Street. (13.76 acres) 598 dwellings and 141 ancillary buildings. Approximate dates ready for occupation - 109 dwellings by August, 1959, 154 by December, 1959, 112 by June, 1960 and 88 by November, 1960. Six blocks will have electric floor heating, the remainder will have open fires. Tetley Street (10.698 acres) 355 dwellings and 176 ancillary buildings. Approximate date of occupation - 130 dwellings in December, 1959, 116 in December, 1960, 22 in June, 1961 and 87 in 1962/3. All 16 blocks will have open fires. Glaucus Street (2.127 acres) 83 dwellings and 52 ancillary buildings. Approximate dates ready for occupation - 45 dwellings in August, 1959 and 38 by end of 1961. It is anticipated that all blocks will have open fires. Blackwall Tunnel Area (2.2 acres) will be an open space. These areas are awaiting confirmation by the Minister. Dock and River craft. Prom time to time nuisance is created by craft in the river or in the docks and these cases are referred to the appropriate Authority.

A wharf engaged in exporting waste paper to the Continent complained that during the night of January 1st certain papers had turned bright yellow in a matter of a few hours. Upon investigation it was found that of the various types of paper on the wharf only that containing wood fibres was affected and only that portion of the stacks which had been wetted by rain. There were several varieties of woodpulp paper including newsprint involved and one particular consignment of a wellknown daily newspaper, the surplus issue of the previous day, had only been deposited on the wharf at 3 p.m. in the afternoon. This was perfectly normal when brought in and such changes as were observed could only have occurred during the period before 8 o' clock the next morning. Between 4 p. m. in the evening and 8 o' clock the following day the wind had veered from west through north to east and during the night there had been squalls of rain with the wind gusty. Samples of the various papers affected and comparable samples without colouration were submitted to two analysts who both found that there was no abnormality in the unaffected paper and independently suggested that the colouration was due to the effect of a primary amine such as aniline or a similar substance under acid conditions and, in fact, the colour was identical with that produced by the use of a standard solution of aniline sulphate which was used on the wharf as a spot test to separate woodpulp papers from other varieties. There was evidence that newspaper lying in the gutters in the vicinity also showed signs of the change -31- but, over a very restricted area. The difficulty was in ascertaining the source of aniline which is a liquid with a very low vapour pressure so that for it to have been present in the atmosphere in vapour form in sufficient quantity to produce this effect it must have been heated or distilled off from somewhere in the vicinity. The only plant in the vicinity where this might have been a possibility was a colour works which, during some part of the night, would have been up wind of the wharf but after detailed questioning no corroboration could be obtained that any free aniline or aniline vapour was or could have been released during the night. The acid conditions are more easily explained as, during some part of the night, both the factory and the wharf would have been down-wind at about a mile distant from Brunswick Wharf Power Station burning about 2000 tons of coal a day. The wind in gusts produced squalls of rain which could have washed out of the atmosphere a considerable amount of sulphur dioxide and deposited it in a reasonably localized area. The Wharf Manager had never experienced such a phenomenon in over twentyfive years. This appears to have been an isolated incident which has not been repeated so that we have had no opportunity of verifying the source of the aniline. During investigations the co-operation of Medical Officers of Health in adjoining Boroughs on both sides of the river, the Alkali Inspector and also the Factory Inspectors, both medical and general, was sought, and a detailed chemical investigation of the processes in all nearby factories was undertaken with negative results. -32- Shops Act, 1950. Under the provisions of this Act no visits were made. No exemption certificates under the Act were issued during the year. Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. A list of persons who sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List is maintained under the provisions of the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. The number of persons on the list at the end of 1958 was 84. Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act requires the registration of premises upon which a business is carried on involving the use of filling materials. The number of premises registered is 10. The Act also requires the licensing of premises for the storage of rag flock, and 2 licences have been issued. Pet Animals Act, 1951. Licences have been issued in respect of 4 premises within the Borough. Hairdressers and Barbers. The total on the register at the end of the year was 53 persons and 46 premises. -33- National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47. National Assistance (Amendment) Act 1951, Section 1. A number of cases of aged people living alone in neglected conditions have again been brought to the notice of the public health department. Most of the cases were found to be suffering from malnutrition and living in filthy conditions through self-neglect. As in the past, every assistance was afforded by the Home Help section of the London County Council, the District Nurses, other voluntary services and friends and neighbours in an endeavour to provide feeding and domestic help. In no case was it found necessary to seek compulsory removal but some were persuaded voluntarily to either enter hospital or other suitable establishments. Incontinent Laundry. In the early part of the year the Council established a laundry service for incontinent persons in cases where no other suitable arrangements could be made. This has been very much appreciated, both by patients, relatives. District Nurses and the Home Help Service. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50. Burials carried out under the provisions of this Act totalled 5 (adults). The total cost was £51 0s. 6d., of which £32 8s. Id. was recovered. -34- Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court. It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-mortem room. In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the pathologists and clerks. The total number of bodies received during 1958 was 535. (Residents 196, non-residents 339). Post-mortem examinations were made in 493 cases and inquests were held in 42 cases. Swimming Baths and Wash-houses.

Of these, 543 were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination, the remaining 33 being sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service for biochemical or bacteriological report. Samples examined by the Public Analyst included a comprehensive variety of food. 1 sample was acquired formally and 542 informally. A total of 11 samples (2.2 per cent.) were found to be adulterated. Details of the unsatisfactory samples and the action taken are shown in Table VIII on page 44. During the year forty-four samples of sausages were purchased mostly from different manufacturers, including local butchers. The meat content of pork sausages varied from 51.5 to 74.8 per cent., with an average of 62.9 per cent. (Prices varied from l/8d. to 3/6d. per lb. with an average of 2/8d. per lb.). In the case of beef sausages the meat content varied from 47.4 to 70.3 per cent, with an average of 55.5 per cent. (Prices were from l/6d. to 2/8d. per lb. with an average of 2/ld. per lb.). Two samples of Pork Sausages were unsatisfactory. Details of these samples and action taken are shown in Table VIII, page 44. -45- Unsound food. The Council's Pood Inspector is called upon to pass judgment of fitness on great quantities of food. Frequently large and valuable stocks are involved. Among special lots of food examined during the year were the following:- Orange Concentrate (Stock at Wharf) 25 tons Condemned and destroyed Marmalade (Stock at Wharf) 8 cwts. Condemned and destroyed Ham (Stock at Shop) 2 tons, 2 cwts. Condemned and destroyed Mayonnaise (Stock at Firm) 5½ cwts. Condemned and destroyed Ginger (Stock at Wharf) 4¾ tons Condemned and destroyed Apricot Pulp (Stock at Wharf) 1 ton Condemned and destroyed Potatoes (Stock at Wharf) 1 ton, 16½ cwts. Condemned and destroyed Onions (Stock at Firm) 8 tons, 7 cwts. Condemned and destroyed Pork (Stock at Wharf) 3¾ tons Released for animal feeding -46- The following is a summary of foods condemned as being unfit for human consumption:- Fresh foods Canned foods Meat and offal 1,312 lbs. 8,884 lbs. Meat products 6 ,, 571 " Ham - 12,958 " Poultry 29 ,, 31 " Cheese 131 ,, - Pish 996 ,, 6 ,, Milk - 374 ,, Vegetables 24,220 ,, 5,239 ,, Fruit 59,103 ,, 14,746 ,, Other foods 432 ,, 249 ,, Marmalade 943 ,, - Ginger 10,640 ,, - Mayonnaise - 635 ,, This summary differentiates only between canned food and others; foods preserved by salt, sugar, dehydration, etc., being included under the heading " Fresh Poods". Disposal of Unsound Food. The bulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned and destroyed by the Borough Engineer's refuse disposal service as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned,arrangements may be made under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch, or manure making. -47- Milk Supply. All domestic supplies of milk are sold in sealed bottles or cartons bearing a designation. Except for very small quantities of raw Tuberculin Tested milk from Attested Herds, all milk is heat treated. Although a large number of shop keepers are registered to sell milk, the greater proportion of milk supplied to domestic consumers is delivered to the door through twenty of the registered distributors. The London fresh milk depot of one of the leading wholesale milk concerns is situated within the Borough. Here, over 9,000,000 gallons of milk are pasteurised annually and distributed over some thirty to forty districts in the Greater London area. The Council is responsible for licensing and supervising the pasteurising process. Samples of milk have been taken from dairies, shops and deliverymen for the purpose of checking quality, purity and bacteriological cleanliness. Samples are also taken on delivery from supplies to schools. During the year 29 inspections were made of dairies and other premises from which milk is distributed. Conditions on the whole were found to be satisfactory. Registration and Licensing. For details of registration of dairies and distributors see page 42. Licenses issued under theMilk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949:- Sterilised Pasteurised Tuberculin tested Dealers 126 61 26 Supplementary 29 25 25 Pasteurisers - 1 - -48- Milk Sampling. A total of 15 samples of milk ( - formal, 15 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination. All samples were satisfactory. For average solids in all samples, excluding Channel Islands milk, the figures were: Fat 3.7, Non-fatty solids 8.68. The Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956, introduced on 18th June, (fixed a minimum standard of 4 per cent, fat in connection with milk sold under the Description Channel Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and South Devon. 2 samples of Channel Islands milk were taken and reports showed fat figures of 4.5 and 4.3 and in each case the non-fatty solids figure was 9.0. Of the 26 samples of designated milk (23 pasteurised; 3 tuberculin tested pasteurised) submitted to the Phosphatase, and Methylene Blue tests, all were satisfactory. Ice Cream, Close supervision is exercised in connection with the manufacture, sale and storage of ice cream. Premises, plant and refrigerators were kept under constant observation. Full and free consultation has taken place between manufacturers and the Council's Food Inspector on problems of production. Inspections are made of the vehicles used by itinerant vendors; vehicles have been stopped, stocks inspected, temperature of containers checked and samples taken. A total of 5 samples were taken during the year. Of these 1 was submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The -49- sample was classified as Grade 3. The remaining 4 samples were examined by the Public Analyst under the Pood Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951. All samples were reported to be satisfactory, the quality in general being much higher than the standards prescribed in the regulations. Ice Lollies. During the year 5 samples were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination. A satisfactory report was received in each case. Imported Food. The Council is a specially appointed Authority under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations, 1937. Inspections are made of direct landings of imported foodstuffs at the Sufferance Wharves in the Borough. No prohibited meat may be imported into the country for sale for human consumption and no meat or meat products may be imported without an official certificate of inspection issued by the Country of Origin, and approved by the British Government. Foods for Export. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 9 inspections were made of foods exported from the district; 9 certificates of purity were issued. Food Poisoning. 28 cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. No serious outbreaks of food poisoning occurred. -50- SECTION E INFECTIOUS DISEASES The total number of corrected notifications of infectious disease during 1958 was 513 which was less than half the figure, 1,476 for the previous year and mainly due to the decrease in the number of cases of measles 86 and 1,010 respectively, which were notified. Diphtheria. It is gratifying to report that no cases of diphtheria were notified during the year but it must be emphasised that this has been achieved by a vigorous policy of immunisation and if diphtheria is not to re-appear as a killing disease constant vigilance is required and there must be no apathy on the part of the public in availing themselves of immunisation facilities as this degree of freedom from this serious disease will only be maintained if at least 80 percent, of the susceptible population are immunised and an alarming feature is that owing to the virtual disappearance of this disease there is a tendency to disregard its seriousness and the percentage of immunisation is barely being maintained at a satisfactory level in spite of vigorous propaganda campaigns. Dysentery. I am pleased to report that the number of notified cases of dysentery showed a decrease on last year's figure and in fact were inflated a little due to notification being received from an outbreak in 1957. -51- Measleso The number of cases of measles notified during the year was 86 as compared with 1,010 in 1957 and 392 in 1956. This follows the normal pattern of measles epidemics which prior to the war showed a fairly clearly marked two-year cycle in which a high peak was reached in alternate years, the intervening years being marked by relative freedom from the disease. Poliomyelitis. During the year 2 cases of poliomyelitis (1 paralytic: 1 non-paralytic) were notified but diagnosis was confirmed in only 1 case (1 paralytic). There were no deaths from this disease. Tuberculosiso Notifications again show little change from last year but when it is realised that every case arises from a previous case which is in an active phase of the disease it is apparent that in spite of modern therapeutic aids and improved diagnostic facilities this disease is only being held in check and is a long way from eradication. It is probable that the infected dust, due to particles from dried sputum droplets less than 5 microns in size, is the predominant cause of the spread of tuberculosis. Particles of this size and smaller can easily penetrate into the recess in the lung and be retained and it is of some significance that these are of the same order of magnitude as the tubercle organism. The local Chest Physician has sought my co-operation on a number of instances where persons suffering from tuberculosis and with a positive sputum have refused -52- to accept any form of treatment. In most cases a satisfactory outcome was achieved. We have in the Borough at Garford Street a Salvation Army Hostel for men of 244 beds and at any one time there are probably up to 20 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis intermittent excreters of the organism and this does represent a considerable hazard both to the other inmates and to members of the public with whom they come in contact. This aspect of tuberculosis control is, at the moment, being very carefully considered by the various authorities interested. The following table shows the age and sex incidence of the cases notified.

There were 22 cases of whooping cough notified during the year as compared with 120 the previous year. 68% occurred in children below 5 years of age and 18% in children below 1 year. This disease shows little variation over the years and in view of the age group attacked, predominantly in children below 5 years, it must still be regarded as one of the most serious diseases of childhood because of the possibility of sequelae. -56- -57- TABLE XI INFECTIOUS DISEASE DISEASE Corrected Notifications Removed to Hospital 0yrs. 1yrs. 3yrs. 5yrs. 15yrs. 25yrs. 45yrs. 65yrs.

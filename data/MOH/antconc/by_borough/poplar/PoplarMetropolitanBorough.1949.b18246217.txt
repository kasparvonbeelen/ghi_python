Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report for the year 1949. Dr. C. Porter continued to act as Medical Officer of Health until I commenced duty in June. General Standard of Health. The general standard of health of the inhabitants of the Borough may be regarded as satisfactory. The total number of notifications of compulsorily notifiable disease did however show an increase as compared with the previous year, the increase in the main being attributable to Measles and Whooping Cough. Eleven cases of Acute Poliomyelitis were notified during the year. No deaths occurred as a result of this disease. Vital Statistics. The Birth Rate for the year is 18.3 per 1,000 estimated population, that of the previous year being 21.0 and that of the country as a whole 16.7. The Infantile Mortality Rate is 36.7, the rate for England and Wales being 32. The Recorded Death Rate for the Borough is 12.8 per 1,000 estimated population, that for England and Wales 11.7, the slight increase over the previous year being attributable to the increase in deaths from diseases of the circulatory and nervous systems. Housing. In collaboration with and at the request of the London County Council a slum clearance survey was undertaken during the year, under which details of provisional areas considered suitable to be dealt with by the respective authorities are set out. Having regard to the acute housing shortage in Poplar it is essential that expeditious action be taken to relieve the distress that this shortage is causing within the Borough. — 6 — Food Hygiene. The Department's officers continued throughout the year their efforts to improve the standard of cleanliness and personal hygiene in premises and persons associated with the manufacture, distribution and storage of food. A letter was addressed to the occupiers of all food premises within the Borough drawing attention to the need for improved standards of hygiene and inviting co-operation in the Council's efforts to secure this objective. Rodent Control. The Rodent Control Scheme operated successfully during the year. Sewer Maintenance Treatments in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries were also carried out. May I utilise this occasion to express my appreciation of the consideration shown by the Council in all matters affecting the public health of the Borough, to my brother officers for their co-operation and to the entire staff of the Public Health Department for their assistance to me. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, W. T. DONOVAN, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1950. — 7 — SECTION A. STATISTICS OF THE AREA.

INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD. (a) Milk Supply. (1) Inspection of premises. During the year a total of 310 inspections of dairies ana other premises in the Borough used in connection with the distribution of milk were made by the Food Inspector. Defects were found to exist in three instances and appropriate action was taken. (2) Registration and Licensing. The Food and Drugs (Milk and Dairies) Act, 1944, and Regulations under the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, as amended by the 1944 Act, became operative on 1st October, 1949, and these enactments brought about a variation in the law relating to the registration of dairies and dairymen and to the issue of Licences authorising the use of special designations in connection with the sale of certain milks. Details of registrations and licences issued during the year are given in the following tables: TABLE X. Number of registrations under the Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 (Subsequent to 1.10.49).

In addition 80 samples of heat treated milk were examined and the results are given in the table below: TABLE XII.

The arrangements for sampling milk delivered to London County Council schools continued and during the year a total of 72 samples were taken. Of this number 36were submitted for chemical examination and were reported genuine. Thirty-six were submitted for bacteriological examination—four of these failed to pass the Methylene Blue test. It is considered that the failures can be attributed to the exceptionally hot weather at the time. (b) Meat and other Foods. During the year 1,635 visits were made by the Inspectors to shops and other premises where food is sold, prepared for sale or stored. Unsatisfactory conditions were found to exist at three premises and appropriate action was taken. Details of the inspections made are given in the following table: TABLE XIII.

During the year a total of 23 notifications were received. Consumption of the following foods alleged to be responsible:— Shellfish 19 Sausages 1 Various 3 (j) Clean Food Campaign. The Ministry of Food issued Circular M.F. 12/49 which drew the attention of Local Authorities to the need for clean handling of food in all its aspects. Accordingly a letter was sent from the Public Health Department to the occupiers of all food premises in the Borough. The letter stressed the importance of clean handling of food and appealed for the co-operation of all concerned to secure and maintain a good standard of cleanliness and personal hygiene in connection with the manufacture, distribution, storage and handling of food. In addition a number of practical hints and advice with regard to food hygiene were included. The letter was followed up by visits at which advice where necessary was given. 35 SECTION F. PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES. There has been no change during the year in the infectious diseases compulsorily notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health. The total number of notifications received during 1949 was 2,160, as compared with 2,006 in 1948. The increase is accounted for by the increased number of cases of the following:— Measles Whooping Cough Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis 1948 1,001 330 5 1949 1,220 354 11 There was a decrease, however, in the number of cases of the following :— Diphtheria Pneumonia Scabies 1948 19 115 81 1949 7 85 39 During the year 11 cases of Acute Anterior Poliomyelitis, 9 of which were confirmed, were notified. There were no deaths. The corresponding figures for the previous year were 5 cases notified, of which 4 were confirmed. One case proved fatal. The arrangements under which the Medical Officer of Health is informed by the Hospital Authorities of any change in the original diagnosis continued during the year.

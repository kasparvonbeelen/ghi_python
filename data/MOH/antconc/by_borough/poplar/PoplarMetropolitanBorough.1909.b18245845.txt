ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with the "Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my seventeenth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1909, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The Report of the Lady Health Visitor is also included. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1909, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 170,688:— Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,833,938 60,804 66,685 43,199 being 60.6 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 73.32 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 52.13 per acre in Poplar Sub-District, 110.00 B 2 in Bromley, and 77.73 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1909. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Sub-District of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three sub-districts might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., and VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. Births. During the year 1909, 134 births were notified outside the Borough belonging thereto:—132 by the Medical Officer of Stepney, one by the Medical Officer of Health of Paddington, and one by the Medical Officer of Health of Lambeth. 120 of the Stepney births occurred in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road, and 12 in the London Hospital. The birth in Paddington took place in the London Lock Hospital. The Lambeth birth occurred in the Clapham Maternity Hospital. Mothers' Home, Commercial Road. poplar. bromley. bow. Male. Female. Male.

In the 52 weeks 2779 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 695 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1685 in Bromley, and 399 in Bow; from the 695 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 70 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 383 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1008 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1685 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 778 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 213 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 1120. From the 399 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 4 non-residents and added 279 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 674 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III., that in considering the deaths of nonresidents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2779 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 460 deaths of actual nonresidents and 483 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2802 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1008 deaths in Poplar included 18 illegitimate children, 10 male and 8 female; the 1120 deaths in Bromley included 19 illegitimate children, 6 male and 13 female; the 674 Bow deaths included 10 illegitimate children, 5 male and 5 female, making a total for the Borough of 47 deaths of illegitimate children. 7 8 Males.

Mortality rate among infants visited was 104.19 per 1000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough. † The 670 deaths of infants under one year of age include deaths in outlying institutions and allow for deductions of non-residents. The actual deaths inside the Borough without deducting non-residents and not including deaths occurring in outlying institutions were 635—199 Poplar, 316 Bromley and 120 Bow. ‡ In the County of London during the year 1909 there were 116,559 children born, of whom 12,582 died under one year of age. 13 Notification of Births Act, 1907. During the year 4380 notifications were received under the Notifications of Births Act, 1907. Discrepancies in Registration of Births. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a report of the Medical Officer on the subject of discrepancies in the dates of births, as notified to the Medical Officer, and the same births as registered by the Registrars, and directed the attention of the Registrar-General be called to the matter. The following is the report mentioned above :— "An anomalous state of affairs has been revealed since the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, in the Borough. "By Section 1 (4) the Registrars of Births and Deaths shall at all reasonable times have access to notices of births received by the Medical Officer of Health under this Act or to any book in which those notices may be recorded. "By Section 2 (5) in London the Medical Officer of Health of every Metropolitan Borough in which this Act is in force shall send weekly to the London County Council, on a form prescribed by the Local Government Board, a list of all notices of births received by him under the Act during the week. "In Poplar, the Public Health Department, to assist the Registrars, sends a press copy of the weekly list mentioned above, to the Registrars of Births and Deaths. Every week the Registrars forward to the Public Health Department a return of births registered by them during the week. When the Registrars' returns are received the children are for the most part over six weeks old. "Now, it is found in many instances the date of the birth of the child as given by the person registering the birth differs from the date notified to the Medical Officer of Health. For example:—The birth of a female child was notified on the 13th January to the Medical Officer of Health as taking place on the 12th January; but in the Registrar's return for the week ended 12th March the date of the birth was entered as 25th January, and the Registrar informs the Medical Officer of Health the person registering such birth rigidly adhered to the date being the 25th January; hence the Registrar had no alternative but to enter in his return the 25th January. 14 "Again, in the return of births registered in the Sub-District of Bromley during the week ended 20th March, there is an entry of a male child having been born on the 4th February, whereas on the notification card received on the 28th January the date of birth is given as 26th January, and there can be no doubt that the child was born on this latter date and not upon the 4th February as registered. "Each of the three Registrars of the Borough informs the Medical Officer of Health that frequently the date given by the person registering the birth varies from that which is returned to him by the Medical Officer of Health. In some cases the Begistrars, by calling attention to the date which appeared on the notification of birth card supplied by the Public Health Department, is able to register the date previously given to the Medical Officer of Health, but in others the person registering the birth will not admit any mistake; hence the Registrar has no option but to enter the date which must obviously be incorrect, as there can be no doubt that the date on the notification of birth "card is the more correct, as it is posted within 36 hours after the birth. "The probable explanation is the parents give the wrong date of the births, having failed to register such births within six weeks, as required by the Registration Act, and thereby avoid the penalty. "A birth notified under the Notification of Births Act as happening out of wedlock on 31st January, was given the mother's name on the notification card to the Medical Officer of Health, and subsequently appeared in the Registrar's return for the week ended 13th March registered in the father's name, as if the child had been born in wedlock." There can be no doubt the adoption of the Notification of Births Act and the sending to the Registrars copies of the filled-in form which is sent weekly to the London County Council, assists the Registrars in registering the correct date of the birth. Medical Practitioners and the Notification of Births Act. Apparently all the births taking place in the Borough are not notified, for there is evidence that some medical practitioners do not comply with the provisions of the Notification of Births Act. Upon the adoption of the Act its provisions were brought to the notice of the medical practitioners and midwives practising within the 15 Borough by public posters, supplemented by circulars, which were sent out by post; and again under date 3rd February a circular letter was sent (by the direction of the Public Health and Housing Committee) to the medical practitioners and midwives, calling attention to their duties under the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and setting out the provisions of the Act. They were also informed "that the Council will, upon application, supply addressed and stamped envelopes for the purpose of notification" (a pattern was forwarded) and " that the Council will be obliged if you will kindly make known the provisions of the Act to anyone whom it may concern." A list of boundary streets and roads has been supplied to the medical practitioners and midwives, so that medical practitioners and midwives have received ample notice as to their statutory obligations. Upon these facts being brought to the notice of the Public Health and Housing Committee, the Committee were of opinion it is very desirable all births should be notified to the Medical Officer as provided by the Notification of Births Act, and regretted that some medical practitioners decline to carry out the provisions of that Act. The Committee reported the matter to the Council, and stated that in such cases legal proceedings would in future be taken against offenders where necessary. Stamped postcards are sent out to the medical practitioners and midwives instead of letter cards so that the postage is one halfpenny instead of one penny, which means a saving to the Borough. Health Visitor. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908—General Order of Local Government Board. The Local Government Board issued a General Order under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, with respect to the qualifications, mode of appointment, duties, salary, and tenure of office of Health Visitors, who may be appointed by Metropolitan Borough Councils. The London County Council, by resolution, expressed the opinion that the status of any Health Visitor appointed under the Act should not be less than that of a female sanitary inspector employed by the Borough Council, and in determining the amount which it would contribute towards the salary of any Health Visitor, the London County Council would take into consideration the question whether the officer is paid a salary commensurate with the status of a female sanitary inspector. 16 Appointment of Health Visitor. In March, 1908, Miss A. E. Hall was appointed Health Visitor for the Borough. The appointment was made a temporary one, with a view to re-appointment under the provision of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, then under consideration by Parliament, which enables the County Council to pay one-half the salaries of Health Visitors appointed by the Metropolitan Borough Councils. Whilst this report is being written the Local Government Board approved the selection of Miss Hall as Health Visitor to the Borough. The duties of the Council's Health Visitor are to visit births and give advice on feeding and management of infants, and on cleanliness and ventilation of homes, to visit cases of infantile summer diarrhœa: also to organise and direct voluntary* assistance in the work.

Gore Farm Hospital as a Sanatorium. The Stepney Borough Council urged upon the Metropolitan Asylums Board the desirability of the utilisation of the Gore Farm Hospital, lying idle, as a sanatorium for consumptives, but the Board, who had the matter before them on several occasions, had come to the conclusion they are not in a position to act without the sanction and direction of the Local Government Board. The Stepney Borough Council therefore appealed to the Local Government Board to allow the Metropolitan Asylums Board to use their vacant Isolation Hospitals for the reception of consumptive patients for sanatorium treatment. The Poplar Borough Council on several occasions had urged the utilisation of the Gore Farm Hospital as a sanatorium for consumptives. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to support the appeal of the Stepney Borough Council to the Local Government Board to allow the Metropolitan Asylums Board to use their vacant Isolation Hospitals for treatment of consumptive patients. 25 Compulsory Notification and Practical Reforms. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a letter from the St. Marylebone Board of Guardians, expressing the opinion that the following policy is the one most likely, at present, to bring about good results in the fight against lung tuberculosis:— "I. Ideal aims for the whole nation. (a) Compulsory notification of all cases in England, and until this can be obtained, compulsory notification of cases in Hospitals and Dispensaries. (b) Compulsory removal and detention of cases, when, owing to neglected condition and the state of the disease, they constitute a danger to the community, unless the spread of the disease can be prevented at home. II. Practical reforms which could be begun at once. (a) The establishment in every Infirmary of special wards (where non-existent) for phthisis. (b) The formation, in connection with the Health Committees in every Borough, of a body of visitors, either voluntary or paid, who shall disseminate literature and preach unceasingly the need of cleanliness and fresh air. (c) That the Local Government Board be invited to set apart any Institutions, with suitable land attached, to which patients might be sent from the various Infirmaries when they are sufficiently recovered to undertake any light work, under medical supervision, but are not well enough to return home and enter the labour market." At present there is compulsory notification of pulmonary tuberculosis only in the cases of inmates of Poor Law Institutions or of persons in receipt of Poor Law relief or medical relief. The Committee were of opinion the adoption of the proposals of the St. Marylebone Board of Guardians is desirable, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the Local Government Board be so informed.

Of the 481 patients notified in Poplar, 390 were removed to hospitals and institutions; of the 462 in Bromley 366 were isolated, and of the 246 in Bow 173 were removed, so that of a total of 1,189 notifiable diseases in the Borough 929 patients had been removed from their homes.* Workmen's Compensation Act and Dangerous Infectious Diseases—proposed Inclusion. The attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee was called to cases of nurses and attendants at Isolation Hospitals, and others engaged in connection with dangerous infectious diseases, who had died in the course, and as a result of, the nature of their duties. These cases * See Tables xxiv.-xxvii. 56 are not covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act, although certain other diseases which may be incurred in industrial processes are so covered by reason of their inclusion in the third Schedule, under the provisions of Section 8 of the Act. Sub-section 6 of Section 8 empowers the Secretary of State to make orders for extending the provisions of the Section to other diseases and injuries due to the nature of any employment specified in the order, not being injuries by accident. It was considered the inclusion of dangerous infectious diseases would enable insurances to be effected without material increase of premium. The Committee were of opinion it is desirable the Workmen's Compensation Act should be made to apply to dangerous infectious diseases contracted in the course of employment in such cases, and recommended the Council—That the Secretary of State for the Home Department be urged to make an order for inclusion in the Third Schedule of the Workmen's Compensation Act, of infectious diseases notifiable under any Statute or Order, in the cases of persons employed in removal of infectious patients, disinfection of premises, clothing and effects, in connection with such infectious diseases, or in attendance at Isolation Hospitals. A communication was received from the Secretary of State for the Home Department, with reference to the resolution of the Council urging the extension of the Third Schedule of the VVorkmen's Compensation Act to infectious diseases contracted by persons employed in connection with Isolation Hospitals or in disinfection. The Home Secretary stated that the matter had been considered by the Departmental Committee on Compensation for Industrial Diseases, and they expressed the opinion that neither the wording of the Act, nor the Third Schedule in its present form, nor the discussion of the Bill in Parliament, give any indication that our legislation on Workmen's Compensation contemplates cases of ordinary illnesses contracted by chance through exposure to infection while in an employer's service. The Home Secretary endorsed the opinion of the Departmental Committee. Errors in Diagnosis. In giving the above numbers of notifications, no deductions have been made for the following cases, which it will be seen developed other diseases either shortly after admission or after being in the hospital some time, whilst the list also shows that some patients removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals, after being detained in those institutions some days, were returned home certified as not suffering from the complaint or any other notifiable disease. 57 POPLAR SUB-DISTRICT.

The percentage on the total (admission) scarlet fever cases was 4.20, diphtheria cases 11.44, and enteric fever cases 25.92. Among the 30 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 2 broncho-pneumonia, 3 erythema, 9 tonsillitis, 1 measles, 1 rotheln, 1 varicella, 1 urethritis, 1 burns, and 2 cases were diphtheria, and not scarlet fever. Among the 25 cases wrongly certified as diphtheria were 7 of tonsillitis, 2 measles, 1 septic pharyngitis, 1 tonsillar abscess, 1 pharyngeal paralysis. 6 cases were scarlet fever and not diphtheria. Among the 7 cases of typhoid fever wrongly certified were 1 appendicitis, 2 lobar pneumonia, 1 meningitis, and 1 helminthiasis. In the course of the year 1909 no fewer than 2,322 patients* against 2594 in 1908, 3,109 in 1907, 2151 in 1906, 2,157 in 1905, 1,993 in 1904, 1,913 in 1903, and 2,108 in 1902, or a percentage on the total admissions of 9.27 in 1908, 9.7 in 1907, 8.3 in 1906, 9.04 in 1905, 10.7 in 1904, 10.4 in 1903, and 8.6 in 1902 were, after admission to the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certificates upon which they were removed to hospital. The number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar for the years 1899—1909 which were removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals, have been as follows : — Percentage of mistakes in total admissions.

Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever bacteriologically examined. (See pages 104 and 108.) Arrangements are still made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the medical officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. Three cases of scarlet fever, 1 of diphtheria, 2 of enteric fever and 2 of measles were connected with milkshops in Poplar. Two cases of scarlet fever, and one of measle3 were connected with milkshops in Bromley. Two cases of diphtheria, one of erysipelas, and one of measles, were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.* Eight premises with outworkers were† connected with infectious cases notified, 2 in Poplar, 4 in Bromley, and 2 in Bow—6 scarlet fever, and 2 diphtheria. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. One case of measles‡ (Bromley) was also connected with outworkers' premises, and where work was found on the premises it was disinfected before being returned if there were any likelihood of infection, but there is no power to prevent work being executed on outworkers' premises where measles exists.

Work of the Plant during Summer Period 1909. At the seven depots during the Summer period the electrolytic fluid was in great demand by the public; so great was the demand that the entire requirements of the Works Department could not be met; no fluid could be given out for street watering and sewer manhole flushing, but was delivered for the street gullies. The requirements of the Institutions of the Guardians and the Managers of the Sick Asylums were not curtailed. To meet the public demand at the depots, overtime at the central manufacturing depot had to be resorted to, as at the end of each day all fluid had been distributed at the central depot. After a run of eight hours the top supply tank was replenished, the electrolysers washed out and a fresh start made. On some days there was an output of over 300 gallons. At the central depot alone during the hot weather in one day as many as eight hundred vessels of all descriptions were filled with the fluid to satisfy the public call. The demand at the seven depots was at one time so great that the depots had to be supplied with fluid on two occasions during the week in place of the usual once. 71 Stability of Fluid. During the intensely hot weather the stability of the fluid was good, which speaks well for the method employed. The contents of a carboy made on the 29th May maintained its strength as follows:— 29 th May 5.678 grammes per litre. 1st June 5.678 ,, ,, 3rd June 5.678 ,, ,, 5th June 5.678 ,, ,, 12th June 5.678 ,, ,, 9th July 5.678 ,, ,, 20th August (three months) 5.482 ,, ,, Output ok Fluid. The output of fluid during each month of the year 1909 was as follows January 1,246 Gallons. February 1,204 „ March 1,190 ,, April 2,023 ,, May 1,960 ,, June 2,471 ,, July 3,374 ,, August 4,326 ,, September 3,430 ,, October 2,870 ,, November 2,464 ,, December 658 ,, Total 27,216 „ Distribution of Fluid.

The cost of material in manufacturing 27,216 gallons of the electrolytic fluid was as follows:— Electricity, 4,781 units at 1½ per unit £ s. d. 29 17 7½ tons. cwt. lbs. Chloride of Magnesium *2 18 11 11 16 1 Salt, 4½ tons ... ... 7 5 0 Caustic Soda ... ... 3 2 6 Water ... ... 1 1 0 Total cost of materials to produce 27,216 gallons £53 2 2½ * There was a large amount in the saturator at the end of the year. 73 Bottles, Corks and Labels. Bottles (37 gross 10 doz.) £28 3 9 Corks (150 gross) 7 10 0 Labels (40,000) 3 0 0 £38 13 9 Condition of Plant. After working for nearly four years and not having been cleaned for a period of over twelve months, the apparatus was taken to pieces, over, hauled and thoroughly cleaned. The platinum wire and slates upon which it is wound were found in perfect condition—these are the positive electrodes and are the costly portion of the plant. In the apparatus there are forty pairs of zinc plates—the negative electrodes—and experience shews that the zinc electrodes will last from four to five years. The cost of a pair of zinc electrodes with the necessary nuts and bolts is five shillings and sixpence. It may be mentioned that experience shews that by somewhat altering the shape of the zinc electrodes their lives may be considerably increased and give greater efficiency in the working of the plant. The Chief Disinfector supervised the working and cleansing of the plant, and also superintended the distribution of the fluid at the seven depots and the various Institutions of the Borough. Total Quantity Manufactured since Installation of Plant. Monetary Advantage to Borough. Since the plant has been installed, a period now reaching four years, nearly 90,000 gallons have been manufactured at a cost for electricity and materials of under £175. The great monetary advantage to the Borough since the installation of the Electrolytic Plant need not be referred to in detail, as the fact has been the subject of reports again and again. The Public Health Department is not only furnished with the disinfectant and the various institutions of che Council (the public baths, etc.), but the institutions of the Managers of the Sick Asylums and of the Board of Guardians (within and without the Borough) are supplied with an unlimited quantity free. 74 For the fluid supplied to the Works Department a charge of 1d. per gallon is made, the Public Health Department is credited with this amount although no actual monetary transaction takes place. As applicants now usually bring their own receptacles to the depots, there is also a very appreciable saving in the expenses on bottles alone.

The Public Health and Housing Committee considered complaints made at meetings of the Council of insufficient centres for distribution of disinfectants, especially in North Bow and recommended the Council that additional distributing centres for disinfectants be opened at North Bow and Cubitt Town. Rooms at 37, Trego Road, and a shed at 97, Stebondale Street, Cubitt Town, for the purpose of additional distributing centres were obtained, at a rental of 4/- per week in each case.

Cost Advantages. Output and Strength of Fluid. On account of the demand for the fluid, the dismantling, overhauling and cleansing of the apparatus had to be carried out on Sunday, the men working overtime; this, together with the fact that to meet the public demand overtime had to be resorted to and the supply to the Works Department curtailed, induced the Committee to consider the advisability of recommending the Council to purchase an additional plant. There was no need for new saturators. In view of the difficulty of meeting the demand for the fluid, and of the use of the disinfectant in connection with the Public Swimming Baths, the Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the duplication of the plant was necessary, and recommended the Council that additional plant, as specified, for manufacture of disinfecting fluid by Electrolysis, be obtained and fitted up at an estimated cost of £430. The new plant has been installed whilst this report is being written (February, 1910) and is as follows:— Four Electrolysers* good for an output of 25 gallons of fluid at a * The tanks were, made of earthenware (which if well glazed will never wear out). Earthenware is one of the best insulating materials.

POPLAR ELECTROLYTIC FLUID INSTALLATION. The additional plant is shown on the left. The wire guard protects against injury from the motor and wheels which work the stirrers in the carboys. The three dark slate tanks of the old plant seen on the right have now been replaced by earthenware tanks. The glass funnels with mixing receptacles beneath are for the substance assuring stability. Above on the platform is the tank containing the solution to be electrolysed. 77 strength of * 4 grammes of Chlorine per litre and suited for a 240 volt circuit. One Electric Motor (for a 240 volt circuit), arranged to hang vertically and driving two stirring machines. Two Stirring Machines running on ball bearings and fitted with suitable grooved pulleys.

A Switchboard mounted with 2 D.P. Switch good for 25 amps in cast-iron case. 4 S.P. Porcelain Tubular fuses; An Ampere meter; A Voltmeter; with provisions for the Council's meters. A Series Rheostat. By including (as mentioned above) a stirring motor of vertical pattern, two stirring machines and two stirrers—one working on the old plant and one on the new—the production is made practically automatic and enables both plants to be worked simultaneously, and necessitates no addition to the staff. The cost of the entire plant as specified was £430; the Council provided rough labour that was required in addition. The saturated solutions are now lifted into the large top supply tank by means of a pump instead of being carried up by hand in pails, a matter occupying ten minutes instead of an hour and a half.

The following are copies of letters sent to the London County Council (Education Department) under the directions of the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Council Offices, Poplar, 29th September, 1909. Sir,— The Public Health and Housing Committee have had under consideration the question of the possibility of the spread of infectious disease by means of dust raised in school rooms by the movements of the children, and they are advised this is a probable source of infection. On the 26th September, 1906, an offer was made to the London County Council by this Council, but not then accepted, to deliver, free of cost, supplies of disinfectant for use in the schools in the Borough. I am directed to suggest that, experimentally, supplies of the disinfectant should be accepted for use in sprinkling the floors in six selected schools in the Borough, and the effect on the condition of the children and their attendance noted. I am to add that the Public Health and Housing Committee will be prepared to recommend the Council to renew its offer of September, 1906, to supply the disinfectant, with instructions for use, free to all the schools in the Borough, should the County Council desire to continue its use. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) LEONARD POTTS, Town Clerk. The Executive Officer, Education Offices, London County Council. 80 Council Offices, Poplar, 27th September, 1906. Sir,— Disinfectants. I am directed by the Public Health aud Housing Committee to offer supplies of Electrolysed Salt Water disinfectant manufactured by this Council, for use in the Public Elementary Schools in this Borough. 1 enclose papers describing the nature, power and use of the disinfectant. The Committee will be pleased to arrange for delivery to the Schools, with necessary instructions for use. It is not proposed to make any charge in connection with the supply. Yours faithfully, (Signed) LEONARD POTTS, Town Clerk. The Clerk, London County Council, Education Department, Victoria Embankment, W.C. The Electrolytic Fluid will neither stain nor discolour the floors and seats* of the class-rooms, for as well as disinfecting, it bleaches, which is an advantage over some other disinfectants. It is non-poisonous. At the time of writing this report the matter is receiving the attention of the Education Department of the London County Council. Swimming Baths—this use therein of Electrolytic fluid.† In September, 1909, with permission of Mr. Councillor Barge, the then Chairman of the Baths and Wash-houses Committee, experiments were made in order to determine if the water in * Its use is very essential for spraying the seats in the babies' class-rooms. † As this Report is going to press some adverse criticisms are appearing in the Public Press to the effect that the Council is adding the Electrolytic Fluid in order to save the use of fresh water. This statement is absolutely untrue; in fairness to the Public and to the Council I take this opportunity to deny it, and to state most definitely it is an absolute mis-statement founded on misrepresentation. The Council has not this parsimonious object in view in seeking to provide their bathing supporters with the most wholesome bathe possible Neither is the Council's object to disinfect the bathers, another misrepresentation. The fact is a swimming bath cannot be emptied, cleansed and refilled at all times, so the Council desires to keep the water clean, sweet and pure as far as possible for the afternoon bathers after it has been unavoidably polluted by those of the morning] 81 the swimming baths of the Borough could be kept pure, purified, or sterilised by means of the Electrolytic Fluid. Mr. Councillor Barge devoted a large amount of time to this most important matter. Mr. Councillor Barge was present at the experiments, and the then Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee was also present and took part in one of the experiments. For financial reasons water in public swimming baths cannot be constantly changed, and it is obvious that after a large number of persons have bathed in the same water, more especially persons who have no convenient and proper bathing arrangements in their own homes, the water must become charged with impurities, polluted with organic matter and permeated with bacteria— the organic matter from the bodies forming a good medium for the bacteria to feed upon and thereby multiply; moreover, it cannot be concealed that swimming baths may, without detection, be used by persons who are unconsciously or otherwise suffering from communicable disease or from such diseases as may have a tendency to further pollute, i.e., skin maladies. In the act of swimming, as in all other exercises, the skin helps to eliminate the waste matter accumulating in the blood due—so to speak —to the expenditure of the fuel which maintains the swimmer's energy. This waste matter with perspiration is also absorbed by the water. It is a well-known fact that the water in swimming baths remains clearer longer at the latter part than at the first part of the bathing season for the simple reason that skins of some of the habitual bathers become more and more cleansed, t * In order to give some idea of the size of the germs of disease, and the tremendous vital activity possessed by them, which disinfection aims at destroying, I will quote Cohn, who estimated that a single bacillus weighs about 0.000,000,000,024,243,672 of a grain; forty thousand millions, 1 grain; 289 billions, 1 pound. After twenty-four hours the descendants from a single bacillus would weigh of a grain; after two days, over a pound; after three days, sixteen and half million pounds, or 7,366 tons. Of course, these figures would apply if there were a continual supply of food, and no impediments—which, fortunately for us, are many—to the growth of such germs, fresh air and sunlight being our ohief protectors. "Let us assume," says Cohn, " that a microbe divides into two within an hour, then again into eight in the third hour, and so on. The number of microbes thus produced in twenty-four hours would exoeed sixteen and a half millions; in two days they would increase to forty-seven trillions; and in a week the number expressing them would be made up of fifty-one figures. At the end of twenty-four hours the microbes descended from a single individual would occupy 1/40th of a hollow cube, with edges 1/25th of an inch long, but at the end of the following day would fill a space of 27 cubic inches, and in less than five days their volume would equal that of the entire ocean." † At the public baths of the Borough for the sum of one penny a child can have a 82 There is no doubt that from the comparative roughness of the surface and the porous and uneven nature of the interstices between the glazed bricks lining the bath, numerous germs are harboured and the growth of these germs helps to render the bath water impure. The ordinary scrubbing and cleansing, however well applied, cannot be entirely successful in the dislodgement of the whole of this accumulation of bacteria, which makes it necessary to resort to some process of sterilization to render what may be remaining inert. The temperature of the bath water is usually kept at 72 degrees, and it must be remembered that for germs taking part in the ordinary processes of putrefaction the temperature of warm summer weather—68 to 76 degrees—may be taken as the average optimum. Varying in time according to the number of bathers, particularly in summer, within twenty-four hours changes—without doubt due to the rapid growth of bacteria—are noticed in the water of a swimming bath.* It assumes a darkish colour, and if left in the bath grows still darker; at the bottom of the bath it becomes somewhat slimy and there is a feeling of stickiness about the body after bathing. When the used water is drawn off this slime leaves the bottom of the bath in a slippery condition and consequently difficult to stand upon when scrubbing and cleansing is in progress; the slime also emits an offensive odour which has a tendency to produce nausea and sore throat. Slime with grease is also deposited on the tiles at the water level; this should be removed by washing with strong hot soda water when the bath is emptied. Mr. Councillor Barge, the then Chairman of the Baths and Washhouses Committee, who had closely followed the experiments daily, considered the baths should be emptied and re-filled with fresh water as usual. He was of opinion the object of the scheme should be not so much to save water, as to give the bathers a pure bath and prevent the spread of disease, by sterilising the water and interior surfaces of the bath, and oxidising, as far as possible, the organic substances that must private warm bath, and for a like sum men and women can obtain a private cold bath. For the sum of two pennies men and women can have a private warm bath. In the above cases one towel is provided, bathers can bring their own soap or purchase a piece at the bath for the sum of a half-penny. The use of a second towel can be obtained for one half-penny, or a rough Turkish towel for one penny. * In fact, even in hot weather, after a few hours, changes will be noticed in swimming bath water without any bathers polluting it. Without doubt these changes are due to the water remaining still in a covered building and in a receptacle which has not been sterilised. 83 necessarily be present having regard to the large number of persons using the bath. It was patent to observers that the water kept clear for a longer period and was more refreshing to bathers with the Electrolytic Fluid in it than without it. The opinion of masters and mistresses attending with the boys and girls from the schools was that the water, by the addition of the Electrolytic fluid, was fresher, and more invigorating, and had lost its body odour. The secretary of a swimming club on Tuesday night, 14th September, stated that the members felt much fresher, and had lost that " dead feeling" when coming out of the bath. A voluntary statement was made by one of the women employed in the laundry by the Council that the swimming costumes of the men and women have no unpleasant odour since the fluid had been used in the bath water; she stated that previously they gave off a most unpleasant odour. This was not to be wondered at having regard to the result of the bacteriological examination of a sample of the water reported upon to the Committee. After the bath had been run out, the Superintendent stated that there was an absence of the slime usually found at the deep end of the bath. The cleansing of the bottom and sides of the bath was much more easily accomplished. The water of a swimming bath becomes discoloured after being used by only a few bathers; as mentioned above the germs from the body multiply enormously (see foot-note, page 81), the warm temperature at which the bath water is kept being favourable to their growth and development; and it is noticed by the Attendants that it very soon gives off bad odours after a number of bathers have used it; therefore if anything can be done to arrest and destroy these growths it must be advantageous not only to the health of the users of the baths, but indirectly to the health of the public at large. A single contingent of bathers will pollute the water of a swimming bath, consequently, where there are a number of bathers the water should be renewed several times during the day, but as this cannot be done, it must be good to endeavour to keep the water sterile whilst the bathers are in it. 84 Bathing in a swimming bath is not like bathing in a pure flowing stream. Large out-door swimming baths, unless supplied with running water or unless the water is frequently changed and the bottom of the lake cleansed must be a source of danger to the bathers. It is obviously healthier to bath in water three or four days old which is kept pure by the addition of Electrolytic fluid, than to bathe in water which is polluted by the bathers after a few hours' use when the fluid is not added to the bath. It is undoubted folly to overlook the very obvious and insidious dangers of public swimming baths, for it cannot be concealed the contaminated water of swimming baths may be the cause of many communicable diseases. There is a strong probability that consumption may be contracted from the sputum* and emanations and discharges from the mucous membrane of the nose and mouth of the bathers, for it must be remembered it is a common occurrence for the bath water to enter the mouths (and is of course at once expelled into the bath) by at least a goodly number of bathers who neglect oral hygiene whereby portions of food accumulate between the teeth; particularly when they may have diseased and uncleansed teeth. It is possible that involuntary micturition may take place in the bath through the temperature of the water being lower than the body, thereby causing the kidneys to act more freely than usual. Again, in a common bath communicable diseases may be contracted from the washing of the external parts of the bathers bodies. Should a bather happen to have had Typhoid Fever and be a "carrier" of the germ, it is obvious how dangerous becomes his presence in a public swimming bath. Another discomforting fact is further presented that during the rainy weather mud finds ready access to the only too expansive openings in the boots of many children who use the baths, and here again is a filthy source of pollution. Care is taken by the attendants to see that all children with dirty feet wash them before entering the bath, but the cleansing is perfunctory, and all children cannot even be so treated for the reason that time prevents such a proceeding. Dust and dirt also get into the bath-water from the hair of the girls who • For years endeavours have been made to stop the ravages of the White Plague, the Local Government Board have issued Regulations dealing with Pulmonary Tuberculosis, the Oaths Act has come into operation, Acts of Parliament have been passed, and at the present time further legislation is proceeding to prevent consumption. County Councils and Local Authorities exhibit notices on highways, in public places and in public conveyances requesting persons not to spit, pointing out the dangers of the filthy practice, and drawing attention to the penalties for infringement of the bye-laws. In swimming baths spitting goes on to an enormous extent, and the sputum from one person may directly enter the mouth and stomach of another. The public shuts its eyes to this danger, and the reformer is dubbed a faddist when he mentions it. 85 cannot wash their heads so readily as the boys. It is an acknowledged fact that water in a swimming bath is always dirtier after use by girls than after being used by boys. And so on may be depicted the horrors of bathing in contaminated swimming-bath water, to say nothing of the livestock from the heads and bodies of dirty bathers.* It is satisfactory to know that the Baths Superintendents are fully alive to the horrors and dangers of the swimming baths, and they do all in their power to safeguard the public health, as from time to time they skim (by means of a scum cloth) the water, overflow it, and as far as possible remove sputum, other objectionable matter floating on the surface, and clear by means of a net on a long pole any substances seen at the bottom of the bath. A bacteriological examination of the water of a swimming bath which had been in use for three days showed that it was polluted with practically dilute sewage. Of the bacteria the bacillus Coli Communis was present in the greatest proportion. This bacillus is the chief organism present in the small intestine in normal conditions, and with many other bacteria it also inhabits the large intestine. No comment is necessary to account for the presence of this bacillus in the water—the reason must be only too obvious, † Habitual frequenters of swimming baths, in their enthusiasm, should not close their eyes and hoodwink themselves to these existing dangers, but should endeavour to assist to keep the water of swimming baths as sweet and wholesome as possible. "The nation's health is the nation's wealth." Some habitues of swimming baths clamour for the baths to be supplied daily with fresh water instead of adding Electrolytic Fluid, but do these captious persons realise the financial aspect of the case? Thousands of gallons of water at 6d. per 1,000 gallons, and about three tons of fuel for each of the four large baths to raise the temperature of the water. Emptying and filling a swimming bath every day means a large amount of labour, consequently extra hands would have to be employed at night when the bath is emptied, washed and refilled, and then there must not be lost sight of the time taken up in cleaning the dressing boxes. Without doubt the daily emptying and purifying of the swimming baths and refilling them with fresh water is an ideal state of affairs, but this * See Addendum at end of Report. † It is indeed strange that in these days of sanitation, thousands of school children —during a week—should bathe in slimy water containing Bacilli Coli Communis and sputum; wipe themselves with a towel and return to school. The Poplar Borough Council's action to prevent bathing in such polluted water should be upheld by the public, more especially as school-masters have stated that the boys smell fresher now than in previous years after coming from the baths. 86 cannot be carried out at all events in the Borough of Poplar, where as matters stand at the present time the baths are kept open at a great financial loss to the ratepayers. Anyone who respects his health and desires to enjoy in comfort a good wholesome clean bathe, let him far rather go to the Bow Baths in the Roman Boad, or to any of the other baths in the Borough, pay a few pence (one penny if a child and two pennies if an adult), than patronise in Victoria Park the free and unrestricted bathing open-air lake frequented by thousands of all sorts and conditions of human beings who must obviously pollute the water to such an extent that here no comment is necessary, for such a state of affairs tells its own tale, but some folk will go into any kind of water, never considering the danger of doing so, as long as they can obtain a swim. Where filtration and aeration is carried out in public baths, it is noticed the filters become covered with distinctly offensive slime (aforementioned), occasioning much and continued cleansing of the filters; and then again unless the bath is entirely emptied and cleansed slime still remains at the bottom. Moreover, most swimmers have a decided objection to bathing in filtered water which has been in use for a long period, as they know fully well that evacuations from the body have been absorbed by the bath water. The addition of Electrolytic Fluid, as made in Poplar, to the bath water has a decidedly effective action on impurities in the water, and to have swimming baths cleansed and refilled frequently with fresh water and Electrolytic Fluid is strongly to be recommended as a most efficient way to deal with the lurking dangers to which attention has been drawn.* The water being kept clear, through the addition of the fluid, the bottom of the bath is visible, so that the attendants are enabled, by means of a net at the end of a long pole, to remove masses of dark coloured, flocculent matter. These masses consist of hair from the heads of the girls and fluff from the bathing costumes, which become worked together by the movement of the water and settle to the bottom of the bath when the water becomes still. After girls have used a swimming bath, hairribbons can be seen and removed. It is an advantage to be able to see to remove the fluffy masses mentioned above, as, upon being disturbed by the bathers, the masses disperse in the water and may enter the mouths of swimmers and probably be swallowed. For cleansing the dressing boxes and the side paths of the baths the Electrolytic Fluid is certainly better than phenol preparations, for should 87 any of the fluid be splashed (which it is difficult to avoid) into the bath water it does not matter. To keep the water in the swimming baths pure and free from germs is an object to be desired, more especially when such an object can be effected, for a short time at all events, at a cost of a few shillings. The Superintendents of the Baths of the Borough must be commended for the great interest they evince in keeping the swimming baths and dressing boxes (where disease and dirt may lurk) thoroughly cleansed. A large amount of labour is expended in this work and much time is occupied late in the evening when the baths are closed to the public. Full reports upon the whole matter (general, chemical and bacteriological) were furnished to the Baths and Wash-houses Committee, and appear in the Minutes of the Council under date 30th September, 1909. The Baths and Washhouses Committee reported to the Council that they were satisfied with the results of the experiments in connection with the Swimming Baths at Poplar, and had authorised the use of the disinfecting fluid in the whole of the Council's Swimming Baths.* The * The electrolytic disinfectant manufactured at Poplar is practically a solution containing hypochlorite of magnesia, which has the advantage of being non-caustic, non-acid and non-poisonous. Other hypochlorites belong to the caustic and alkali and alkaline-like earth groups of substances. A hypochlorite of magnesia belongs to the magnesia group, and for commercial purposes can only be made cheaply by the aid of electricity. When the Electrolytic Fluid is added to water containing organic matter, a powerful oxidisation takes place and any bacteria present are killed, the active part of the sterilising fluid being used up, and when the fluid is added in its proper proportion there is left behind practically a very weak solution of sea water. Without doubt the great difficulty and anxiety will be fully appreciated which were experienced in the repeated trials and observations for determining the right quantity and strength of Electrolytic Fluid which should be added to the water of the swimming baths in order to hit the happy medium so as to keep the water pure and not to inconvenience the bathers. In the report to the Baths and Wash-houses Committee at their meeting of the 23rd September, 1909, it was suggested after laboratory experiments with water which had been in use for some days that— "Into the four baths, each containing over 70,000 gallons of water, 40 gallons "(4 carboys) of Electrolytic Fluid should be added when the baths are filled, and "be put in while the bath is being filled in order that the fluid and bath water "may be thoroughly mixed ; 20 gallons (2 carboys)should be added the next night, "and 20 gallons the third night, making 80 gallons (8 carboys) in all for each "filling. The fluid which is added after the first night should be emptied into the " water at as many points as possible so as to get it equally distributed, "† " Into the smaller, second-class, swimming bath at Poplar, containing 39,000 "gallons, on the night of filling 20 gallons (2 carboys) of Electrolytic Fluid should " be added, 10 gallons (1 carboy) on the second night, 10 gallons on the third night " (40 gallons in all, or 4 carboys), applied in the same manner as to the large baths. † It is a good plan to pour the fluid into a bucket from which it can be scattered into the bath water. 88 Committee also reported that they had appointed a Sub-Committee to confer with the Medical Officer as to the use of the disinfectant in the slipper baths "When the baths are newly filled the Electrolytic Fluid should always be "added during the filling, but the later additions should be governed by the " number of bathers and the condition of the water." No hard and fast rule is laid down respecting the later additions, each Bath Superintendent must use his discretion. If there have not been many bathers and the condition of the water remains good some days may elapse before the second addition is necessary, and the same remarks apply to the third addition. In practice these amounts were varied and for some months 40, 30 and '20 gallons for the large baths and 20, '20 and 10 gallons for the small bath were substituted, but whilst this report is being written the quantities have again been altered to 30, 20 and 20 gallons for the three large baths of over 80,000 gallons, 20, 20 and 20 gallons for the large bath in Poplar holding 75,000 gallons and 10, 10 and 10 gallons to the small Poplar bath, to see if these smaller additions would bring about beneficial results. The fluid must be well mixed and evenly distributed in the bath water. The strength of the fluid is now kep as near as possible at 2.5* grammes of chlorine per litre. In the first trials and for some considerable time afterwards the strength of the fluid was 4.2 to 4.5 grammes of chlorine per litre, but it was from time to time reduced until it reached that mentioned above. After a number of bathers have used the same water and polluted it a slight chlorous odour is noticed in the atmosphere of the baths (instead of the usual sickening "body smell"), due to the Electrolytic Fluid working upon the organic matter- oxidisation is taking place and chlorine compounds, most powerful germicides and deodorants are being given off. So long as this slight chlorous smell*—which might be really termed the "indicator"—is noticed, the Electrolytic Fluid is active, oxidising the organic matter, and either killing the germs or inhibiting their growth. It is obvious that swimming bath water which has had Electrolytic Fluid added to it previous to being used and has given off a chlorous odour after a number of bathers (say 1,500, for this number of persons may use the same water in the large baths of the district) have polluted the water and ceases to give off this faint chlorous odour, either more Electrolytic Fluid should be added or the water should be discharged into the sewers. For reasons which need not be entered into the latter course should be adopted. Ventilation is a most important item in maintaining the hygiene of a swimming bath. It is necessary in a confined building to have good constant ventilation to remove the sickening "body smell" due to a number of human beings undergoing exercise. Efficient ventilation is not only essential for health but will help to preserve the water. As already staled on page 83 it is noticed by the Attendants that it very soon gives off bad odours after a number of bathers have used it. When a solution of Electrolytic Fluid is used for washing out the dressing boxes and cleansing the bath generally, the "body smell" is not so much noticed, but good ventilation is necessary so that the faint chlorous smell may be carried away. The bath should not only be well ventilated during the day but as much as possible throughout the night, for when a large body of polluted water has had added to it Electrolytic Fluid faint vapour will rise due to the process of oxidisation going on in the water. The capacity of each of the five Baths in the Borough is as follows:— Poplar: 1st Class 75,000 gallons 2nd Class 39,000 „ Bow: 1st Class 85,000 „ 2nd Class 82,000 „ Isle of Cogs 82,000 „ 363,000 „ * Sufficient to give about 1 part available chlorine to 2 millions of water, † A well-known analyst states that this chlorous smell is due to chlorine compounds acting upon organic matter—saliva, perspiration, filth, etc. To face page 88 Annual Report, 1909. Swimming Baths—The Use therein of Electrolytic Fluid. It is very questionable whether the slight chlorous smell (mentioned on page 88) can now be detected because the strength of the fluid is kept at l.5 and 2.0 grammes of chlorine per litre for the Poplar and other baths respectively, as this strength from the appearance and condition of the bath water appears to be sufficient—for the time being at all events—either to kill the bacteria, or to inhibit their growth. The same quantities are added as mentioned on page 88, and the chlorine per 100 gallons, of the bath water is 3.38 grains (large bath) and 3.48 grains (small bath) for each addition in Poplar: 5.1, 3.4, and 3.4 grains of chlorine per 100 gallons of bath water for the Bow and Island Baths. See addendum at end of Annual Report Page 259a. 89 In conclusion I must cordially thank Mr. Bowden, the Borough Electrical Engineer, and his staff for the kindly advice and assistance which they have at all times willingly afforded in order that the undertaking should continue to be successful. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897.* The Council is empowered by the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, to give any person applying on the ground that he is infested with vermin, free use of any apparatus for cleansing his person and clothing, and may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants for this purpose. Provision was made in 1905 for cleansing verminous persons. During the year 647 persons had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfested. Since the notices were posted throughout the Borough a total of 3,570 persons had applied for baths, etc., as mentioned above. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1907, CHILDREN ACT, 1908, VERMINOUS CHILDREN ATTENDING SCHOOLS AND VERMINOUS PERSONS IN COMMON LODGING HOUSES, SHELTER.* Proposed New Shelter and Disinfesting (Bathing) Accommodation . London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, and Children Act, 1908. Under Section 38 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, and Section 122 (3) of the Children Act, 1908, the London • Verminous Rooms, London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, see page 177. 90 County Council may utilise for cleansing verminous children under these Acts, premises and apparatus provided by the Borough Council for cleansing the person and clothing of persons infested with vermin, upon such payment (if any) as may be agreed, or, in default, settled by the Local Government Board. Negotiations with the London County Council for cleansing verminous school children, under the Acts referred to, have been for some time in progress.* During the year 96 school children were bathed and their clothes disinfested (see Miss Tattersall's report, pages 243 and 244). Proposed New Shelter and Disinfesting (Bathing) Accommodation. The Works Committee reported to the Council that in view of the completion of the new Dust Destructor, it was desirable the Infectious Diseases Shelter† at Bromley Depot should be discontinued there in order that the cottage forming part of the shelter might be available for the Destructor foreman, who should live on the spot to ensure the efficient working of the Destructor plant, and it was also advisable the workshop forming the remainder of the present temporary shelter should be freed for use by the Works Department. It was suggested that the Council's former depot in Old Ford Road might be utilised for erection of a shelter, and in order that a scheme might be prepared and considered the Borough Surveyor communicated with the London County Council with a view to sanction being obtained for erection of the shelter on this site if so decided. The estimated cost was £2,650. *Whilst this report is being written the Public Health and Housing Committee reported to the Council they bad directed that the London County Council Education Committee be informed that the exclusive use of baths at the existing Cleansing Station will be available between 9 a.m. and 12 noon for the cleansing, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, and the Children Act, of 12 verminous school children, at a fee of 2s. for each bath, including disinfection of clothing. The Council is bound under Section 60 (4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to provide temporary shelter for members of any family in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their dwellings for the purposo of enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the Council. During the year one scarlet fever contact had used the shelter. 91 The London County Council was prepared to sanction the building, subject to conditions as to building, and to the dedication of a narrow strip of land to be thrown into Old Ford Road. These conditions were embodied in a document required to be sealed by the Council. The sealing was agreed to by the Council, but it did not commit the Council to proceed with the scheme, which was not carried out as it was considered the position was not sufficiently central. Whilst this report is being written the Public Health and Housing Committee had under consideration the present provision of shelter accommodation and of bathing and disinfesting facilities. In view of the desire of the Works Committee to obtain possession of the premises at present in use, the Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion arrangements should be made to provide new shelter accommodation, including means for isolation of contacts during epidemics of infectious disease: also that accommodation should be provided on the same site for cleansing verminous persons and disinfesting their clothing, with sufficient suitable provision for treatment of verminous children sent from the Schools, under agreement with the London County Council. The Committee considered the most economical and convenient arrangement would be to provide the necessary accommodation on a site adjacent to the present disinfecting station, in a form involving as moderate a capital cost as possible, and the site adjoining the stone yard in Glaucus Street appeared to be the most suitable. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that, subject to the consent of the London County Council being obtained to the proposed buildings, the vacant land adjoining the stone yard in Glaucus Street be rented and a Shelter and Disinfesting House be erected thereon, in accordance with the plan and specification of the Borough Surveyor, at an estimated cost of £1,260.

The Port Medical Officer was so informed by letter dated 10th December. H 94 GLANDERS, ANTHRAX,* AND HYDROPHOBIA IN MAN. Extension of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; Case of Anthrax in Man; London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907 ; Case of Anthrax in a Mare. In 1908 the Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from the Local Government Board on the subject of representations made by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries as to the desirability, with a view to checking the spread of such diseases, of information being afforded by the Medical Officer of Health to the Clerk to the Local Authority under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, of cases or suspected cases of glanders, anthrax and hydrophobia in man. In order to afford this information the Local Government Board stated it is necessary a means of notification should be adopted, and the Board would be prepared to favourably consider an application for their approval of a resolution of the Council for extending to the diseases in question the provisions of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Fourteen days' notice to members of the Council as required by Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was given on the 22nd December, 1908. The London County Council gave notice that at a meeting held on the 23rd day of March, 1909, it made an " Order " that Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the notification of infectious disease shall apply in the Administrative County of London to the diseases known as Glanders, Anthrax and Hydrophobia in Man. The Order was approved by the Local Government Board and came into operation on the 26th April. A Case of Anthrax in Man. A notification was received on 1st April from the London Hospital of a case of Anthrax. The patient lived in Morville Street, Bow. The • Woolsorter's disease, or splenic fever, or malignant pustule. 95 notification was duly forwarded to the Chief Inspector of Factories, Home Office.

In 1907 the male aged 14 years was again notified to be suffering from Enteric Fever. (During his first illness in 1906 he was away three months.) In the months of July and September, 1909, samples of the urine and stools of the members of the family who had recovered from the fever, as well as some members who had not bee attacked, were examined at the Lister Institute with negative results. 104 54 cases of Typhoid Fever were notified during the year, but in many instances no causes or predisposing influences were stated. Errors in Diagnosis. Seven cases sent to various hospitals, 5 in Poplar, 1 in Bromley; and 1 in Bow were certified (see list pages 57-59) as not suffering from Typhoid Fever:—so that in the 54 notified cases, 7 patients were certified from hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board* as not suffering from the complaint (see page 60).

Bacteriological Examinations. 124 swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria were forwarded for bacteriological examination to the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine.* The Bacillus Diphtheriæ was isolated in 35 instances (28.22 per cent.), and the Pseudo Diphtheritic Bacillus in 16 cases. On 9th December, 1909, a letter was received from the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine with reference to the transmission of reports on the results of bacteriological examinations for the Bacillus of Diphtheria and therein it was stated as follows:— "All specimens from suspected cases of Diphtheria in your district received before 10 a.m. on week-days (Saturdays excepted), will be reported on if Positive the same evening between 5.30 and 6 p.m. by telegram, telephone or post, either to you, or to the sender of the specimen, as you may prefer. If the result is Negative no report will be sent until confirmed by the next morning's examination. "All specimens received at any time on Saturdays up to 10 p.m. will be reported upon by telegram or telephone to the senders of the specimens on Sunday forenoons if required, and the results will be confirmed by post to you on Mondays, but it is requested that the Institute may be informed whether your Council desire reports on Sundays and will authorise the cost of telegrams when it is not possible to telephone." The old arrangement was that, providing the specimen was received at the Lister Institute before 6 p.m., the result of the examination was forwarded to the Public Health Offices at about noon the following day, but if the specimen were received at the Institute either on Saturday or later than 6 p.m. on any other week-day, a day elapsed before the result of the examination was known at these Offices. On 10th December, 1909, the Assistant Secretary of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, was written to as follows:— "The Caretaker of these Offices understands the transmission * See page 61. 109 of the reports to the Medical Practitioners and is always here, therefore I should be pleased to receive reports by telegrams addressed to me at these Offices as heretofore and also on Sundays (forenoon)." It is preferable to have the result in writing (telegram) as messages sent through the telephone are liable to be misunderstood. This new arrangement will hasten the removal to hospital or isolation at home of patients suffering from Diphtheria. Errors in Diagnosis. See pages 57-59 as to cases of Diphtheria admitted into Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals which were certified as not having the complaint. No deductions have been made in respect of these patients. Condition of Housk Drainage.

Isolation. 64 cases in Poplar (sub-district), 69 in Bromley, and 33 in Bow were removed to hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Two patients from Poplar (sub-district) were treated in the East London Hospital for Children, one patient from Bromley was treated in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and one patient from Bow was treated in the Sick Asylum. So that 170 patients out of 210 notified cases in the Borough were isolated. 110 WHOOPING COUGH. Deaths. Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES AND OUTWORKERS. TRADE BOARDS ACT, 1909, (see page 186) PROPOSED ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR. Registers and Inspections. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 127 and 128. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. k 126 The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,337, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 127, and Tables C and D, pages 130 and 131. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 243 and 244, and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 200, 203, 209, 219, 222, 232 and 238. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 61. Trade Boards Act, 1909. (seh: page186). Proposed Abolition of Child Labour. Before the Labour Exchanges Act, 1909, became law the Council, upon the recommendation of the General Purposes Committee, passed a resolution urging upon His Majesty's Government the promotion of legislation for the abolition of child labour, whether half time or otherwise, up to 16 years of age. A special form is submitted by the. Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 130 to 133) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks far the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops,* and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Table A, under "Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 18 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were "Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 127 TABLE A.

London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 9.—Vendors of Fried Fish, Fish Curers and Rag and Bone Dealers.—Proposed Bye-Laws. The London County Council submitted draft Bye-laws relating to the conduct of the businesses of a Vendor of Fried Fish, Fish Curer and a Rag and Bone Dealer as follow:— Fried Fish Vendor and Fish Curer. Present vendors or curers are to give notice to the London County Council and Borough Council of name of owner, and address at which business is carried on. Vendors and curers newly established are to give notice before making alterations to premises, fittings or apparatus, and to furnish plans if required. There are also provisions for enforcing cleanliness, and prohibiting nuisance from effluvium or smoke; also for regulating structure and 139 fittings in newly established businesses. Yards used are to be properly paved and drained. Rag and Bone Dealer. Notice of name of owner, and address of business to be given to the London County Council and Borough Council. Rags, refuse or other materials from dust carts, dust wharf, or refuse heap not to be allowed on premises. Bones and fat to be removed at least twice a week from May to October (inclusive), and once a week during remainder of year. Rags, bones, fat, skins, etc., are to be stored or manipulated in a properly constructed room as specified. There are also provisions for enforcing cleanliness and proper repair of premises. The London County Council was prepared to consider representations from Borough Councils as to amending or altering the Bye-laws. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the Bye-laws are reasonable and necessary, and recommended the Council— That the draft Bye-laws submitted by the London County Council, with reference to the conduct of the businesses of a vendor of fried fish, a fish curer, and a rag and bone dealer, be approved. COFFEE SHOPS, EATING-HOUSES, FRIEDFISH SHOPS, HOTELS & RESTAURANTS, ETC.* London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908.—Sanitary Regulations for Premises used for Sale, etc., of Food for Human Consumption. The number of premises in the Borough where food is sold or prepared for sale is 294 : 148 Poplar, 79 Bromley, and 67 Bow. (See Table A, page 127). * See Tables A and C, pages 127 and 130. 140 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. 1041 visits were paid to these premises during the year and the Sanitary Regulations under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 8, were enforced. Want of cleanliness was found in 178 instances, and 74 other defects existed. 125 intimations were served, which in 25 cases were followed up by Statutory notices and two final notices, but no legal proceedings were taken. A register of these premises is kept. See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 200, 203, 204, 210, 218, 221, 231, 232 and 239. HAIR-DRESSERS' PREMISES. The hairdressers' premises were inspected during the year. MILKSHOPS. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908.—Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Register Names of Dairymen in certain circumstances; London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1910.

At the end of the year there were in the Borough 341 registered premises (including 15 cow-houses, 3 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 7 Bow) 141 where milk is sold, 109 Poplar, 139 Bromley and 93 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspectors' reports pages, 199, 204, 209, 218, 223, 233 and 239. Cleansing of premises was necessary in five instances. 14 other defects were remedied. 20 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 7 Poplar, 9 Bromley and 4 Bow. 44 Premises were on account of change of occupiers re-registered as milkshops, 14 Poplar, 18 Bromley and 12 Bow. The sale of milk was discontinued on 20 premises—8 Poplar, 6 Bromley and 6 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 61. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. Part II. Sanitary Provisions. Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Register Names of Dairymen in certain circumstances. No circumstance arose during the year calling for the enforcement of the power given to the Sanitary Authority under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section (5). See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 199, 204, 209, 218, 223 and 239. London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1910. Part VI. Milk Supply. Unwholesome Milk. Under Sections 33 to 36, the London County Council's Medical Officer or a deputy may take at any railway premises or other place in the County, samples of milk in transit, and if found to contain matter rendering it unwholesome, the sender is liable to penalties; and similar powers are conferred on Borough Councils against vendors in respect of milk offered for sale (other than on railway premises) in their own areas. L 142 Section 37 enables the London County Council to prohibit supply within the County from any dairy outside the County from which unwholesome milk has been supplied, and also to inspect such dairies. Tuberculous Milk. Section 42 enables the London County Council to inspect dairies and cows within the County (and outside the County on a Justice's Order) from which tuberculous milk is suspected. The provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with respect to cows suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, and to the milk from such cows, are extended to cows suffering from any form of tuberculosis or emaciation. (Similar provisions contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908 and 1909, were approved by the Council, but were not proceeded with.)* * In the House of Commons on 7th April, 1910. the London County Council (General Powers) Bill was on the notice paper for second reading. Part VI. contained provisions for dealing with the Milk Supply. On the motion for the second reading of the Bill, Mr. Courthope moved its rejection as an amendment. He admitted that milk legislation was necessary, but he objected to the piece-meal proposals of the Bill. After the amendment had been seconded by Mr. Stanier, Mr. Walter Guinness, who spoke on behalf of the London County Council, said that, that Body would have preferred general legislation. After Mr. Walter Guinness had finished his speech, Mr. Emmott, Chairman of Ways and Means, asked the House to pass the second reading, and to take a division with regard to the milk supply, on the motion that it should be an instruction to the Select Committee to delete from the Bill the clauses relating to this subject. Mr. Courthope assented to this course. The Bill was read a second time without a division. Mr. Courthope then moved that it should be an instruction to the Committee to delete Part vi. (Milk Supply). After further speeches by members, among whom were Mr. Burns (President of the Local Government Board) and Mr. Walter Long, a division was taken, and ther voted— For the Motion 85 Against the Motion 81 Majority for the Motion 4 It was therefore ordered that it be an instruction to the Committee on the Bill to delete Part VI. (Milk Supply). 143 ICE-CREAMS. About the middle of the year 1909, all the known premises within the Borough where ice-creams are manufactured were inspected. There are 142 such premises within the Borough, 61 Poplar, 47 Bromley and 34 Bow. (See Table A, page 127.) Cleansing of premises was necessary in 24 instances. 39 other nuisances were remedied. See Inspectors' reports, pages 199, 204, 210, 218, 225, 232 and 239. SMOKE NUISANCES. Conference convened by the London County Council and proposed Amendment of the Law; London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1910, Part IV.— Smoke Nuisance. 61 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year:—12 Bow East, 4 Bow West, 14 North Bromley, 7 Bromley Central, 7 East combined, 8 West combined, and 9 Poplar South. 41 intimations and 25 statutory notices were served. No summonses were applied for. Conference convened by the London County Council and proposed Amendment of Law. At a Conference convened by the London County Council on the question of obtaining an amendment of the law with a view to dealing more effectively with nuisance from smoke, the following proposed amendments were approved, viz.:— Resolved—That Section 24 (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which provides that "any chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling house) sending forth black smoke in such quantities as to be a nuisance," shall be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under the Act, should be amended by the deletion of the word "black." 144 Resolved—That the word "chimney" in Section 24 (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, should be deemed to include— (i.) Openings through which smoke is emitted from buildings or places in which processes of manufacture are carried on, and the chimneys of any building or place where furnaces are used in operations carried on under statutory powers. (ii.) The chimneys of any Government workshop or factory. Resolved—That in special cases of nuisance arising under Sections 23 and 24 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the proceedings in respect of any nuisance may, at the request of, and by agreement with the Sanitary Authority, be taken by the London County Council in such special cases. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the recommendations of the Conference be approved and supported. London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1910. Part IV.—Smoke Nuisance. Section 20 amends the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by deleting the word "black" in Section 24, under which any chimney (other than of a dwelling house) sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance may be dealt with by prosecution of the persons responsible. Section 24 is also extended to include factories owned or used by the Crown and places in which any process is carried on under statutory powers, and the word "chimney" is to include any opening through which smoke is emitted. Section 21 enables the London County Council, at the request of the Borough Council, to enforce the provisions of Section 23 of the Public Health (London) Act, requiring that furnaces and steam vessels shall consume their own smoke, and gives power to the London County Council to enforce the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, with reference to smoke nuisance in cases where cause of nuisance arises outside the county and in cases where it arises on premises of a Metropolitan Borough Council. 145 FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS Result of Analyses; Legal Proceedings; Preservatives in Butter; Proposed Issuing of Regulations under Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, with regard to Cheese; Proposed Amendment of Sale of Food and Drugs Acts as to Warranties in the case of Milk.

Five samples (8-0 per cent.) were found to be adulterated, and legal proceedings were instituted in each instance against the itinerant vendor. In 18 instances samples were taken on delivery at institutions within the Borough—viz., 3 Poplar Union, 1 Guardians Out-Relief, Upper North Street, 5 Sick Asylum, 4 Blackwall Sick Asylum, and 5 Stepney Union Workhouse. All the samples were genuine. 146 Result of Analyses. Of these 369 samples, legal proceedings were instituted in 17 cases.

The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Battersea Borough Council, Town Hall, Battersea, S.W., 29th December, 1909. Dear Sir, My Council have had under consideration the question of the sale of cheese deficient in fat, and have recently caused samples to be taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Some of the samples in question have been certified to be deficient in fat to a considerable extent, and it is felt that proceedings should be instituted against the vendors. The Council are, however, faced by the difficulty that there is at present no official standard fixing a minimum limit for the quantity of fat which cheeses of different kinds should contain. In view of the circumstances, it appears to the Council to be useless to take proceedings in such cases as it is very doubtful whether the Council would obtain convictions in the absence of official standards or minimum limits such as those referred to. I have, therefore, by direction of the Council, addressed a letter to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries drawing their attention to the matter and asking that the Board will be good enough to consider as to issuing Regulations under Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, with regard to cheese. In the event of your Council concurring I am directed to ask that they will kindly support the action of my Council in the matter. Yours faithfully, W. MARCUS WILKINS, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, Poplar. 151 The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the application of the Battersea Borough Council to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to issue Regulations under Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, with regard to cheese, be supported. Proposed Amendment of Sale of Food and Drugs Acts as to Warranties in the case of Milk.—Milk and Dairies Bill, 1910 (see page 192). (8.) A warranty or invoice shall not be available as a defence to any proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907, where the article in respect of which the proceedings are taken is milk. Margarine Act, 1887, Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, and Butter and Margarine Act, 1907. The following is the number of premises in each Sub-District of the Borough registered under the above-mentioned Acts, up to and including 31st December, 1909, viz.:— Sub-District. Margarine. Butter.

Bromley 3 2 1 1 Bow 6 .. 1 2 Totals 9 3 2 3 The above table includes premises registered for two purposes, as follows:— In Bromley the premises of one vendor are registered both for the purposes of manufacturing and for the wholesale dealing in margarine, and the premises of another vendor are registered for the purposes of a wholesale dealer in margarine and milk-blended butter. In Bow two premises are each registered as being used for the purposes of a wholesale dealer in margarine and milk-blended butter. 152 INSPECTION OF FOOD AND EXAMINATION OF UNSOUND FOOD AT WHARVES, Etc. Appointment of Assistant Inspectors under Unsound Food Regulations (First Series), Foreign Meat Regulations, Poplar (First Series, Unsound Food Regulations) Order, 1908, Poplar (Foreign Meat Regulations) Order, 1908; Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc.; Proposal for enforcing cleanliness in cases of barrows and Stalls on which Food is exposed or deposited for sale in the Streets or other places; Conference to consider the Meat Supply of the Kingdom and the present Restrictions on the Importation of Live Cattle for Slaughter. Appointment of Assistant Inspectors under Food Regulations. In January the Council sanctioned the appointment, subject to approval by the Local Government Board, of the Council's several Sanitary Inspectors as Assistant Officers under the General Orders issued in connection with the Foreign Meat and Unsound Food (First Series) Regulations made by the Local Government Board under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, to discharge under the direction of the Medical Officer, all or any of the duties of the Medical Officer under the Regulations. The Local Government Board, however, requested that the matter should be re-considered, with a view to the appointment under the Regulations of such of the Inspectors as the Council considered necessary to carry out the work, and who possess recognised certificates of qualification for food inspection or are qualified by experience in this respect. The Board further required that separate payment should be assigned to the Inspectors selected, in respect of work to be done under the Regulations. There are four wharves at which imported meat or other foods are 153 landed in the Borough, and such foods have been for years past inspected by the Sanitary Inspectors in the ordinary course of their duties. The Sanitary Inspectors for the districts in which these wharves are situated are Messrs. C. Foad, J. Bullock and J. Johnson, and the Public Health and Housing Committee expressed to the Local Government Board their readiness to recommend their appointment as Assistant Officers under the General Orders of 12th September, 1908, and the allocation of a nominal proportion (£1 per annum) of each of their present salaries in respect of any work required to be done under the Regulations. The Local Government Board stated they would be prepared to consent to these arrangements when formally approved by the Borough Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council:— "That the proposed appointment of Messrs. C. Foad, J. Bullock and J. Johnson as Assistant Officers under the General Orders of 12th September, 1908, in the administration of the Foreign Meat and Unsound Food (First Series) Regulations, on the conditions stated, be approved, and the Local Government Board so informed." Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc. With respect to the examination of food stuffs see Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 200, 203, 210, 218, 222, 231, 240 and 242. Also, with respect to the examination of food stuffs at wharves, see Inspectors' reports, pages 222, 234 and 240. Proposal as to Provision for enforcing Cleanliness in cases of Barrows and Stalls on which Food is Exposed or Deposited for Sale in the Streets and other places. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee: — London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 28th June, 1909. Sir, Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) 154 Act, 1908, regulates the sanitary condition of premises on which food is sold or prepared for sale, and premises (such as yards, stables and arches) where is stored food to be sold by costermongers on barrows, can be dealt with under this Section, but it does not apply to barrows and other vehicles on which food is exposed for sale. A large amount of foodstuff is sold in London from barrows and stalls, and it appears to a Committee of the Council that some control should be exercised over their sanitary condition. This could be effected if legislation were obtained enabling sanitary authorities to ensure the observation of proper sanitary regulations in regard to articles of food exposed or deposited for sale in the streets and other places to which the provisions of Section 8 of the Act of 1908 do not apply. Before proceeding further in the direction of promoting legislation the Committee would be glad to know whether the several Metropolitan Borough Councils are in favour of the proposed extension of the authority given by Section 8 of the Act of 1908, and they would welcome any suggestions as to the best methods of regulating the sanitary condition of barrows and stalls. I have been directed to ask that the observations of the Borough Councils may be submitted not later than 8th July, 1909, in order that proposals may be submitted to the Council in time for the promotion of legislation in the next session of Parliament. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, enforcing cleanliness on premises where food is prepared for sale, or sold, should be applied also in the cases of barrows and stalls, and directed the London County Council be so informed. The Council approved the action of the Committee. 155 Conference to consider the Meat Supply of the Kingdom and the present restrictions on the importation of Live Cattle for Slaughter. The Greenwich Borough Council directed attention to the danger of the Foreign Beef supply of this country being ultimately controlled by a few American Companies, owing to the fact that live cattle can be imported into this country from North America only, and that these Companies control practically the whole of the live cattle trade, and had also acquired some of the larger undertakings for chilling and shipping beef from Argentina. It was suggested that the present restrictions on the importation of live cattle should be removed to admit of their importation, for slaughter at the port of landing, from countries officially declared free from disease. A Conference on the subject was convened, and the Public Health and Housing Committee appointed the then Chairman, Mr. A. H. Darby, with the Medical Officer of Health, to attend the Conference. The following resolution was adopted at the Conference of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Greenwich Borough Council, at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, on the 12th October, on the subject of the meat supply of the Kingdom, viz.:— "This Conference, after carefully considering the information at its disposal, and bearing in mind the conclusions arrived at by the Departmental Committee appointed to inquire into combinations in the meat trade and also the serious rise which has taken place in the price of beef in the past two years, is of opinion that the meat supply of the Metropolis is in an extremely unsatisfactory position. "This Conference is further of opinion that owing to the failure of the home supply to increase in proportion to the national demand, the decrease in the numbers of live cattle imported and the increased necessity of depending upon the supplies of chilled and frozen meat, it is easier for the trade to be effectually controlled by large and powerful Trusts or Combinations of Companies. "This Conference is further of opinion that the time has arrived when the needs of large Urban Communities, which have 156 to rely to a great extent upon imported meat, call for a relaxation of the present restrictions upon the importation of foreign cattle for immediate slaughter in order that channels, other than tho3e now available, may be opened up for supplying this Country with meat. "That the Mayor of Westminster be requested to ask the Prime Minister to receive a Deputation on the subject in order that this Conference may place its views before the Government. "That copies of the above Resolution be sent to all Members of Parliament representing Metropolitan constituencies, to the Corporation of the City of London, the London County Council, and to the Corporations of Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow, and other large Towns, and the Association of Municipal Corporations." The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the resolution of the Conference be approved and supported. At a further Conference of Representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils, convened by the Greenwich Borough Council to consider the Meat Supply of the Kingdom and the present Restrictions on the Importation of Live Cattle for Slaughter, held (by the courtesy of the Westminster City Council) at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, on Monday, the 28th February, 1910, the following resolutions were passed:— (a) "That the Mayor of Westminster be asked to approach the Prime Minister and urge him to reconsider his refusal to receive a Deputation as asked at the previous Conference"; (b) "That a copy of this Resolution be sent to the London Borough Councils asking whether they will support and are prepared to join in this Deputation": and 000000(c) "That copies of the above Resolution be sent to all Members of Parliament representing Metropolitan Constituencies, to the Corporation of the City of London, the London County Council, and to the Corporations, Cities and Boroughs which have replied to the circular letter sent by this Conference, and asked to use their influence with the Prime Minister to receive a Deputation." 157 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR TO MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. Suggested further Legislation with respect to Furnished Rooms—Proposed License; London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Section 78—Water Supply in Tenement Houses; London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1909—Storage of Food. At the end of the year there were 1,044 houses on the register. For Inspector's report see pages 245 to 248. Legal proceedings were instituted in three instances, see page 184. Suggested further Legislation with respect of Furnished Rooms—Proposed License. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 18th June, 1909. Sir, The Council has under consideration the question of the necessity for the exercise of increased control over a certain type of furnished room, the practice of letting such rooms for short periods, at a rate not exceeding 10s. a week, having recently become more general in various parts of the County of London. This class of room appears to be occupied by persons who are, if anything, of a more degraded character than those frequenting common lodging houses ; the rent is paid daily and the appointments of the rooms are mostly of a very scanty and dilapidated nature, the beds being, in many instances, verminous. The ease with which such rooms can be hired is, moreover, a great incentive to immorality. M 158 It appears to the Council that the bye-laws which have been made by the Councils of the several Metropolitan Boroughs under the provisions of Section 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, do not confer upon sanitary authorities adequate power for dealing with rooms of the above description. It is stated also that considerable difficulty is experienced in putting into operation the provisions of Part IV. of the London County Council (Genera' Powers) Act, 1904, as to the destruction of filthy or unwholesome articles, owing to the frequency with which disputes as to the amount of compensation for articles destroyed arise. The existence of these circumstances has led the Council to consider whether in the interest of public health, further legislation should be sought in respect of furnished rooms so let, to assure that they should be maintained with due regard to sanitation. It appears to the Council to be most desirable that greater supervision and control than exists at present should be exercised over this class of house, which is nearly related in character to the common lodging house, both in respect of the class of house and the social condition of the inmates, and, in fact, the demand for lodgings of this character exists, in the main, in localities where common lodging houses are situated, the lodging house and the furnished rooms not infrequently being owned by the same persons. The Council thinks that more effective control would be more ensured if persons letting such rooms were required to obtain an annual license, to be granted after consideration of the fitness of the applicant and the structure and cleanliness of the premises. Such licenses would be granted by the Council in the same manner as is done with regard to common lodging houses. An alternative means of securing adequate supervision would be by investing the local sanitary authority with full power to inspect and enforce a certain standard of requirements, authority being given to the Council, with the consent of the Local Government Board, in each case to act in default of action by the local sanitary authority. The Council would be glad if the Metropolitan Borough Councils would assist it in its deliberations by furnishing their views as to the means, by licensing or otherwise, by which the sanitary and moral condition of the inmates of these houses could be improved. The Council has no doubt but that this question has already been before the local sanitary authorities, and that 159 those authorities have in their possession valuable information bearing on the subject, and I have to state that the Council will be very glad to receive any information of this nature which is available. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, The Town Clerk of the Clerk of the Council. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee were informed there are very few furnished lodgings of the character indicated in the Borough. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion increased powers of supervision are necessary in such cases, and that powers should be obtained by the London County Council for enforcement by Borough Councils of the washing of bed linen at least once a week, and as often as may be necessary; for requiring provision of sufficient washing accommodation, with towels, etc., and access to an ample water supply and to adequate sanitary conveniences. It is also desirable such premises should be licensed in order to ensure fitness of an applicant for a license, and of the premises for the purpose proposed, such license to be withdrawn where due care is not taken that the rooms are not used for immoral purposes. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the London County Council be so informed. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Section 78—Water Supply in Tenement Houses. In the month of March notices were served under this Act to provide a proper and sufficient water supply at some tenement houses in Bromley. After a short delay the work was carried out and there is now a supply tap and sink on each storey, which, needless to say, are greatly appreciated by the tenants. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1909— Storage of Food. Part III. provides that in any tenement house not so used or occupied 160 before the passing of the Act, the Borough Council may require the owner to provide sufficient and suitable accommodation for storage of food for each family, on the floor or floors on which the rooms occupied by such family are situated, if such provision is practicable. Penalty for noncompliance 40s. and 20s. per day. ["Tenement house" means any house occupied by any person of the working class, wholly or partly let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family.] (See page 190.) HOUSING. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Section 30— Bird-in-Hand Court; Coventry Cross Place; "Black Beetle Alley"; Amendment of the definition of Owner; Conference on Town Planning; Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Section 30— Bird-in-hand Court. Representations were made under Section 30 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, that Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Bird-in-hand Court were in such a state as to be dangerous or injurious to health, and unfit for human habitation. The Public Health and Housing Committee approved the service upon the owner of statutory notices that in default of the houses being made fit for human habitation within 14 days, legal proceedings would be taken to obtain closing orders. The Committee directed proceedings for closing orders be taken, in default, and application made to the Court for authority to pay the tenants of the houses reasonable allowances on account of their expenses of removal, such amount to be recovered from the owner by the Council. The Council approved the action of the Committee. Notices were served upon the owner, the houses were vacated by the tenants and the premises were made fit for human habitation. There was no need to institute legal proceedings. 161 Coventry Cross Place—"Black Beetle Alley." For several years past attention had been given to the sanitary condition of five small dwelling houses, four three-roomed and one tworoomed house, of the back-to-back and no through ventilation kind, respectively, which comprised a small block, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, Coventry Cross Place, colloquially known as "Black Beetle Alley." In December, 1906, proceedings were about to be taken for the closing of No. 4 (the tworoomed premises) which had fallen into a bad state of repair, but the owner closed this house and later on demolished it and cleared the site. Proceedings, no doubt, would have been instituted under the Housing of the Working Classes Act for closing the other four houses, had the owner not closed them. The houses in question were very old, decayed, worn out and were pulled down and site cleared. Amendment of the Definition of Owner. Difficulties having been experienced in taking proceedings under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, by reason of inability to ascertain the name and address of the "owner" of the property affected (i.e., the person having not less than 21 years' unexpired interest in the premises), the Public Health and Housing Committee directed a communication be addressed to the President of the Local Government Board suggesting that the Housing and Town Planning Bill then before a Parliamentary Committee should be amended by the introduction of a clause on similar lines to those of Section 116 (3) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to the effect that any person who collects the rents of, or is interested financially or otherwise in any premises, when requested by or on behalf of the Sanitary Authority to state the name and address of the owner of the premises or of any person interested financially or otherwise in such premises, who refuses or wilfully omits to disclose, or wilfully mis-states the same shall be liable to a penalty. The Council approved the action of the Committee. See Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, Section 49 (2), amendment of definitions for purpose of Part II. of the principal Act. Conference on Town Planning. The Garden Cities and Town Planning Association convened a Conference on Town Planning and its practical application, held at the 162 Guildhall on December 10th; the Lord Mayor presided and invited appointment of delegates. The Public Health and Housing Committee appointed the Chairman and the Medical Officer of Health to attend the Conference. At the Conference on Town Planning convened by the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association, it was agreed that a Central Consultative Town Planning Body should be formed for the purpose of giving advice and assistance upon all matters connected with Town Planning and the better development of our towns. The Council was invited to send representatives to the first meeting of the proposed Consultative Body. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended that Mr. Councillor A. H. Warren be appointed the Council's representative at the first meeting of the proposed Consultative Body on Town Planning. Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909. (9 Edw. 7. Chap. 44.)

Condition as to keeping houses let to persons of the working classes in repair. 15.—(1) The last foregoing section shall, as respects contracts to which that section applies, take effect as if the condition implied by that section included an undertaking that the house shall, during the holding, be kept by the landlord in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. (2) The landlord or the local authority, or any person authorised by him or them in writing, may at reasonable times of the day, on giving twenty-four hours' notice in writing to the tenant or occupier, enter any house, premises, or building to which this section applies for the purpose of viewing the state and condition thereof. (3) If it appears to the local authority within the meaning of Part II. of the principal Act that the undertaking implied by virtue of this section is not complied with in the case of any house to which it applies, the authority shall, if a closing order is not made with respect to the house, by written notice require the landlord, within a reasonable time, not being less than twentyone days, specified in the notice, to execute such works as the authority shall specify in the notice as being necessary to make the house in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. 165 (4) Within twenty-one days after the receipt of such notice the landlord may by written notice to the local authority declare his intention of closing the house for human habitation, and thereupon a closing order shall be deemed to have become operative in respect of such house.

(7) In this section the expression "landlord" means any person who lets to a tenant for habitation the house under any contract referred to in this section, and includes his successors in title; and the expression "house" includes part of a house. (8) Sections forty-nine and fifty of the principal Act as amended by section thirteen of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903 (which relate to the service of notices and the description of owner in proceedings), shall apply for the purposes of this section, with the substitution, where required, of the landlord for the owner of a dwelling-house. 166 (9) Any remedy given by this section for non-compliance with the undertaking implied by virtue of this section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other remedy available to the tenant against the landlord, either at common law or otherwise. Amendment of Procedure for Closing Orders and Demolition Orders. Duty of local authority as to closing of dwelling-house unfit for human habitation. 17.—(1) It shall be the duty of every local authority within the meaning of Part II. of the principal Act to cause to be made from time to time inspection of their district, with a view to ascertain whether any dwelling-house therein is in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and for that purpose it shall be the duty of the local authority, and of every officer of the local authority, to comply with such regulations and to keep such records as may be prescribed by the Board. (2) If, on the representation of the medical officer of health, or of any other officer of the authority, or other information given, any dwelling-house appears to them to be in such a state, it shall be their duty to make an order prohibiting the use of the dwelling-house for human habitation (in this Act referred to as a closing order) until in the judgment of the local authority the dwelling-house is rendered fit for that purpose. (3) Notice of a closing-order shall be forthwith served on every owner of the dwelling-house in respect of which it is made, and any owner aggrieved by the order may appeal to the Local Government Board by giving notice of appeal to the Board within fourteen days after the order is served upon him. (4) Where a closing order has become operative, the local authority shall serve notice of the order on every occupying tenant of the dwelling-house in respect of which the order is made, and, within such period as is specified in the notice, not being less than fourteen days after the service of the notice, the order shall be obeyed by him, and he and his family shall cease to inhabit the dwelling-house, and in default he shall be liable 167 on summary conviction to be ordered to quit the dwelling-house within such time as may be specified in the order. (5) Unless the dwelling-house has been made unfit for habitation by the wilful act or default of the tenant or of any person for whom as between himself and the owner or landlord he is responsible, the local authority may make to every such tenant such reasonable allowance on account of his expense in removing as may be determined by the local authority with the consent of the owner of the dwelling-house, or, if the owner of the dwellinghouse fails to consent to the sum determined by the local authority, as may be fixed by a court of summary jurisdiction, and the amount of the said allowance shall be recoverable by the local authority from the owner of the dwelling-house as a civil debt in manner provided by the Summary Jurisdiction Acts. (6) The local authority shall determine any closing order made by them if they are satisfied that the dwelling-house, in respect of which the order has been made, has been rendered fit for human habitation. If, on the application of any owner of a dwelling-house, the local authority refuse to determine a closing order, the owner may appeal to the Local Government Board by giving notice of appeal to the Board within fourteen days after the application is refused. Underground Room. (7) A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be a dwelling-house so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either— (a) is not on an average at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling; or (b) does not comply with such regulations as the local authority with the consent of the Local Government Board may prescribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms, and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation: provided that if the local authority, after being required to do so by the Local 168 Government Board, fail to make such regulations, or such regulations as the Board approve, the Board may themselves make them, and the regulations so made shall have effect as if they had been made by the local authority with the consent of the Board : Provided that a closing order made in respect of a room to which this subsection applies shall not prevent the room being used for purposes other than those of a sleeping place; and that, if the occupier of the room after notice of an order has been served upon him fails to comply with the order, an order to comply therewith may, on summary conviction, be made against him. This subsection shall not come into operation until the first day of July nineteen hundred and ten, and a closing order mads in respect of any room to which this subsection applies shall not be treated as a closing order in respect of a dwelling-house for the purposes of the next succeeding section. Order for demolition. 18.—(1) Where a closing order in respect of any dwellinghouse has remained operative for a period of three months, the local authority shall take into consideration the question of the demolition of the dwelling-house, and shall give every owner of the dwelling-house notice of the time (being some time not less than one month after the service of the notice) and place at which the question will be considered, and any owner of the dwelling-house shall be entitled to be heard when the question is so taken into consideration. (2) If upon any such consideration the local authority are of opinion that the dwelling-house has not been rendered fit for human habitation, and that the necessary steps are not being taken with all due diligence to render it so fit, or that the continuance of any building, being or being part of the dwellinghouse, is a nuisance or dangerous or injurious to the health of the public or of the inhabitants of the neighbouring dwellinghouses, they shall order the demolition of the building. (3) If any owner undertakes to execute forthwith the works necessary to render the dwelling-house fit for human habitation, and the local authority consider that it can be so rendered fit for human habitation, the local authority may, if they think fit, 169 postpone the operation of the order for such time, not exceeding six months, as they think sufficient for the purpose of giving the owner an opportunity of executing the necessary works. (4) Notice of an order for the demolition of a building shall be forthwith served on every owner of the building in respect of which it is made, and any owner aggrieved by the order may appeal to the Local Government Board by giving notice of appeal to the Board within twenty-one days after the order is served upon him.

Notice may be given to the occupier for the purpose of this section by leaving a notice addressed to the occupier, without name or further description, at the house, buildings, or premises. Power of Local Government Board to obtain a report on any crowded area. 37.

Notwithstanding anything in any local Act or bye-law in force in any borough or district, it shall not be lawful to erect any back to-back houses intended to be used as dwellings for the working classes, and any such house commenced to be erected after the passing of this Act shall be deemed to be unfit for human habitation for the purposes of the provisions of the Housing Acts. Provided that nothing in this section— (a) shall prevent the erection or use of a house containing several tenements in which the tenements are placed back to back, if the medical officer of health for the district certifies that the several tenements are so constructed and arranged as to secure effective ventilation of all habitable rooms in every tenement; or (b) shall apply to houses abutting on any streets the plans whereof have been approved by the local authority before the first day of May nineteen hundred and nine, in any borough or district in which, at the passing of this Act, any local Act or bye-laws are in force permitting the erection of back-to-back houses.

Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—20, King Street, Poplar; 18, 22 and 24, Jebb Street, Bow; 42, 44, 46, 48 and 50, Blondin Street, Bow; 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11, Priory Street; 6, Bidgdale Street; 3 new houses and a shop in Wade Street; 728, Old Ford Road; 48, 52, 54, 56, 58 and 60, Wrexham Road; School-keeper's House, British Street School, Poplar; New L.C.C. Schools, Dingle Lane, Poplar; New School-keeper's House, Marner Street Schools. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. No. 1, Duff Street and the Mercantile Marine Offices. In November, 1908, owing to trouble with the drains of No. 1, Duff Street, which was traced on to the Mercantile Marine Offices, East India Dock Road, H.M. Office of Works claimed the brick barrel, which took the drainage of both premises, to be a sewer, and suggested the barrel should be re-constructed throughout its entire length (140 feet) with pipes. Upon examination the brickwork was found to be in fairly good condition, though the flow, which was necessarily small, was sluggish. 175 No work was carried out then except to place two manholes in the street for access and cleansing, but H.M. Office of Works pressed for re construction and proposed to entirely redrain their own premises. Negotiations were carried out on a suggestion of the Borough Surveyor that in consideration of the diversion of the drain of No. 1, Duff Street, and the demolition of the barrel by the Council, H.M. Office of Works should relieve the Council of all liability in respect thereof, and construct the new drainage of their premises at their own expense, and this was agreed to on behalf of H.M. Office of Works. The Borough Surveyor proposed to divert the drainage of No. 1, Duff Street into the combined drainage system at No. 3, Duff Street, already maintainable by the Council, and the owners concerned agreed to this course. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the proposal of the Borough Surveyor should be adopted, and recommended the Council:— "That the drainage of No. 1, Duff Street be disconnected from the brick barrel at the Mercantile Marine Offices, East India Dock Eoad, and diverted into the combined drainage system of No. 3, Duff Street; and the brick barrel referred to be demolished." COMBINED DRAINAGE. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order:—46 to 50, Botolph Road; 390 to 394, Manchester Eoad; 3, 4, 5, Chapel House Street; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Griffin's Cottages; 35 to 55, Donald Street; 56, Gough Street; 7 and 8, Joshua Street; 1, 3, 5, Ida Street and 219, 221, East India Dock Road; 2 to 12, Blondin Street; 33 to 34, Egleton Road; 36 and 38, Coborn Road; 1 and 2, Thomas Street; 41 to 49, Priscilla Road; main drain at Nos. 25 and 27, Chilcot Street; 61 to 65, Galbraith Street; 156, Devons Road; 37 to 43, Bromley Hall Road; 36 to 52, Manchester Road; 36 and 38, High Street, Poplar; 24 and 24a, St. Leonard's Road; 40, High Street, Poplar; 198, West Perry Road; 133 to 135, Brunswick Road; 179, 181 and 183, Stebondale Street; 121 and 123, Upper North Street; 289 to 295, Manchester Road ; 7 to 13, Bakers Alley. 176 Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. The Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on the 5th March, 1908, by Mr. Dickinson and was read a first time. The Bill has not been brought before the present House of Commons owing to the position of affairs at Westminster. It is a Private Member's Bill and appears to be very questionable whether it will become law without the co-operation of the Government for the time being. During the last Parliament, from March, 1908, to July, 1909, the Bill was tabled over 100 occasions without being read a second time. The Bill is set out on page 193 in extenso.

In 1908 Rothbury Buildings,* Bow, were found to be in a most insanitary condition ; there was also no proper and sufficient supply of waterf with no adequate washing accommodation. The Public Health and Housing Committee directed that the Board of Inland Revenue be informed of the facts and that exemption under the Acts should no longer exist. The Board of Inland Revenue thereupon treated the certificate as cancelled. At the time of writing this report the owner is carrying out extensive work in order that certificates shall be granted. * Now called Rothbury Mansions. † London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. 177 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACTS, 1904 & 1909. Verminous Rooms* and Licensed Premises' Urinals; Power to provide Sanitary Conveniences jointly with adjoining Boroughs. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the "Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. The above procedure saves a large amount of time, as under the London County Council (General Powers) Act a certificate must be given by the Medical Officer of Health, who would have to inspect every room. However, eleven certificates had to be given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 232 rooms have been cleansed of vermin:— Poplar South Division 11 West Combined Division 15 East Combined Division 14 Bromley Central Division 11 Bromley North Division 20 Bow West Division 21 Bow East Division 36 Houses let in lodgings 104 No summonses were applied for. * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons see page 89. 178 Licensed Premises' Urinals. Four notices were served under Section 22 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, calling upon the owners to provide proper doors to the urinals attached to their licensed premises.

By Section 66 power is given to Metropolitan Borough Councils to provide sanitary Conveniences on or near their boundaries jointly with the Councils of adjoining Boroughs or Districts. SCHOOLS. Inspection of Schools; the use of Playgrounds of Public Elementary Schools for the purposes of Recreation. Inspection of Schools. The Schools of the Borough were inspected and the sanitary conveniences and water supplies were found in a satisfactory condition. The use of Playgrounds of Public Elementary Schools for the purposes of recreation. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— St. Pancras Borough Council, The Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. 19th January, 1909. Dear Sir, Children's Playgrounds. The attention of the Council has been directed to the danger incurred by children being compelled by circumstances to use the public streets, in which frequently there is heavy vehicular traffic, as playgrounds. In numerous cases the children reside in localities 179 far removed from a public park, garden or open space, and it is not practicable, therefore, for them to often visit these recreation grounds. The Council have considered a suggestion that it is very desirable that further grounds should be provided in London for children so that they may be able to play in safety therein without being exposed to the dangers of the traffic in the public thoroughfares, and a Committee of the Council has been appointed to consider the question in regard to the use of a portion of the public gardens in this Borough for the purpose. Attention has also been called to the playgrounds of the Schools under the control of the London County Council, which are only open and available at the present time to the scholars attending those Schools immediately before and after school hours, and during the short recreation periods during the school hours. In the opinion of the Council it is very desirable in the children's interest that the County Council should be urged to throw open these playgrounds out of school hours to all children for recreation purposes. I am instructed, therefore, to ask if your Council would be prepared to co-operate by joining in a petition to the County Council praying that the playgrounds attached to the Public Elementary Schools under their jurisdiction should be thrown open out of school hours for the use of all children who may wish to use them for the purposes of recreation. Will you kindly let me know at an early date the views of your Authority in regard to the matter. Yours faithfully, C. H. F. BARRETT, Town Clerk. L. Potts, Esq., Town Clerk, Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to join in the petition suggested in the foregoing letter. 180 SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, OVERCROWDING, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Cul-de-sac off Mellish Street, Dock Cottages, Prince Arthur's Avenue; Closure of Duff's Fields; Removal of Obnoxious and Offensive Matter—Proceedings by the Works Department. In two cases where w.c. pans and traps were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39(1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders were written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings would be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work has been found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. One other case came under the notice of the Public Health Department. This case was reported to the Borough Surveyor as no plans had been submitted, a new w.c. with drains having been constructed. 181 List of Sanitary Works carried out in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, from January 1st, 1909, to December .31st, 1909.* Poplar South.

Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting twelve cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 36 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 48 of overcrowding abated; five cases of overcrowding were abated in workrooms (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 243); 152 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, pages 245-248). In no instance were legal proceedings instituted. General. 7,626 communications were received, and 859 complaints (including 61 smoke) as to nuisances were made. Cul-de-Sac off Mellish Street. Dock Cottages. Prince Arthur's Avenue. In December, 1908, the Magistrate dismissed a summons taken against the owner of a cul-de-sac off Mellish Street, to enforce proper drainage and repair of such place, which was in bad condition and drained into untrapped gullies. The proceedings were taken under Section 100 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the effect of the decision is that unless the freeholder is also the owner of the houses abutting no proceedings can be effective to compel owners to repair such places. The Committee were advised an appeal was not likely to be successful, and therefore directed no further legal action be taken in the matter. The Public Health and Housing Committee also requested the Works Committee to consider the desirability of arranging for the necessary work to be done by the Council at the place in question, and at other places in similar cases, the cost being apportioned upon the owners. Early in the year 1909, the Works Committee reported to the Council that the Midland Railway Company bad agreed to repair the thoroughfare at Dock Cottages. Negotiations were proceeding with the owners in respect of the making up of Prince Arthur's Avenue. With regard to the cul de sac between Nos. 67 and 69, Mellish Street, Millwall, liability was accepted by two out of the three owners of the property abutting thereon, but was disputed by the third. The Works Committee were of opinion 183 it was desirable the road should be repaired, but that no liability for future maintenance should be undertaken by the Council, and recommended:— "That the necessary repairs to the cul de sac between 67 and 69, Mellish Street be carried out by the Borough Surveyor, and the cost apportioned upon, and recovered from, the owners, in accordance with the powers of the Council under Section 3 of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1890." Closure of Duff's Fields. The Works Committee reported to the Council that they had been waited upon by a deputation, who pointed out to them certain improper uses to which a passageway known as Duff's Fields was put. The Works Committee were assured the owners would do all that is necessary for the convenience of the tenants, who would remain in occupation, by putting up a gate and providing them with keys, so that they would be able to use the back portions of the premises Nos. 25 and 27, St. Leonards Road, as previously. The Works Committee were of opinion the thoroughfare in question might well be closed without any injury or inconvenience to the general public, and the Council agreed to the proposal that the passageway known as Duffs Fields, situate between St. Leonards Road and Lodore Street, should be closed as desired by the owners. After the usual formalities Duff's Fields was closed in the manner suggested above. 184 Police Court Proceedings. No. o£ Street or Name of Premises or Locality, Ac. Nature of Complaint.

The Works Committee reported to the Council they had directed warning notices be issued against the dropping of trade refuse on the public ways. SANITARY LEGISLATION. Metropolitan Ambulances Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII., cap. 17; Trade Boards Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VIP., cap. 22; Oaths Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII., cap. 39; Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII., cap. 44; London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII., ch. cxxx. Metropolitan Ambulances Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII., cap. 17. "In 1906 the London County Council sought powers to establish and maintain, and to aid the establishment and maintenance of, an efficient ambulance service for cases of street accident and illness occurring in London. The Clauses of the Bill, after examination by the Police and Sanitary Committee, passed the House of Commons but failed to pass the House of Lords. "The Home Secretary thereupon appointed a Departmental Committee ' to inquire as to the provision made for dealing with cases of accident and sudden illness occurring in streets and public places in the Metropolis, and to report whether any, and, if so, what, improvements in ambulance provision are necessary or desirable, and how they could be best effected with due regard to efficiency ami economy.' "The Committee reported that it had been' abundantly shown that the present system is gravely defective and results in much preventible 186 detriment and suffering by reason of the transport, by unsuitable means, of persons who have been injured or taken ill in the streets or other public places; and that the real evil arises from the great use which is made of ordinary vehicles, such as cabs and vans, even in serious cases, which require the transport of the patient by the best means possible.' "The Committee was divided in opinion as to whether the London County Council or Metropolitan Asylums Board should be the authority for ambulance purposes in London. "The present statute, which was introduced into the House of Commons by Sir William Collins, reproduces the powers sought by the London County Council three years ago, in order to enable them to provide for London such ambulance service as the Departmental Committee's investigations have shown to be required." (Paterson's Practical Statutes.) Trade Boards Act, 1909. 9 Edw. VII., Cap. 22. "This statute enforces, subject to elaborate restrictions, the novel principle of a minimum rate of wages in certain industries, commonly known as ' sweated ' industries. These industries are (1) those specified in the schedule (namely, ready-made and wholesale tailoring, the making of paper or chip boxes, machine lace making and chain making); and also (2) any other trade with exceptionally low wages to which the Act may be applied by the Board of Trade under a provisional order requiring the consent of Parliament. "The method for fixing a minimum wage is by means of Trade Boards, constituted under regulations by the Board of Trade, consisting of an equal number of representatives, members of employers and workers> together with appointed members whose number must be less than half the total of representative members. It is the duty of Trade Boards to fix minimum time-rates of wages, and they are also empowered to fix general minimum piece-rates of wages. These minimum rates do not become obligatory until sanctioned by an order of the Board of Trade made after an interval of six months ; but they have at once a limited operation (1) in the absence of a definite agreement; (2) when an employer has given notice that he is willing to adopt them ; and (3) in the case of contracts with a government department or a local authority. "Power is given to Trade Boards to establish district trade committees, with a constitution similar to their own, to which they may delegate any of their powers and duties except that of fixing minimum 187 rates of wages. Women are made eligible as members of Trade Boards both representative and appointed, and in the case of a trade in which women are largely employed at least one of the appointed members acting must be a woman. The Board of Trade is empowered to appoint Officers for carrying out the Act, who may be the existing inspectors of factories under the Home Department; and it is expressly provided that, by Order in Council, an interchange of powers may be effected between the several departments of Government concerned. Finally the expenses of Trade Boards and of their representative members (including compensation for loss of time) and also the remuneration of appointed members and secretaries, are to be paid out of monies provided by Parliament." (Paterson's Practical Statutes.) Oaths Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII., cap. 39. "By Section 5 of the Oaths Act, 1888, it is open to a person to whom an oath is administered to swear, if he so desires, with unlifted hand, in the form and manner in which an oath is usually administered in Scotland. Under that Act, however, judges, magistrates, coroners and other persons do not consider themselves justified in suggesting this form of oath to the witness, jury or deponent; and it is a question whether the oath ought to be so administered unless the witness, etc., voluntarily request it to be done. Consequently, the old form of kissing the Book, to which there are many objections, still prevails. "The object of the present statute, which was introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Bramsdon, but was considerably amended in Committee and also in the House of Lords, is to endeavour to make universal the administration of the oath according to a new method— namely, with the Book in the uplifted hand—by enabling the court, etc., to administer it in this form unless the person about to take the oath voluntarily objects thereto." (Paterson's Practical Statutes.) Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, 9 Edw. VII., cap 44. "The main objects of this Statute, which was for two years under discussion by the House of Commons, and was also subjected to modification in the House of Lords are twofold: (1) to amend the existing law relating to the housing of the working classes by conferring wider powers, simplifying the procedure and strengthening the authority of the Local Government Board; (2) to introduce an entirely new method of urban 188 and suburban development, by means of carefully thought out schemes called ' town planning.' "Part I. of the statute, dealing with the housing of the working classes, while in form it consists only of amendments to the Act of 1890, substantially transforms that Act into a measure of much greater efficiency. Instead of being an adoptive Act it is now made operative in every urban and rural district. Whenever a complaint is made by four householders that the local authority have failed to exercise their powers, the Local Government Board may order them to do their duty within a limited time, and such order may be enforced by mandamus. Similar powers are also given to a county council to take action in case of default. Land may be acquired compulsorily in accordance with the simpler procedure first authorised under the Small Holdings and Allotments Acts, 1907. The period for the repayment of a loan from the Public Works Loans Commissioners is extended from 50 to 80 years, and the money is to be advanced at the lowest rate of interest allowed at the time. "With regard to the implied contract by a landlord that a house is reasonably fit for human habitation, this implied contract is now made applicable to all houses (with no restrictions to those for the working classes only) let at the following rents:—In London, £40 ; in a borough or urban district council with a population of 50,000, £26; elsewhere, £16. Moreover, this implied contract, which before only applied to the condition^ of the house at the time of letting, is now extended to the duration of the holding, and the local authority is empowered to see that the contract is duly carried out. "With regard to the closing or demolition of dwelling houses unfit for human habitation, in place of the former procedure of recourse to a court of summary jurisdiction with appeal to quarter sessions, an administrative order by the local authority is substituted, with appeal to the Local Government Board. Special provision is made for rooms below the surface of the street, habitually used as sleeping places; the erection of back-to-back houses as dwellings for the working classes is prohibited; and the definition of a cottage is extended so as to include a garden of not more than one acre, without regard to the annual value of such garden. "With regard to improvement and reconstruction schemes, an order of the Local Government Board sanctioning such scheme, and authorising compulsory purchase of land, is no longer a provisional order requiring confirmation by Parliament, but takes effect when sanctioned. "Powers are given to the Local Government Board to enter any 189 house for the purpose of survey or valuation, and also to obtain a report upon any crowded area from the local authority. For hearing appeals the Board is required to make rules, which must provide that no appeal be dismissed without a public local inquiry; and at any stage in the proceedings a special case may be stated for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law. "Part II. deals with the novel question of "town planning": that is, the provision of a considered scheme for the laying out of land which is in course of development or appears likely to be used for building purposes. It is, of course, open to private persons, including landowners, to prepare such a scheme ; but the statute contains elaborate provisions for the preparation or adoption of town planning schemes by a local authority—either a borough or a district council and the London County Council. Such schemes must contain provisions prescribed by the Local Government Board; they must be approved by the Board, and in the event of opposition they must be likewise laid before Parliament. The scheme may include power to purchase land compulsorily in accordance with the simplified procedure provided in Part I. In case of default by the local authority the Local Government Board may issue orders enforceable by madamus. "Parts III. and IV. contain general provisions. Of these the most important is that which makes compulsory (instead of optional, as hitherto) the duty of every county council to appoint a medical officer of health, who may not engage in private practice or hold any other public appointment, whose duties are to include those prescribed generally by the Local Government Board, and who may not be dismissed without the consent of the Board. Every county council (except that of London) is required to establish a public health and housing committee, to whom all relevant matters must be referred and whose reports must be considered. Provision is aho made for assistance to be given to co-operative building societies. Finally, no common land or open space may be acquired under this statute or under the Housing Acts unless the scheme authorising it is expressly confirmed by Parliament."

If at any time it appears to any sanitary authority that in any tenement house within their district sufficient and suitable accommodation for the storage of food is not provided for the use of each family occupying such house on the storey or one of the storeys in which are situate the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of such family, the sanitary authority may, if the provision of such accommodation is practisable, cause notice to be served on the owner of such house requiring him, within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice, to provide sufficient and suitable accommodation for the purpose aforesaid, and any owner failing to comply with such requirement within the period prescribed in the notice shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings and to a daily penalty not exceeding twenty shillings. Provided that this Section shall not apply to any tenement house used or occupied as such before the passing of this Act. 17. Application of certain provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and enforcement of this part of the Act (i.e., the provisions contained in Sections 101, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 121, 122, 124, 125,127, 128, 133 and 135 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891.) 18.

Part VI.— Milk Supply, Unclean and Tuberculous (see pages 141, 142). Milk and Dairies Bills, 1909 and 1910. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. Milk and Dairies Bill, 1909. A Bill to make better provision with respect to the Sale of Milk and the Regulation of Dairies. Presented by Mr. Burns, supported by Sir Edward Strachey, Mr. Attorney-General for Ireland and Mr. Masterman. Ordered by the House of Commons to be printed 25th May, 1909. Memorandum. The main objects of the Bill are to provide for— 1. The more effective registration of dairies and dairymen. 2. The inspection of dairies and the examination of cows therein. 3. The prohibition of the supply of milk from a dairy where such a supply has caused or would be likely to cause infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. 4. The prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk. 5. The regulation of the importation of milk so as to prevent danger to public health arising therefrom. 192 6. The issue of regulations for securing the supply of pure and wholesome milk. 7. The establishment by local authorities in populous places of milk depots for the sale of milk specially prepared for infants. The provisions as to registration supersede the provisions as to the registration of dairies contained in the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts and the Orders made thereunder. The provisions as to the inspection of dairies and the prohibition of the supply of milk reproduce with amendment Section 4 of the Infectious Diseases Prevention Act, 1890, Section 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the model milk clauses incorporated in many local Acts. The clause as to the prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk is also taken from the model milk clauses, but the scope of the enactment is somewhat extended. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries will, in connection with this Bill, issue an order under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, dealing with the notification of tuberculosis in cattle and the inspection, examination, detention, isolation and slaughter of tuberculous cattle, and the giving of compensation in appropriate cases. This Bill was dropped and a new Bill has been promoted. Milk and Dairies Bill, 1910. A Bill to make better provision with respect to the Sale of Milk and the Regulation of Dairies. Ordered to be brought in by Mr. Courthope, Mr. Long, Mr. Hayes Fisher, Sir Luke White, Colonel Lockwood, Mr. Courtnay Warner, Mr. Eyland Adkins, Mr. Charles Bathurst, Mr. Dawes, Mr. Guinness, Captain Jessel and Mr. Stainer. Ordered by the House of Commons to be printed 13th April, 1910. Memorandum. The main objects of the Bill are to provide for- 1. The more effective registration of dairies and dainmen. 193 2. The inspection of dairies and the examination of cows therein. 3. The prohibition of the supply of milk from a dairy where such a supply has caused or would be likely to cause infectious disease, including tuberculosis. 4. The prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk. 5. The regulation of the importation of milk so as to prevent danger to public health arising therefrom. 6. The issue of regulations for securing the supply of pure and wholesome milk. The provisions as to registration supersede the provisions as to the registration of dairies contained in the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts and the Orders made thereunder. The provisions as to the inspection of dairies and the prohibition of the supply of milk reproduce with amendment Section 4 of the Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, 1890, Section 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the milk clauses incorporated in many local Acts. The clause as to the prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk is taken from the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries have prepared an order under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, dealing with the notification of tuberculosis in cattle, and the inspection, examination, detention, isolation and slaughter of tuberculous cattle and the giving of compensation in appropriate cases. (See page 151 as to proposed amendment of Sale of Food and Drugs Acts as to warranties in the case of milk.) Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill (see page 176). Memorandum. The object of this Bill is to amend the state of the law relating to combined drainage. There are two kinds of combined drain, the " combined drain,'' which in law is a "drain," and the "combined drain," which in law is a 194 "sewer." The former is repairable by the private owner; the latter by the public authority. In the opinion of builders, owners and local authorities combined drains were originally constructed as drains, and were mutually regarded as such until the retrospective case of Travis v. Uttley (1893), the effect of which has been to convert thousands of drains, which had been privately owned and privately maintained, into sewers vested in the local authorities and maintainable at the expense of the ratepayers. The state of the law has been described by the Lord Chief Justice, who said in a recent decision, " It seems to me, as I have before pointed out, to be essential that there should be some amendment of the law upon this subject. The state of the authorities is such that it appears to be impossible either to reconcile the various decisions or to deduce from them any logical rule." Several provincial authorities, notably West Ham, Croydon, Carlisle, Leyton, Wood Green, Sheffield, etc., have been successful in obtaining the powers which the Metropolitan local authorities ask for by this Bill. Metropolitan Seweus and Drains. [8 Edw. VII.J A Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Sewers and Drains. Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:— 1. In and for the purposes of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act or Acts amending the same, the word "drainshall be deemed to include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, with which two or more houses, buildings or premises are, at the date of the passing of this Act, or may at any time thereafter be connected, or which is used or capable of being or intended to be used for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses, buildings or premises directly or indirectly to any sewer which has been approved as such by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of Works, 591 or the London County Council, but shall not include any sewer so approved as aforesaid. 2. This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1908, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same. On the back of the Bill appear the following names:—Mr. Dickinson, Sir William Bull, Mr. Bowles, Sir William Collins, Mr. Crooks, Mr. Timothy Davies, Sir George Fardell, Mr. Claude Hay, Sir Henry Kimber, Ear Percy, Sir Albert Spicer and Mr, Waterlow. The Boroughs represented are St. Pancras, Hammersmith, Lambeth, Woolwich, Fulham, Paddington, Shoreditch, Wandsworth, Kensington, Hackney and Islington. Again I am deeply indebted to Mr. Shillinglaw, the principal Clerk in the Town Clerk's Department, for his valuable assistance which at all times he has so willingly rendered me, adding efficiency to the working of the Public Health Department. Mr. Shillinglaw acts as Clerk to the Public Health and Housing Committee, ana has recorded the resolutions, recommendations and reports of the Committee which have been quoted in this report. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow R iad, e. April, 1910. 196 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1909. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my twentieth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending 31st December, 1909, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances ... 1,251 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 216 Do. on house-to-house visitation 34 Do. Canal Boats 68 Re-inspections 3,076 Making a total of 4,645 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,569 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 34.4 per cent, of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 541 written intimations, 256 statutory, and 26 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in no case was it found necessary to have reoourse to legal proceedings to ensure enforcement. House-to-House Visitation. The house-to-house inspection comprised sections of the undermentioned roads— Appian Eoad and Lefevre Road. 197 Drainage Reconstructions.

At the hearing of the summons the defendant was fined 10s. with three guineas costs for failing to comply with the terms of the statutory notice served upon him by the Council, the magistrate holding the system was a drain repairable by the owner. Smoke Nuisances. No case of smoke nuisance occurred in the district arising from without the district. Where nuisances have occurred within the district intimation and notice have been served and the nuisance abated thereon. Two cases of smoke nuisance arising from steam highway locomotives passing through the district were dealt with by letters of caution to the owners. Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. Under the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations 26 boats have been examined. Of these 9 were registered and 17 non-registered. All the registered canal boats, with one exception, were found in fair condition and in compliance with the Acts and Regulations. No contravention of the Acts was discovered on any of the nonregistered barges. Demolitions and Additions. No dwelling houses have been demolished during the year, but 63 additional houses have been built— Wrexham Road, 32 Jebb Street, 12 Ridgdale Street, 19 203 Unsound Food. The following unsound foods were dealt with during the year.— January 23rd.—Two tons of damaged butter for soap making. January 22nd.—330 tins sorted from 161 cases of condensed milk.

The fat melters in the district have completed the necessary alterations to their plant and premises as required by the new regulations governing offensive businesses which came into force on November 25th, 1907, and has resulted in a remarkable diminution of complaints up to the present. Verminous Booms. 36 verminous rooms have been cleansed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces have been visited and found generally satisfactory, any nuisances existing upon the premises have been abated on the service of intimation. Homework. The outworkers, who are all boot and shoe operatives, have been visited twice during the year, and the premises of each examined for nuisances and sanitary defects. The workrooms were mostly found in a fair condition, and any defects in the premises were remedied by the owner or occupier on a notice being served. 204 Milkshops and Cowsheds, Food Preparation, etc. The milkshops and cowsheds have given no cause for complaint; the cowsheds were limewhited and cleansed twice during the year, in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds orders, and the milk vessels and measures of the various milk vendors were satisfactory with one exception, necessitating a caution to the vendor for uncleanly measure. The places where foodstuffs are prepared have been periodically visited. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. On visiting the ice cream makers and vendors during the season, the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902 was apparently carefully complied with. An alien itinerant vendor without name and address upon barrow was cautioned and at once proceeded to affix the necessary particulars. The barrow had recently been redecorated and the name slip forgotten. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Pood and Drugs Acts fifty-three varied samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analyses On analysis one only was found to be adulterated.

During the year the premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected, and where necessary, for sanitary purposes, notices have been duly served upon the responsible persons, and the nuisances were abated thereon. Milk Shops. There are 49 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation ; 210 I find that in some of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed slaughter houses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Ofttimes a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are seven fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public. Bake-Houses. There are 20 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 15 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean. Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small scale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period frequent visits are made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored over night is particularly investigated. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. Unsound Food. During the year a varied assortment of food stuffs have been surrendered by the owners as being unfit for food. Certificates were 211 given where the articles were destroyed. Large quantities of unsound food, etc., coming into the Bromley North District for destruction are destroyed under my supervision. These goods are handed over to the various inspectors after they have been rejected by the firms to which they were consigned. Smoke Nuisances. Many smoke nuisances have been notified, but on the service of an intimation the nuisance has been abated. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive material is conveyed through the district. Only on two occasions were carriers cautioned, but the nuisances were very slight.

I have inspected 1,539 premises, 999 in response to complaints of nuisances, and notices received under the London County Council Bylaws and the Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908, 162 on account of cases of infectious diseases notified, and 378 were house-tohouse visitations. Of the 1,539 premises so dealt with 548 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the 991 premises (the remainder) defects and nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated statement page 181). In the supervision of same 4,788 re-inspections were made. Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908. Of the pulmonary tuberculosis cases for which notices were received, the great majority of patients were removed to various institutions for treatment. Inspections were made of the premises, as above stated, the necessary precautions (disinfection, etc.) adopted, and where required the work of cleansing was readily carried out by the responsible person.

By the demolition during the year of the five small houses which comprised Coventry Place, commonly known as "Black Beetle Alley," a small unhealthy area had ceased to exist. The houses (5) were old, decayed and worn out. Four were three-roomed, back-to-back, atticbuilt, and one had two rooms. This last house was in a ruinous state, having been closed by the owner in December, 1906, to prevent legal proceedings being instituted. The five houses were without means of through ventilation, and the sanitary arrangements consisted of a draw tap for the drinking water and two closets in a small enclosed courtyard. No. 2a Coventry Cross, adjoining the above houses, comprised two rooms and an attic, lean-to wash-house at rear and a water-closet in a small yard, and these premises, although thoroughly repaired in July, 1904, had for a long time since been unoccupied, unowned and neglected. This house was also demolished. Brunswick Road. In consequence of damage done by fire to workshops and dwelling house adjoining 240 and 242 and the dirty and dilapidated state the premises were in, the owner closed and demolished the workshops and dwelling house. 216 House to House Inspections.

The drains of 359 premises were tested by means of the "rocket" smoke test. Seventy-four were proved defective, not gastight, whilst in 285 cases (the remainder) the result was negative. The water test has been applied to all new drainage work, and also where practicable to drains partially reconstructed or repaired. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts—Margarine Act. I have, as directed by you, procured 50 samples of food, etc., which were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis; one (milk) only being found to be deficient in fat to such an extent (33 3 per cent.) that legal proceedings were instituted. The vendor was fined £5 and 23s. costs. In addition to the above, two samples, one milk and the other butter, were not up to the standards. The vendors were duly cautioned by the Public Health and Housing Committee. The milk was found to be deficient in solids not fat to the extent of at 217 least 3.5 per cent., which deficiency indicated the presence of at least 3 5 per cent. of added water, and the butter contained 1.3 per cent. of excessive water. Altogether 19 samples of butter were obtained; 4 were found to contain boric acid, three 0 5 per cent. and one 0.25 per cent. Public Schools. Oban Street Council Schools. Bromley Hall Road Council Schools. Hay Currie Council Schools. St. Leonard's Road Council Schools. Marner Street Council Schools. The above schools were inspected and found to be in a fair sanitary condition; the drinking water supplies were drawn direct from Metropolitan Water Board's mains. The storage tanks were furnished with covers and periodically cleansed; these tanks are only used for supplies to lavatories and closets, etc. Inspection of Bakehouses, etc. I have, as instructed, made the periodical inspections of these (13) premises (three not in use), and, where required, served Extracts of Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, "intimations " and statutory notices for the necessary work of cleansing and repairs, which were respectively complied with. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops in the division were inspected, attention being given to the cleanliness of the utensils used in the business as well as to the sanitary conditions of the premises. Where defects existed, "intimations" and statutory notices were served and nuisances abated. Public-House Urinals, etc. Attention has been given to the urinals to ascertain whether they were kept clean and furnished with the necessary fittings in compliance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Verminous Booms. During the course of year 11 rooms were cleansed; it was not 218 necessary to enforce the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Eating Houses, Coffee Shops, Pork Butchers, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops. Inspections were several times made of the whole of the abovedescribed business premises and all necessary works of cleansing and repairs carried out, in some cases without the service of "Intimations," etc. In no instance upon such visits was there cause for complaint so far as the condition of food was concerned. Cowsheds, Milk Sellers and Purveyors. The above (51) premises were frequently visited, the Public Health, etc., Office Registers corrected in the cases of those found non-registered through change of occupancy. The new proprietors were supplied with forms which were duly signed for the required alteration. Constant attention was given to the enforcement of regulations relating to cleanliness of utensils, more particularly in compliance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, relating to the sanitary conditions and surroundings under which milk was sold. Upon notice received for renewal of the licence of a cowshed at 27, Abbott Road, the premises were again inspected and found to be in a fair sanitary condition ; no opposition was made to the application of the owner to the London County Council. Examination of Food. I have on several occasions, upon applications made by different itinerant vendors and tradesmen, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found " unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food," witnessed the same destroyed by the owners, certificates being given to that effect. In no case was there any article of food "exposed for sale, deposited for sale, or in preparation for sale " at the time of my visit to any premises in such condition as to justify seizure. Ice-Cream Makers and Vendors. All the premises where ice-creams were made were visited, with the object of detecting nuisances and infringements of the London County 219 Council General Powers Act, 1902. The barrows were found to be legibly marked with names and addresses, etc., of vendors; and the utensils and the premises were found to be clean and the ice-creams were wholesome. Factory and Workshops Inspections. Nuisances arising within the several factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., were dealt with. The whole of the ascertained above business premises were inspected and found, in the majority of cases, to be in fair sanitary condition. In the remainder the work of repairs, cleansing, etc., was carried out in compliance with " intimations," notices, etc. Smoke Nuisances. Smoke emitted so as to be a nuisance from chimneys other than those belonging to private dwelling-houses, viz., factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., was abated on the service of the usual documents. In no instance was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings. Canal Boats. I have inspected 41 barges, 10 non-registered and one registered sailing barge; I found the cabins fairly clean, and no infringement of the regulations. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Cert. San. Inst. Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of food and Drugs Acts and Canal Boats Act, Bromley Central Division. 220 Report of Inspector West Combined Division.

Sir,— I beg to lay before you my ninth Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith in the West Combined District during the past year, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. Inspection of Division. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds 1272 houses or other premises have been visited, 249 of these visits being on account of notifications of infectious diseases. In addition to these, 94 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, notified under the new regulations, have been visited and dealt with as required. This number shows a further decrease upon those of the previous year. Of the 249 cases 11 were notified from the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, 2 from Langley House Receiving Home and 4 from the Poplar Union. House to House Inspections. These visits to the number of 95 were carried out in the undermentioned localities, a large number of the drains proving unsound on being tested:— Ellesmere Street. South East Row. Langton Street. Ricardo Street. Prospect Place. Vesey Street. Park Street. Upper North Street. Sabbarton Street. and at odd houses as occasion required. 221 Drain Reconstructions. The drains of some 93 premises were taken out and reconstructed, and where practicable, in order to comply with the bye-laws of the London County Council and Borough Council, were intercepted, ventilated and provided with means of access for clearing in times of stoppages, the whole work being thoroughly tested before being passed as sound:— Barchester Street, Nos. 48, 50, 52, 54. Bath Street, Nos. 31, 15. Castor Street, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (Elm Cottages, Nos. 1, 2). Chrisp Street, No. 180 (Maypole Dairy). Chilcott Street, Nos. 25, 27.

The drains of 55 premises were also examined and amended where necessary. Coffee and Eating Houses. These premises have been periodically inspected during the year, alterations in tenancy and new shops have been registered and the registers brought up to date. While inspecting these places, so far as possible attention has been paid to the food in preparation for cooking. The premises have been cleansed when found necessary. Q 222 Food Inspection at Wharf, etc. At Aberdeen Wharf, where food, skins, and potted meats are landed for transit, inspections have been made from time to time and everything found in good condition. This wharf has been visited in company with an Inspector of the Local Government Board on two or three occasions. The butchers' premises and stalls in Chrisp Street Market were inspected at night times, at week ends and at times on Sunday mornings. In each place where sausages and brawn are made special attention has been given. These places are registered and the businesses are conducted in a clean and careful manner, and the premises are regularly cleansed. Odd consignments of damaged wheat, rice and barley have been received into the district from the " docks " to be made up into poultry food. These consignments have been watched through the processes. The following foodstuffs have been surrendered and destroyed during the year:— 24 boxes of tomatoes, 2 boxes of plaice, 1 lump of beef, 3 barrels of herrings, 1 box of skate, and several lots of damaged fruit in small quantities. Factories and Workshops. These places have been visited periodically, and when necessary cleansing "notices" have been served and complied with. New workshops opened have been placed on the register and duly inspected. No case of overcrowding or infectious disease in any workshop has been found to exist, but some cases of infectious diseases notified as residing in the district, but engaged outside the district, have been dealt with by notifying the authorities in whose district they worked. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited at 223 intervals. Changes of address have been noted and registered, and where necessary "notices" for cleansing have been served and complied with. Bakehouses.

Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops and Slaughterhouses. These places are regularly visited during the year. All dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness and have, generally speaking, been kept in a very good condition, and some of the milkpans are now covered with "patent dust-proof covers." All changes of tenancy (which are frequent) have been dealt with and the registers brought up to date. The number of these on the register at present is as follows:— Milkshops 69 Cowshed 1 Slaughterhouse 1 Canal Boats Acts. Canal boats that are "registered" under the Acts are visited as opportunities offer. They have been found, as regards the living quarters, in a clean and bright condition, and properly ventilated. The "certificates" have been produced at times, when asked for, and examined and compared with the number of occupants, and no overcrowding has been found to exist. No cases of illness have been discovered on the boats. Smoke Nuisances. Complaints from the London County Council have been dealt with, also my own observations of shafts. No legal proceedings were necessary as all "notices" were quickly attended to. 224 Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. During the year 52 samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis, 6 of which proved to be so adulterated that legal proceedings were instituted as under, and also "letters of caution" were sent to other vendors by order of the Committee where advised that this would be sufficient. Milk.—Deficient in fat to extent of 6.6 per cent. Summons dismissed on production of warranty. (1st offence.)

Public Health (London) Act, 1891. All cases of infectious diseases notified during the year have received attention with a view to tracing their origin if possible. A summons was taken out against the owner of a house in Kerbey Street for not complying with a "notice" from the Council to do certain necessary works under the above Act. The defendant ignored the summons and did not appear at Court. An abatement order of 21 days together with 27s. costs was obtained. A further summons was taken out, and defendant again failed to appear to answer for disobeying the Magistrate's Order. 225 Defendant was further fined, and not paying the fines distraint was made by the Court on "goods" to the full value of fines. The premises are now empty and the work is to be done before occupation. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Under this Act about 15 rooms have been successfully freed from vermin. No legal proceedings were necessary to ensure this result. The public-house urinals, as far as possible, have been kept in a cleanly state. Ice-Cream Regulations. London County Council (General Poivers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice-cream is made have been inspected and attention given to all the utensils used.

The number of these premises now on the register are—cowsheds, 2; slaughterhouses, 3. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 53 varied samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Three on analysis were found to be adulterated, 1 only sufficiently to require the vendor to be cautioned by the Public Health and Housing Committee, whilst in the cases of the remaining two summonses were issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples and results of proceedings are appended :— Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 26.6 per cent, and 11.2 per cent. respectively, indicating at least the presence of 11.2 per cent of added water. Defendant fined £10 and £2 2s. costs. Itinerant vendor. Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 20 per cent. and 3.5 per cent. respectively. Defendant not fined. Magistrate allowed £5 5s. costs. Itinerant vendor. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 2.3 per cent.

In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it was not found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with the London County Council's and Poplar Borough Council's own bye-laws, as the nuisances were satisfactorily abated previous to applying for summonses. Smoke Nuisances. During the year the shafts throughout the district have been under careful observation, and in only four instances nuisances were detected. In these cases intimations and statutory notices have been served, which has had the desired effect of abating the nuisances. No recurrence of the nuisances took place, and therefore there was no necessity to institute legal proceedings. Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected in respect of unsound and unwholesome food, and during the past year there was no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. During the year 3 bags of young cabbages, 2 boxes of haddocks and 1 box of hake were brought to the Public Health Offices to be examined, and were found to be unfit for human food. After the usual precautions being taken to prevent any of the above being used after condemnation, the usual certificates were given for the purpose of the purchasers having their money returned by the wholesale vendors. 232 Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection has been given to these premises during the past year; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register. At each inspection particular attention was paid to the food under preparation, and in no instance was there cause for complaint; in some cases it was necessary to serve intimations and statutory notices respecting cleansing of the kitchens, etc. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected, the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of the articles used in the business being carefully noted. In some few cases intimations were required to be served. Generally there is a marked improvement in these premises. Factory and Workshops Acts. The workshops, domestic workshops, workplaces and domestic workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number engaged in each case being checked, particularly in respect to overcrowding; the terms of the Acts relating thereto have been met with in response to intimation and statutory notices when necessary, and in no instance was there occasion to take legal proceedings. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without any particular incident during the year. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. All the premises where ice creams are made have been inspected with the view of detecting nuisances, also any infringement of the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1902, Part viii. Each itinerant vendor's barrow and utensils have been inspected. In each case the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto, the ice cream and utensils were found to be satisfactory, and there was no cause for action to be taken. 233 Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-laic under Public Health (London) Act. Section 50). The cisterns of the undermentioned buildings have been inspected during the year, and duly reported upon. Where covers were found to be defective, they have since been amended, and made as far as practicable dustproof. Each cistern is so situated as to be free from pollution:— Adelaide Buildings 2, Baffins Buildings 2, Grosvenor Buildings 55, Hudson's Buildings 2, Melbourne Buildings 4, Montreal Buildings 4, Ontario Buildings 4, Ottawa Buildings 4, Prestage Buildings 6, Quebec Buildings 4, Council Buildings 5, St. Lawrence Cottages, Norfolk Street 14, Sydney Buildings 4, Toronto Buildings 2, Winnipeg Buildings 4. Public House Urinals. The public house urinals have been under regular observation during the past year, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 22, strictly enforced. Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of premises where milk is stored and sold throughout the district with the object of enforcing the regulations of the "Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885," as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, particularly in respect to other articles kept for sale in the same premises. Where counter pans were not properly covered instructions were given to have proper ones provided. Number of Milk Sellers 33 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 2 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 5 Number of Milk Sellers added to Register 1 Overcrowding. During the year fourteen cases of overcrowding were discovered; in each case the nuisance was abated after the service of an intimation followed by a statutory notice, without recourse to legal proceedings. 234 Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, and notices to cleanse the premises have been served where required. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, etc. There is only one wharf in my district, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramornie Meat Co.), where food (all tinned) is landed, some of which is warehoused for other firms; the other, which is all examined by the consignee is for sale for both home consumption and export. A large amount goes into the Mercantile Service, all of which is examined and labelled by the Board of Trade officials before being taken away. The following number of tinned foods (as set out below) on examination were found by the consignee to be blown or otherwise damaged and consequently condemned by the consignee as unfit for human food; the condemned food was set apart by the consignee in a building adjoining the premises for the purpose of being sent to a fat boiler to be rendered down for the fat, proper precautions being taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose. 189 61bs. beef, 325 21bs. beef, 15 1lb. beef, 711 61bs. mutton, 17 41bs. mutton, 439 21bs. mutton, 81 21bs. soup, 13 21bs. tongue, 166 1lb. tongue, 31 l½lbs. chicken, 381 lib. salmon, 4 1lb. sausage, 8 1lb. ham, chicken and tongue, 310 tins of fruit—making a total of 2,690 tins. The "Regulations under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907," give more power to inspect food imported into this country, and will facilitate a more rigid examination, also supervision of the disposal of unsound food. Public Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Public Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supplies and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main, and the storage cisterns 235 (which are used for supplying the sanitary conveniences only) are cleansed periodically. The sanitary conveniences and offices were found to be in a clean and satisfactory condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats, East Combined Division. 236 Report of Inspector, South Division of Poplar. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1909. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my Annual Summary of the sanitary work executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1909, viz.:— The details of which were entered in my journal day by day and reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee month by month. Inspections, special, periodical and on complaint of nuisances 1,276 Inspections re notifications of infectious diseases 220 Inspections, house-to-house visitations 111 Total Inspections 1,607 Re-inspections 2,521 House-to-House Inspections. House-to-House inspections were carried out as follows:— The whole of— Devonshire Terrace. Griffin Cottages. Chapel House Street. Sections of— East Perry Road. West Perry Road. Havannah Street Barque Street. Mellish Street. Glengall Road. Elizabeth Cottages. 237 Of the total premises inspected 1,044 were found to be in fair condition; 34.5 per cent. required various works of sanitary improvement, which necessitated the service of 505 written intimations, 160 statutory notices, 32 final notices, and 2 summonses. 27 drains were proved defective by the smoke and chemical tests, and in 231 instances the application of tests revealed no defects. Drains. Drain construction and reconstructions, including means of access and ventilation, were carried out at the following premises:— Tooke Street, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49. West Ferry Eoad, 3, 209, 211, 213. Chapel House Street, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Stebondale Street, 179, 181, 183, 185. Galbraith Street, 39 to 65 odd Nos. Island Gardens, Superintendent's House, Wharf Road. British Street L.C.C. Schools (Section only). Cubitt Town L.C.C. Schools (Section only, Wharf Road). The drains of the undermentioned premises were reconstructed partially or wholly on the old lines, in most cases including the fixing of new w.c. pans, traps and yard gullies:— West Ferry Road, 189, 198, 200, 317, 232. Rose Wharf, West Ferry Road. Alpha Road, 73. Mellish Street, 60, 66, 101. Malabar Street, 26. Gaverick Street, 22. Elizabeth Cottages, 2. Byng Street, 10. Griffin Cottages, 6. Manchester Road, 36 to 42, 187, 302, 207, 209, 211, 213, 392, 394. In all practicable cases a water test was applied to new work. New Buildings. During the year the undermentioned building was newly erected in this Division:— British Street School—School Keeper's House. R 238 The sanitary arrangements were examined and tested as the work progressed. The various Bye-laws in force were complied with. On your recommendation a water certificate was granted by the Council. Factories. Improved and sufficient sanitary accommodation for workmen has been provided at the following factories:— Rose's Wharf and Paint Factory, West Ferry Road. Messrs. J. Stewart's, Marine Engineers, Works, Stewart Street, Manchester Road. Hope's Chemical Works, Hope's Wharf, West Ferry Road. Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were visited and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations. Workshops, etc. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 36—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Rooms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms (20 in all) were inspected and dealt with where necessary. Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. 239 Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division (Poplar South) number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. In one instance only was it necessary to serve the authorities with a written intimation. At this School (St. Edmund's, West Perry Road) on inspection the drain inlet in playground was obstructed and one of the water flushing apparatuses of the boys' w.c.'s was out of repair. The nuisances were abated on the service of a written intimation. Public Health London Act, 1891. Prosecutions. Complaint. Premises. Costs. Failing to comply with statutory notice to clear and amend obstructed defective drain. 21, Chipka Street, Cubitt Town. Summons withdrawn on payment of £2 4s. costs.

Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises, and notices served as under:— No. of Intimations and Notices. Now Unoccupied. Bakehouses 8 11 — Cowhouses 1 1 — Slaughterhouses 1 — — Tripe dressers and sausage makers 9 8 Dairies and milk shops 24 — 1 Ice cream vendors 24 3 — Coffee shops and dining rooms 35 24 4 Fish shops 12 3 — Totals 114 50 5 240 The number of intimations and notices served and complied with, viz., 50, 3how the amount of work, principally cleansing and limewashing, which resulted from the above inspections. Riverside Wharves and Food Manufacturing and Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the undermentioned wharves for the purpose of detecting the landing or storage of unsound food intended for sale for human consumption, with the results indicated:— St. Andrew's Wharf and Cattle Food Manufactory, West Ferry Road. The undermentioned food stuffs were brought to the above premises (from without the district) and converted into cattle food:— Feb. 11th, 1909.—75 cases of desiccated cocoanut. Mar. 3rd, 1909.—88 packages of shelled walnuts. Sufferance Wharf and Food Preserving and Manufacturing Premises (for export only), West Ferry Road, Millwall. These premises were frequently visited and all unsound food stuffs, suspicious or blown tinned foods (sorted by the consignee from imported stock) were destroyed by the firm. Summary of food stuffs examined and destroyed by the consignee:— 71 cases tinned fish, principally lobster, salmon and sardines, about 50 tins per case. 50 do. do. about 60 tins per case. 6 cases salmon, about 48 tins per case. 4 cases mixed salmon and vegetables, 48 tins per case. 4 cases tinned fruit and tomatoes, 40 tins per case. Damaged or Unsound Foodstuffs returned from Abroad.—In response to notices from the Port Sanitary Authority of unsound foodstuffs consigned from the docks to the above factory, I have inspected the following goods on delivery, with the results indicated below:— 16 cases of sardines, each containing 100 tins per case. 127 tins unsound and destroyed, remainder sound. 24 Canadian cheeses each 601b. in weight. Damaged externally, unsound portions removed and destroyed. 241 2 cases calves' feet jelly, 36 jars per case. All unsound and destroyed. 3 cases tinned butter, 100 tins per case. External damage only to appearance of tins. Butter contained in sound condition. Maconochie's Wharf and Food Manufacturing and Preserving Factory West Ferry Boad. The above premises were constantly visited during the year, Particular attention was paid to the various food stuffs in course of preparation, as well as to the cleanliness of the vessels and utensils in use and of the sanitary conditions generally of the different kitchens and preparing rooms. All unsound or tainted food stuffs, blown or suspicious tinned food, etc., sorted out by the firm, were destroyed in the furnaces by the firm on the premises, mostly in my presence. The total amount of food stuffs destroyed (in my presence after being sorted out by the firm) during the year at this factory which consisted of meat, poultry, fish, soups, fruit and vegetables was 1858 tins, all of which was contained in tins varying from ½lb. to 14lb. in weight. Frequent exportations from the above factories of consignments of hams or tinned meat to the Argentine or Philippines (where a certificate is required from the Sanitary Authority of the district whence the goods are despatched to accompany each consignment) had occurred. In every instance the factory was visited and the foodstuffs (meat) examined prior to tinning before the certificates were signed. The additional powers conferred by the Regulations under the Public Health Regulations as to Food Act, 1907, facilitates a more rigid inspection of food stuffs landed at the above-mentioned wharves, and a more effectual means of dealing with and disposing of unsound food as defined in that statute. No notice under these regulations was received during the past year from the Officer of Customs relating to foodstuff imported into this division. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were 242 destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Foodstuffs Surrendered from Itinerant Vendors, Stalls and Small Dealers Premises. During the year, at the request of the owners, the undermentioned articles of food were examined at the Public Health Offices in some instances and on the district in others, and were found unfit for human food and were destroyed by the owners:— 1 trunk fresh herrings. 1 trunk cod roes. 1 trunk whiting. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-seven samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of that number 8 (being butters) contained boric acid preservatives ranging from .2 to .5 per cent. Of the remaining samples taken 3 were certified to be so adulterated that summonses were issued against the respective vendors. The nature of samples and extent of adulteration, with result of prosecutions, are indicated below:— 2F Milk—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 16 6 and 105 per cent. respectively. Vendor fined £10 and £2 2s. costs. 11F Butter—Adulterated with 49.7 per cent of foreign fat. £10 or two months' imprisonment. 47F Milk—Adulterated with 10.5 per cent. of water. £2 and £1 3s. costs. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspecctor of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 243 Report of Lady Inspector (Miss Tattersall). Public Health Department, December 31st, 1909. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my tenth Annual Report which deals with the work done in factories, workshops, among outworkers, and other miscellaneous inspections during the year 1909. During the year five notices were served where the sanitary accommodation was unsatisfactory, in three cases additional accommodation was provided, and in the other two alterations made. Scabies (Itch) and Verminous Children. I have visited a number of houses from which children were excluded from school when suffering from scabies, or on account of their verminous condition, and have had bedding disinfected and cleansing carried out. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation in the whole of the elementary school in the Borough has been inspected and various defects remedied. Outworkers. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 125 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 355 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 319 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. The following is a tabulated statement of further details :— 244 Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended December 31st, 1909:— Poplar.

"Cleansing of Verminous Rooms." The intimations under this Act again proved very useful, 75 of which were served during the year, and resulted in 104 rooms being freed from vermin. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. Section 78. " Water Supply in Tenement Houses In the month of March, notices were served under this Act to provide a proper and sufficient water supply at some tenement houses in Bromley. After a short delay the work was carried out, and there is now a supply tap and sink on each storey, which, needless to say, are greatly appreciated by the tenants. Nuisances. As in previous years, nuisances that came to my notice, and could not be dealt with under the Bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings, were duly reported to the Inspector for the district. Inspection and Cleansing. A large amount of cleansing and repairing, under the Bye-laws, was executed during the year. The work was carried out at houses in the following streets:— Arcadia Street. Alpha Road. Bakers Alley. Beachy Road. Box Street. Charles Terrace. Clifton Street. Davis Street. Devas Street. Eastward Street. Perry Street. Finches Yard. Franklin Street. Gale Street. Hancock Road. Hawgood Street. High Street, Poplar. High Street, Bow. Kerbey Street. Manchester Road. Milton Road. Northumberland Street. Park Street. Perring Street. Ranwell Street.

Legal Proceedings. In the month of April the landlord of No. 69, Arcadia Street was summoned at Thames Police Court for not supplying information, in order that the house should be placed on the register. The defendant alleged that the house was let to one family, but it was proved to the magistrate that he was collecting rents from more than one family. Fined 40s. and 23s. costs.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present the second Annual Report of my work. Poplar Health Visiting Association. The Poplar Health Visiting Association, of which I am organising Secretary, continues to do good, steady work. The five "Centres" into which the Borough is divided for working purposes are now properly organised and in good working order, each "Centre" having its own Hon. Secretary, Committee and band of "Helpers,'' the Hon. Sec. and two Delegates from each forming the Executive Committee, which is the ruling body of the Association. Consultation Days for Mothers and Babies are established in each "Centre"; these are held once a month, and the mothers may bring their infants to be weighed, and obtain advice on feeding and general management from the doctor in attendance. A "Provident Maternity Club" has been started in one "Centre." If this is successful, and the necessary funds are forthcoming, similar clubs will be started in each Centre. Several helpers have had to resign during the year owing to illness, removal or other causes, the number remaining on the list at the end of the year 1909 being sixty, including four doctors, five secretaries, and fifty-one visitors. To these, and to all who have so heartily co operated in helping forward the good work commenced by the Association, I should like to take this opportunity of expressing my heartfelt thanks, and trust that the success which has attended their first efforts will be an incentive to them, not only to continue, but to try and increase their efforts. The Association is composed of the following:— President Mrs. Sidney Buxton. Vice-President Mrs. R. H. Green. Hon. Treasurer Rev. H. Mosley. 250 North Bromley Centre. Hon. Sec. Mrs. E. Sinker. Hon. Consultant Doctor Helen Payne. Delegates to Executive:— Rev. J. H. Morrell. Rev. H. Johnstone. Number of Visitors 16 „ Infants visited 119 Consultation Day—Third Tuesday in the month at the Vicarage Rooms, High Street, Bromley. E, South Bromley Centre. Hon. Sec. Mrs. G. E. Young. Hon.

Number of Visitors 11 ,, Infants visited 57 Consultation Day—Second Friday in the month at the Town Hall, Newby Place, Poplar, E. Isle of Dogs Centre. Hon. Sec. Miss Wintour. Hon. Consultant Dr. Lilian Simpson. 251 Delegates to Executive:— Mrs. Duckham. Mrs. Cardale. Number of Visitors 5 „ Infants visited 440 Consultation Day—Alternate Thursdays, at St. Mildreds'House, West Ferry Road, Isle of Dogs, E. Bow Centre. Hon. Sec. Mrs. H. Mason. Hon. Consultant Dr. Ethel Lamport. Delegates to Executive:— Pastor Hayes. Dr. Lamport. Number of Visitors 10 ,, Infants visited 48 and once to all infants born in St. Stephen's Parish, more often if necessary. Consultation Day—Third Thursday in the month at the Bow Baths, Roman Road, E. The Isle of Dogs Centre has a paid worker, which accounts for the difference in the amount of work undertaken. Number of visits paid :— Voluntary Helpers— Visits 981 Re-visits 9,696 Health Visitor— Visits 671 Re-visits 1,562 Total 11,258 Attended "Consultation Days " 1,519 252 Infant Feeding. Reliable information regarding feeding, etc., of the infants visited by the voluntary helpers is not available, and as I mentioned in my last report, it is impossible for me to visit the cases before handing them over, which would be the better way; however, the following facts regarding the infants visited by myself, may, I think, be taken as typical of the whole. Of the 671 visited, 12 had removed, 17 were dead, and 12 were still births. The remaining ones were fed, at the time of visit, as follows : — Breastfed 92.0 per cent. Mixed feeding 3.3 ,, Hand fed 4.7 ,, 100.0 Number of mothers who worked during pregnancy:— Home work 8.7 per cent. Factory, workshop, charing, etc. 8 4 ,, Families occupying— 1 room per family 9.6 per cent. 2 rooms ,, 21.1 ,, It is now possible to give statistics regarding infants born from March to December, 1908. 922 were kept under supervision as far as possible, but of these 231 removed and were not traced. This does not adequately convey the difficulties met with when working amongst people of migratory habits, as some of these changed their address no less than five times. The total number of changes were 388, equal to 42 per cent. of the whole number visited, changing their address once. Of the 691 remaining, 72 died, giving a mortality rate of 104.19 per thousand visited, which I venture to think may be looked upon as a satisfactory result of the year's work, especially when one takes into consideration the fact that the worst areas in the Borough are mapped out for visiting.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— Respecting the sheets issued for analysis of cases, for the purpose of the Home Office Inquiry, still-births and miscarriages are not visited, so that no information regarding such cases is available. The cases are taken from Bromley, Poplar, Old Ford and Victoria Park, so as to be representative cf the whole Borough. They are all "casual-labour" districts, very few of the men being in regular work. The average income given is what they would have if they worked, but as 17.8 per cent. have been in receipt of Parish Relief, and others have been working under the Distress Committee sometime during the year, it will be seen that the average, low as it is, is too high. The women who work at home are match and cardboard box makers, trouser, coat and vest finishers, shirt makers, etc. All consider five shillings a good week; out of that they have to provide glue, cottons, etc., and use their own tools. The factory workers are "cutters down," fillers, etc., in match factories, packers in sweet factories. The few working "elsewhere" have done anything from hawking to nursing their neighbours during confinement. With regard to Habits.—None of the parents in the cases under supervision were abstainers, but the amount of drinking, especially amongst the women, is not to be compared with those amongst whom I worked in Liverpool, still, it is a matter for regret that the idea of beer being necessary to a nursing mother should be so deeply rooted. Quite a large proportion of the mothers prepare a proper dinner for the family when they have the means, with others, milkless tea and bread form the chief articles of diet, except for the husband—"who must have a bit of something, Miss." General Cleanliness.—Here again I must judge by comparison, and the sanitary arrangements are so infinitely superior to those in the provincial towns in which I have worked, that it must of necessity affect the home; the difference, to be appreciated, must be seen. Care of Children.—In the main they are as well cared for as can be expected. In my opinion it is impossible for any woman to give the 255 attention necessary for the well-being of the little ones when they are born, or to bear healthy children, when she is continually either suckling or carrying (sometimes carrying on both functions together) in addition to acting as general charwoman and nursemaid, and, in some cases, as breadwinner also to the family. That we cannot have quantity and quality is a fact very forcibly impressed on our mind every day. I have taken "infectious diseases" in the grouping of "causes of death" to mean notifiable infectious diseases, not including measles. I was not able in my Annual Report to make any comparisons of the mortality between the infants of working and non-working mothers, but have taken the opportunity to do so now. The result was so startling that I have prepared another Table for the purpose of comparison, which shows that the result in the present case is largely accidental. Table I. Comparison of rates of mortality between infants of working and nonworking mothers in the cases under supervision for the purpose of the Home Office Inquiry. Rate of mortality 16.6 per cent. ,, amongst infants of non-working mothers 21.4 „ ,, „ „ home workers 11.1 „ ,, ,, ,, factory workers 0.0 „ ,, ,, „ charwomen, etc. 20.0 „ Table II.

PUBLIC SWIMMING BATHS. * * "The Morning Post directs attention to the dangers arising from public swimming baths. Every spell of hot weather produces a concerted rush to the swimming baths. After these periodic incursions a large number of the pilgrims suffer from colds or from internal disturbances which they commonly refer to chills suffered during their aberrant enthusiasm for the bath. This cause is more likely to be infection from the micro-organisms of the swimming bath if, as often is the case, the water in it is not renewed frequently or if the number of people who use it is large. Cases both of nose and ear affections have been traced to this source, and sometimes, though this is rare, typhoid enters the pool and spreads therefrom. These dangers apply not merely to indoor swimming baths, but to some swimming pools or lakes. Filtration has been tried without very much effect, sterilisation by heat is out of the question because of the expense, but sterilisation by chemicals offers a fruitful method because it has even been applied successfully (at Barking, for example) to sewage effluents. The application to a swimming bath of the methods of purifying sewage has been recently tried with satisfactory results. Hypochlorite of lime* in quantities sufficient to give 1 part available chlorine to 2 millions of water was found to afford efficient sterilization.f The swimming pool * The Electrolytic Fluid manufactured at Poplar is practically a solution containing hypochlorite of magnesia, which has the advantage of being non-caustic non-acid and non-poisonous. Other hypochlorites belong to the caustic and alkali and alkaline-like earth groups of substances. A hypochlorite of magnesia belongs to the magnesia group, and for commercial purposes can only be made cheaply by the aid of electricity. † For the three baths of over 80,000 gallons the strength of the fluid is kept as near as possible at 2-5 grammes of chlorine per litre, and for the two baths at Poplar at 2 0 grammes of chlorine per litre. 30, 20 and 20 gallons of fluid are added to the first three baths, 20, 20 and 20 gallons to the large Poplar bath and 10, 10 and 10 gallons to the small bath. If these additions be worked out it will be found they are sufficient to give one part of available chlorine to 1,600,000, 1,800,000 and 2,800,000 of water. * * See page 85. when so treated remained practically sterile for four days during constant use. No odour or taste from the chemicals is noticeable. How often such treatment need be applied must vary with local conditions, but probably the application twice a week in the proportions named would ensure a practically sterile swimming bath or pool."—Reprint, Water and Water Engineering, page 147, June 15th, 1910. Extract. Water Sterilization.* " ...We believe that the process (hypochlorite treatment) is not only " likely to be useful as an emergency method, but that ultimately it will " be accepted in this country as one of the ordinary steps in water " purification, and just as we now drink water which has been treated " with coagulants and filters to make it clear, so shall we be equally ready " to adopt a simple and cheap process, whereby the bacterial purity of the " water can be insured also. If we are content to drink waters which " have been treated with large quantities of sulphate of iron, why should " we reject without reason an infinitely small quantity of chlorine."— Reprint, The Surveyor and Municipal and County Engineer, page 803, June 10th, 1910. * The Surveyor and Municipal and County Engineer, pages 819 to 821.

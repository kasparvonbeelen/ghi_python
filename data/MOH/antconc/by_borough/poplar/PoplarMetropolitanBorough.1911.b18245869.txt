Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with the "Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my nineteenth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1911, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The Report of the Lady Health Visitor is also included. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1911, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1901 and 1911 being maintained, is 162,290:— Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. ###] 4,522,628 56,272 65,210 40,808 being 69.72 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 48.25 per acre in Poplar B 2 Sub-District, 107.64 in Bromley, and 73.43 in Bow. These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1911. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1910 are the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Sub-District of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three sub-districts might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., VI. and VII., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1901 and 1911. Births. During the year 1911, 133 births were notified outside the Borough belonging thereto:—126 by the Medical Officer of Health of Stepney, one by the Medical Officer of Health of Hackney, four by the Medical Officer of Health of Finsbury, one by the Medical Officer of Health of Lambeth and one by the Medical Officer of Health of Leyton. The Stepney births occurred in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road. The one birth in Hackney took place in the Hackney Union Infirmary. The Finsbury births occurred in the City of London Lying-in Hospital, the Lambeth birth in the Clapham Maternity Lying-in Hospital and the Leyton birth in the Whipp's Cross Infirmary.

In the 52 weeks 2889 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 662 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1790 in Bromley, and 417 in Bow ; from the 682 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 50 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 438 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1070 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1790 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 790 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 240 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 1240. From the 417 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 3 non-residents and added 352 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 766 deaths. In dealing separately with the sub-districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III., that in considering the deaths of nonresidents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub-districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2889 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 395 deaths of actual nonresidents and 582 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 3076 upon which the death rate is calculated.

Mortality rate among infants visited was 105'69 per 1000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough. J In the County of London during the year 1911 there were 111,738 children born, of whom 14,440 died under one year of age. "The rate in 1910 was only 103 per 1,000 births. This is the lowest London rate recorded, and is 29 per 1,000 below the average in the preceding 10 years."—Registrar-General. 13 Notification of Births Act, 1907. During the year 4545 notifications were received under the Notifications of Births Act, 1907. Discrepancies in Registration of Births. The Committee's attention was again directed to discrepancies in the dates of births as notified to the Medical Officer of Health under the Notification of Births Act, and the dates of the same births as registered by the Registrars. In a recent case a birth was registered as having occurred three weeks after the actual date of birth. It appears the object in giving false information for registration is to avoid liability to the penalty to which persons are liable when the birth is not registered, without reasonable excuse, within 42 days of its occurrence. The Committee had already called the attention of the Registrar General to the subject, and after the case mentioned above they directed that warning notices be issued calling attention to the penalties to which the responsible parties are liable. Notification to the Medical Officer of Health under the Notification of Births Act, is required to be given within 36 hours of birth, but this notice is required in addition to, and not in substitution for, the notice required to be given to the Registrar within 42 days. Under the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1874, Section 40, any person who " makes any false statement with intent to have the same entered in any register of births and deaths, shall for each offence be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds. Poplar Health Visiting Association and the Appointment of a Second Health Visitor. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Poplar Health Visiting Association. St. Mildred's House, Millwall, E. October 13th, 1911. To the Chairman, Public Health Committee. Dear Sir, At a meeting of the Poplar Health Visiting Association held 14 at the Town Hall on Friday, October 6th, the following resolution was passed :— " That the Poplar Health Visiting Association should approach the Public Health Committee with a view of asking them to make a recommendation to the Borough Council to appoint a Health Visitor to do similar work to that being done now by Miss Guest, who is leaving in December, and that the Public Health Committee be asked to receive a deputation lrom the Association." The Public Health Visiting Association for the last ten months has been able to place at the disposal of the Health Committee the services of a qualified and trained lady visitor (Miss D. Guest) who has been paid at the rate of £100 a year. The Public Health Visiting Association has done its best to make the arrangement a permanent one, but it has failed, and the valuable work must come to an end after next month unless the Council are willing to take it up. In Miss Hall the Council has a most capable organiser of health visiting, but in so large an area she needs assistance if all the ground is to be properly covered. The infant death rate for the Borough of Poplar in 1910 was 119 per thousand births, as compared with 112 per thousand in Stepney, a very similar district. The rate of mortality of infants visited by the Health Visitor and the Public Health Visiting Association was 98 per thousand. See pages 12 and 289 Dr. Alexander's Report. (Annual Report, 1910.) Such a startling reduction in the death rate speaks for itself, and needs no words to emphasise the invaluable nature of the work done. How urgent the matter is becomes clear when we remember that a heavy death rate among infants entails a heavy rate of inefficiency and disease among the children who grow up, and our experience in the last three years shows clearly that the systematic visiting of mothers and infants in their own homes by qualified visitors brings its reward in the gratifying reduction of the infant death rate as shown. 15 Miss Guest has paid in nine months 616 first visits and 2,740 re-visits, making a total of 3,356 visits, and these in the poorest streets of the Borough. The Public Health Visiting Association, therefore, desires to urge upon the Committee the desirability of recommending the appointment of another Health Visitor, not only on humanitarian grounds, but on the certainty that the continuance of this work will bring in a large and increasing return of the best kind to the Borough. To remove a possible misconception I am desired to add that the Public Health Visiting Association, while willing, of course, to co-operate in every way with the new officer, if appointed, recognise that she would be responsible solely to the Council and directed in her work solely by the Medical Officer of Health and the Public Health Committee. A small deputation of the Public Health Visiting Association hope to attend the meeting of your Committee on Tuesday, October 24th, and will be most grateful if you will allow them to place their views before you. I am, yours truly, (Signed), (Miss) KATHLEEN WINTOUR, Chairman, Executive, P.H.V. Assoc. A deputation, comprising Mrs. Sydney Buxton, Mrs. R. H. Green, Dr. Ethel Lamport, Miss K. Wintour and Mr. H. Martley, introduced by Councillors H. R. Barge and R. H. Green, J.P., waited upon the Public Health and Housing Committee in support of the representations of the Health Visiting Association. It was stated that on the Isle of Dogs provision is made for support of the work and employment of a trained visitor by voluntary means, but in the remainder of the Borough the Association is unable to continue to collect the necessary funds for employment of a qualified visitor, or to depend upon voluntary help ; and they considered it essential a second official Health Visitor should be appointed to work with Miss Hall as Miss Guest had hitherto done. The Committee were strongly impressed with the value of the work accomplished by the Association and the Health Visitors, as shewn in the reduction of the rate of infantile mortality in the Borough. The deaths of infants under one year in 1908 were 123-83 per 1,000 births; while in 16 1910 the death rate in eases visited was 98'75 per 1,000 (such cases being those in which the death rate would ordinarily be highest), as against 119'38 per 1,000 births for the whole Borough and 103 for London in the same year. In addition to the saving of infant life effected, an important result of the work is that infants surviving are, by reason of the advice and assistance afforded, saved from rickets (caused by malnutrition from improper rather than insufficient feeding) and other sources of feebleness which eventuate in ill-health, incapacity and destitution in later life. The Committee were assured the attentions of the Health Visitors are never resented, but are welcomed and appreciated in the homes visited. The Committee were of opinion it is desirable the work carried out by the Visitor employed by the Association, under Miss Hall's supervision, should be continued by the Council, and that to ensure this a second Health Visitor should now be appointed. It is necessary the selection of the person to be appointed as a Health Visitor should be approved by the Local Government Board before the appointment is made. • The Committee recommended the Council:— (a) That, subject to approval by the Local Government Board a second Health Visitor be appointed at a salary of £100, rising to £150 per annum by annual increments of £10; that advertisements be issued inviting applications from persons qualified, and that your Committee select three candidates for submission to the Council.* (b) That application be made to the London County Council for payment, under Section 6 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, of one-half of the salary of the Second Health Visitor appointed. OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Compulsory Notification , Conference of Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health ; London County Council and Nursing Arrangements. Compulsory Notification of Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Notice was received from the London County Council that the *Miss Prances E. Alldritt was appointed Second Health Visitor by the Council and commenced her duties on March 5th, 1912. 17 Council had made an order on February 7th, 1911, approved by the Local Government Board, that section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the notification of infectious disease shall apply, in the Administrative County of London to the disease known as ophthalmia neonatorum. The order with reference to ophthalmia neonatorum came into operation on March 13th, 1911. The midwives practising within the Borough of Poplar were circularised calling attention to the above Order, the effect of which is: — To require that, on becoming aware that the inmate of any house, building, vessel, tent, van, shed, or similar structure used for human habitation within the Administrative County of London, is suffering from ophthalmia neonatorum, the head of the family to which the patient belongs, and in his default the nearest relatives of the patient present in the house or in attendance on the patient, and in default of such relatives every person in charge of or in attendance on the patient, and, in default of such person, the master of the house or other similar structure, shall send notice of the case to the Medical Officer of Health of the sanitary district in which the house or structure is situated; and every medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit the patient shall send to the same Medical Officer of Health a certificate giving full particulars of the case. Every person required by the statute to send a notice or certificate who fails forthwith to send the same will be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. Conference of Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health. A Conference of Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health was held on March 17th. Sir Shirley P. Murphy, Medical Officer of Health for the London County Council, was present. The Conference was called for the purpose of discussing the best methods of dealing with cases of ophthalmia neonatorum, and it was decided that with regard to cases of inflammation of the eye in the newly born, notified to Sir Shirley F. Murphy by midwives C 18 (1) Visits will be paid in first instance by the London County Council Inspectors under the Midwives Act; (2) If hospital treatment is urgently necessary the Inspectors will take immediate steps to obtain it; (3) The name and address of each case will be sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the borough concerned, special note being made of the fact if the patient has gone to hospital; (4) After the notification has reached the Medical Officer of Health of the district concerned the responsibility for further action is in his hands ; and (5) Information as to the patient's further progress should be sent to Sir Shirley Murphy for entry upon the records. Sir Shirley Murphy asked the medical officers of health to let him know of any cases of inflammation of the eye, amongst midwives' patients attended by midwives in their districts, coming to their knowledge. London County Council and Nursing Arrangements. A communication was received from Sir Shirley Murphy enclosing a memorandum showing the arrangements made by the London County Council in connection with cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum occurring in the practice of midwives, as follows:— The London County Council's Inspectors visit all cases of inflammation of the eyes of infants in the practice of midwives and a record is kept of the conditions at the times of the visits and of the results. Arrangements have been made with certain nursing associations in London for the nursing of cases which required special care on account of the severity of the symptoms or on account of the home conditions such as to make this assistance desirable, and the services of nurses from one or two other institutions have also been utilised. This assistance has been provided gratuitously by the following nursing institutions Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses, 58, Victoria Street, S.W.—This institute has published a map 19 shewing London in districts and giving the address of each local branch to which application for a nurse should be sent. The Eanyard Nurses, Ranyard House, 25, Russell Square, W.C., to which address applications for a nurse should be sent. This Association has printed a list of districts and streets in which their nurses can be employed. The North London Association for Nursing the Sick Poor, 413, Holloway Road, N.—This is an association supplying nurses to be used in the locality. Nursing Sisters of St. John the Divine (3 addresses).— East End Nurses' District Home, 1, Bow Lane, Poplar, E.; S. John's Hospital, Morden Hill, Lewisham, S.E.; SouthEast London District Home, Watson Street, Deptford, S.E. East London Nursing Society, Charterhouse, E.C. The County Council has been in communication with various hospitals with a view to the admission of mother and child where the cases are so severe as to make this course desirable. The London Hospital receives a few cases under these circumstances. The Metropolitan Asylums Board has undertaken to provide an ambulance for the removal of cases without charge, but does not provide a nurse. 20 AGE MORTALITY.

The Local Government Board issued an Order making pulmonary tuberculosis a notifiable disease under the Infectious Diseases Clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, as from January 1st, 1912, but no enactment rendering a patient or any other person liable to a penalty, or which subjects a patient to any restriction or disability affecting himself or his employment is to be applied in such cases. Notifications under the Order are to be treated as confidential. A fee of 2s. 6d. is to be paid to the notifying medical practitioner in respect of each case notified, except in the cases of Poor Law and hospital notifications, already provided for in a previous Order. School medical inspectors are to notify cases in schools. In the circular which accompanied the Order, the Local Government Board pointed out that ability to convey infection is limited and intermittent, and that infection can be prevented by the patient himself when he has learnt to practice elementary precautions. Upon receipt of a notification the Medical Officer of Health, either personally or through an officer acting under his instructions, is to take such steps as may appear to him to be necessary or desirable for preventing the spread of infection, and for removing conditions favourable to infection. Apart from treatment, the Board urged upon local authorities the 32 great importance of making full use of their powers of preventing overcrowding and securing removal of any conditions tending to injure the health of their districts. The Board also pointed out that local authorities have power to provide sanatoria, or contract for use of such institutions, and state that they are advised these powers enable local authorities to provide or contract for the use of dispensaries or out-patient hospitals. The Public Health and Housing Committee were informed that sanatoria treatment for tuberculosis, however, was being provided for under the National Insurance Bill then before Parliament, and steps had been taken locally for the provision of a tuberculosis dispensary for Poplar by voluntary means. This dispensary will be in operation early in the year 1912. In connection with the Local Government Board Order in respect of the notification and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, it was considered desirable that samples of sputum should be bacteriologically examined, and the Public Health and Housing Committee authorised examination by the Lister Institute on the same terms as for similar examinations in connection with cases of diphtheria and typhoid fever. The Council approved of the action of the Committee. Each medical practitioner practising within the Borough of Poplar was supplied with the following letter and copy of the regulations, viz.:— [Copy. | Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911. Public Health Offices, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Bow Road, E. (Corner of Fairfield Road), 191... Sir, I beg to draw your attention to the Order of the Local Government Board dated 15th November, 1911, which imposes important duties upon medical practitioners relating to the notification to the Medical Officer of Health of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. A copy of the Order is enclosed, together with a copy of the official circular accompanying the Order. 33 The Order, which is entitled the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911, completes the administrative machinery necessary for the notification to the Medical Officer of Health, as far as practicable, of all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis as soon as they are observed. It requires that, as from 1st January, 1912, all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis upon which a medical practitioner is in attendance must be notified by him within 48 hours of his first diagnosis of the cases as such to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the patient is residing. Articles IV. and V. of the Order deal specially with the duties of medical practitioners and their remuneration. The notifications must be made in the prescribed Form A set forth in the schedule to the Order. With regard to such cases of pulmonary tuberculosis as you observe, who reside within the district of this Council, the notification should be sent to the Public Health Offices, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Bow Road, E. (corner of Fairfield Road). A fee of 2s. 6d. for every case of pulmonary tuberculosis notified is payable by the Council of the area within which the address of the patient as given on the notification is situated. You will receive from the Medical Officer of Health, in every case in which the address of the patient is not within his district, a notice informing you to which Medical Officer of Health the notification has been transferred. In such cases it is suggested that a record of the transfer should be made in order that you may readily be enabled to claim the fee from the Council from whom it is due. In accordance with the provisions of the Order, I transmit to you a supply of the notification Form A. A further supply will be sent upon application. The notification has attached to it duplicate counterfoils, which are drawn up to simplify the further proceedings. When notice is received that a notification has been transferred to another Medical Officer of Health, a memorandum should be made in the space provided on the counterfoils, so that the fee may be claimed from the proper Council. d 34 The accounts should be sent in quarterly, made up to the usual quarter days. Yours faithfully, Fkedk. Wm. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health. To Medical Practitioner. [N.B.—Poor Law District Medical Officers must still notify Poor Law patients, and forward their claims for fee3 as hitherto under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, on the forms supplied by the Guardians.] Each medical practitioner was also supplied with a book of forms of notification under Schedule A of the regulations, in addition to which the following footnote had been added to the form :— Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911. Notification by Medical Practitioners. Article IV. (1) Subject as provided in Articles X., XI. and XII. of these regulations every medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit any person shall, within 48 hours after first becoming aware that such person is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, complete, sign and transmit a notification of the case in the form shown in the Schedule A to these regulations to the Medical Officer of Health for the area within which the place of residence of the person is situate : Provided that a medical practitioner shall not be required under these regulations to notify any case of pulmonary tuberculosis which has already, to his knowledge, under these regulations or under the Poor Law Regulations or under the hospital regulations, been notified to the Medical Officer of Health for the area within which the place of residence of the patient is situate. [N.B.—Poor Law District Medical Officers must still notify Poor Law patients and forward their claims for fees as hitherto 35 under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, on the forms supplied by the Guardians. The head master and head mistress of each public elementary school in the borough were supplied with a book of forms of notification under Schedule B of the regulations, and books of forms were also supplied to the London County Council. The London County Council were duly informed that books of forms had been supplied to the schools above-mentioned. As each notification is received from a medical practitioner, the following letter is fowarded to him with the enclosures mentioned:— [Copy. J (Encl.) Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Boad, E. 191... Dear Sir, Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911. I am in receipt of your notification under the above-mentioned regulations that of is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. I enclose herewith a stamped envelope and will be pleased to hear from you as to whether your patient would like the loan from the Poplar Borough Council of a spit-cup or pocket-flask. I am sending you a picture card and printed card as to general precautions respecting the prevention of consumption, etc., which possibly you may care to give to the friends of the patient. If at any time you may advise the disinfection of your patient's house, or part thereof, or of any of the articles contained therein, it would be carried out free of charge by the staff of the Public Health Department upon application being made. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, Dr Medical Officer of Health. 36 As the Council resolved to supply outfits for the bacteriological examination of sputum from suspected cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, the following letter was forwarded to the medical practitioners in the borough, and numerous requests to be supplied with outfits were received :— (Encl.) Dear Sir, [Copy.] Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Boad, E. (Corner of Fairfield Boad), January 3rd, 1912. Pulmonary Tuberculosis. I beg to inform you that the Public Health and Housing Committee have resolved to recommend the Borough Council to supply, free of charge, to medical practitioners, outfits for the bacteriological examination of sputum from suspected cases of pulmonary tuberculosis residing within the Borough of Poplar. The Council will have the samples bacteriologically examined at their ovvn expense and the results will be forwarded to medical Practitioners in due course. I shall therefore be glad if you will inform me whether you wish to be furnished with outfits. A stamped envelope is herewith enclosed. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, Dr Medical Officer of Health. The card index system already in use under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Begulations, 1908, and the Public Health (Tuberculosis in Hospitals) Begulations, 1911, has also been adopted, for the new 37 regulation, and one register is in use for all eases notified under the three regulations. A book of weekly statements of notifications received under the three regulations is also being kept for the return of cases to the London County Council in accordance with the regulations. Milk and Dairies Bill. It is stated that early in the year 1912 a Milk and Dairies Bill will be introduced into the House of Commons. Anti-Tuberculosis Dispensary. Whilst this report is being written an anti-tuberculosis dispensary is about to be opened in the Bow Road. The institution will be conducted on the lines of the Edinburgh scheme and is supported by voluntary contributions. The essential feature of the system is the provision of the services of a doctor who not only sees the patients when they come to the dispensary, but also visits them in their homes, advises as to hygienic conditions, and examines other members of the household.

The fluid continues to be added to the water in the swimming baths in the same quantity and strength as mentioned in the Annual Report for the year 1909, viz., 1 part of chlorine to 2,000,000 parts of water. 3237 gallons were supplied to the Poplar Baths, 3217 gallons to the Bow Baths and 1,106 gallons to the Island Baths, making a total of 7,560 gallons. The Bath Superintendents repeat their statements that the addition of the fluid prevents the formation of slime in the water, the slime is not found at the bottom of the baths when they are emptied, and there is no offensive smell when the baths are being cleansed. Comments on Adverse Criticisms. It is somewhat amusing to learn that after the electrolytic process of manufacturing hypochlorite of magnesium has stood a successful trial of six years in the Borough of Poplar adverse criticisms have not ceased to be made. The experience gained in Poplar, in the opinion of many people, should have been sufficient for any ordinary intelligence, but it has not been unknown in the world's history that new institutions, processes, or discoveries, have sustained adverse criticisms largely founded on vested interests. Quotations from various scientific workers in laboratories are interesting enough, but broad common sense facts from practical workings are far more to the purpose. Without doubt, when the figures quoted in these comments are seen, pencil and paper will be immediately seized and there will be worked out the cost of chlorine manufactured in various ways to prove that the Poplar process is extravagant; it is, however, much easier to work out figures on paper than to carry on a producing process. * See "The Pollution of Swimming Baths," by J. Graham Forbes, M.D., M.R.C.P., D.P.H., an up-to-date paper upon the serious matter of the evils and dangers lurking in our swimming baths, read before the Medical Officers of Schools Association, 22nd February, 1912. In a concluding paragraph Dr. Forbes states :— "There can be no doubt, therefore, that the value and practical use of the electrolytic method of disinfecting swimming baths shown in the Poplar district clearly demand its general application to all swimming baths, including not only those under the control of borough or district councils, but also those at our public schools." Dr. Graham Forbes' paper is published by J. & A. Churchill, 7, Great Marlborough Street. Price Is. net. 95 In spite of adverse criticism I am fully convinced, after the six years' practical success of the electrolytic process of production adopted in Poplar that there is no more suitable means of producing a cheap, clean and effective chlorine solution. A solution of hypochlorite of magnesium is not caustic, it is non-poisonous, and is the least destructive to clothing of all the hypochlorites. It has the advantage over phenol (carbolic acid) disinfectants, there being no need to dispense it in coloured, particular shaped and specially labelled bottles, applicants requiring fluid are consequently enabled to bring their own bottles, which provides a great saving to the rate payers. Figures have been given in many of my former Annual Reports respecting the cost of distribution of carbolic acid disinfectants, and therefore need not be repeated. The process of making a hypochlorite solution as carried out in Poplar is quite simple Open the taps, switch on the electric current and the disinfectant is at once available. Since the installation of the plant 200,000 gallons of fluid (at an average strength of 5 grammes of available chlorine per litre—at this strength the fluid is much too strong for domestic purposes and requires diluting) have been made for the sum of £380, out of which amount £212 were for electricity, leaving a sum of £168 for raw material, including water. Respecting the £212 for electricity, an advantage accrues to the Borough from this item of expenditure because £35, or 16 per cent., of this sum is clear profit.* It is quite possible a saving could be made upon the raw material, but as the plant is worked absolutely by unskilled men a rule of thumb must be adopted. If skilled labour were employed, the £168, or an average of £28 per annum, for six years would soon be swallowed up. It is obvious that municipal authorities adjacent to the sea, and owners of ships, would not require raw material, as the electrolyte—sea-water—is always at their doors, f * Adverse critics and experts will probably carp and cavil at the oost of an electrolytic disinfectant when electricity is so cheap that a smokeless metropolis and other cities and towns exist, lighting, heating, and motive power being all effected by electricity obtained from municipal transforming stations—local main generating stations being shut down—supplied with extra high-tension current generated at the coalfields which so far as the metropolis is concerned are less than 150 miles away. The same remarks would apply should a main generating electricity station be installed at a port near the metropolis where there is plenty of room for stacking sea-borne coal, and the cables transmitting the extra high-tension current laid along the railways. † As to the value of a hypochlorite made from sea-water by means of electrolysis the following facts ought to be sufficient:— 96 As to labour, carbolic acid disinfectants in being bottled and dispensed require the same amount of labour as the bottling and dispensing of the hypochlorite solution. It is true that more labour has been employed since the introduction of the electrolytic disinfectant at Poplar, for the very simple reason that the demands of the public for this disinfectant have been greater than when carbolic acid disinfectants were distributed, and, moreover, the electrolytic disinfectant being somuch cheaper than the phenol disinfectant, and there being such a saving in bottles, the Borough being well able to afford to distribute it with a lavish hand have to employ more ^labour to meet the increased demand. I venture to say if hypochlorite of lime were extracted from bleaching powder there would be more labour entailed than with the present electrolytic process adopted in Poplar. In Germany and America over seven hundred electrolysers are now In America an important operation was carried out in 1895 at a place called Riker's Island, East River, New York Harbour. Garbage had been "dumped " here for some years, and the place had become so pestilential that a writer in the " Electrical Engineer," a New York publication, said : " The stench was awful. I have been informed that it was nauseating three miles away on the open waters of the Sound; while residents at College Point, nearly two miles oft' and elsewhere, became loud in their outcry." An installation for electrolysing sea water, or salt water, was fitted upon a barge and sprayed the poisonous area with a hose. A complete care was effected over the surface of the whole thirty acres in a brief three weeks. Half a dozen little sprays were at work. Riker's Island was completely disinfected, there was no active putrefaction going on and as a consequence the noxious gases and odours so much complained of were not perceptible on the grounds. The sewage of Havre and Rouen has been treated with electrolysed sea water. The sewage of Worthing, Ipswich and Lytham has also been treated with the same disinfectant. The War Office have adopted the Hermite system throughout the Victoria Hospital, Netley. The electrolysed solution of about half a gramme per litre is supplied to every closet, sink and ward in the hospital. A plant has been erected in a building close to shore and is capable of producing 500 gallons per hour of hermitine (electrolysed sea water by the Hermite process). The solution is pumped into a tank at the top of the main building and thence distributed by pipes into all parts. Quite recently the Admiralty have installed at Osborne a system similar to that at Netley. Ships and seaside hotels and hospitals can be fitted up with the apparatus as at Netley and Osborne. An apparatus was fitted on board a French troopship bound for Madagascar and gave great satisfaction. At a Catholic School in Marseilles a plant was installed. 97 in use in the textile and allied industries, or in hospitals and similar institutions in those countries, so that it is evident that electrolyticallyproduced compounds of chlorine can under favourable conditions be far more economically produced than solutions of chemically-produced compounds of chlorine hypochlorites (bleaching powder), and not only for the reason that the cost of production and labour is less, but that the resultant available chlorine is much more efficient than chlorine of the chemically-produced bleaching powder. This has been over and over again demonstrated by authorities. Experimenting in bleaching paper pulp it has been shown electrically-produced chlorine has a superior efficiency of 2 to 1. However, some results of recent researches endeavour to prove that there is but a small difference between the relative bleaching efficiency of chemically and electrolytically produced chlorine. I am not a chemist and do not wish to pose as such, but I have watched the process for six years in Poplar, to say nothing of the time spent in studying the process before it was installed in the Borough, and one fact is made distinctly patent to my mind, that the unstable fluid as it leaves the electrolysers has quicker if not greater bleaching powers than when it has been made stable. This statement inav be useful knowledge to bleachers who have no need to store fluid and who would immediately use the unstable fluid for bleaching purposes. I believe the greater bleaching properties of the unstable fluid are due to the presence of hypochlorous acid, hence the best process for bleaching purposes would be one with the most hypochlorous acid in the fluid in its unstable state. (See " Lancet," January ISth, 1908 : " Electrolyticallvproduced fluids containing hypochlorites, their manufacture, and the rationale and chemistry of the process for securing stability.") Respecting electrolytic processes which are referred to in opposition to the one adopted in Poplar, no information is given as to whether a hypochlorite of sodium, or of potassium, or of calcium, is made, or of magnesium, as in Poplar, but greater strengths of available chlorine are put forward as a plea against the Poplar process.* Hypochlorite of magnesium belongs to the magnesia and not to the alkali group. It is not caustic, is non-poisonous, and to the clothes is the least destructive of all the hypochlorites. It is obvious that the stable solutions of electrolytically-made hypochlorites of magnesium are * The fluid is made in Poplar at an average strength of 5 grammes of chlorine per litre, which strength is quite sufficient and requires dilution before using, but if it be so desired an apparatus could be constructed to produce fluid of a strength of 20 grammes and upwards of chlorine per litre. H 98 preferable to those of sodium and potassium or even calcium, because for the purposes of rendering the three last mentioned solutions stable, there would have to be used hydroxide of the metals of the alkali or the alkaline earth calcium, which are extremely caustic, alkaline, and very soluble, and where varying strengths of electrolytic fluid, containing the hypochlorites of sodium and potassium, are produced, one may add too much or too little of the hydroxides of the alkalies when working with unskilled labour. But when the extremely insoluble hydroxide or oxide of magnesium is added and mixed, one can add and stir in any quantity, but only the necessary amount will be absorbed. It is common knowledge that metallic hypochlorites of the alkali metals and alkaline earths may be obtained in the pure state by neutralising hypochlorous acid with certain metallic hydroxides of the alkali metals and alkaline earth groups. But to obtain hypochlorite of magnesium, even upon a small scale, to say nothing of the large quantity manufactured in Poplar, by means of electricity, and to render it stable by using the hydroxide or oxide of magnesium, should, in view of the practical experience obtained in Poplar during the past six years, necessitate no criticism. Even supposing a solution of hypochlorite of calcium be produced more cheaply from bleaching powder by lixiviation than a solution of hypochlorite of magnesium by an electrolytic process—which is the better fluid for municipal domestic purposes? I venture to think the latter is, for the reason stated above, the public have consequently a better article. Bleaching powder is subject to great fluctuations in price, and it contains from 33 to 37 per cent, of available chlorine, but it very rapidly loses its efficiency when exposed to the atmosphere, and it is no exaggeration to say that a further 15 to 18 per cent, must be deducted from the efficiency of available chlorine when bought to the chlorine as ultimately obtained. Another point is, that with chloride of lime two-thirds, residue, must be disposed of in some way ; it is generally allowed to accumulate on waste ground, where in time it becomes a nuisance. I certainly think that if hypochlorite of lime were extracted from bleaching powder there would be more labour required than with the electrolytic process adopted in Poplar. Respecting the cost of the plant, its depreciation and the maintenance of the depot in which it is housed, it is certainly unfair at the present time to criticise past figures because six years ago a plant was installed and 99 additions and alterations had to be made to meet the various exigencies of the workings, inasmuch as at that time the whole process of making a stable electrolytic disinfectant for municipal purposes was quite an innovation. The demand for the fluid increased, consequently the building had to be extended. The Borough Council was so pleased with the scheme that a second plant was erected, which entailed the dismantling and taking to pieces of the first plant, and quite recently on account of the extension of the Borough Electricity Works the depot in which the electrolytic plant was installed has been removed, reconstructed and enlarged upon another site. It is obvious that the dismantling and taking to pieces of the installations and the refixing of them must cause depreciation. When the plant was first installed breakdowns occurred and one of them, which gave considerable trouble and anxiety, was due to the slate of the tanks in certain parts becoming eroded and causing short circuiting of the electric current to take place. This was due to electrical action on the walls of the tanks on account of the metal in the slate and tank after tank became destroyed. But this difficulty has been entirely overcome by having the tanks made of earthenware and constructed in a particular manner. Another cause for depreciation in the first instance was that the zinc or negative electrodes contained impurities, resulting in electrical action being set up in the electrodes themselves. This difficulty is obviated by having the zinc as free as possible from impurities, notably iron. Still another cause for depreciation was the frequent taking to pieces of the electrodes to find out the best way of working the installation and to prevent heating. Without further describing difficulties which have occurred and which have been overcome there is no reason why any appreciable depreciation should be estimated in the future. The heating is prevented by simple adjustable resistances ; the flow of the fluid is kept even by means of ball valve supply tanks. The platinum windings forming the positive electrodes have been rearranged so as to obtain greater efficiency, and in passing it may be mentioned that there is no depreciation in the platinum (the expensive portion of the installation), which is always an asset to the Borough, and so far as the taking to pieces for cleaning the zinc or negative electrodes is concerned there is no necessity to do this, as a switch has been so fixed that the current may be reversed once or twice 100 a week for a few minutes when the tanks are being washed out and any deposit upon the zinc electrodes is thrown off and thus they cleanse themselves. For those persons who have not seen the working of the plant it may be interesting for them to learn that the three-wire system is installed in the Borough, and one plant is worked from the negative below and the neutral above and the other plant from the positive below and the neutral above. So far as labour is concerned, this has also been considerably lessened by a small motor stirring the fluid while making it stable, and quite recently this same motor has been arranged to keep the fluid in the large supply tank constantly stirred—which was formerly done by hand—so as to keep the electrolyte at a constant specific gravity. For the success of the Poplar installation, I must cordially thank Mr. Bowden, the Borough Electrical Engineer, and his staff, who on all and every occasion, were ready and willing to give their valuable assistance. VICTORIA PARK BATHING LAKE. Representations to the London County Council as to Cleansing and Flushing. Representation to the London County Council as to Supervision of Persons using Lake. Representations to the London County Council as to Cleansing and Flushing. In the summer of 1910 representations were made to the London County Council as to the bad condition of the water in the bathing lake in Victoria Park, and a letter from the Parks and Open Spaces Committee was submitted to the Borough Council in September, 1910, in which it was stated analysis showed the water was not offensive but was of sufficiently good quality for the purpose required, and it was not proposed to take any action until the following spring, when the periodical cleansing would take place. Representations were thereupon made to the London County Council by the Council—supported by the Hackney and Bethnal Green Borough Councils—expressing the opinion that the water in the lake had been most unsatisfactory, and urging a complete annual cleaning out of the lake and more adequate flushing during the summer months. 101 In August a temporary military encampment was formed in the park, when Colonel Ford, Principal Medical Officer (Sanitation), complained strongly of the insanitary condition of the bathing lake, and the London County Council was communicated with on the matter. The use of the lake for bathing purposes by the soldiers was prohibited by the Army Medical Authorities, the water being totally unfit for such purpose. The lake was closed to the public for emptying and cleansing, but the Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the special attention of the London County Council should be directed to the matter with a view to securing more frequent cleansing and flushing of the lake in the future, as but for the accident of the military encampment it was improbable that any cleansing would have been effected on this occasion, notwithstanding the many thousands of people, in all conditions, who use the lake during the summer months. The lake was cleaned out in the spring of 1911, and the fact that a further complete cleansing became indispensable in September showed how utterly inadequate is the triennial cleansing of the lake hitherto carried out by the London County Council. In September the Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council " That representations be made to the London County Council on the subject, again urging that the bathing lake in "Victoria Park should be completely cleansed not less than once a year, and that provision should be made for more adequate flushing during the summer months; and that the representatives of the Borough on the London County Council be asked to support such representations." Representation to the London County Council as to Supervision of Persons using Lake. In September, as stated above, the Council directed representations to be made to the London County Council with reference to the foul condition in which the water in the Victoria Park bathing lake had been allowed to remain during the summer, and to which special attention had been directed owing to complaints by the Army Medical Authorities in connection with the temporary military encampment formed in the park. It was again urged that the lake should be thoroughly cleansed at least once a year, instead of triennially, and arrangements made for more adequate flushing during the summer. 102 No reply was received from the London County Council, but Mr. G. L. Bruce, L.C.C., brought the matter to the attention of that Council by a series of questions addressed to the Chairman of the Parks Committee. The Public Health and Housing Committee, in reporting to the Council, recorded their appreciation of the action taken by Mr. Bruce, and expressed the hope that the result might be more adequate attention given to the condition of the water in future bathing seasons. In connection with the above subject the attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee was directed do the need for more effective restrictions being placed on the use of the bathing lake by persons in an obviously filthy and verminous condition, or suffering from disorders which render use of the lake by such persons objectionable in the interests of other bathers. The Committee were of opinion more adequate supervision in this respect should be afforded and undesirable persons referred to the cleansing stations, and recommended the Council that representations to the effect stated be made to the London County Council.

Provision was made in 1905 for cleansing verminous persons. During the year 432 persons had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfested. Since the notices were posted throughout the Borough, a total of 4,688 persons had applied for baths, etc., as mentioned above. 104 VERMINOUS PERSONS IN COMMON LODGING HOUSES, LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1S07.

One case from Bow was admitted into the London Hospital and one Bow case was treated in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Eoad. Four patients died—two Bromley and two Bow. SMALLPOX. During the year eleven cases of smallpox occurred within the Borough—two Bromley and nine Bow. Two of the Bow cases died. (1.) A case of smallpox occurred in a female, aged 42 years, of Cantrell Road, Bromley, and was removed to hospital on February 23rd, on which date the rash had appeared. The patient (a widow) was a scrubber at the Mile End Infirmary. Her son, aged 21 years, and two daughters (twins), aged 7 years, were isolated at the Council's Shelter, Glaucus Street. The son was re-vaccinated, and the twins vaccinated on February 24th. There were 14 papers on the walls which were stripped and afterwards limewashed. The other inmates (four in number) of the premises were kept under daily observation. (2.) March 7th, male, aged 6 years, unvaccinated, Eglinton Road, Bow. Taken ill on March 4th ; rash appeared on March 6th ; patient * See page 49 as to what diseases are included under Puerperal Fever. 109 removed on March 7th by Metropolitan Asylums Board. Father, mother, sister and brother were re-vaccinated same date as disease was diagnosed, and were removed to Council's Shelter pending disinfection of the rooms. They were bathed and clothes disinfected. The dog was also taken to shelter and washed with a solution of electrolytic fluid. There were several contacts in this case who were kept under observation, and vaccination and re-vaccination advised as the case might have been. The Medical Officers of Health of the districts in which the contacts worked were communicated with. This case was probably contracted from the three mentioned below. (3.) March 9th, female, aged 30 years, of Eglinton Road, Bow. Stated to have been vaccinated in infancy. It appeared this patient had been ill for three or four weeks; no medical man in attendance; she had felt unwell and spots appeared on her body (see two cases below). The husband (who had been re-vaccinated) was employed at a hosier's in the City of London, and travelled backwards and forwards on the District Railway. At this same hosier's a man, residing in Bethnal Green, was also employed; he fell ill on February 24th, and was removed to hospital with smallpox on February 28th. The question was, did the husband carry the disease from his wife to the Bethnal Green case ? The Medical Officer of Health of the City of London was immediately informed of these circumstances. (4.) March 9th, female, aged 8 years, of Eglinton Road, Bow, unvaccinated, daughter of above case. Ill with spots on her for two or three weeks; no medical man in attendance. Removed to hospital on March 9th. (5.) March 9th, female, aged 4 years, of Eglinton Road, Bow, unvaccinated, sister of the above case. Fell ill March 3rd, rash appeared March 7th, removed to hospital March 9th. The patient died on March 19th. The father of the above two cases was removed to the Council's Shelter pending the disinfection of the rooms occupied by his family (stripping of walls and limewhiting); and the other inmates of the house (man, two adult females and two boys) also went to the Council's Shelter to be bathed and to have their clothes disinfected, pending the rooms occupied by them also being disinfected. The Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the adult male inmates work was immediately informed of the circumstances of the case, as also was the Secretary of the General Post Office in regard to the son. The man and one son 110 were re-vaccinated, as well as the woman looking after the children. The man's wife, an in-patient of the Sick Asylum and on the dangerous list, had been visited daily by people from the house. The Medical Superintendent of the Sick Asylum was immediately informed of this. One of the inmates of the house was a female house to house hawker of tapes, needles, etc. Her goods were destroyed and she was compensated. The Medical Officer (Education), London County Council, was communicated with as to the schools attended by the patients and inmates of the house. The whole of Stafford Road School was disinfected by the Public Health Department on March 9th. (6.) Male, aged 35, Eglinton Road, Bow, vaccinated in infancy, and re-vaccinated on March 3rd (the re-vaccination was not successful), father of the above children. This patient went on March 10th to Joyce Green Hospital to visit his younger daughter who was on the dangerous list; the Medical Superintendent of the hospital telephoned to the Medical Officer of Health that the father would be detained as he (the Medical Superintendent) considered that he (the father) had had a very mild attack of smallpox (probably about a fortnight old and contracted from his wife); there was evidence of the disease on the soles of his feet. This patient was the man mentioned above engaged at a hosier's who had been travelling backwards and forwards to the City on the District Railway, his wife and elder child being ill at home with smallpox, and it appeared he himself had been suffering from the disease. (7.) A case of smallpox occurred in a male, aged 7 years, unvaccinated, of Stafford Road, Bow. The patient was notified and removed to hospital on March 29th, 1911. The inmates of the premises were all vaccinated or re-vaccinated on March 29th, and removed to the Council's shelter for bathing and for the disinfection of their clothes. Disinfection of the premises was duly carried out. (8.) Male, 8 years, unvaccinated, of Ford Road, Bow, was notified on April 1st to be suffering from smallpox and removed to hospital on the same date. The usual precautions were taken. This patient died on April 7th and was a relation of a lodger living in the house in Eglinton Road from which four cases of smallpox had been removed. (9.) Female, aged 4 years, Stafford Road, Bow, sister of No. 7 above. This patient was vaccinated for the first time March 29th, some 111 days after being exposed to infection; became ill on April 7th; rash appeared on April 8th; patient was removed on the latter date to South Wharf, was isolated there for observation and then transferred to Joyce Green Hospital. The attack was benign and the rash discrete. Patient had evidently not been vaccinated soon enough after exposure to prevent the disease. The inmates of the house, nine in number, who had all bfeen vaccinated and re-vaccinated as the case might be on March 29th, were again taken to the Council's Shelter to be bathed and their clothes steamed whilst the house was being disinfected. A baby, aged 8 months, included among the inmates, was not re-vaccinated, as vaccination had already been performed. In connection with the outbreak of smallpox, numerous contacts and absentees from schools were reported to the Public Health Department, and were kept under observation as much as possible. (10.) A case of smallpox occurred in a male, aged 26 years, of Ford Street. The case was notified on 29th April and removed to hospital (South Wharf) same day, and thence to Joyce Green. The patient was stated to have been vaccinated in infancy only. The mother (aged 65 years) of the patient was so upset upon hearing that her son had been removed suffering from smallpox that she died suddenly, and her body was taken to the infectious disease mortuary pending the inquest. The patient (who is uncle of the child, aged 6 years, No. 2 above, who was removed from a house in Eglinton Road) was taken ill on the 23rd April; rash appeared on the 27th; he was at his work in the City (being employed as a packer of toys and sundries) all day on the 28th, and on the 29th went to Bartholomew's Hospital. The Medical Officer of Health for the City of London was communicated with, and the patient's father, sister and brother were taken to the Council's Shelter pending the disinfection of the whole house. The father, sister and brother were re-vaccinated on the day of removal of the patient after having been exposed to infection for some days. The father was a brush maker and a large quantity of material for brushmaking to the value of six pounds had to be destroyed. The sister was a homeworker and there was a quantity of material upon the premises which was taken away and disinfected. (11.) A case of smallpox occurred in a male, aged 26 years, vaccinated in infancy, a lodger in Merchant Street, Bromley. The patient fell ill on the 12th May, the rash (benign discrete) appeared on the 14th, and the case was removed to hospital on May 15th. Patient was employed as a stick mounter by a City firm, and he stated he had attended at St. Bartholomew's Hospital on April 29th, and was in the same room 112 as a case of smallpox removed from that hospital on the date mentioned (see Case No. 10 above). Disinfection of the premises was carried out in the usual manner, and a number of the inmates went to the Council's Shelter to be bathed and their clothes disinfected. Re-vaccination of the inmates of the house was carried out with the exception of the patient's father. Emergency Notification Order, London County Council. Having regard to the outbreak of smallpox and to the fact that mild forms of that disease were liable to be mistaken for chicken-pox, the London County Council, at a meeting held on 14th March, 1911, made an order, as a case of emergency, applying Sections 55, 68 and 70 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the notification and prevention of infectious diseases, to the disease known as chicken-pox, for a period of three calendar months from and including 22nd March, 1911. The Order was duly approved by the Local Government Board, advertised on 15th March, and came into operation on 22nd March. During the three months 143 cases of chicken-pox were notified within the Borough 56 Poplar, 65 Bromley and 22 Bow. The Vaccination Officer, Mr. G. W.

Registers and Inspections. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 145 and 146. * A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 145 to 151) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give 142 There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,070, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 145, and Tables C and D, pages 148 and 149. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 259 and 260, and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 218, 224, 237 and 248. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 80. Factory and Workshop Act (1901) Amendment Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to regulate night employment, and to prohibit week-end employment in certain factories and workshops. full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers1 premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops,* and even factories ; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Table A, under " Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 9 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were "Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 143 Offices Regulation Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to provide that the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, relating to th health and protection of persons employed in factories and workshops, shall extend and apply to persons employed as clerks in offices. The purpose of this Bill is to bring under inspection offices in which clerks are employed, by extending and applying the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, relating to the health and protection of persons employed in factories and workshops, to persons employed as clerks in offices. Street Traders' Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to make provision for the licensing and registration of street traders. Prevention of Destitution Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to provide for the more effectual prevention of destitution and the better organisation of public assistance. The Bill embodies such of the recommendations of the Minority Report of the Poor Law Commission as require legislative enactment. It does not, however, include all the amendments of the Lunacy Acts or the Education Acts proposed either by the Royal Commission on the Care and Control of the Feeble-minded or by the Poor Law Commission, nor yet the necessary changes in the statutes relating to Exchequer contributions. Nor does it, save by the grant of the necessary general powers to the departments concerned, attempt to prescribe the administrative orders and rules which, in substitution for the present poor law orders of the Local Government Board, may be found necessary to give effect to the changes proposed. The Bill is divided into four parts. The First Part contains general provisions, together with the establishment of a new department under a Minister for Labour. The Second Tart provides for the abolition of the 144 hoards of guardians, and the transfer of all provision of public assistance for the non-able-bodied (whether children, the sick and infirm, the aged, or the mentally defective) to the county or county borough council, with suitable arrangements for the City of London, the metropolitan borough councils, and for the councils of the non-county boroughs and urban district councils, of the more populous places. The Third Part describes the powers and duties of the Minister for Labour, and provides for the abolition of distress committees, and the transfer of all matters affecting unemployment and the regulation of the hours and conditions of labour to the department of the Minister for Labour. The Fourth Part applies the Bill to Scotland. Throughout the Bill the several authorities are empowered and required to take steps to prevent the occurrence of destitution, as well as to make provision for those who are destitute. Employment of Children Act (1903) Amendment Hill (H.L.) A Bill entitled an Act to amend the Employment of Children Act (1903), and for other purposes connected therewith. 145 TABLE A.

A Bill as amended by Standing Committee A to amend the law relating to slaughtering of animals for human food. This Bill introduces a uniform system for the licensing and regulation of slaughter-houses throughout the United Kingdom. Under the present law there is no adequate control over slaughter-houses in large areas of the country, and in some areas there is no control at all. The Bill proposes that all persons carrying on the business of slaughterers, in rural as well as urban districts, shall be required to take out licences which will require periodical renewal. The Bill also contains provisions intended to prevent, as far as possible, the occurrence of cruelty in connection with the slaughtering of animals for human food, and, with the same object, proposes that a licence shall be required for all men employed to kill animals. The Bill does not touch the powers of local authorities to provide public slaughter-houses. OFFENSIVE TRADES. Rag Flock Act, 1911 (see page '206).

No circumstances arose during the year calling for the enforcement of the power given to the Sanitary Authority under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section (5). See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 217, 220, 224, 230, 238, 247 and 255. Milk and Dairiks Bill. I understand that a Milk and Dairies Bill is to be specially introduced in the year 1912. SMOKE NUISANCES. 63 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year :—30 Bow Bast, 3 Bow West, 7 North Bromley, 9 Bromley Central, 6 East combined, 3*West combined, and 5 Poplar South. 33 intimations and 25 statutory notices were served. Two summonses were applied for (see page 202). 160 ICE CREAM. About the middle of the year 1911 all the known premises within the Borough where ice-creams are manufactured were inspected. There are 116 such premises within the Borough, 53 Poplar, 37 Bromley and 26 Bow. (See Table A, page 145.) Cleansing of premises was necessary in 27 instances. 18 other nuisances were remedied. See Inspectors' reports, pages 217, 225, 233, 239, 247 and 255. MOTOR VEHICLES. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards. Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils re Nuisances from Motor Traffic. Motor Traffic (Street Noises) Bill. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards. From time to time the General Purposes Committee have considered the matter of the provision of proper splash guards on motor omnibuses (see Annual Report, 1910, page 192), and following up the subject during the year 1911, the General Purposes Committee reported to the Council:— " The Council has repeatedly requested the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to enforce the provision of proper splash guards on all motor omnibuses plying within the Metropolitan Police District, and has pointed to the effective operation of such splash guards on the near wheels of omnibuses plying between Piccadilly and Hammersmith." "The Commissioner states no objection would be raised to the attachment of similar devices by the proprietors of omnibuses plying in Poplar, and on being urged to enforce such provision, states he would not feel justified in going further in the matter at present." "The objection to the enforcement of the provision of splash guards appears to be the cost, estimated at £8 to £10 per vehicle 161 per annum, but this would be reduced by one half if the near aide wheels only, as on the Hammersmith route, are guarded." " The West Ham Town Council has addressed a communication to the Commissioner urging the enforcement of splash guards." In view of the very grave nuisance to pedestrians and to shopkeepers and residents on motor omnibus routes, the General Purposes Committee were of opinion the small relative cost of protecting the public against this nuisance ought not to influence the Commissioner of Police, and that he should be again urged to take steps for the protection of the public in the matter. The General Purposes Committee recommended the Council that the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis be again urged to enforce the provision of efficient splash guards on the near side wheels at least, of all motor omnibuses plying in the Metropolitan Police District, and that other Borough and Urban District Councils in the Metropolitan Police District be requested to take similar action. The following letters were received from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis on the subject of the resolution of the Council urging the compulsory provision of splash guards on motor omnibuses plying in the Metropolitan Police area :— Metropolitan Police Office, New Scotland Yard, S.W. March 23rd, 1911. Be Splash Guards for Motor Omnibuses. Sir, ' With reference to your letter of the 18th inst., I am directed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you that he has no objection to a proprietor having any form of guard fitted to his vehicles if he so desires, provided that the guard is not affixed in such a manner as to be a source of danger. I am to add that the Commissioner is not prepared to go further than this in the matter. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, C. L. BATHURST, Chief Clerk. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. M 162 Metropolitan Police Office, New Scotland Yard. March 20th, 1911. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 14th inst., enclosing a copy of a petition from a number of tradesmen in the Bow Road who complain of injury to their premises by mud splashing, I am directed by the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you that the Police have from time to time kept observation on the traffic with the view of ascertaining the actual nature of the nuisance of mud splashing. It was noticed that mud is splashed higher and for a longer distance by the feet of horses than by omnibuses. In wet weather all forms of fast moving traffic splash mud to a greater or less extent, especially on certain road surfaces. In the circumstances, the Commissioner does not feel justified in going beyond what he has already decided, viz., to allow proprietors to fit any approved form of mud guard if they so desire. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, C. L. BATHURST, Chief Clerk. The Town Clerk of Poplar. In accordance with the direction of the Council communications were addressed to the local authorities in the Metropolitan Police area asking their support to the proposal of the Council, that splash guards should be enforced. Mr. Councillor G. Lansbury, M.P., also addressed a question in Parliament to the Home Secretary on the subject. In July the General Purposes Committee reported :— " The Council of the County Borough of West Ham has convened a Conference of the Councils of Greater London to discuss the question of mud splashing by motor omnibuses, with a view to bringing further pressure to bear on the Commissioner of Police to induce him to accede to a reasonable request for the abatement of this long continued nuisance." 163 The General Purposes Committee appointed Mr. Councillor Robert Brown to attend the Conference. At a Conference of twenty-one local authorities of Greater London, convened by the West Ham Town Council, on the subject of mud splashing by motor omnibuses, the following resolution was adopted, viz.:— " That this Conference, representing twenty-one local authorities in Greater London, recognising the great damage and annoyance to persons and property caused by the mud splashed from the wheels of motor omnibuses, and having regard to the refusal of the Commissioner of Police to take reasonable steps to obtain an abatement of the nuisance, requests the Secretary of State for the Home Department to receive a deputation from this Conference with a view to his intervening and requiring the Commissioner to make it a condition of his licence that all motor omnibuses plying within the limits of his jurisdiction be fitted with efficient splashguards. "That this Conference further resolves that a copy of the preceding resolution be forwarded to the Members of the Government and also to the representatives in Parliament of Greater London requesting their support." The General Purposes Committee reported that:— " The Home Secretary, in reply to the request that he would receive the deputation, states he is advised there is at present no mudguard suitable for use in London streets which can be said to be efficient, and which, therefore, could be compulsorily imposed on the omnibus companies. He would be glad to consider any information which may be submitted as to mudguards considered to be satisfactory for use on motor omnibuses." The General Purposes Committee considered communications from inventors and others, submitting diagrams and particulars of splashguards stated to be suitable for use on motor omnibuses, to prevent side splashing. The General Purposes Committee directed these inventions be brought to the notice of the Chief Commissioner of Police, and he be again urged to take steps to enforce the use of splash guards on all motor omnibuses licensed under his jurisdiction, in order to terminate what has become an intolerable nuisance. 164 Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils re Nuisances from Motor Traffic. The Hampstead Borough Council proposed to convene a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils to consider the question of routes taken by motor omnibuses, and the cutting up of roadways by that class of traffic, with consequential vibration; the serious annoyance to the inhabitants, and, in many cases, positive danger to premises along the line of route; and the loss of rates from unoccupied houses in the thoroughfares through which the traffic passes. The Council was invited to appoint delegates to the Conference. Motor Traffic (Street Noises) Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to amend the law in respect of warning instruments on motor vehicles. The object of this Bill is to give powers to make regulations defining the nature of the warning instruments which may be used on motor vehicles, and making obligatory during certain hours and in particular areas the use of certain descriptions of instrument. The regulations will be made under Section 6 of the Locomotives on Highways Act, 1896, under which there is power to confine the application of any regulations to a particular area.

Twenty-three samples were taken on delivery at institutions within the Borough, viz., 6 Poplar Union Workhouse, 6 Sick Asylum, 5 Blackwall Sick Asylum and 6 Stepney Union Workhouse. All the samples were genuine with the exception of one procured on delivery at the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum (see legal proceedings, page 167). Results of Analyses. Of these 377 samples legal proceedings were instituted in 12 cases Milk 11 Butter 1 12 The Public Analyst reported that during the year he had analysed 377 samples ; 11 or 2.9 per cent, were found to be adulterated. This result compares with 3.2 per cent, for 1910, showing a satisfactory decrease. The Public Analyst in his report states :—"which was the lowest recorded in the Borough since the work has been in my hands." 166 The following table shows the percentage of all adulterated samples found in the several years named:— 1890 12.6 1891 14.4 1892 18.9 1893 20.5 1894 20.6 1895 22.1 1896 12.4 1897 14.2 1898 14.6 1899 9.2 1900 7.6 1901 9.1 1902 15.4 1903 8.2 1904 7.2 1905 8.8 1906 7.0 1907 7.3 1908 8.6 1909 6.2 1910 3.2 1911 2.9 Legal Proceedings.

No notice or placard was displayed on the barrow from which it was sold to that effect. On the barrow was marked in large letters, "The New Farmers Milk Supply." On the side of the hand can engraved in the metal was marked, " Separated Milk." This could not be seen at the time of purchase as the milk seller fetched the jug from door of 17, Newcastle Street, took it into the street to his barrow, and returned with the milk. It was pointed out to the Magistrate that had this lettering on the hand can been in black or white it could have been seen. In cross-examination for the defence, the person who purchased for the Inspector admitted having some time previously purchased some milk from defendant's man at 3d. per quart. It was therefore urged that she knew the milk to be separated. The Magistrate, in dismissing the case, warned the defendant, and remarked that when separated milk was sold the fact should be clearly advertised. Section 11, Sale of Pood and Drugs Act, 1899, does not apply to ordinary separated or skimmed milk. The Section in question states that every tin or other receptacle containing condensed, separated, or skimmed milk must bear a label clearly visible to the purchaser on which the words "machine-skimmed milk" or "skimmed milk," as the case may require, are printed in large and legible type, etc., etc., etc. Under these circumstances, and from the result of the above case, it would be as well if, when further legislation upon the sale of food and drugs is being considered, a similar clause should be inserted respecting skimmed or separated milk, and a placard conspicuously displayed on the barrow in the case of itinerant vendors. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the report on the 169 Summary for the Year 1911. Preservatives in Butter. Of the 104 samples of Butter 39 contained percentages of boric acid as follow:— 0.4%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.1%; 0.25%; 0.5%; 0.1%; 0.25%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.4%; 0.5%; 0.25%; 0.3%; 0.3%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.25%; 0.1%; 0.25%; 0.25%; 0.25%; 0.1%; 0.5%; 0.3%; 0.5%; 0.1%; 0.1%; 0.4%; 0.25%; 0.4%; 0.25%; 0.25%; 0.3%; 0.25%; 0.25%; 0.5%. proceedings against the itinerant vendor for selling milk deficient in fat to the extent of 96*6 per cent., and as it was stated the can on the barrow was engraved "separated milk," and the case was dismissed with a caution. The Committee were of opinion that it is desirable in any future legislation on the subject that provision should be made that at any shop and on any barrow or other vehicle used for sale of skimmed or separated milk, the fact should be required to be plainly indicated by adequate notice visible to any purchaser. The Committee recommended that the Council endorse such opinion, and representations be made to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture, to the effect stated. Quarter ended. Total.

Okder in Council, March '22nd. 1911, making Regulations under Section 5 op the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908 (8 Einv. 7 c. 55). as to the Sale op Poisonous Substances. (1.) In the sale by retail of any substance to which Section 5 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908, applies, the label required by the said Section to be affixed to the box, bottle, vessel, wrapper, or cover, in which the substance is contained shall bear, distinctly printed thereon, the additional words, "Not to be taken." (2.) In the sale by retail of any liquid substance to which Section 5. 171 applies, such substance shall not be delivered or sent out except in bottles or other containers rendered distinguishable by touch from ordinary bottles or containers. By Section 5 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908, it is enacted that— "(1.) It shall not be lawful to sell any substance to which this section applies by retail, unless the box. bottle, vessel, wrapper or cover in which the substance is contained is distinctly labelled with the name of the substance and the word 'Poisonousand' with the name and address of the seller of the substance, and unless such other regulations as may be prescribed under this section by Order in Council are complied with ; and, if any person sells any such substance othenvise than in accordance with the provisions of this section or of any Order in Council made thereunder, he shall, on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, be liable for each offence to a fine not exceeding five pounds. "(2.) The substances to which this section applies are sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, soluble salts of oxalic acid, and such other substances as may for the time being be prescribed by Order in Council under this section." Order in Council, July 5th, 1911, applying Section 5 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908 (8 Edw. 7 c. 55), to Liquid Preparations containing more than 5 per cent, by Weight of Free Ammonia. From February 1st, 1912, liquid preparations containing more than 5 per cent, by weight of free ammonia shall be substances to which Section 5 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908, applies. (See italics above.) Sale of .Margarine Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to provide for the further prevention of the fraudulent sale of margarine. The object of this Bill is to prevent margarine from being coloured so as to resemble butter and prevent its fraudulent sale as such. The report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Food Products Adulteration, 1896, at page 29 says:— 172 "However, your committee cannot but feel that the adulteration of butter with margarine and the fraudulent sale of margarine for butter are greatly facilitated in many instances by the artificial use of ingredients to colour margarine. While your committee are reluctant to interfere with the manufacture of any edible commodity they cannot in the interests of honest trading arrive at any conclusion other than to recommend the absolute prohibition of the artificial colouring of margarine to resemble or imitate butter." The last report of the Local Government Board, Part 2, page 102, states that:— "The fact that one sample of butter in every sixteen was condemned shows that the practice of selling margarine when butter is demanded has not been put down." The present definition of margarine, as contained in the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907, is "any article of food whether mixed with butter or not which resembles butter and is not milk-blended butter." The purpose of the present Bill is to prevent margarine from resembling butter, and would destroy the existing definition. The definition in this Bill is so framed as to cover the substance now known as margarine, but it is necessary to exclude lard from the definition, and therefore the fat of beef and mutton is specifically mentioned. Suggested Amendment of Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from the Council ot' the Royal Borough of Kensington on the subject of the regulations of the Board of Agriculture with respect to separated or skimmed milk. The regulations provide that where a sample of such milk contains less than 9 per cent, of milk solids it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine. Thus a sample containing 1.5 per cent, of fat and 7.5 per cent. of solids Other than fat is reported as genuine, inasmuch as it contains 9 per cent, of milk solids, although it has also 11.8 per cent, of added water. The Kensington Borough Council had made representations to the Board of Agriculture urging amendment of No. 3 of the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901, by substituting a limit of 8-7 per cent, of milk solids 173 not fat for the present limit of 9 per cent. of total milk solids, and asked the Poplar Borough Council to support such representations. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to support the action of the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington. Suggested Legislation Prohibiting Colouring Matter in Milk. The Kensington Borough Council called attention to a case of analysis of a sample of "nursery milk" reported to be inferior and artificially coloured with a dye, probably of coal tar origin. The Kensington Borough Council had represented to the Board of Agriculture that, in any impending legislation, the admixture of colouring matter of any description with milk should be absolutely prohibited, and asked that such representation should be supported. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to support the action of the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington. Suggested Amendment and Consolidation ok the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington had communicated with the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture urging the necessity for immediate action to be taken in the direction of the introduction of legislation for the amendment and consolidation of the Sale of Pood and Drugs Acts, for laying down for the guidance of local authorities definite standards or limits in respect of all the principal classes of foods in common use, for establishing a Court of Reference as mentioned in the recommendations of the Departmental Committee of 1901, and for adequately dealing with the difficulties surrounding the questions of "Warranties" and "Disclosures" as protecting the vendor of an adulterated or sophisticated article of food. The Public Health and Housing Committee had reported from time to time on the difficulties which had arisen in the administration of the Food and Drugs Acts, especially in respect of "Warranties." The Committee recommended the Council that communications be addressed to the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture in support of the representations made to them by the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington. 174 INSPECTION OF FOOD AND EXAMINATION OF UNSOUND FOOD AT WHARVES, Etc. Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc. Seizure of Unsound Meat and the Central Meat Market. Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc. With respect to the examination of food stuffs see Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 218, 219, 225, 232, 237, 246, 248 and 255. Seizure of Unsound Meat and the Central Meat Market. The Marylebone Borough Council called attention to seizure of unsound meat deposited for sale which had recently been purchased at the Central Meat Market. Upon proceedings being taken the vendors endeavoured to show that meat purchased at the market is always examined by the qualified inspectors of the City Corporation. Upon a letter being addressed to the City Corporation, a report of the Medical Officer of Health was sent in reply stating that it was impossible with the staff at his command to examine minutely every carcase delivered at the market, and guarantee that every pound of meat purchased there was fit for human consumption. The Public Health and Housing Committee directed a communication be addressed to the City Corporation urging such increase of the staff of meat inspectors as shall ensure that no meat unfit for human consumption is allowed to be sold at the Central Meat Market. 175 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. Work of the Inspector. Loudon County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Section 78—Water Scpply in Tenement Hodses. Suggested Appointment of an Additional Inspector. Extension of Duties of the Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings. Proposed New By-Laws Houses Let in Lodgings (Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, Section 16 (1)). Work of the Inspector. At the end of the year there were 1,124 houses on the register. For Inspector's report see pages 261 to 264. Legal proceedings were instituted in three instances:—2 in respect of cleansing and one in respect of water supply (see pages 201 and 202). London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Section 78—Water Supply in Tenement Houses. During the year nine notices were served under this Act (see Inspector's Report, page 262). Legal proceedings were instituted in one instance (see page 201). Suggested Appointment of an Additional Inspector. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the reference from the Council "to consider and report on the desirability of appointing another Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings." The following report was presented on the subject, viz. :— 176 To the Chairman and Members of the Public Health and Housing Committee. Gentlemen, The suggestion of the appointment of an additional inspector for "Houses Let in Lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family," having been referred by the Council to the Public Health and Housing Committee, one cannot do better than again, with some additions, present the report, dated September 11th, 1907, on the same subject, which was considered by the Council on October 3rd, 1907. From the report it will be seen that the enforcing of the cleansing of verminous rooms under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 20, was added to the duties of the inspector on October 5th, 1905, and, since that date, in order that the work of the Inspector for Houses Let in Lodgings might be more effectually carried out, the Council added to his duties the enforcement of (a) the cleansing of water closets, etc., under Clause 25 of the By-laws made under Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; (b) the By-laws made under that Section (2) with respect to the keeping of water-closets supplied with sufficient water for their effective action; and (c) the By-laws made under Section 50 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the cleansing of cisterns. The Council has also empowered the inspector to act under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, Section 17 (7), in respect of underground rooms habitually used as sleeping places; and under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Section 78, with respect to the supply of water to tenement houses. Whether the Public Health and Housing Committee do, or do not, recommend the Council to appoint the additional Inspector for Houses Let in Lodgings, experience shows that, for the advantage in keeping houses fit for human habitation, saving time and preventing duplication of work and annoyance to the landlords and tenants, the inspector should be empowered to serve intimations and notices, and to enforce legal proceedings, in respect of defective roofs, eaves gutters, rainwater pipes, flooring and yard paving. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health. 177 The following is the report mentioned above, with the tabulated statement of work executed, brought up to date:— By Section 94, Sub-section 1, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, every sanitary authority shall make and| enforce such by-laws as are requisite for the following matters, that is to say— (a) For fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and for the separation of the sexes in a house so let or occupied. (b) For the registration of the houses so let or occupied. (c) For the inspection of such houses. (d) For enforcing drainage for such houses, and for promoting cleanliness and ventilation in such houses. (e) For the cleansing and liinewashing at stated times of the premises. (f) For the taking of precautions in case of any infectious disease. I must again repeat what I have so often pointed out when it has been stated that more inspections could be made, viz.: —that whenever an inspection takes place to secure the abatement of a nuisance it may ultimately be necessary to bring the circumstances of the case before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, and all entries in note books, journals, and the serving of notices and necessary documents, must therefore be carefully executed in the manner prescribed by law. I think it speaks well for the department that for the past fifteen years no summons has been dismissed except upon a legal technicality or as to whether the owner or the local authority was liable. The clerical work of the Inspector for Houses Let in Lodgings cannot be carried out by a clerk as the inspector must enter up his register and write out the necessary documents himself. The following is an outline of what clerical work is necessary when a house is placed on the register and when various clauses of the by-laws have to be enforced :— A declaration form, together with a copy of the By-laws, N 178 is served upon the landlord of the house and these papers are accompanied by a notice signed by the Town Clerk requesting that the necessary information be furnished. Declarations should be returned within fourteen days, but it is seldom that they are received until repeated applications and letters are sent, and frequently in the cases of illiterate landlords the inspector has to fill in the papers on the premises. When declarations are received the addresses of the houses are reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee in order that the premises may be registered. The landlord of each registered house is then notified of the fact by a printed intimation signed by the Medical Officer of Health. The particulars stated on the declarations are then entered in the journal and register. As soon as possible the houses are inspected, and, if necessary, the cubic capacity of the rooms ascertained and all particulars and dimensions entered in the register. The books kept are as under: — 3 registers, 10 journals, 1 book of notices to supply information, 1 book of notices for cleansing, overcrowding, etc., 1 book of notices of intimation re registration, 1 book of notices re verminous rooms, and 1 book of particulars re overcrowding, % and I would here point out that in the carrying out of the whole clerical work, including writing of notices, intimations, etc., no assistance whatever is received from the clerical staff of the department as is the case with the district inspectors, and, moreover, it would be impossible with the present clerical staff to afford any such assistance.* I would further mention that in enforcing these bye-laws no assistance whatever is rendered by the inspector's labourers. *Intimations and Notices are now served under the By-laws, as mentioned in the second paragraph at the beginning of the report. 179 Tabulated Statement of Work Executed during the Years 1905 to 1910 (inclusive). 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 1910 Number of houses on Register in Borough 877 960 1020 1010 1044 1095 Rooms measured and capacity entered in Register 894 507 467 204 141 278 Houses registered 114 75 93 22 34 58 Houses re-registered 41 35 — — — — Intimations of houses being placed and Registers sent 155 110 93 22 34 58 Cases of overcrowding discovered 74 108 135 103 156 146 Cases of overcrowding abated — — 127 117f 147 125 Cases of overcrowding outstanding — — — 6 9 21 Notices for information and declaration sent out 170 110 93 27 41 78 Notices for information and declaration returned — — 93 23 41 58 Notices served for cleansing to be carried out 148 183 313 221 256 261 Notices served for abatement of overcrowding 27 35 70 79 92 92 Notices served for animals improperly kept in living rooms 1 1 — — — — Notices served re vermin in rooms under London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904 7 20 61 48 75 49 Notices served for means of ventilation to be put in proper working order — — 35 105 208 100 Means of ventilation of staircases repaired and put in working order — — 18 9 20 17 Means of ventilation in rooms repaired and put in working order — — 17 96 188 162 †Including 20 ca»es from 1907. 180  1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 ###] Final notices served for cleansing and overcrowding 14 25 21 9 20 15 House-to-house inspections 251 323 397 306 413 419 House-to-house visits for registration purposes 412 369 329 175 121 116 Re-inspections 1946 2333 2339 2045 2540 2377 Night and early morning inspections — — 292 206 139 116 Rooms stripped and cleansed — — 756 536 558 618 Passages stripped and cleansed — — 108 54 88 92 Staircases stripped and cleansed — — 123 59 62 108 Yard walls cleansed — — 247 166 200 204 Wash-houses cleansed — — 261 166 215 188 Water closets cleansed — — 267 170 207 195 Water closet soil pans cleansed — — — — — 35 Areas cleansed — — 37 17 25 28 Rooms rid of vermin — — 95 72 104 73 Notices served under L.C.C.

The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the appointment of an additional Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings was not then desirable or necessary, and recommended the Council that the reference to them be discharged. 181 The Council referred the recommendation back to the Public Health and Housing Committee. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the reference back of their recommendation that the reference to them "to consider and report on the desirability of appointing another Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings," be discharged. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion, in view of the present financial position and the decision of the London County Council to withhold a proportion of its contribution towards salaries of sanitary officers owing to the deficiency in the Exchequer Grants, it is not desirable that a further appointment should now be made, and, further, the Committee were not satisfied that any considerable addition to the Register of Houses Let in Lodgings, requiring special inspection, which the appointment of an additional inspector would involve, is urgently necessary. The Committee repeated their recommendation to the Council that the reference of the matter to them be discharged. The Council adopted the recommendation. Extension of Duties of the Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings be empowered to serve intimations and notices, and to enfore legal proceedings, in respect of defective roofs, eaves gutters, rain water pipes, flooring and yard paving; and that the Seal of the Council be affixed to a new warrant to include these duties.

Application has been made to the Local Government 182 Board for confirmation of the by-laws, the necessary public notice having expired: — Houses Let in Lodgings. Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and The Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909.

He shall, at the same time, cause the walls of every area, the surface of every ceiling, and the interior surface of every wall of every room, staircase and passage in the lodging-house, and of every water closet belonging to the premises to be thoroughly lime-washed in every case where lime-washing is necessary for effective cleansing. Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to liine-washing shall not apply in any case where the interior surface of any such ceiling or wall is painted, or where the material of or with which that surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where the said surface is thoroughly cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 16.

The following is a list of dwelling-houses inspected, and the work has been executed, except in those instances marked with an asterisk; but in 7 cases " Representations " were made, followed by " Closing Orders " :— Bromley Cottages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Chadbourne Street 1, 2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25.

The dwelling-houses, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, Chadbourne Street, 13, 14 and 15, Davey Road, were represented to be in such a state as to be dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. The Council made Closing Orders prohibiting the use of such dwelling-houses for human habitation until in the judgment of the Council they were rendered fit for that purpose. Determination of Closing Orders, Section 17 (6). A Closing Order was made on November 9th, 1910, in respect of 26a, Cuba Street. These premises were incorporated with 35, Cuba Street, and, the necessary works to render it fit for human habitation having been carried out, the Closing Order was determined by the Council. A Closing Order was made on November 17th, 1910, in respect of 2, Walter Court. These premises having been rendered fit for human habitation, the Closing Order was determined by the Council. *Work in hand, 1912. 190 The Council also determined Closing Orders made in respect of 1, 2, 3 and 4, Chadbourne Street, which premises had been closed during the year 1911 and rendered fit for human habitation. Regulations* as to Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. Section 17 (7). Housing Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. The consent of the Local Government Board was given on April 21st, 1911, to the above Regulations. During the year the Seal of the Council was affixed to a Closing Order, under Section 17, Sub-section 7, of the Housing, Town Tlanning, etc., Act, 1909, in respect of a back underground basement room at 90, Lefevre Eoad, habitually used as a sleeping place, and which did not comply with the regulations made by the Council, with the consent of the Local Government Board, under the said Act. Cheap Trains Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to amend the law relating to cheap trains for the working classes. The purpose of this Bill is to remove some of the difficulties experienced in London and other large towns in housing the working classes, by making provision for an ample service of trains for workmen, so as to provide a cheaper means of communication between the central stations and the outer suburbs. "The Cheap Trains Act of 1883, 46 and 47 Vict. c. 34, by means of which a bargain was struck between the nation and the railway companies, requires all companies to provide proper and sufficient workmen's trains for workmen going to and returning from their work, at such fares and such times between six p.m. and eight a.m. as may appear to the Board of Trade to be reasonable." There has been no general legislation on this subject since 1883, *Set out in extenso on pages 212-215 of Annual Report of Medical Officer of Health, 1910. 191 when the Cheap Trains Act was passed, whereby the passenger duty was remitted on all fares not exceeding the rate of one penny a mile, and a reduction from two to five per cent of the duty on first and second class fares in certified urban districts, on condition that all railway companies should provide sufficient workmen's trains for workmen going to and returning from their work, at such fares and such times between six p.m. and eight a.m. as may appear to the Board of Trade to be reasonable. The object of this Bill is to provide for a sufficient service of cheap trains, and to fix for passengers by all workmen's trains arriving at the various stations up to eight a.m. a maximum return fare between any central station and the outer suburbs up to twenty miles. The Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes strongly urged the need for cheap workmen's trains to run up to eight o'clock in the morning. By reference to the Board of Trade Return to Parliament, May 25th, 1900, it will be seen that with a few exceptions there are no workmen's trains running up to eight o'clock in the morning—the time laid down by the Act of 1883. It is also shown by the same return that the fares charged by some of the companies are much higher than those proposed by this Bill. Moveable Dwellings Bill (H.L.). A Bill as amended (on report) entitled an Act to provide for the regulation of moveable dwellings was considered by the House of Lords. WATER. Water Certificates. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—Fire Brigade Station, Parnell Road; Fire Brigade Station, Brunswick Road; 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38, Ridgdale Street, Bow; 68a, East India Dock Road. 192 COMBINED DRAINAGE. Work Executed by Council. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. Sewers and Drains Bill. Work Executed by Council. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order:—35 and 37, Alpha Road; Nos. 1 to 9, Lion Street; 23 to 33, Sherwood Street; 21 and 23, Susannah Street, Stables, Nye Street, 4, Lindale Street; 20, Samuda Street; 135, Bow Road; 6 to 10, Wades Place and 7 to 13, Shirbutt Street; "Coat and Badge," 10, Chrisp Street; 7, PIimsoil Street (front area). Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill.* It was intended that the Bill should be again introduced during this present Session, but its introduction was postponed owing to Mr. Dickinson (who had charge of the Bill) being abroad on account of illhealth. It appears to be very questionable whether the Bill will become law without the co-operation of the Government. Public Health (Sewers and Drains) Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to amend the Public Health Acts with respect to sewers and drains, but this Bill does not relate to the Metropolis. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The Borough Surveyor reported to the Works Committee that an old brick barrel sewer beneath the southern footway of East India Dock •This Bill was set out in extenso Annual Report, 1910, pages 216 and 217. 193 Road between Lower North Street and the premises of Messrs. Geary had been opened on complaint of its defective condition, and it was found that the portion west of Nos. 112 and 114 had been cut off and was unused, and that the remainder of the sewer was in use for the drainage of the two houses mentioned only. The barrel being of 18in. diameter, of old construction, with an inefficient gradient and small flow, had led to nuisance, and the Works Committee approved the connection, by the Borough Surveyor, of the drainage of 112 and 114, East India Dock Road to the Council's sewer in the centre of the roadway, and the demolition of the old brick barrel. The Borough Surveyor presented to the Works Committee a plan and estimate for the reconstruction of the sewer in St. Leonard's Street from Talwin Street (late Love Lane) to Priory Street. The Surveyor reported that the sewer in question was one handed over to the late Board of Works for the Poplar District on the constitution of that Authority in 1855. The old sewer in Brunswick Road between Findhorn Street and East India Dock Road was reported by the Borough Surveyor to be in a bad condition. The sewer, the Surveyor reported, consisted of one ring of brick barrel. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1. Gap. 8, Sect. 26 (2.) REVENUE ACT, 1903. 3 Edw. 7, Cap. 46. No certificates for exemption under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890-1, and the Revenue Act, 1903, were granted during the year. o 194 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Verminous Rooms.* Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the "Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. Seven certificates had to be given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 240 rooms have been cleansed of vermin :— Poplar South Division 12 West Combined Division 20 East Combined Division 32 Bromley Central Division 5 Bromley North Division 30 Bow West Division 18 Bow East Division 19 Houses Let in Lodgings 104 No summonses were applied for. Licensed Premises' Urinals. Six notices were served under Section 22 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, calling upon the owners to provide proper doors to the urinals attached to their licensed premises. * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons see pages 102 and 103. 195 SCHOOLS. Inspection of Schools. The Schools of the Borough were inspected and the sanitary conveniences and water supplies were found in a satisfactory condition. SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, ETC. Fixing of W.C. Pans and Traps without Notice. List of Sanitary Works. Overcrowding. General. Janet Street School Playground. Douglas Street. Closing of the Marsh Wall. Suggested Provision of Covers for Dust Pails. Legal Proceedings. Fixing of W.C. Pans and Traps without Notice. In two cases where w.c. pans and traps were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders were written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings, which had been authorised by the Committee, would be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work.

Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting two cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 45 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 47 of overcrowding abated; two cases of overcrowding were abated in workshops (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 259); 136 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, page 261). In no instances were legal proceedings instituted General. 7,858 communications were received, and 794 complaints (including 63 smoke) as to nuisances were made. Janet Street School Playground. The General Purposes Committee again considered the condition of the playground at Janet Street School, which is covered with ashes, and recommended the Council that a protest against the condition of the playground at Janet Street School be made to the London County Council, with a request that the playground should be properly paved and thrown open out of school hours to the children of the neighbourhood, and that the representatives of the Borough on the London County Council be asked to take action in the matter. The following letter was submitted to the General Purposes Committee:— London County Council. Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C., September 22nd, 1911. Janet Street Ground, Millwall. Sir, I am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, relating to the above-named ground. 198 In reply thereto, I am to inform you that the question of levelling the ground and putting it into good order is already being dealt with. The proposal that the ground should be thrown open out of school hours to the children of the neighbourhood will be submitted to the appropriate committee in due course. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, R. BLAIR, Education Officer. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The following letters were submitted to the General Purposes Committee:— London County Council. Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. November 9th, 1911. Janet Street Site—Poplar. Sir, Your letter of the 14th ultimo, concerning the suggestion of the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council that the site at Janet Street should be laid out in permanent paving and opened out of school hours for use by the children of the neighbourhood generally, has been considered by the appropriate Sub-Committee of the Council. In reply thereto, I am to inform you that the ground is required in connection with the organised games of the pupils from the schools in the neighbourhood. The games played include football, hockey and cricket, and a paved ground for such games is not considered desirable. Arrangements will be made, however, for the surface of the ground to be put into thoroughly good condition. With regard to the question of the use of the ground out of school hours, the Council is of opinion that it is not desirable that the ground should be opened as a playground for play of a general and unorganised kind, since considerable damage would be caused 199 to the ground and its usefulness for school purposes would be impaired. The Borough Council is probably aware, however, that in the case of the Glaucus Street ground arrangements have been made for the ground to be used on summer evenings and on Saturday mornings for organised and supervised play by the Evening Play Centres Committee, and it is not anticipated that there will be any difficulty in making similar arrangements in respect of the Janet Street ground. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, B. M. ALLEN, Deputy Education Officer. The Town Clerk, Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council. Douglas Street. The attention of the Works Committee had been called by the Public Health and Housing Committee to the condition of Douglas Street, a cul de sac, not in the charge of the Council, at Cubitt Town. The Borough Surveyor suggested gravel footways, kerbing, and flint roadway, and that the road be not taken over by the Council. The Works Committee recommended that Douglas Street be repaired as proposed, and the cost apportioned upon the respective owners, the street thereafter remainin repairable by the owners. Closing of the Marsh Wall, Millwall. The Justices at Quarter Sessions on July 11th made an Order for the closing of part of the Marsh Wall and the King's Arms Stairs, as approved by the Council. The Order to become operative on the completion of the new road from West Perry Road and the new river stairs, and their certification as satisfactory by two Justices. The London County Council approved the construction of a new street for foot traffic on the western side of West Ferry Road in substitution for the tortuous footway on the Marsh Wall Co be closed under an Order of the Justices. 200 Suggested Provision of Covers for Dust Pails. The Public Health and Housing Committee, on March 30th, reported to the Council they had had before them questions raised at the last Council meeting as to provision of covers for dust pails. They had on two occasions made representations to the Works Committee urging such provision on public health grounds, and had also pointed out the requirements of the London County Council By-Laws in the matter. The Works Committee, however, considered the provision of covers impracticable, and in view of the frequent removal of house refuse, unnecessary. The Committee had again considered the matter, but, being equally divided, submitted no recommendation on the subject. 201 Police Court Proceedings. No. of Street or Name of Premises or Locality, &c.

The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. March 2nd, 1911. Sir, It will be remembered that on July 7th, 1904, a conference, convened by the Council, was held at the County Hall in Spring Gardens, at which representatives of the Metropolitan Borough Councils attended. The object of the conference was to afford the Metropolitan Borough Councils an opportunity of exchanging views as to the results of the experience gained in the administration of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and of discussing any general principles which it might appear to be desirable to adopt with a view to the Act being equally and uniformly enforced throughout London. The holding of this conference was attended with beneficial results and the Council is of opinion the time has arrived when another conference should be convened with a view to discussing the many and diverse matters of public health interest which have arisen since the previous conference was held. The Council has therefore decided to convene a conference to meet at the County Hall in Spring Gardens on Thursday, April 6th, 1911, at 11 a.m, and I am to express the hope that the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council will appoint two representatives to attend the conference, accompanied by the Town Clerk and the Medical Officer of Health. Among the subjects which the Council suggests might usefully be considered are the following:— 1. Regulation of furnished and unfurnished rooms, 2. Action to be taken in connection with cases of pulmonary phthisis. 204 3. Supply of water to tenement houses under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. 4. Regulation of places where food is prepared for sale. 5. Action arising out of the Notification of Births Act. 6. Question of making measles a notifiable disease. It would, of course, be understood that only members of the Borough Council would vote on any motion which might be made. If the Borough Council agree to take part in the conference and appoint two representatives accordingly, I shall be obliged if you will be so good as to inform me of the names and addresses of the representatives appointed to attend the conference. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, G. GOMME, Clerk of the Council. Councillors A. H. Warren and A. James, Chairman and ViceChairman respectively of the Committee, were appointed to represent the Council at the conference, together with the Medical Officer of Health and the Town Clerk. The following resolutions were adopted by the Conference on Matters Relating to Public Health at a meeting of the conference of representatives of the Corporation of the City of London, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils, held in the County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W., on Thursday, April 6th, 1911:— Furnished Rooms. None. Houses Let in Lodgings. That the efficient administration of Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to the registration and regulation of houses let in lodgings is a matter of extreme importance to the public health of London. 205 Pulmonary Tuberculosis. (A)—That the principle of compulsory notification should be extended to all cases of pulmonary tuberculosis.

(5) That accommodation should be provided in the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals for urgent nonpauper cases of measles. (B)—That in the interests of public health the school regulations should provide that all children from houses infected with measles should be prohibited from school attendance. Water Supply to Tenement Houses. That houses of three or more storeys, occupied by more than one family of the working-class, should have at least one water supply and a sink placed on a landing convenient for the occupants of the second and third storeys. Places where Food ».s Prepared and Exposed for Sale. (A)—That it is desirable that regulations should be made to limit the pollution resulting from exposure in an improper manner in public places or adjacent to the public way, of food and food receptacles. 206 (B)—That it is desirable that all places where food is prepared for sale should be regulated by by-laws made by the London County Council and administered by the sanitary authorities, and should be subject to annual licensing by the sanitary authority. Notification of Births Act, 1907. That in view of the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, throughout London, and the provisions of the recent orders of the Local Government Board with regard to the compulsory notification of consumption, the appointment of one or more women health visitors, or women sanitary inspectors, in each metropolitan borough is eminently desirable. Chapels of Best. That it is desirable that chapels of rest, apart from mortuaries for bodies awaiting inquest, should be established by sanitary authorities. That all private mortuaries should be registered and regulated SANITARY LEGISLATION. Rag Flock Act, 1911. An Act to prohibit the sale and use for the purpose of the manufacture of certain articles of unclean flock manufactured from rags.

Consolidates Shops Regulation Acts, 1892 to 1911, and comes into operation on the first day of May, 1912. Shops Regulation Acts, 1892 to 1911, are repealed.

Its main provisions impose new statutory requirements as to closing of shops and employment of shop assistants, and it constitutes the charter of shop assistants for a weekly half holiday and definite hours for meals. 208 In Pursuance of Sections 107, 108 and 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901.

March, 1912. 214 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1911. To the Medical Officer of Health. sir,— I beg to lay before you my twenty-second Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ended 31st December, 1911, as follows :— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 1,092 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 338 Do. on house-to-house visitation 102 Do. Canal Boats 31 Re-inspections 1,458 Making a total of 3,021 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,563 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 30.7 per cent, of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 480 written intimations, 222 statutory, and 10 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precede the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in no case was it found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings to ensure enforcement. 215 House-to-House Visitation.

The results of the analyses of above samples showed that none of the articles were found to be adulterated. Factories, Workshops, Workplaces and Outworkers. During the year the premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected, and where necessary, for sanitary purposes, notices have been duly served upon the responsible persons, and the nuisances were abated thereon. Milk Shops. There are 56 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation of milking; I find that in all of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. Canal Boats. These boats are visited whenever lying alongside a wharf. 30 have been inspected during the year without cause of complaint. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed slaughter houses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Ofttimes a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress. 225 Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are eight fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public. Bake-Houses. There are 17 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 20 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean. Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small scale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period frequent visits are made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored over night is particularly investigated. Schools. There are 5 in the Bromley North District and these are visited twice a year re drinking water supply and w.c. accommodation. On each visit everything has been found in perfect order. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. Unsound Food. Large quantities of unsound food are received from outlying wharves and sent into the Bromley North Division for destruction; such food Q 226 stuff is not allowed to be destroyed until the District Inspector has verified the amount and weight of each load sent from the wharf to his district. The goods are then destroyed under his supervision. The following quantities have been destroyed so as to prevent its reappearance on the market as a cheap food for the working class. The residue is used only for cattle food and manure. Total destroyed :— 196 carcases. 11 tons of grain. 6,492 tins of various meats. 371 boxes of dates. 49 cases of biscuits. 63 bags of flour. 10 boxes of butter. 10 pails of lard. 15 cases of Quaker Oats. 3 cases of oatmeal. 1 case of split peas. 3 barrels of pork. Smoke Nuisances. A few smoke nuisances have been notified, but on the service of an intimation in each case the nuisance was abated. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive material is conveyed through the district. Only on two occasions were carriers cautioned, but the nuisances were very slight.

Public-House Urinals, etc. Attention has been given to these places of public convenience and as far as practicable they were kept clean and furnished with the fittings in compliance with the Act. Hairdressers' Shops. The above shops and premises in general were inspected, attention given to the cleanliness of the trade utensils and accessories, also sanitary conditions.

All dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness and have, generally speaking, been kept as clean as possible. All changes of tenancy have been dealt with and the registers brought up to date. Canal Boats Acts. Canal boats that are " registered" as such under the Acts are visited as opportunities offer. They have been found, as regards the living quarters, in a perfectly clean condition, and advantage has always been taken of the regulation means of ventilation provided. When asked for the " certificates " have been produced for inspection and compared with the number of occupants, and in no case was any overcrowding found to exist. No cases of illness have been discovered on the boats. Smoke Nuisances. Complaints from the London County Council (which have been exceptionally few this year) have been attended to, and also my own observations of shafts. No legal proceedings were necessary, all " notices," whether verbal or " statutory," have been attended to. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. During the year samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis, also many have been procured on delivery and at the workhouse in the district. In no case this year has it been necessary (for the first time in eleven years) to institute legal proceedings for adulteration, although some have had a large proportion of preservative in them, principally the samples of butter. 239 Public Health (London) Act, 1891. All cases of infectious diseases notified during the year have received attention with a view to tracing their origin if possible. Very many visits to premises have been paid respecting notifications of tuberculosis, and where possible, precautions taken upon advice tendered to the patients and household generally. Eespecting the " closing order " made last year at the Thames Police Court for a house in Guildford Road, I was summoned to attend the Court regarding the order being rescinded. As the work under " notice " was all executed no objection was raised and the " order " was duly cancelled. " Proceedings " have been commenced against a Covent Garden firm of fruit merchants, and also against their salesman, for selling unsound tomatoes to a stall keeper in the Chrisp Street Market. For the present the matter is in abeyance pending the hearing at the High Court of Justice. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Under this Act some 20 rooms have been successfully freed from vermin. No legal proceedings were necessary to ensure this result as the particular section of the Act requiring this work to be done is now more thoroughly understood. The public-house urinals, as far as possible, have been kept in a cleanly state. Ice-Cream Regulations. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice-cream is made have been inspected and attention given to all the utensils used. They have been kept in a most clean and satisfactory condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH JOHNSON, R.P.C., Cert. San. Insp. Exam. Board (London); Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs and Canal Boats Acts, West Combined Division. 240 Report of Inspector, East Combined Division.

Inspection of Division. 1843 premises have been inspected, 1617 in response to complaints of nuisances, 125 on account of notifications of infectious diseases, and the remainder (101) part house-to-house inspections and part under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. Of the 1843 premises so dealt with 1217 were found to be in a fair sanitary condition, whilst at the remainder (626) nuisances were found to exist, necessitating sanitary works being carried out (see tabulated list, page 196). House-to-House Inspections.

Verminous Rooms. 32 verminous rooms have been cleansed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. 244 Bakehouses. I have, as instructed, made periodical inspections of the bakehouses (now numbering fifteen, two having been closed since my last report. Three of the bakehouses are underground. The bi-annual cleansing in each case has been carried out satisfactorily. The general conditions of the bakehouses were found satisfactory. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. Five notices were received for renewal of licences. The premises were duly inspected regarding the cleansing, limewashing and general sanitary condition in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds Order; any defects found to exist were remedied and the limewashing done before the renewals of the licences were granted. The slaughterhouses have been frequently visited, often when killing was in progress, and everything found satisfactory; limewashing in each case has been done in compliance with the London County Council's bye-laws. The number of these premises now on the register is—cowsheds, 2; slaughterhouses, 3. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 52 varied samples have been taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. On analysis four were found to be adulterated. Summonses were issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples and results of legal proceedings are appended:— Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 3.5 per cent. Defendant proved warranty. Summons dismissed. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 4.7 per cent. Defendant gave due notice of a warranty, which Mr. Young, Solicitor, proved was not a true copy within the meaning of the Act, and defendant was ordered to pay 23s. costs. 245 Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 8.2 per cent. Vendor fined 7s. and 23s. costs (first offence). Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 20 per cent, and 7 per cent, respectively. Vendor fined 10s. and 23s. costs (first offence). Bight samples of butter were found to be mixed with a foreign substance, i.e., boric acid (preservative) in varying small proportions. Number of samples of butter obtained 15 ,, containing boric acid 8 ,, ,, foreign fat 0 ,, ,, excess of water 0 Particulars of samples containing preservatives:— Butter containing boric acid, 0.1 per cent. ,, ,, 0.5 „ ,, ,, 0.1 ,, ,, ,, 0.5,, ,, ,, 0.5 ,, ,, ,, 0.25 ,, ,, ,, 0.25 „ ,, ,, 0.5 ,, Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act 1891 and Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it was found necessary in only one case to institute legal proceedings (against the owner of " Hawthorn's Wharf," Cold Harbour, for disobeying the order of the Council, viz., to provide a suitable and proper water supply for the use of the workmen). Defendant was fined 40s. and 23s. costs. Smoke Nuisances. During the year the shafts throughout the district have been under careful observation, and in five instances nuisances were detected. In these cases intimations and statutory notices were served, which have had the desired effect of abating the nuisances. No recurrence of the nuisances took place, therefore there was no necessity to institute legal proceedings. 246 Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected, and there has been no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. During the year several applications have been made by tradesmen and others to examine articles of food which, when examined, were found to be "unsound, unwholesome and unfit for human food." In each instance applicant was advised to have the same taken to the Council's destructor, and on being informed by telephone that the said food had been destroyed a certificate was given and the purchasers reimbursed. Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-law under Public Health (London) Act. Section 50). The cisterns of the undermentioned buildings have been inspected, and the usual cleansing has been carried out in accordance with the Bye-law:— Adelaide Buildings 2, Baffin Buildings 2, Grosvenor Buildings 55, Hudson Buildings 2, Melbourne Buildings 4, Montreal Buildings 4, Ontario Buildings 4, Ottawa Buildings 4, Quebec Buildings 4, Council Buildings 5, St. Lawrence Cottages, Norfolk Street 14, Sydney Buildings 4, Toronto Buildings 2, Winnipeg Buildings 4. Public House Urinals. The public house urinals in the district have been frequently inspected, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, strictly enforced (see tabulated list page 196). Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection of these premises have been made during the year and change of ownership, etc., duly reported and noted in register. While inspecting these premises attention has been paid to the food in preparation for cooking. The premises have been cleansed where necessary and the conditions generally were found to be very satisfactory. 247 Hairdressers' Shops. The haircutting and shaving rooms have been periodically inspected, the condition of the utensils used in the business being carefully noted. Where cleansing was necessary intimations were served. The workshops and domestic workshops, etc., have been periodically inspected, only in a few instances it being found necessary to serve intimations for cleansing. The premises where ice creams are made have been frequently inspected and the sanitary conditions found very satisfactory. The barrows and utensils of itinerant vendors have been under constant supervision, no cause for complaint being found. The inspection of canal boats was without any particular incident during the year. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is stored and sold in the district with the object of enforcing the regulations of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of the measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, especially in respect to other articles kept for sale in close proximity to where milk is kept. Factory and Workshops Acts. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. Canal Boats. Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. Number of Milk Sellers registered 36 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 7 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 3 Number of Milk Sellers added to Register 0 Overcrowding. During the year 13 cases of overcrowding were dealt with; in 248 each case the nuisance was abated after service of an intimation followed by a statutory notice, without recourse to legal proceedings. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, intimations and notices having been served where necessary. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, etc. There is only one wharf in my district, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramornie Meat Co.), where food (all tinned) is landed, some of which is warehoused for various firms. The Ramornie Meat Company's consignments are examined by an expert examiner employed by the firm before being sent out, either for home consumption or for exportation. A large amount is purchased for the Mercantile Service, all of which is again examined, especially labelled and passed by Board of Trade officials before leaving the premises. The following tinned foods were found, on examination by the consignees, to be unfit for human consumption and rejected, being set aside by the consignees in a separate building for the purpose of being sent to a fat boiler in the district to be rendered down for fat, precautions being taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose:— 821 -61bs. beef, 2-41bs. beef, 1074-21bs. beef, 282-1lb. beef, 2965- 61bs. mutton, 751-21bs. mutton, 308-1lb. mutton, 80 meats various, 7-21bs. kidneys, 70-1½ lbs. chicken, 8-21bs. soup, 172-21bs. steak, 79- 21bs. tongues, 136—1lb. tongues, 244—1lb. salmon, 71-21bs. fruit various. Public Elementary Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Public Elementary Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supplies and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main. The storage cisterns (which are used for supplying the sanitary conveniences only) are cleansed out every three months. The sanitary conveniences and offices (with two exceptions) were found to be in a clean 249 and satisfactory condition. In some cases drinking cups were found to be missing but have since been reinstated. Places where Bread is Sold. With reference to a communication received from the London County Council the shops in my district where bread is sold have been periodically inspected under Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which refers to the sanitary regulations of premises used for the sale of food for human consumption. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats, East Combined Division. 250 Report of Inspectoe, South Division of Poplar. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1911. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my Annual Summary of the sanitary work executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1911, viz.:— The details of which were entered in my journal day by day and reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee month by month. Number of Inspections, special, periodical and on complaint of nuisances 1,318 ,, ,, Inspections re notifications of infectious diseases 129 ,, ,, Inspections, house-to-house visitations 87 Total Inspections 1,534 Re-inspections 3,865 House-to-House Inspections. House-to-House inspections were carried out as follows:— The whole of— Sections of— Deptford Ferry Road. Claude Street. East Ferry Road. Gaverick Street, Crew Street. Manilla Street. Glengall Road. Stewart Street. Stebondale Street. Malabar Street. Of the total premises inspected 977 were found to be in fair 251 condition; 37 per cent. required various works of sanitary improvement, which necessitated the service of 459 written intimations, 106 statutory notices, and 21 final notices. Premises Reported under the Housing and Town Planning Act. Result of Procedure. Nature Premises. and extent of Work Executed. Stewart Street, 5, 6, 7 Drain and water closets entirely reconstructed. Dampness remedied by inserting damp-proof coursing in walls, concreting ground area beneath floors (basement level) and rendering lower surfaces of walls in cement. Yards re-paved in concrete. Roofs made watertight. Gutters and pipes renewed or repaired. Walls and ceilings, floors, hearths, window sashes and frames repaired. Walls and ceilings cleansed throughout.

Charles Terrace, 2 to 8 Premises cleansed and repaired throughout. Dampness remedied by damp-proof coursing. Roof rain-water pipes and gutters, yard paving and water fittings overhauled and repaired. The supervision of the above sanitary improvements, including the testing of new drains and fittings, etc., examining damp-proof coursing, etc., entailed many visits and occupied much of my time. In one or two instances on my report of slow progress, you communicated with the owners, with the result that more men were put on the work. The work was completed in each case to your satisfaction and permission was given for re-occupation. Dangerous Structures. I reported in five instances dangerous structures to the London County Council, which were dealt with by the District Surveyor. Drains. During the year 66 drains were proved defective by the smoke and chemical tests, and in 320 instances the application of tests revealed no defects. Drainage construction and reconstruction, including means of access and ventilation, were carried out at the following premises:— Chipka Street, 29 to 41. Stewart Street 15 to 23. Samuda Street, 20, 21. East Ferry Road, 32 to 46. Manchester Road, 310. St. John's Vicarage, Roserton Street. West Perry Road, 296, 298, " Tooke Arms," Sufferance Wharf. Alpha Road, 35, 37, 67 to 83. 253 The drains of the undermentioned premises were reconstructed partially or wholly on the old lines, in most cases including the fixing of new w.c. pans, traps and yard gullies:— Manchester Road, 487 to 495. West Ferry Road, 178, 52, 54, 247, 249, 417, Nelson Wharf, Messrs. Le Bas Engineering Works, " Anchor and Hope " p.h. Glengall Road, Silex Works, and Nos. 36 to 42. Janet Street, 32.

Improved or sufficient sanitary accommodation for workmen has been provided at the following factories:— Messrs. Le Bas Engineering Works, West Ferry Road. Cannon Ironworks, Cheval Street. Messrs. Bullivants, West Ferry Road. Messrs. Hodges and Son, West Ferry Road. Nelson Wharf, West Ferry Road. Messrs. F. and T. Thorne, builder's shop and yard, Manchester Road. Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were visited and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations. 254 Workshops, etc. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 43—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Booms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms were inspected and dealt with where necessary. In every case an antiseptic was in use. Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repsated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division (Poplar South) number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. In one case only was it necessary to serve a written intimation and this was promptly attended to. With this exception the sanitary condition of the lavatories, conveniences, water supplies, and fittings was satisfactory. Tuberculosis and Measles. In addition to the ordinary notifications of infectious diseases, in all cases of measles notified from schools and tuberculosis from poor law institutions the homes of the patients were inspected and sanitary conditions remedied where necessary. Rats and Plague. Printed circulars explaining the connection of rats with plague were 255 left at all riverside premises and factories throughout my district by your direction. Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises:— Bakehouses, 7. Slaughterhouses, 1. Tripe dressers and sausage makers, 11. Dairies and milk shops, 21. Ice cream vendors, 22. Coffee shops and dining rooms, 33. Fish shops, 12. In all cases where cleansing, limewashing, or other works of sanitary improvements were necessary the matter was brought to the notice of the occupiers by written intimation, which in every case was complied with. The regularity of the periodical inspection of these premises has impressed upon the occupiers the necessity of cleanliness and limewashing, etc., of kitchens and places where food is prepared or stored. This was proved by the amount of work already completed or in progress (without notice) at the time of my visits. Riverside Wharves and Food Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the undermentioned wharves and factories and records were kept of all unsound foodstuffs and methods of destruction. Maconochie's Wharf and Food Preserving Factory, West Ferry Road. The total amount of food stuffs rejected as unsound by this firm and destroyed in the furnaces on the premises at the time of my visits during the past year was 1,699 tins, varying in weight from ¼lb. to 14lb., and consisting of meat, fish, poultry, fruit, and vegetables. In response to notice from the Port Sanitary Authority in February last that 63 cases of damaged oranges were consigned to the above factory, I awaited the delivery and the goods were sorted by the firm immediately on arrival, with the result that 7½ cwt. were found to be unsound and were destroyed. 256 Sufferance Wharf and Pood Preserving Factory, West Ferry Road (for export only). The tinned food stuff rejected and destroyed by this firm during the year amounted to 144 cases, each containing about 48 tins, which contained principally preserved fish. These cases were marked unsound and sealed and were put overboard at sea from the firm's boats. During the year three notices were received from the Port Sanitary Authority of returned tinned goods from abroad consigned to the above factory. In each case the goods were examined on delivery with results as follows:— 10 cases of jars of fish paste—contents of jars in sound condition. 8½ cases of tinned shrimps—contents of tins sound. 11 cases of tinned lobster, about 48 tins per case—contents of tins partially decomposed (destroyed in furnace). 1 case of tinned herring—unsound and unfit for food. This case, on the firm's application, was removed by your permission to their factory at Lowestoft for investigation, and the Medical Officer of Lowestoft was notified of its despatch. Victoria Wharf and Stores for Pickles only, West Ferry Road. No unsound food stuffs seen during my visits to these premises. St. Andrew's Wharf, Cattle Food Factory. No information respecting food stuff delivered to this factory for conversion into cattle food. No notice was received from H.M. Office of Customs under the regulations made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, of food stuff imported by water into this district during the past year, and no infringement of the Act was observed by myself. Inspection of Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. 257 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-six samples of food were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis as under:— Milk, 30, 14 of which were purchased from street vendors. Butter, 14. Margarine, 3. Lard, 3. Coffee, 2. Cocoa, 3. Rice, 1. Of the 14 samples of butter taken four contained boric acid preservatives ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 per cent. Of the milks procured one was certified to be deficient in fat to the extent of 96.6 per cent. A summons was issued against the vendor and was dismissed with a caution. In this case the evidence given before the Court was that on the 8th December milk was sold in Newcastle Street, Cubitt Town, without declaration at the time of the purchase that it was separated milk. No notice or placard was displayed on the barrow from which it was sold to that effect. On the barrow was marked in large letters, " The New Farmers Milk Supply." On the side of the hand-can engraved in the metal was marked, "Separated Milk." This could not be seen at the time of purchase as the milk seller fetched the jug from door of 17, Newcastle Street, and took it into the street to his barrow, and returned with the milk. It was pointed out to the Magistrate that had this lettering on the hand-can been in black or white it could have been seen. In cross examination for the defence, the person who purchased for the Inspector admitted having some time previously purchased some milk from defendant's man at 3d. per quart. It was therefore urged that she knew the milk to be separated. The Magistrate, in dismissing the case, warned the defendant, and remarked that when separated milk was sold the fact should be clearly advertised. Section 11, Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, does not apply to ordinary separated or skimmed milk. The Section in question states that every tin or other receptacle containing condensed, separated, or skimmed milk must bear a label clearly visible to the purchaser on which the words " machine-skimmed milk" or " skimmed milk," as the case may require, are printed in large and S 258 legible type, etc., etc., etc. Under these circumstances, and from the result of the above case, it would be as well if, when further legislation upon the sale of food and drugs is being considered, a similar clause should be inserted respecting skimmed or separated milk, and a placard conspicuously displayed on the barrow in the case of itinerant vendors. The remaining samples were certified genuine. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 259 Report of Lady Inspector (Miss Tattersall). Public Health Department, December 31st, 1911. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my twelfth Annual Report which deals with the work done in factories, workshops, among outworkers, and other miscellaneous inspections during the year 1911. Verminous Children, Phthisis and Scabies. A large proportion of time has been devoted to the inspection of the homes of children reported as attending school in a verminous condition, and as, at the time of writing this report, the cleansing station is in operation to bathe and disinfest the clothing of the children, it is hoped there will be much visible improvement during the next year or two. The homes of children suffering from scabies (itch) and phthisis have also been visited, leaflets left and advice given. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation for the girls and infants in the 36 elementary schools in the Borough have been inspected and various defects remedied or reported to the London County Council (Education Dept.). Outivorkers.

London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. (Section 20). "Cleansing of Verminous Rooms." The whole of the work done under this Act was under the intimations served, and in no cases were certification and subsequent notices necessary. There were 68 intimations served, referring to 104 rooms. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. " Water Supply in Tenement House." During the year notices were served under this Act for provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water on the upper floors at nine houses. At three of the houses the work was carried out at once, but the landlord of the other six houses objected to the notices and legal proceedings had to be taken at the Thames Police Court, when the magistrate ordered the supply to be provided (see Legal Proceedings). 263 Legal Proceedings. At the Thames Police Court, on 18th July, the landlord of Nos. 319 and 321, West Ferry Road, Millwall, was summoned for not providing "a proper and sufficient supply of water on each storey," according to notices served, also for not carrying out cleansing, and having rooms rid of vermin, according to further notices served.

Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. January 1st, 1912. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present the fourth Annual Report of my work. The year has been rather an eventful one in the history of the Poplar Health Visiting Association. At the close of 1911 the Executive Committee appointed a paid worker to visit in the Borough, at a salary of £100 per year. £50 was guaranteed by friends of Miss Wintour's; a concert held in February realised £21 16s. 10½d.; the remainder was given by friends. The Committee, however, soon decided that it would be impossible for them to obtain the funds necessary for making the appointment a permanent one, and decided to approach the Borough Council and ask them to do this. The application was afterwards redrafted and only a donation was asked for. The Borough Council referred the matter to the Local Government Board, and they replied that such a donation would be illegal. The Executive Committee then decided to approach the Public Health and Housing Committee and ask them to recommend the Borough Council to appoint a second Health Visitor, who should be entirely under the control of the Borough Council, and a deputation was appointed to wait on the Public Health and Housing Committee to explain the views of the Association. That the deputation was favourably received may be judged by the result—an assistant Health Visitor has been appointed. The Executive Committee appointed two delegates to represent the Association at the National Conference for the Prevention of Destitution held in Caxton Hall in the summer, and they have affiliated to the newly-formed Association of Infant Consultations and Schools for Mothers. Six meetings of the Executive Committee have been held during the year, the average attendance at each being eight. There have been several alterations in the personnel, the chief being the resignation of the Hon. Treasurer (the Rev. H. Mosley) and 266 the addition of Doctors Binns, Cardale, Millea, Rome Hall and Toland to the list of Hon. Consultants. These are especially welcome, local interest being decidedly the most satisfactory. The Executive Committee have now agreed to provide literature and the funds necessary to pay the bonus on members' savings in the Maternity Club to any centre starting. Poplar has started, but the North and South Bromley Centres think that under the Insurance Bill such clubs will be unnecessary. The attendances at the Consultation Days show a considerable decrease, due (1) to the record epidemics of measles and infantile diarrhœa—the Island Centre finding it necessary to close altogether for a time; (2) closing of South Bromley Centre for two months, owing to the place of meeting being closed for that period; and (3) alteration of date of consultation day at North Bromley to meet the convenience of the Hon. Consultant. The number of workers remains practically the same:—sixty, inclusive of eight Hon. Consultants, five Hon. Secretaries, and forty-seven Visitors. The number of infants visited in each centre has increased, except in the case of the Isle of Dogs, and that shows a slight decrease only because there were fewer births. The visits of the paid worker are shown in the totals. The London City Mission (Grundy Street) and the nurses of St. John Divine have ceased to co-operate with the Association. We welcome workers from St. Stephen's and St. Saviour's Churches (Poplar). In making any comparison between the rates of mortality Borough v. infants visited, I wish particularly to call your attention to the fact that the rate of mortality (105.69) given by me refers to infants born in 1910 and kept under supervision for a year. The excessive mortality during the diarrhoea epidemic, therefore, affects those statistics only slightly; the real effect will be seen when the figures for 1911 are given next year. In conclusion, I wish to again express my thanks to every one for their hearty co-operation—the Hon. Consultants, the Visitors, the friends who provide meeting places for our Consultation Days, the "cup that cheers" for the mothers—trusting that their efforts will not flag, even though the results shown are not quite so good as last year. Best thanks are also due to Messrs. K. G. Hobday and C. F. Short for the help they so willingly gave me in the organisation of the concert, and to the Committee of the Charity Organisation Society for providing milk for necessitous cases. Every case which I have referred to them has been taken up, a quart of milk daily being allowed for four months in one case of delicate twins. My idea of a milk fund in connection with the Association is still—an idea! 267 POPLAR HEALTH VISITING ASSOCIATION. President Mrs. Sidney Buxton. Vice-Presidents Mrs. R. H. Green. Miss K. Wintour.

Notifications received 43 Visits paid 43 Re-visits paid 79 Still under supervision 2 Recovered 37 Sight of one eye impaired 2 (Handed over to N.S.P.C.C.) Blind 2 (One died while still under treatment.) Thirty-two of the cases (including the four last) were attended by midwives, eleven by medical men. 272 Five were admitted into the London Hospital, afterwards being made out-patients, three were admitted into the Sick Asylum, thirteen attended the Hospital as out-patients, twenty-five were treated by private practitioners, the nurses of the East London Nursing Association visited five cases, the nurses of St. John Divine three. With reference to the cases handed over to the N.S.P.C.C., one mother failed to attend hospital regularly and was found at home the worse for drink one day when she should have been at the hospital, the second case, the mother discharged herself from the Sick Asylum and refused to allow the child to remain, she also refused to allow it to stay in the hospital where it had been taken at a later date. Of the two whose sight was destroyed, one was taken regularly to the hospital but the mother declined the services of a nurse. The child was hand-fed and died of epidemic diarrhœa. The other, both mother and child were delicate and were treated in the Sick Asylum, this child also was hand-fed. Miscellaneous Visits.

Metropolitan Borough of Popular. Comprising the Registration Sub-Districts of Poplar, Bromley and Bow. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with the "Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my fifteenth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1907, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1907, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 170,209: — Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,758,218 60,221 67,098 42,890 being 63.5 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 73.14 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 51.64 per acre in Poplar Sub-District, 110.90 2 in Bromley, and 77.27 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1907. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports; for the Sub-District of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three parishes might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., and VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. Births. During the year 1907, 100 births were notified outside the Borough belonging thereto:—96 by the Medical Officer of Stepney, three by the Medical Officer of Finsbury and one by the Medical Officer of Health for Greenwich. 80 of the Stepney births occurred in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road, and 16 in the London Hospital. The three births in Finsbury took place in the City of London Lying-in Hospital. Mothers' Home, Commercial Road. poplar. bromley. bow. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male.

In the 52 weeks 2904 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 711 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1766 in Bromley, and 427 in Bow; from the 711 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 65 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 380 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1026 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1766 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 820 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 229 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 1175. Prom the 427 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 7 non-residents and added 258 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 678 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III. that in considering the deaths of nonresidents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2904 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 514 deaths of actual nonresidents and 489 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2879 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1026 deaths in Poplar included 4 illegitimate children, 3 male and 1 female; the 1175 deaths in Bromley included 15 illegitimate children, 8 male and 7 female; the 678 Bow deaths included 8 illegitimate children, 5 male and 3 female, making a total for the Borough of 27 deaths of illegitimate children. 8 Males.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Sub-Districts of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the years 1901-1906, females also exceeded the males. 9 The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 23 years (see page 2): — Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

An Act to provide for the early Notification of Births became law on the 28th August, 1907. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable that the Notification of Births Act should be adopted by the Council, and recommended— "That the Council at its meeting on the 31st October, 1907, do consider and determine the following recommendations, viz.:— 'That the Notification of Births Act, 1907, be and it is hereby adopted by the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, to come into operation within the said Borough at such time as may be fixed by the Local Government Board.' 'That public notice be given by advertisement of the adoption of the Act by the Council, and all necessary steps taken to bring the provisions of the Act to the attention of all medical practitioners and midwives practising in the Borough.' " The Council adopted the Act on the 31st October, 1907.* Notices of births will be received at the Public Health Offices within 48 hours after the birth, instead of some weeks after, so that the hints regarding the management and feeding, etc., of infants, will be in the hands of the parents without unnecessary delay. The father, if actually resident at the time and place of birth, and any person in attendance (including the medical practitioner or midwife) upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth shall give notice within thirty-six hours after the birth, in the manner and form prescribed by the Act, to the Medical Officer of Health, and the local authority shall supply, without charge, addressed and stamped postcards containing the form of notice. A person shall not be liable to a penalty for not giving notice if he had reason to believe notice had been duly given by some other person. The Registrars of births and deaths shall have access to notices of births received by the Medical Officer of Health, or to any book in which these notices may be recorded. *The Local Government Board confirmed the adoption of the Act and appointed the 9th March, 1908, as the date on the which it should come into operation. C 14 The Medical Officer of Health of every Metropolitan Borough shall send weekly to the London County Council, on a form prescribed by the Local Government Board, a list of all notices of births received during the past week. The notification required to be made under this Act shall be in addition to, and not in substitution of any Act relating to the registration of births. Conference of Medical Officers of Health at the Home Office—Health Visitor. The following report was presented to the Public Health and Housing Committee on the subject of the appointment of a Health Visitor:— "On Wednesday, 6th November, your Medical Officer attended a Conference of Medical Officers of Health at the Home Office, convened by the Home Secretary to determine the lines of inquiry into the subject of the influence on infant life by the industrial employment of women before and after childbirth. "The subject was discussed with the object of formulating a systematic inquiry on uniform lines throughout the country. "The views of those attending the Conference were fully expressed and resulted in a Committee being appointed to draft a table with the object of securing uniformity in the return of the various authorities. "To obtain the necessary information would be part of the duties of a Health Visitor, as every home would have to be visited upon the notification of a birth of a child under the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and again visited upon the return of the death of a child under one year of age, when forwarded by a Registrar of Births and Deaths to the Medical Officer of Health. "At the close of the Conference a further discussion took place with respect to the enforcement of the homework provisions of the Factory Act, inter alia, how the statistical returns of homeworkers could be improved and what provisions should be made for the more effective prevention of homework in unwholesome and infected premises. "So far as a Health Visitor's duties are concerned, she would 15 not only visit homes upon the notification of a birth as previously mentioned, to advise generally upon the rearing of the infant, but would also have to visit homes upon the receipt of notices from schools dealing with verminous children under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, in order that the clothing, bedding, etc., might be dealt with under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. "In the matter of visiting homes on the return of deaths to obtain information required by the Home Secretary, for such information to be of any use it is evident that children must be visited more than once during the first year after birth and more especially during the first month of life, for in the Borough of Poplar during the year 1906 822 children died under one year of age, and of these 188 were under one month. "Deaths of infants under one year of age, 1906, belonging to the Borough of Poplar:— Under 1 week. 1-2 weeks. 2-3 weeks. 3-4 weeks. Total under 1 month. 1-2 months. 2-3 months. 3-4 months. 4-5 months. 5-6 months. 6-7 months. 7-8 months. 8-9 months. 9-10 months. 10-11 months. 11-12 months. Total Deaths under 1 year. 98 33 31 26 188 87 79 63 50 70 38 56 52 53 41 45 822 "During the year 1906 5,363 births were registered as belonging to the Borough of Poplar. "It may be interesting to the Committee to know that recently, upon enquiries at 26 factories in Poplar where a total of 5,641 women are employed, 769 are married, or 13.6 per cent. "In the case of a woman with an infant being employed out at work, the question naturally arises, when the mother is at work how is her baby fed and cared for, and if there are other infants how are they provided for?" The following letter was received from the Local Government Board, with reference to the adoption by the Council of the provisions of the Notification of Births Act, viz.:— 16 Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 15th November, 1907. Sir,—I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, by the Metropolitan Borough Council of Poplar, and I am to enquire what action it is proposed to take upon the information of births to be received under the Act, with a view to the reduction of infant mortality. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LITHIBY, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk, Poplar. It was understood the Local Government Board were not prepared to confirm the adoption of the Act unless proper provision was made for utilising the information as to births, required to be given to the Medical Officer, by means of visitations by a Health Visitor.*. The salary of a Health Visitor would at present be a charge wholly on local rates, but the London County Council is proposing to acquire powers to contribute one half the salaries of such officers. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable a Health Visitor for the Borough should be appointed, and recommended— "That the Council do agree to the principle of the appointment of a Health Visitor for the Borough, and the Local Government Board be so informed; that it be referred to the Public Health and Housing Committee to consider and report as to salary and terms of appointment of such officer." Proposed Milk Depots. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— *The Council on the 19th March, 1908, appointed Miss A. E. Hall of Bradford to be Health Visitor at a commencing salary of £125 per annum. See page 166, London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908. 17 London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W., 1st March, 1907 Sir, At the conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils on the administration of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, convened by the Council in July, 1904, one of the resolutions passed was as follows:— That, having regard to the declining birth rate and the large infantile mortality rate of the Metropolis, it is desirable that the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be empowered, at their discretion, to provide in their respective districts, depots for the preparation and sale of sterilised and humanised milk for the food of infants, and that the London County Council be requested to insert a clause in its General Powers Bill for the Session of 1905, to confer such power upon the said Borough Councils. Subsequent correspondence with the Borough Councils on the matter resulted in a general approval of the proposal to confer powers upon them to maintain milk depots, and the Council has accordingly inserted clauses in its General Powers Bill of this Session with a view to obtaining the necessary powers. The Council now learns that some of the Borough Councils, who have petitioned against the Bill, object to Part VI. of the Bill, which contains the clauses in question, and that there is moreover considerable opposition on the part of the London milk trade to the proposed legislation. In the circumstances the Council is of opinion that Part VI. of the Bill should not be further proceeded with until an opportunity is taken of consulting the whole of the Metropolitan Borough Councils on the matter. I am accordingly directed to ask that you will be so good as to favour me as soon as possible with the views of the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar as to the desirableness of proceeding with Part VI. of the Council's General Powers Bill this Session. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, Clerk to the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Committee were of opinion it is desirable, in order to secure a reduction in infant mortality in London, that the powers proposed should 18 be conferred upon Metropolitan Borough Councils, and that the London County Council should proceed with Part VI. of their General Powers Act. The Committee recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the London County Council be so informed. At the meeting of the Council on the 21st March the following amendment was moved and adopted:— "That this Council considers that the declining birth rate and infantile mortality are due to other causes than defective milk supply, and sees no reason for the establishment of municipal milk depots as proposed by the London County Council (General Powers) Bill." The maintenancs of milk depots has not been dealt with in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. See page 165 London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, "Unwholesome Milk and Registration of Milk Shops." AGE MORTALITY.

Conference Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. St. Pancras Borough Council and Tuberculous Nursery Milk. London County Council General Powers Acts, 1907 and 1904. Conference Metropolitan Borough of Paddington. Together with Mr. Councillor A. H. Darby, Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, and Mr. Councillor J. Z. Cahill, J.P., Chairman of the Assessment Committee, I attended a Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, held on 6th June, at the Town Hall, Paddington, on the question of taking measures to limit the spread of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. The following motion, moved by Mr. Councillor Darby, and seconded by Mr. Councillor Cahill, was adopted, viz.:— 22 "That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is desirable, in order to limit the spread of Tuberculosis, that provision should be made for public inspection and control at its several sources of the milk supply of England; and that the Local Government Board be asked to take steps to secure the efficient administration of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885, and Orders amending the same, by making compulsory regulations." Also the following motions were adopted:— "That it is desirable that the notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) should be compulsory." "That it is desirable that voluntary notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis should be general throughout Great Britain and Ireland," (Not adopted.) "That application be made to the Local Government Board for an Order to be made— (i.) "To include Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption) among the diseases to be notified under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891" and (ii.) "To extend the provisions of the following Sections of the above Act to Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Consumption)"— "Section 60—Cleansing and disinfection of premises, etc.'' "Section 61—Disinfection of bedding, etc." "Section 62—Infectious rubbish thrown into ashpits, etc., to be disinfected." "Section 63—Penalty on letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging." "Section 64—Penalty on persons letting houses making false statements as to infectious diseases." "Section 65—Penalty on ceasing to occupy house without disinfection or notice to owner, or making false answer." "That application be made to the Local Government Board for an Order to be made to extend the provisions of Section 69 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to Pulmonary Tuberculosis, in so 23 far as it relates to the milking of cows and to the sale and distribution of milk." "That the provision conferred by Section 7 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, namely, that in every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and sufficient ventilation maintained, be rigidly enforced, and a similar provision extended to all places where people are assembled together for any lengthened period, with a view to restricting the spread of tuberculosis." (a) "That a Sanatorium is needed for the open-air treatment of poor persons suffering from pulmonary consumption in the early stages of the disease, and should be provided by a Central Authority acting for the metropolis as a whole." (b) "That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, by reason of their practical experience in the management of hospitals for infectious diseases, being eminently qualified for the position of such authority, the Local Government Board be requested to confer on, or, if necessary, to obtain for, the said managers the power to act in that capacity." (c) "That the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should also be empowered to use, for sanatorium purposes, the Southern Hospital, recently erected by them at Carshalton, in the County of Surrey." "That this Conference appoint a deputation to wait upon the Government to urge the desirability of their providing a sum of money annually for the erection and maintenance of suitable Sanatoria for the treatment of early cases of consumption." A deputation was appointed to wait upon the President of the Local Government Board. Tuberculous Nursery Milk. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from the St. Pancras Borough Council on the subject of tuberculous nursery milk. Samples were taken direct from two cows—both contained large quantities of pus cells, and one contained what was reported to be 24 tuberculi bacilli. When the disease was finally found to be tuberculosis of the udder, the consent of the owner was obtained to the slaughter of the cows. Although the Dairies, etc., Order of 1899 provides the milk of a diseased cow shall not be mixed with other milk or sold for human food, no provision is made for removing or quarantining the cows, and it is impracticable to keep such cows under constant inspection to ensure that the milk is not mixed with that of any other cows. The St. Pancras Borough Council was of opinion power should be given to Borough Councils under Article 2 of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1899, and Article 15 of the Order of 1885, to remove and place in quarantine any milch cow suspected to be diseased or tubercular, until the animal is condemned or released by the Veterinary Inspector under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts, and to pay reasonable compensation to the owners for such quarantine or detention, and representations to this effect had been made to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture and the London County Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended—That the Council concur in the opinion expressed by St. Pancras Borough Council, and representations on the subject be made to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture and the London County Council. 25 London County Council (General Powers) Act 1907. (7 Edwd. VII. Ch. clxxv.) Part IV. Milk Supply (Tuberculosis). Sec. 24—(1) Gives power to medical officer (London County Council) or any authorised person to take within the county for examination samples of milk produced or sold or intended for sale within the county, provided that in case of railway premises such persons shall conform with the reasonable requirements of the railway company so that the working of the traffic may not be obstructed or interfered with. (2) The London County Council may, by resolution, authorise a Sanitary Authority within the county to exercise powers instead of their medical officer. (3) Like powers as in Sub-section (1) may be exercised outside the the county upon an order obtained from a justice having jurisdiction in the place where the sample is to be taken. Sec. 25.—Power to inspect cows and to take samples of milk is given to medical officer or authorised person; if accompanied by a veterinary surgeon he may enter dairy and inspect the cows therein, and if medical officer or such person believes a cow is suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, he may require the cow to be milked in his presence and may take samples of the milk, and the milk from any particular teat shall, if he so require, be kept separate and separate samples thereof furnished. Power is given to medical officer if he is of opinion tuberculosis is caused or is likely to be caused to inhabitants within the county from consumption of milk supplied from a dairy, to report to the Council, and his report to be accompanied by a report from the veterinary surgeon, and the Council may thereupon serve a notice on the dairyman to appear before them within not less than 24 hours to show cause why he should not be prohibited from supplying milk in the county. Power is given to medical officer if he has reason to believe milk sold in the county from any dairy outside the county is likely to cause tuberculosis in any persons residing within the county, to inspect such dairy or cow. Provided the medical officer or authorised person obtains a justice's 26 order authorising such entry and inspection. Provided also that the medical officer or authorised person gives without reasonable delay notice in writing to the medical officer of the county. Every dairyman and persons in his employ must give reasonable assistance to the medical officer or authorised person or veterinary surgeon as may be required, and in default are liable to a fine not exceeding £5. If dairyman fails to show cause why such order as aforesaid should not be made, the Council may make the order and forthwith serve notice of the facts on the Local Government Board, and if the dairy is situate outside the county, on the county council of the administrative county and the council of the borough or district in which it is situate, the said order to be forthwith withdrawn on the council or medical officer being satisfied the milk supply has been changed or is not likely to cause tuberculosis in persons residing within the county.

The percentage on the total scarlet fever cases was 4.28, diphtheria cases 12.29, and enteric fever cases 3.70. Amongst the 55 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 3 of rötheln and 3 of measles. Amongst the 44 cases wrongly certified as diphtheria were 2 of tonsillitis, 1 of bronchitis and 2 of measles. 13 cases were scarlet fever and not diphtheria and 1 case was enteric fever and not diphtheria. In the course of the year 1907 no fewer than 3,109 patients against 2151 in 1906, 2,157 in 1905, 1,993 in 1904, 1,913 in 1903, and 2,108 in 1902, or a percentage on the total admissions of 9.7 in 1907, 8.3 in 1906, 9.04 in 1905, 10.7 in 1904, 10.4 in 1903, and 8.6 in 1902 were, after admission to the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certificates upon which they were removed to hospital. The number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar and London for the years 1899—1907 and removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals, have been as follows:— Percentage of mistakes in total admissions. Poplar.* London. 1899 49 cases 8.4 6.3 1900 60 „ 7.3 7.9 1901 131 „ 13.1 9.2 1902 93 „ 6.3 8.6 1903 46 „ 6.5 10.4 1904 54 „ 5.5 10.7 1905 57 „ 4.7 9.04 1906 44 „ 6.3 8.3 1907 102 „ 7.2 9.7 * Whole Borough. F 62 Bacteriological Examinations. Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever bacteriologically examined. (See pages 91 and 95.) Arrangements are still made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the medical officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. Two cases of scarlet fever, one of typhoid fever, one of membranous croup, one of erysipelas, and four cases of measles were connected with milkshops in Poplar. Eleven cases of scarlet fever, and one of measles were connected with milkshops in Bromley. One case of scarlet fever was connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.* Fifty-two premises with outworkers were† connected with infectious cases notified, 15 in Poplar, 27 in Bromley, and 10 in Bow—37 scarlet fever, 10 diphtheria, 1 typhoid fever, 4 erysipelas. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Twenty-nine cases of measles‡ (6 Poplar, 7 Bromley, and 16 Bow) were also connected with outworkers' premises, and where work was found on the premises it was disinfected before being returned if there were any likelihood of infection, but there is no power to prevent work being executed on outworkers' premises where measles exists. For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 82. * See page 124. † See pages 109, 115 and 116. ‡ See page 98. 63 School Books and Infectious Diseases. The Bermondsey Borough Council called attention to the practice of the London County Council requiring school library books, which have been exposed to infection in cases of dangerous infectious disease, to be returned to the head teacher, who burnt such books. The Medical Officer suggested any such books should be delivered to the Sanitary Authority for destruction, when other infected articles are being collected from the scholar's home for destruction, but the County Council expressed the opinion that its present regulations are satisfactory. The Bermondsey Borough Council made a representation to the London County Council urging that infected school books should be delivered to the Borough Councils for destruction, as suggested by their Medical Officer, and asked that such action be supported. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended— "That the Council concur in the representation made by the Bermondsey Borough Council, and the London County Council be so informed." The London County Council now consents to the destruction by the Metropolitan Borough Councils, where necessary, of school books which have been exposed to infection at private houses. Attendance Medals and Exclusion from Schools. The Public Health and Housing Committee directed a further representation to be made to the London County Council urging reconsideration of the rule under which children excluded from school owing to infectious diseases in their homes are deprived of attendance medals. The Woolwich Borough Council made representations to the London County Council urging that in view of the serious injury occasioned to the health of children attracted by school medals to attend school when ill, and to the difficulty of dealing with the spread of infectious diseases in schools for the same reason, the issue of such medals should be abolished. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the 64 incentive to regular attendance afforded by the medals in question is useful, and that the difficulty could be met by a regulation that absences through illness or in consequence of infectious disease in their homes, duly certified by a medical practitioner, should not disqualify children otherwise entitled to medals. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended— "That the Council concur in this opinion and the London County Council be so informed." Evening Play Centres and Infectious Diseases. Mrs. Humphrey Ward, Chairman of the Committee for Evening Play Centres for children attending Public Elementary Schools, asked that notice of notifications received of infectious diseases might be supplied in order that children from homes where infectious diseases exist might be excluded. The Public Health and Housing Committee authorised that daily lists of cases of infectious diseases be supplied. 65 ALPHABETICAL STREET LIST OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Streets and Places.

Condition of Plant, Improvements, Cost of Plant, Output, Cost of Manufacturing. Balance Sheet and Comparison. The Electrolytic apparatus commenced work in February, 1906. Condition of Plant. The wear and tear has been practically nothing to speak about. The plant after two years is still in good working order, turning out 185 gallons of fluid in 8 hours, at an average strength of 4.5 to 5.0 grammes of chlorine per litre. It has not been necessary to renew any of the zinc electrodes, which from their present condition no doubt can be used for a much further period. To prevent the salt from acting upon the iron, the interior of the large supply tank has been coated over with "Rosbonite," a preparation which answers admirably. The saturators have been treated in a like manner. There has been introduced a very simple arrangement to insure the mixing of the preservative (Hydroxide of Magnesia*) and a large amount of labour is also saved. Cost of Plant, &c. Total cost up to date, 31st January, 1908, of depot, plant, fittings, alterations, painting, testing apparatus, carboys, syphons, &c., £606 18s. 3d. Initial outlay, 1906, was £583 9s. 2d., which shows that £23 9s. 1d. has been expended during the years 1906 and 1907 for carboys, sundry additional apparatus, repairs to depot, new electric light, paint, Rosbonite, and minor details. * See Lancet, 18th, January 1908.

Whilst this Report is being written there is a proposal to open another depot in North Bow, which, if adopted, will increase the wages for issuing and delivering. (On the 2nd April, 1908, upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Council approved of the following arrangement for the distribution of the disinfectant: —Bickmore Street, Poplar, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 12 noon; West Ferry Road (near 79 The sum of £1,009 5s. 8d. shows that upon the initial two years' working of the installation, there has been effected a saving to the Borough of £1,005 18s. 0d., without taking into consideration any saving which may have been brought about through supplying the Works Department with 13,656 gallons of disinfecting fluid for watering roads, flushing gullies, sewer manholes, and market places.* Each cart for conveying away sludge from the street gullies is furnished with a four gallon jar of fluid, and instead of dusting around the gullies carbolic powder, there is sprinkled Electrolytic fluid by means of a small ordinary watering can. £ s. d.

London County Council (General Powers) Acts, 1904 and 1907. During the year 764 persons had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfected. Since the notices were posted throughout the Borough a total of 2,047 persons had applied for baths, etc., as mentioned above. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. Part V. Cleansing of Verminous Persons.

See pages 56-60 as to cases of Diphtheria admitted into Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals which were certified as not having the complaint. No deductions have been made in respect of these patients. The 110 cases in Poplar were notified from 85 premises, the 138 cases in Bromley from 110 premises, and the 110 cases in Bow from 87 houses, and of these premises the drains were found to be defective in 30 instances —15 Poplar, 9 Bromley, and 6 Bow. Proposed Supply of Antitoxin. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the question of the supply of antitoxin to medical practitioners for use in suspected cases of diphtheria pending the reception of reports on the bacteriological examination of swabbings taken from the patients' throats. It had been frequently pointed out to the Committee by the Medical Officer of Health, and also by medical practitioners who had been communicated with in respect of patients removed but afterwards found to be not suffering from diphtheria, that it is very essential that patients should be removed to the hospital as quickly as possible that they may be treated with Diphtheria Antitoxin, and to delay removal, without antitoxin treatment, in order to await the result of the bacteriological examinations, might endanger the lives of patients. The time taken at the Lister Institute for a bacteriological examination averages twelve hours after delivery of the swabbing, and there is, of course, the further delay in the receipt of the swabbings at the Public Health Offices and their despatch to the Lister Institute. Results are telegraphed or telephoned, but if diphtheritic bacilli are found at least a day's delay in removal has probably occurred, and further delay is also caused owing to the fact that no bacteriological examinations are made on Saturday afternoons or Sundays. The Committee were advised that it is an important element in the successful treatment of diphtheria with antitoxin that the injection should be made as early as possible, and that, if there be reasonable suspicion that a case be one of diphtheria, an injection of antitoxin should at once be made. * See page 62. 96 In view of the loss, inconvenience and suffering occasioned by the erroneous notification and removal of patients not suffering from the disease notified, the Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable antitoxin should be supplied, at the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health, for use pending receipt of results of bacteriological examinations in cases where such provision cannot otherwise be made. The Committee were assured no ill results follow from injections of the antitoxin in cases which are subsequently found to be not true cases of diphtheria, and recommended the Council— That the Medical Officer of Health be authorised to supply, at his discretion, diphtheria antitoxin, free of charge, to medical practitioners for use in cases of suspected diphtheria in the Borough, pending receipt of result of bacteriological examinations, or where patients are too ill to be removed. Upon the presentation of the report of the Public Health and Housing Committee containing this recommendation at the meeting of the Council on the 23rd September, an amendment was moved and seconded—To omit all words after the words "That the" in order to insert there these words:— "Council declines to enter into competition on an unfair basis with purveyors of drugs and related preparations, and emphatically refuses to relieve medical practitioners of their natural responsibilities." The amendment was put and declared carried and adopted, also as a substantive motion. WHOOPING-COUGH. Deaths Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

For death rates see Tables XVIII. and XIX., page 47. At the end of the year there were 854 entries in the Measles Register (305 Poplar, 371 Bromley, and 178 Bow), representing the number of premises where Measles had been stated to have occurred. Upon enquiry one case was stated to have recovered, 9 were found not to be cases, 16 were stated to be suffering from a different disease other than the one notified, 6 wrong addresses (empty houses and unknown) were given, and 14 moved away before enquiries could be made. So that practically as far as is known 808 cases of Measles occurred in the Borough. Milkshops. Five cases of Measles occurred in connection with milkshops, four Poplar and one Bromley. Disinfection and Outworkers. 283 rooms were disinfected by the Public Health Department, and the remainder were disinfected by the tenants, medical practitioners giving certificates that disinfection had been satisfactorily carried out. Thirty-two cases removed before a certificate of recovery was received. Respecting outworkers and the articles disinfected by the Council, see pages 62 and 73. SPOTTED FEVER. EPIDEMIC CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS.° Notification Orders, London County Council. A case of the above disease was notified from the Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, in a male aged 9 years, of an address in Stebondale Street. Upon enquiry, it was found that the family had moved on Saturday, the 2nd March, from the address given by the Hospital Authorities; but they were traced to another house in the same street. • Posterior Basal Meningitis is included in the term "Cerebro-Spinal Fever." 99 The patient was quite well during the morning and afternoon of Friday, the 1st March, but became suddenly ill during the evening of that day; was admitted into the Seamen's Hospital on the 2nd March, and died there on Sunday, the 3rd March.* There was no history whatsoever as to the cause of the illness. The specific germ of the fever was found in the fluid taken from the spinal canal. A previous case of Spotted Fever which had occurred in the Borough was reported to the Committee in January and was treated in the London Hospital and had been admitted into that institution in October, 1906. Notification of Cerebro-Spinal Fever. On the 26th February, 1907, the London County Council made an order that Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the notification of infectious disease shall apply in the Administrative County of London for a period of six calendar months to the disease known as Cerebro-Spinal Fever (Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis). The order was confirmed by the Local Government Board, was duly advertised on 5th March, 1907, and in accordance with the Statute came into operation at the expiration of one week from that date. The London County Council made a second order with respect to the notification of this disease for a further period of eighteen calendar months as from and including 13th September, 1907. This order was also confirmed by the Local Government Board. Eleven cases of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis were notified—5 Poplar, 2 Bromley and 4 Bow. Three of the Poplar cases died. (1) Male, 10 months, Newcastle Street, notified 22nd March, admitted East London Children's Hospital 14th March. The germ of the disease was found. (2) Female, 9 months, Leven Road, notified 22nd March, admitted to East London Hospital 21st February. The germ of the disease was found. (3) Female, 5 years, West Ferry Road, notified 3rd April, too ill to be removed, died 7th April and body taken to Wellington Road * This death is included in the present death stati 100 Mortuary. Swabbings were taken from the nose and throat and sent to the Lister Institute, but the germ of the disease was not found. The Cerebro-Spinal fluid was not examined. (4) A case of Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis (Spotted Fever) was notified from the London Hospital on 16th April. The patient, a male aged 4 years, was admitted into the hospital on the 10th April from the Sub-District of Bow. (5) Male, aged 12 years, Bow, notified from London Hospital 15th, admitted 14th May. (6) Female, aged 5½ years, of Bow, notified from the London Hospital and admitted into that institution 16th May. (7) Male, aged 6 months, of Bromley, notified from and admitted into the Children's Hospital, Shadwell, on 22nd May. (8) Male, aged 2 years and 3 months, of Poplar, notified from the London Hospital on the 25th June, admitted into that institution on the 18th June. (9) A case of Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis (Spotted Fever) occurred in a female, aged 4 months, belonging to the Bow Sub-District. The patient was notified from the London Hospital as suffering from the disease on 26th July. She was admitted into the hospital on 25th July, and was stated to have fallen ill on 14th July. The patient died on 27th July. (10) A case of Posterior Basal Meningitis (Spotted Fever), was notified in Bromley in a child aged 4 months. (11) A case of Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis occurred in a male, aged 14 years, residing in Kerbey Street, Poplar. The illness began on 17th December; patient was removed to the Poplar Hospital 23rd December, and died on the 27th December.* * This death is not included in the present death statistics as it was returned to the Medical Officer of Health on the 4th January, 1908. 101 DIARRHŒA* and ENTERITIS.† Deaths from Diarrhoea for the past fifteen years were as follows :— Poplar.

The question of the provision of suitable mortuary accommodation in connection with a coroner's court for the Borough, which has been under consideration during the past 15 years, has now reached a position in which there is every prospect of the present unsatisfactory arrangements being very shortly discarded and a suitable mortuary and coroner's court provided. An agreement has been arrived at for the sale by the Borough Council to the London County Council of a portion of a site in Cottage Street and High Street, Poplar, for the erection of a coroner's court, the remainder of the site being utilised by the Borough Council for provision thereon of a mortuary and post-mortem room. The site was originally acquired by the District Board of Works in 1895 for erection of a coroner's court, mortuary and shelters, the court to be let on lease to the London County Council, but owing to the heavy capital expenditure involved, the inadequate rental offered by the London County Council for the court, and to the fact that other buildings had become available for the holding of the coroner's inquiries, the proposal was abandoned by the first Borough Council. 105 MODEL DWELLINGS, Grosvenor, County Council, and Hanbury Buildings.

Elder girl was said to occupy the forecabin when under way, but was sleeping in the after-cabin with the family when lying alongside, as the father did not care to leave her in the fore-cabin alone while boat was lying at quay. Letter to owner of boat." || Mr. Boyce reports that he visited four non-registered boats twice. WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES* AND OUTWORKERS. (Home Work Order, 23rd May, 1907.) As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 111 and 112. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,356, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 111, and Tables C and D, pages 114 and 115. The places where the outworkers are employed were inspected all of them twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 215 and 216, and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 173, 178, 197 and 207. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 62. A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 114 to 117) in preparing the • See page 163, Factory and Workshop Act, 1907. I 110 report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops, and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. 111 TABLE A.

Want of cleanliness was found in 193 instances, and 72 other defects existed. 145 intimations were served, which in 24 cases were followed up by Statutory notices and one final notice, but no legal proceedings were taken. A register of these premises is kept. See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 173, 184, 189, 196, 205, and 212. Proposed Legislation and Bye-Laws. See page 166, London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, proposed penalties in respect of premises used for sale or preparation of food for sale, and proposed power to make bye-laws for regulating businesses of vendor of fried fish.

Proposed Prohibition of the Sale of Milk on Unsuitable Premises. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 349 registered premises (including 15 cow-houses, 3 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 7 Bow) where milk is sold, 111 Poplar, 143 Bromley and 95 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspectors' reports, pages 172, 178, 184, 189, 197, 204 and 212. 24 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 8 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 11 Bow. 52 Premises were on account of change of owners re-registered as milkshops, 9 Poplar, 28 Bromley and 15 Bow. The sale of milk was discontinued on 38 premises—16 Poplar, 14 Bromley and 8 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 62. Proposed Prohibition of the Sale of Milk on Unsuitable Premises. The Holborn Borough Council called attention to the fact that Borough Councils have no power to refuse to register a milkseller, however unsuiable the premises may be, nor to remove a milkshop from the register if the milkshop subsequently becomes unsuitable, although the milkseller is bound to comply with the regulations as to dairies and milkshops. The Holborn Borough Council had requested the London County Council to insert in its next General Powers Bill provisions to confer powers on the Councils of the Metropolitan Cities and Boroughs to enable them to prohibit the sale of milk on unsuitable premises. The Publio Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable powers should be conferred as proposed, and recommended the Council to support the application of the Holborn Borough Council to the London County Council. † See page 165, London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, " unwholesome milk and registration of milkshops." See also pages 16, 23 and 25, proposed milk depots and tuberculous milk. 125 ICE-CREAMS. About the middle of the year 1907, all the known premises within the Borough where ice creams are manufactured were inspected. There are 130 such premises within the Borough, 50 Poplar, 54 Bromley and 26 Bow. (See Table A, page 111.) See Inspectors' reports, pages 172, 178, 190, 200, 205 and 212. SMOKE NUISANCES. Motok Omnibuses. 102 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year—43 Bow East, 6 Bow West, 12 North Bromley, 10 Bromley Central, 5 East combined, 11 West combined, and 15 Poplar South. 56 intimations and 48 statutory notices were served. Summonses were applied for in six instances, see pages 159, 160 and 161. Motor Omnibuses. The Camberwell Borough Council called attention to the reversal on appeal of a conviction obtained at the Police Court, of an Omnibus Company, for using a motor omnibus which did not, as far as practicable, consume its own smoke. The Magistrate found that the cause of the smoke was not accidental, but was due to the neglect of the driver. The Court held that the nuisance not being due to constructional defect, the section of the Act under which proceedings were taken did not apply. The matter was submitted to the Local Government Board, and the Board requested to take action dealing with the nuisance caused by smoke emanations from motor omnibuses, and the Poplar Borough Council was asked to support this request. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to support application of the Camberwell Borough Council to the Local Government Board. K 126 FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS Result of Analyses. Legal Proceedings. Butter and Maegabine Act, 1907. Preservatives in Butter.

Six samples (117 per cent.) were found to be adulterated, and legal proceedings were instituted against the vendors. 26 samples were taken on delivery at institutions within the Borough — viz., 6 Poplar Workhouse, 6 Sick Asylum, 5 Blackwall Sick Asylum, 7 Stepney Union Workhouse and 2 Poplar Hospital. All the samples were genuine. †Three of the 124 samples were returned by the Public Analyst as containing 87.5 per cent., 81.5 per cent. and 83.3 per cent. of foreign fat 127 respectively, and the vendors were summoned for delivering margarine in improperly marked paper wrappers.

Milk 9 Butter 7* Margarine (not delivered in properly marked wrapper) 1 Demerara Sugar 1 Coffee 1 Malt Vinegar 1 20 The Public Analyst reported that during the year he had analysed 372† samples; 27 or nearly 7.3 per cent. were found to be adulterated. This compares with 7 per cent. for 1906, practically the same result. The following table shows the percentage of all adulterated samples found in the several years named:— 1890 12.6 1891 14.4 1892 18.9 1893 20.5 1894 20.6 1895 22.1 1896 12.4 1897 14.2 1898 14.6 1899 9.2 1900 7.6 * See page 129. † Three of these 372 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst by private purchasers, who each paid the statutory fee of 10s. 6d. for the analysis. The three samples from private persons were Butter, Lemonade and Ginger Beer. The Butter was adulterated with 316 per cent. of foreign fat and contained 0.15 per cent. of Boric Acid. The Lemonade and Ginger Beer were both genuine in every respect. 128 1901 9.1 1902 15.4 1903 8.2 1904 7.2 1905 8.8 1906 7.0 1907 7.3 Legal Proceedings.

Vendor cautioned. Milk, deficient in solids, not fat, to the extent of 1.7 per cent. Vendor cautioned. Butter, contained 2 per cent. excessive water and 03 per cent. boric acid. Vendor cautioned. Margarine, containing 1.7 per cent. excessive water. Vendor cautioned. * The Inspector, Mr. Miners, reported that in the case against the vendor o "yellow crystals," Sample No. 474, certified by the Public Analyst to be" beet sugar superficially coloured with a yellow coal-tar dye and therefore not Demerara sugar," which had been sold to the prejudice of purchaser instead of Demerara sugar, had resulted in no summons being issued against the proprietor of the business, in consequence of his private address not being obtainable, although every possible means had been adopted as directed by the Council's Solicitor, both to interview him and to obtain the necessary information. The business itself (one of three branches) was carried on under the term of "company," but there was reason to believe that this "company " consisted only of one person, and whose name was given the Inspector by the saleswoman as the owner. A summons had been applied for and issued against this saleswoman, who actually sold the sample over the counter, but she moved before the service to an unknown address, the summons had in consequence not been served. 132 Camphorated Oil, deficient in camphor to the extent of 10 per cent. by weight. Vendor cautioned. Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine, deficient in ammonia to the extent of 13.5 per cent. Vendor communicated with. Whisky adulterated with 2.4 per cent. water, or being 18° under proof below the statutory minimum strength. Vendor cautioned, as notice was exhibited on his premises, but it was in such a situation that it could not be distinctly seen by customers. Since the purchase of the sample another notice has been exhibited. In the letter of caution the Public Health and Housing Committee directed that the vendor be informed that if he relied upon these notices for the sale of spirits they must be placed in such a position as to be distinctly seen by all bis customers, otherwise legal proceedings would be instituted against him if another adulterated sample was procured from his premises. Preservatives. In 44 samples of Butter out of a total of 121 samples preservatives were found as under:— Boric acid 0 26%; 0.5%; 0.2%; 0.18%; 0.5%; 0.25%; 0.18%; 0.1%; 0.2%; 0.18%; 0.25%; 0.49%; 0.2%; 0.25%; 0.3%; 0.25%; 0.25%; 0.2%; 0.25%; 0.2%; 0.2%; 0.18%; 0.2%; 0.2%; 0.4%; 0.1%; 0.2%; 0.25%; 0.3%; 0.3%; 0.25%; 0.3%; 0.2%; 0.2%; 0.3%; 0.25%; 0.18%; 0.3%; 0.2%; 0.3%; 0.1%; 0.3%; 0.3% and 0.3%.

HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR TO MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. Bow Common Lane Area. Proposed appointment of additional Inspector. Legal Proceedings. Bow Common Lane Area. The Public Health and Housing Committee reported to the Council on the 15th May that the Committee had considered the suggestion made to the Council that a house-to-house inspection should be made of the dwelling houses between Weston Street and Bow Common Lane. The houses in question are registered under the bye-laws relating to houses let in lodgings, and are under constant inspection. It had been previously reported that it was not at present practicable to deal with the area as an insanitary area under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. It was also reported to the Council that the Medical Officer of Health had arranged for an additional special inspection of the houses to be made. On the 12th July I presented a report under date the 22nd June to the Public Health and Housing Committee respecting an inspection of the 134 area in Bow Common Lane, commonly known as the "Barracks," which comprises Gale Street, Box Street, Eastward Street, Hawgood Street and Furze Street. The report embodied a report of Mr. Langley, the Inspector of the district, and a list of the cases of infectious diseases which had occurred in the streets named during the years 1905 and 1907, and also a list of Police Court proceedings. The report was accompanied by a detailed report of work executed under the bye-laws by Mr. Wm. Johnson, the Inspector of houses let in lodgings. The Public Health and Housing Committee reported to the Council on the 25th July that the area in question would be kept under constant inspection, and proceedings taken from time to time as might be necessary. The Committee were satisfied it was not then possible for action to be taken for the adoption of a scheme under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. Proposed Appointment of Additional Inspector. The Public Health and Housing Committee had under consideration the question of the administration of the Council's Bye-laws relating to Houses Let in Lodgings, and of the clauses of the London County Council (General Powers) Act relating to verminous houses. The Committee reported to the Council on the 5th September that the number of houses registered is more than sufficient to occupy the attention of the present Inspector, and they were of opinion the time had arrived for the appointment of an additional Inspector in order that more effective supervision might be given with regard to cleanliness, air space, etc., in the large number of houses in the Borough occupied by members of more than one family. The officer appointed should possess the sanitary certificate required by the Local Government Board for a Sanitary Inspector. The Council's scale of salaries for such officer is £130 rising to £195, one half of which is repayable by the London County Council. The Committee recommended the Council— "That, subject to the consent of the Local Government Board, an additional Sanitary Inspector, for Houses Let in Lodgings, be appointed at a salary of £130 rising by six annual increments of £10 and one of £5 to £195 per annum ; that advertisements be issued inviting applications for the position and that such applications shall stand referred to your Committee to select and submit candidates to the Council." 135 This recommendation was withdrawn at the meeting of the Council. The Committee on the 20th September again considered their proposal, submitted to the Council on the 5th September and withdrawn, that an additional Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings should be appointed. A report on the matter under date 11th September had been submitted by me to the Committee. The report dealt fully with the enforcement of the bye-laws and the past and present work of the Inspector. The following are extracts from the report:— "The cleansing of verminous rooms was rightly added to the duties of the Inspector on 5th October, 1905, and when notices for cleansing are served and the premises are found to be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed, followed by a statutory notice under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, if necessary." "There are over 22,000 houses in the Borough, out of which 960 are on the Register as Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, and these premises are scattered all over the Borough. It is, therefore, impossible for one man to undertake the inspection of any further houses. Every year more houses in the Borough become occupied by two or more families." " There are seven Sanitary Inspectors, whose duty it is to inspect premises for structural defects, workshops and workplaces, places where food is prepared, canal boats, market places, slaughterhouses, cowsheds and milkshops, dairies, &c., places where ice cream is stored and manufactured, visiting houses where cases of infectious diseases occur, to deal with smoke nuisances, and to procure samples under the various Food and Drugs Acts. The results of the inspections are entered by the Inspectors in their note books, whence a Clerk enters them into the Journals for the respective districts." "In a district with a population of 170,000, and containing over 22,000 houses, the Sanitary Inspectors cannot carry out the duties under the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, in addition to those set out above. Counting seven Inspectors to 22,000 houses, each will have an average of over 3,000 houses to inspect, and it has been stated again and again that no Inspector should have more than 2,500 contiguous houses to deal with." 136 "I must again repeat what I have so often pointed out when it has been stated that more inspections could be made, viz.:—that whenever an inspection takes place, to secure the abatement of a nuisance it may ultimately be necessary to bring the circumstances of the case before a Court of Summary Jurisdiction, and all entries in note books, journals, and the serving of notices and necessary documents, must therefore be carefully executed in the manner prescribed by law. I think it speaks well for the Department that for the past 15 years no summons has been dismissed except upon a legal technicality or as to whether the Owner or the Local Authority was liable." "The clerical work of the Inspector for Houses let in Lodgings cannot be carried out by a Clerk, as the Inspector must enter up his register and write out the necessary documents himself. The following is an outline of what clerical work is necessary when a house is placed on the Register and when various clauses of the bye-laws have to be enforced." "And I would here point out that in the carrying out of the whole clerical work, including writing of Notices, Intimations, &c., no assistance whatever is received from the Clerical Staff of the Department as is the case with the District Inspectors, and, moreover, it would be impossible with the present Clerical Staff to afford any such assistance. I would further mention that in enforcing these Bye-laws no assistance whatever is rendered by the Inspectors' Labourers." "The abatement of overcrowding and making responsible persons keep premises clean and free from vermin are essentially among the most important duties of a Sanitary Authority." I unhesitatingly suggested for the consideration of the Committee that another Inspector should be appointed to enforce the bye-laws for Houses Let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family and that the Borough should be split into two divisions, north and south, allowing the the Limehouse Cut to be the dividing line. The Public Health and Housing Committee reported to the Council on the 3rd October that they were now of opinion the proposed appointment of an additional Inspector is inexpedient, and recommended the Council that no action be taken in the matter. The Council resolved that this recommendation be referred back to the Committee. 137 On the 31st October the Committee reported to the Council that they had again considered the reference back to them of their recommendation that no action should be taken on the proposal that an additional Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings should be appointed for the Borough, and they did not agree that it was desirable such appointment should be made. Upon the reception of the Public Health and Housing Committee's report an amendment was moved and seconded to add: "and that it be referred to the Public Health and Housing Committee to reconsider the question of the desirability of the appointment of an additional Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings, with instruction to submit an estimate of the cost to the Borough of the appointment of such officer." A division having been claimed and supported, the Council divided, when there appeared for the amendment 17, and against the amendment 24. The amendment was declared not carried. Another amendment was moved and seconded to add: "and that it be an instruction to the Publio Health and Housing Committee to appoint the present Inspectors as Inspectors of Houses Let in Lodgings in addition to their present duties." A division having been claimed and supported, the Council divided, when there appeared for the amendment 18, against the amendment 20. Amendment declared not carried. Legal Proceedings. Two landlords were summoned for not, within a period of 14 days after being required by a notice in writing signed by the Town Clerk, supplying the information necessary for the Registration of LodgingHouses. A penalty of £2, with 23s. costs, was inflicted in one instance; in the other case the information was received after issue of summons, which was withdrawn upon payment of £2 4s. costs. For inspector's report see pages 217-220. 138 HOUSING. Accommodation for Persons Displaced (Educational Purposes). International Housing Conference Gandy Court Area. No representations were made under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. Accommodation for Persons Displaced. The London County Council applied to the Local Government Board to decide that a scheme was not necessary for providing new dwellings to accommodate persons to be displaced in connection with the acquisition of property in Bruce Road, Bromley—and property in other Boroughs— over which compulsory powers were obtained for educational purposes in the Sessions of 1904 and 1905. The persons to be displaced in Bruce Road number 79, the rooms to be demolished number 62, and the Council had ascertained there were 101 rooms vacant within a radius of a quarter of a mile, that the accommodation was as good as, and in some cases better than, that proposed to be destroyed, and that the persons to be displaced could obtain similar accommodation in the immediate neighbourhood at the same rents as they at present pay. It was further urged that the London County Council had already provided dwellings containing accommodation which had not been allocated to fulfil any obligations. The proposal of the London County Council had been submitted by the Local Government Board for the observations of the Borough Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it was not necessary for the London County Council to make special provision for the persons to be displaced in Bruce Road, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the Local Government Board be so informed. International Housing Congress. The International Housing Congress was held in London from 4th to 7th August, 1907. Mr. Councillor A. H. Darby, Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, Mr. Councillor A. E. Hunt and the Medical Officer of Health were appointed to attend the Conference. Gandy Court Area. The houses in Gandy Court area, which were represented as forming an "unhealthy area" under Part 1 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, in July, 1904, were dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with the following results:— Nos. 1 to 5, Gandy Court (two storey brick houses), thoroughly overhauled and put into habitable condition; floors taken up and surface of ground concreted beneath; under-floor ventilation carried right through from back to front; drains reconstructed, intercepted and ventilated; external walls pointed; back additions, where defective, pulled down and reconstructed; ceilings renewed; walls stripped and cleansed; floorings repaired and in some cases renewed; staircases repaired and underpinned; and trimmer arches reconstructed. Nos. 8, 9 and 10, Gandy Court (brick structures with wooden back additions) have undergone thorough repair. Nos. 8 and 9 were greatly improved, the back additions were rebuilt in brick, yards enlarged, additional w.c. provided, and drainage reconstructed. Nos. 216 and 218, Bow Road also underwent thorough repair. Nos. 6 and 7, Gandy Court (wooden structures) were demolished. The leases of the whole of these premises had expired and reverted to the freeholder, who undertook the necessary repairs and improvements. 139 BROWNING HALL CONFERENCE ON HOUSING-TRAFFIC BOARD. GARDEN CITY ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE-HOUSING REFORM AND TOWN PLANNING.* Traffic Board. Together with Mr. Councillor A. G. Smith, I attended the Browning Hall Conference on Housing, held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, April 24th, 1907, when the two following Resolutions were passed — First Resolution—Moved by Right Hon. Lord Ribblesdale, Seconded by Right Rev. Lord Bishop of Southwark— "That this Conference of representatives of the City Corporation, County Councils, Borough Councils and other local authorities within the area of Greater London, calls upon His Majesty's Government to appoint forthwith a Traffic Board on the lines laid down by the Royal Commission on London Traffic." Second Resolution—Moved by Alderman Thompson, Seconded by Right Hon. Charles Booth— "That this Conference is of opinion that the present haphazard and unsatisfactory manner in which new districts are being now developed can be largely remedied if it be laid down as one of the duties of the Traffic Board to take the necessary steps for advising upon intelligent and comprehensive schemes of Town Planning." * Whilst this report is being written a Bill on Housing, Town Planning, etc. has been presented to the House of Commons by Mr. Burns, supported by the Attorney General, The Lord Advocate and Dr. Maenamara. The Bill is to amend the Law relating to the Housing of the Working Classes, to provide for the making of Town planning schemes and to make further provision with respect to the appointment of County Medical Officers of Health. 140 141 The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the resolutions of the Browning Hall Conference on Housing, and recommended the Council that the resolutions of the Conference urging the establishment of a Traffic Board for Greater London, with advisory powers in respect of town planning, be approved. Respecting this Browning Hall Conference on Housing, the General Purposes Committee of the London County Council, at 4 p.m., on Monday, July 1st, received a deputation on " Traffic Board," and as one of the delegates at the Conference held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, on April 24th, I attended the deputation. The spokesmen of the deputation were the Bight Hon. Charles Booth, Sir David Barbour, Chairman of the late Royal Commission on London Traffic, Lord Ribblesdale, member of the said Commission, and Sir J. Dickson-Poynder, member of the Commission. Letters were read from the Archbishop of Westminster, the Bishop of London, and the Bishop of Southwark. Mr. Booth stated that Lord Loreburn's views were in accord with those of the deputation, and that Mr. Balfour had written him a letter approving their ends. Since the deputation was arranged, the President of the Board of Trade, on Saturday, June 22nd, said:— "Surprise has been expressed that the recommendations of the Royal Commission on London Traffic had not been carried out. But he told them that the Government were considering the matter, with a view to action, and probably, immediate action. They were alive, not merely to the importance, but to the urgency of the question. Something would have to be done in order to co-ordinate all the means of coping with the traffic difficulty of London." Housing Refokm and Town Planning. The following resolution was adopted at a Conference convened by the Garden City Association in October last, viz.:— "That this meeting of Municipal and Local Authorities and Societies and others interested in Housing Reform and Town Planning affirms its belief that the present planless and haphazard extension of towns is detrimental to the best interests of the nation, inasmuch as, by the creation of new slums and overcrowding, it produces mental, moral and physical degeneration, and is also burdensome to the ratepayers; it therefore calls upon all parties to l 142 welcome the Government's promise of legislation upon the matter. This meeting urges, also, the great advantages which would result if, wherever possible, a belt of agricultural land could be retained around or in the neighbourhood of any new suburb or town which may be built, to relieve the congestion of the urban population. It would further urge the importance of dealing with the problem of Rural Housing." The Executive Committee of the Association forwarded the resolution to all Local Authorities in the Country, and suggested the adoption of similar resolutions and asked for observations as to local conditions or requirements. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the resolution of the Conference be approved. WATER CERTIFICATES. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—Two iron school-buildings, Dingle Lane, and the buildings in Dolphin Lane ; the caretakers' rooms and offices, Messrs. Glickstein & Co., Wansbeck Road ; 1a to 4a, East Ferry Road; 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 and 27, Blondin Street; and 5a to 8a, East Ferry Road. SEWERAGE, DRAINAGE AND SEWER VENTILATION. Ship Street, Grove Hall Estate, Lee Towing Path (Sun Flour Mills, etc.), Manholes Wellington Road, Providence Place Scheme, Abolition of Sewer (Messrs. C. & R. Morton), Bow Common Lane Sewer, Reconstruction of Sewer (Mellish's and Burney's Wharves), Floodings Union Street, Flooding Clearing Deposits, Appeal to the London County Council. In the memorandum issued by the Local Government Board to the Medical Officers of Health respecting their Annual Reports, it is stated 143 that the Local Government Board desired to obtain, through the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, information of particular changes of condition that occur by the action of the Local Authority, and one of the subject matters which is required to be reported upon is the condition of sewer and house drains. Ship Steeet. The Public Health and Housing Committee had represented to them the desirability of the reconstruction of a length of sewer in Ship Street at a lower depth, in order to provide a more adequate fall to the Manchester Road Sewer for the drainage of a number of houses in Manchester Road and Ship Street connected to the existing Ship Street sewer. The drains had been repeatedly obstructed and required reconstruction by the owners. It was considered desirable the portion of sewer referred to should be lowered before the drains were relaid in order to provide for more efficient drainage. The Works Committee recommended the Council— That a length of 110 feet of Ship Street sewer be lowered and reconstructed in 12in. pipes. Grove Hall Estate. The Works Committee approved an amended plan, submitted by the owners, for construction of new sewers on the Grove Hall Estate. Lea Towing Path (Sun Flour Mills, etc.).* The Works Committee reported to the Council that they had considered a representation from the Public Health and Housing Committee, proposing the construction of a new sewer in the Lea towing path to take the drainage of Bromley Lock Cottages, Sun Flour Mills, and the Three Mills Distillery, which drainage at present runs into the River Lea. Manholes, Wellington Road. The Works Committee reported to the Council that they had considered a proposal by the Borough Surveyor for construction of five manholes to the * Whilst this report is being written the work is being executed by the Borough Surveyor. 144 Wellington Road sewer. The sewer has only a small fall, and complaints had been received of the flooding of houses in the road owing to surcharge of the sewer on several occasions. The Borough Surveyor considered it was important that access should be provided to the sewer in order that the sewer might be kept properly cleansed. The Works Committee recommended— That five manholes be constructed, by the Borough Surveyor, to the Wellington Road sewer. Providence Place Scheme. The Providence Place Scheme, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, provided that the portion of Union Street included in the scheme should be widened on its west side and extended to Woolmore Street. The Housing Committee of the London County Council suggested that the necessary work should be carried out by the Borough Council. The Works Committee approved the submission of a tender by the Borough Surveyor for paving works and for sewer construction, which was accepted by the London County Council, and the Works Committee recommended that the work be carried out by the Borough Surveyor. Abolition of Sewer (Messrs. C. & A. Morton). Messrs. C. & A. Morton were making considerable additions to their premises (Riverside) on the west side of West Perry Road, and it was considered by the Borough Surveyor a fitting opportunity for the demolition of an old sewer belonging to the Council which ran through the premises, and which had long been the subject of complaint by them owing to its condition, as well as being the source of considerable expense to the Council in maintenance and cleansing. Negotiations were carried out by the Borough Surveyor with Messrs. Morton, with the result that they were prepared to demolish the existing defective sewer and reconstruct the drainage system upon their premises, in accordance with a plan submitted; also to take over the entire ownership of the system and that already reconstructed by the Council on their premises on the east side of West Perry Road, thereby relieving the Council of all subsequent expense and obligation in regard thereto, subject to certain conditions, upon completion of the work to the satisfaction of the Borough Surveyor. The Works Committee approved the demolition of the old sewer on the premises of Messrs. Morton on the west side of West Ferry Road, 145 under a scheme recommended by the Borough Surveyor to the Public Health and Housing Committee for reconstruction on improved lines by Messrs. Morton. Bow Common Lane Sewer. The Borough Surveyor reported to the Works Committee the subsidence of a sewer in Bow Common Lane, near its junction with Devons Boad, and the formation of large cavities under the street as the result of the percolation of sewage and surface water. The sewer was constructed in 1867, and a 4-foot gas main was subsequently constructed immediately above the sewer. Premises in the neighbourhood have been flooded in consequence of the breakage. The clearance of the sewer was a work of much difficulty. The work of repairing the sewer was carried out by the Borough Surveyor. Reconstruction of Sewer, Mellish's and Burney's Wharves. The Borough Surveyor reported to the Works Committee that complaints had been made as to the condition of an old brick barrel sewer lying inside the building line of Mellish's and Burney's Wharves, West Ferry Boad. The barrel had been formed on the site of an open ditch, and its position made the work of examination and cleansing exceptionally arduous. It was also found that the original flow of the sewer was southwards, but, when the Millwall Dock was constructed the end of the sewer nearest the dock entrance had been blocked up and the other end connected to the London County Council sewer, without regard to the fact that the gradient was the reverse way. Consequently an accumulation of filth had gradually filled up the barrel. A line of 9in. pipes was laid by the Borough Surveyor in the barrel, after clearing it out, with a proper gradient southwards and new connections to the London County Council sewer. Floodings, Union Street, Poplar. Complaints had been received at various times of floodings of the basements of houses in Union Street, Poplar, due to the insufficient depth of the sewer. In the extended portion of Union Street a new sewer had been laid by the Borough Surveyor for the London County Council, and it was proposed by the Borough Surveyor that the sewer between East India Dock Boad and Ashton Street should be reconstructed at a lower level and connected to the new sewer. The Works Committee recommended the Council, upon the suggestion of the Borough Surveyor, 146 that the sewer in Union Street between East India Dock Road and Ashton Street be reconstructed in 9in. pipes. Flooding, Clearing Deposits. The Public Health and Housing Committee had under consideration various complaints of flooding of dwelling-houses after heavy rains, and while no liability on the part of the Council could be admitted, the Committee were of opinion it is desirable in the interests of public health that, in cases where it is considered necessary by the Medical Officer of Health, the Borough Surveyor should, without prejudice, clear away deposits in houses resulting from such flood ings and disinfect the premises, and the Committee directed accordingly. The Council approved the action of the Committee. Appeal to the London County Council. The Architect of an important public building designed and had constructed two manhole chambers with channels made of Portland cement instead of the usual glazed channels. The Medical Officer of Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Marylebone declined to pass the same, considering that the said channels were not in accordance with the bye-laws. The Architect argued they were equally efficient, and on the Public Health Committee confirming the action of their officer, appealed to the London County Council. The appeal was dismissed. The case therefore must be taken as a precedent, and it will not be prudent for builders and architects in the Metropolis to attempt to make such channels in cement. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Reconstruction by Council—Conference of Representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils—Proposed Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises, either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order:—144.-152, Roman Road; 146-156, Manchester Road and 3-15, Newcastle Street; 181, 183, West Ferry Road; 15-21, Alfred Street; 35-73, Donald Street; 72-74, Bath Street; 186, High 147 Street, Poplar; 86-94, Wyke Road; 38-41, Sussex Street; 2-10, Mary Place and 36, Yesey Street; 16-26, Devas Street; 19-24, Franklin Street; 51-59, Empson Street and 1, 3 and 5, Colin Street; 1 and 2, Andrew Street and 86-88, St. Leonard's Road; 90-92, St. Leonard's Road and 1a, Andrew Street: 130-132, Canton Street; 210a, Bow Road; 1 and 2, Harley Street and 3 and 4, Harley Street; and 61-63, Canton Street. The owner of Nos. 75 to 101, Empson Street was willing to carry out the reconstruction of the Combined Drainage System of those premises at his own cost, in order that the Council should not exercise any right to restrict building over such system. The Public Health and Housing Committee approved plan of the proposed re-drainage, and recommended the Council that the Seal of the Council be affixed to an Order for the drainage of Nos. 75 to 101, Empson Street, by a combined operation in accordance with the plan submitted. Conference of Representatives of the City and Metropolitan Boruugh Councils. Together with Mr. Councillor Darby, Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, and Mr. Councillor Foxon, I attended a Conference of Representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils on the subject of the unsatisfactory state of the law relating to Combined Drainage, held at the Town Hall, St. Pancras, on Monday, the 24th June, 1907, when the following resolutions were unanimously carried, viz. :— (1) That every effort should be made by the Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities to relieve the ratepayers from the heavy, inequitable and accumulating burden of the maintenance of combined drains originally laid as drains and not approved as sewers ; and (2) That it be referred to a Committee of this Conference to prepare for presentation to the President of the Local Government Board a Petition or Draft Bill dealing with the law relating to combined drainage; and thereupon a Committee of eleven Representatives was appointed. Also, it was unanimously resolved— "That a copy of the Minutes of the Proceedings of this Conference be forwarded to each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils and to the Press." 148 After discussion, the following motion was withdrawn by permission of the Conference:— "That the definition of drain in the Metropolis Management Acts should be made to include any drain which has not been approved as a sewer by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, or by the Metropolitan Board of Works, or by the London County Council." Together with Mr. Councillor A. H. Darby, Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, and the Borough Surveyor, I attended on the 6th December, 1907, at the Town Hall, St. Pancras, an adjourned Conference of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils in regard to a Draft Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to "sewers" or "drains," the draft clause, which was unanimously agreed upon, being as follows:— "In and for the purposes of the Metropolis Mangement Acts, 1855 to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act or Acts amending the same, the word 'drain' shall be deemed to include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, with which two or more houses or premises are at the date of the passing of this Act or may at any time thereafter, be connected or which is used, or capable of being or intended to be used, for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses or buildings directly or indirectly to any sewer which has been approved as such by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the London County Council, but shall not include any sewer so approved as aforesaid." Proposed Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. The General Purposes Committee considered a Bill entitled the Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill, dealing with the question of liability for maintenance of combined drainage, approved by a Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, proposed to be introduced in the next Session of Parliament. Clause I. of the Bill defines the word "drain" (a drain being maintainable by the owners thereof) as follows:— "In and for the purpose of the Metroplis Management Acts, 1855 to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act or Acts amending the same, the word 'drain' shall be deemed to include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the 149 passing of this Act, with which two or more houses or premises are at the date of the passing of this Act or may at any time thereafter, be connected, or which is used, or capable of being or intended to be used, for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses or buildings directly or indirectly to any sewer which has been approved as such by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the London County Council, but shall not include any sewer so approved as aforesaid." The Public Health and Housing Committee suggested the Bill should be supported by the Council. The cost to the Council of re-construction of Combined Drainage in the Borough exceeds £1,100 per annum. The General Purposes Committee were of opinion every effort should be made to secure the passage of the Bill, and recommended the Council that the Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill be approved and supported, and that the members representing the Borough in Parliament be urged to support the Bill, and to take all possible steps to secure its adoption by Parliament. PORT OF LONDON Application for Increased Powers. Local Government Board Inquiry—Conference of Authorities at Bermondsey. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the following communication from the Local Government Board, together with a request of the London County Council to be informed of the Borough Council's views as to the proposal to confer on the Port Sanitary Authority certain powers of a Sanitary Authority under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 24th July, 1907. Sir,—I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that the Port of London Sanitary Authority have applied to the Board for the issue of an Order under Section 112 of the Public 150 Health (London) Act, 1891, assigning to them the powers of a Sanitary Authority under Section 16, Sub-sections (1) (b) (c) (d), (2) and (3), and Sections 17, 18, 19, 37 (omitting Sub-section 5), 38, 39 and 49 of the Act; and I am to inform you that, before deciding upon this application, the Board will direct a Local Inquiry to be held on the subject by one of their Inspectors. The Inquiry will take place as soon as the other engagements of the Inspectors will permit, and due notice of it will be given. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Town Clerk, JOHN LITHIBY, Poplar, E. Assistant Secretary. Clause 16 (1) (b), (c), (d) enables Local Sanitary Authorities to make and enforce bye-laws for preventing nuisances arising from any offensive matter running out of any manufactory, brewery, slaughter-house, dunghill, etc., into any uncovered place; for prevention of the keeping of animals so as to constitute a nuisance; and for paving yards and open spaces in connection with dwelling houses. Sub-sec. 2 enables the County Council to make bye-laws prescribing the time for removal of offensive matter, and for suitable vessels for its removal; also with regard to filling up of cesspools, and for the removal and disposal of refuse. Sub-sec. 3 provides that the Sanitary Authorities shall enforce the bye-laws. Clause 17 forbids the keeping of swine so as to cause a nuisance. Clause 18 provides for prohibition order for keeping animals in any locality or premises proved to be unfit. Clause 19 prohibits the establishment anew of certain offensive businesses, without the consent of the London County Council, and enables the County Council to make bye-laws for conduct of such businesses already established. Clause 37 contains regulations as to construction of w.c's. (Subsec. 5, proposed not to be applied, provides for appeal to the County Council by any person aggrieved.) 151 Clause 38 provides for proper sanitary conveniences in factories and workshops. Clause 39 enables the County Council to make bye-laws with respect to w.c's., ashpits, receptacles for dung, etc., and enables Local Sanitary Authorities to make bye-laws with respect to proper water supply to w.c's. Clause 49 provides for notice to the Sanitary Authority of the cutting off of water supply to any dwelling house. The Sections of the Public Health (London) Act relative to powers of the Sanitary Authority not conferred on the Port Authority are enforceable by the Borough Councils, but bye-laws made under the several sections mentioned are not applicable to the area of the Port Sanitary Authority, unless specially applied thereto by an Order of the Local Government Board. The London County Council asked for the views of the Borough Council with regard to the proposals. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion that it was undesirable that the Port Sanitary Authority should make bye-laws under the Public Health (London) Act, but that the bye-laws in force in the sanitary areas in which the several portions of the Port area are situate, should be extended to the Port and enforced by the Port Sanitary Authority. The Committee thought the other Sections referred to should be enforced by the Port Sanitary Authority within its area as proposed. The Committee recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the London County Council be so informed. The Bermondsey Borough Council convened a Conference of the Authorities affected by the proposed extension of powers of the Port Sanitary Authority. The Council appointed Mr. Councillor E. Brown and Mr. Councillor A. H. Warren, together with the Town Clerk and Medical Officer, to attend the Conference. On the 29th October, together with the Town Clerk, I attended at the Guildhall, and gave evidence at the Local Government Board Inquiry into the application of the Port Sanitary Authority for transfer to that authority of certain additional powers under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 152 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Verminous Rooms* and Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the " Intimations " which are followed, if necessary, by " Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. The above procedure saves a large amount of time, as under the London County Council (General Powers') Act a certificate must be given by the Medical Officer of Health, who would have to inspect every room. During the year 212 rooms have been cleansed of vermin :— Poplar South Division 2 West Combined Division 29 East Combined Division 10 Bromley Central Division 15 Bromley North Division 30 Bow West Division 8 Bow East Division 23 Houses let in lodgings 95 Two summons were taken out against owners. In one instance the • For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons see page 80. 153 work was done before date of hearing, the summons was withdrawn, two guineas costs being paid; in the other case the magistrate gave 23s. costs. Licensed Premises' Urinals. Four notices were served under Section 22 calling upon the owners to provide proper doors to the urinals attached to their licensed premises. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1. Cap. 8, Sect. 26 (2) REVENUE ACT, 1903. 3 Edw. 7, Cap. 46. Application was made for relief under the above Acts in respect of six premises in Poplar. The premises were inspected and considered in four instances as not providing separate dwellings with suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting them, with due provision for their sanitary arrangements, and in two instances the premises were not provided with proper sanitary requirements. The certificates were not granted and the reasons for not doing so were detailed to the applicant. 154 TENEMENT HOUSES WATER SUPPLY.* London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907. 7 Edw. 7, ch. clxxv. 78. For the purpose of Section 48 (provision as to house without proper water supply) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, a tenement house shall be deemed to be a house without a proper and sufficient supply of water unless there shall be provided on the storey or one of the storeys in which the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of each family occupying such house are situate a sufficient provision for the supply of water for domestic purposes: Provided that with respect to any building existing and in use as a tenement house at the passing of this Act this section shall not (a) come into operation until the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and eight, or (b) apply where the storey or storeys on which a proper and sufficient supply of water is not provided is or are a storey or storeys (i.) constructed at a height exceeding that to which the Metropolitan "Water Board may for the time being be required to furnish a supply of water for domestic purposes, and (ii.) to which a supply of water for such purposes is not at the passing of this Act being furnished by the said Board by agreement: Provided, also, that this section shall not apply to any tenement house in respect of which it can be shown that any such provision for the supply of water as aforesaid is not reasonably necessary. * See page (166) London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, proposed cooking accommodation in tenement houses. 155 SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION, OVERCROWDING, &C., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Employment ok Registered Plumbers, Paving of Foot and Carriageways. In five cases where w.c. pans and traps were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders were written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings would be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work has been found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. For fixing in pan and trap without giving the proper notice legal proceedings were instituted in one instance. The magistrate gave 23s. costs. In 1904 the journals of the Sanitary Inspectors were examined from the date of the coming into operation of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and lists were compiled (which involved a large amount of work) of houses not inspected, and also those inspected with the number of inspections made. Lists of houses not inspected were given to the Inspectors with instructions to inspect such premises as soon as possible. The inspection of these premises is now being completed.* The inspections have taken a long time as many defective drainage systems had been discovered, which had to be rectified before furthur inspections were made and fresh drainage work created. See Inspector's Report, page 194. * Early in the year 1908 the inspections will be completed, the outstanding districts being Bromley North Division and West Combined Division. 156 List of Sanitary Works carried out in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, from January lst, 1907, to December 31st, 1907.* Poplar South.

Overcrowding. Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting nine cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 32 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 41 of overcrowding abated; 4 cases of overcrowding were abated in workrooms (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 216); 127 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, page 218). Legal proceedings were instituted in one instance, see page 160. General. 9,278 communications were received, and 794 complaints (including 102 smoke) as to nuisances were made. Employment of Registered Plumbers. The Worshipful Company of Plumbers forwarded a list of registered Plumbers and asked for the Council's sympathy and assistance in encouraging, where possible, the preference of employment of Registered Plumbers on works carried out by the Council, or under its regulations. The registration of plumbers, after examination, is a guarantee of efficiency, and in view of the fact that defective plumbing work is usually detected only when serious results have ensued, the Public Health and Housing Committee considered the employment of registered plumbers should be encouraged. The Committee were informed there are no difficulties in the way of competent plumbers securing registration, and recommended the Council that registered plumbers only be, as far as practicable, employed on plumbing work executed for the Council. Paving of Foot and Carriageways. Notices were duly served under Section 100 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, upon the owners of the property abutting upon the private portion of Dingle Lane to sufficiently pave and drain the surface of the highway. The statutory period having elapsed and the work not having been carried out, the Borough Surveyor did the necessary work. The attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee was called by the Works Committee to the insanitary condition of Peter M 157 158 Street and James Street, Bromley, private streets not in the charge of the Council. The Committee recommended the Council that notices be served under Section 100 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. The notices were duly served, and whilst this report is being written the necessary works are being carried out by the Borough Surveyor at the owners' expense. The carriageways by the London County Council Schools in St. Leonard's Road and in Ellesmere Street were recommended by the Works Committee to be paved with asphalte. The Works Committee recommended the Council that the Borough Surveyor be authorised to pave the unenclosed forecourts on relinquishment by the owners of all rights in respect to the use thereof, and that the back line of existing public footway abutting thereon be obliterated. The footway pavement at Ivy Cottages was relaid and drained by the Borough Surveyor. In November the Council resolved that the Borough Surveyor should pave with asphalte the East Perry Road, north of Glengall Boad and the Glengall Road between the Manchester Road and the East Ferry Road.

Butter and Margarine Act, 1907.* 7 Edw. 7, Cap. 21. This statute carries one stage further the series of regulations affecting the sale of butter and articles resembling butter, which have been passed in favour of the agricultural interest. Apart from more stringent provisions with regard to the manufacture, importation, transport, and sale of margarine, the important part of the statute is that dealing in a similar fashion with another butter substitute, namely, milk-blended butter. This is described as "any mixture produced by mixing or blending butter with milk or cream (other than condensed milk or cream)"; but the Board of Agriculture is left to find an appropriate name (not "suggestive of butter or of anything connected with the dairy interest") under which it may be imported and dealt with. Consequently, margarine is defined afresh, so as to exclude milk-blended butter. The provisions for the registration of margarine manufactories are extended not only to manufactories of milk-blended butter, but also to "any premises on which by way of trade butter is blended, reworked, or subjected to any other treatment, but not so as to cease to be butter," and the presence of adulterants in such premises is prohibited. As to butter proper, its importation when containing more than 16 per cent. of water is prohibited; and the Local Government Board (not the Board of Agriculture) is empowered to make regulations prohibiting or limiting the use of preservatives. (Paterson's Practical Statutes.) *Warrants were issued by the Council to the Medical Officer and the Sanitary Inspectors, authorising them to enter premises in the execution of the various duties placed upon them, and with the addition of the right of entry conferred by the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907. 163 Vaccination Act, 7, Edw. 7, cap. 31. see page 85. Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907. 7 Edw. 7, Cap. 32. An Act to enable regulations to be made for the prevention of danger arising to public health from the importation, preparation, storage and distribution of articles of food. (28th August, 1907.) Factory and Workshop Act, 1907. 7 Edw. 7, Cap. 39. This statute is an attempt to settle a difficulty of long standing with reference to laundries which are carried on by charitable institutions. Under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (1 Edw. 7, cap. 22), only those laundries were liable to inspection and otherwise subject to the provisions of the Act, which were carried on by way of trade or purposes of gain; all other laundries were exempt. Under the present Act laundries are divided into several classes, and all of them are subject to a certain measure of inspection and regulation:—(1) The general provisions of the Act of 1901 are applied not only to laundries carried on by way of trade or for the purpose of gain, but also to those carried on as ancillary to another business or incidentally to the purposes of any public institution. (2) Special regulations as to the hours of employment of women and young persons are enacted for all laundries other than those ancillary to a business carried on in any premises which are otherwise a factory or workshop. (3) Laundries are exempted altogether as "domestic workshops" when the labour is that of the family exercised at irregular intervals, and not as the principal means of living. (4) In the case of laundry work carried on at an institution for charitable or reformatory purposes—which is manifestly the principal object aimed at by the present statute—the general provisions of the Act of 1901 may be modified by the Home Secretary, particularly with reference to the appointment of the medical officer of the institution to be certifying surgeon, and the examination of an inmate only in the presence of the manager. (5) Laundries carried on by a Government department may be brought under inspection. (Paterson's Practical Statutes.) 164 Notification of Births Act, 1907. 7 Edw. 7, Cap 40. This statute, which was introduced into the House of Commons by Sir Howard Vincent, is to provide for the early notification of births. Under the Births and Deaths Registration Act, 1874 (37 and 38 Vict., c. 88, s. 1), it is the duty of the father and the mother of the child (and in their default the duty of the occupier of the house, of all present at the birth, and of any one in charge of the child) to give information of the birth to the registrar within forty-two days. By the present statute, the duty is imposed upon the father, and also (not in the alternative) upon any person in attendance (i.e., medical practitioner or midwife) to give notice of the birth of a child (including a stillborn child born after six and a half months of pregnancy) to the medical officer of health within thirty-six hours. The adoption of the Act is optional to any local authority, but power is given to the Local Government Board to enforce it within the area of any local authority. (Paterson's Practical Statutes.)

If on examination the milk is found to contain any matter rendering it unwholesome, the person producing or consigning the milk taken at Railway Stations, or the person selling it in other cases, is liable to penalties. Section 8. If samples taken at Railway Stations are unwholesome to such an extent or on such frequent occasions as to render it desirable, the London County Council may make an order excluding all or any of the milk from such dairy.

No such room or place shall be used for sleeping, and shall not directly communicate with a sleeping room if necessary to prevent risk of contamination. No refuse shall be deposited in such place nor anything done likely to expose food to infection or contamination. Penalties are imposed on persons using or allowing rooms to be used in contravention. Fried Fish. Section 22. The London County Council may make bye-laws for regulating businesses of vendor of fried fish, fish curer and rag and bone dealer.

Provides for interest to be charged on overdue Precepts. Proposed Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill, See page (148). Proposed Bye-law in respect of the conveyance through the Streets of Carcases of Animals and Dead Meat generally intended for Human Consumption. The following letter was considered by the Public Health and Housing Committee:— BOROUGH OF BERMONDSEY. Town Hall, Spa Road, S.E. 17th July, 1907. Dear Sir, In April last the Public Health Committee of this Council had under consideration a report from the Medical Officer of Health with reference to complaints which had been received relating to the custom of meat contractors of carting the heads of bullocks, which had been slaughtered at the Deptford Cattle Market and other places, through the public streets in uncovered vans. Not only is the meat liable to contamination by this method of conveyance, but the appearance of the heads is most objectionable. The County Council has made a stringent bye-law with respect to the mode of conveying the carcases of dead horses through the streets. On the 12th of April a letter was accordingly addressed to the County Council upon the subject, and a reply dated the 24th June has now been received, stating that enquiry has been made into the matter and it has been ascertained that in nearly all cases the vans used for the conveyance of dead meat are covered in. The County Council add that they have addressed a communication on the subject to the Corporation of the City of London who own the large meat markets in London, but having regard to the result of the enquiries referred to above, do not propose to take further action in the matter. The flesh of dead animals is one of the forms of human food most susceptible to contamination, and apart from any other reason it appears to my Committee on public health grounds that it is very important to frame bye-laws providing that the carcases of animals and dead meat generally intended for human consumption shall be conveyed in 168 properly constructed vehicles maintained in a clean and wholesome condition. A further letter has accordingly been sent to the County Council, asking that the matter may be again considered with a view to power being obtained to make bye-laws as suggested. I have been directed to place the facts before the Metropolitan, City and Borough Councils and to ask that if they concur with the views expressed that they will communicate with the London County Council in support of the request made by this Council. Yours faithfully, FREDK. RYALL, To the Town Clerk of the Town Clerk. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Committee recommended the Council to concur in the representations made by the Bermondsey Borough Council, and a communication on the subject be addressed to the London County Council. Again I must thank Mr. Shillinglaw, the principal Clerk in the Town Clerk's Department, for his kind assistance, which at all times he has so willingly rendered me, adding efficiency to the working of the Public Health Department. Mr. Shillinglaw acts as Clerk to the Public Health and Housing Committee, and has recorded the resolutions, recommendations and reports of the Committee which have been quoted in this report- I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Fred R.W.m Alegander. Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. Corner of Fairfield Road, April, 1908. 169 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1907. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my eighteenth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending 31st December, 1907, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 1118 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 245 Do. on house-to-house visitation 199 Do. Canal Boats 64 Re-inspections 2,406 Making a total of 4,032 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,562 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 33.35 per cent. of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 521 written intimations, 310 statutory, and 27 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 1 case it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating an attendance at the police-court to ensure enforcement. House-to-House Visitation. The house-to-house inspection comprised the whole of the houses in the under-mentioned roads and streets— Lamprell Street. Prince Arthur's Avenue. 170 Victoria Cottages (three times) and sections of Candy Street and Locton Street.

The market places have been regularly inspected throughout the year, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure:— The following have also received constant attention throughout the year:— Bakehouses 21 Registered Milksellers 57 Public House Urinals 26 Marine Store Dealers 6 Butchers' Shops 18 Fishmongers' Shops 16 Fruiterers' Shops 9 Ice Cream Shops 15 Hairdressers' Shops 19 173 Food and Drugs Acts.

The 14 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Unsound Food. Through the year 1 trunk of dabs, 1 case of haddock, 1 box skate and 1 barrel of grapes were specially examined by request of the respective owners and found unfit for human consumption. The fish and fruit were destroyed and the usual certificates given. Factory and Workshop Acts. The workshops, workplaces and outworkers on the Register have been visited, and the terms of the Acts relating to them have been required by notice, where necessary, to be complied with.

Wyke Road, 102 (new system.) Smoke Nuisances. Smoke nuisances arising within the district have been of a very minor character. Only one case of nuisance occurred in the district arising from without the district. Where nuisances have occurred intimation and notice have been served and the nuisance abated thereon. Most of the complaints seem to arise from some unexpected breakdown of a boiler or careless stoking. Only one smoke nuisance presented itself under the Highways and Locomotives Act. A letter of caution was sent to the owners by the Medical Officer of Health. Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. Under the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations 21 boats have been examined. Of these 12 were registered and 9 non-registered. All the registered canal boats, with one exception, were found in fair condition and in compliance with the Acts and Regulations. In the case of one registered canal boat the cabin was overcrowded. Letter was sent to owner of boat. No contravention of the Acts was discovered on any of the nonregistered barges. Demolitions. Two very old, worn-out wooden houses, Nos. 6 and 7, Gandy Court, each consisting of three rooms and wash-house, have been demolished as being unsafe and not reasonably capable of being further repaired, and the site cleared as the result. 178 Offensive Businesses. No serious nuisances from offensive businesses arising within the district have occurred during the past twelve months. But complaint of nuisances arising from without the district have been made on several occasions necessitating communication with the authority of the district. Verminous Booms. 23 verminous rooms have been cleansed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers Act, 1902.) Factories, Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces have been visited and found generally satisfactory, and any nuisances arising within these premises have been abated on the service of intimation. Homework. The outworkers, who are all boot and shoe operatives, have been visited twice during the year, and the premises of each examined for nuisances and sanitary defects. The workrooms were mostly found in a fair condition, and any defects in the premises were remedied by the owner or occupier on a notice being served. Milkshops and Cowsheds. The milkshops and cowsheds have given no cause for complaint; the cowsheds were limewhited and cleansed twice during the year, in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds orders, and the milk vessels and measures of the various milk vendors were not unsatisfactory. In one or two instances dippers required the seams or handles resoldered, which was done on attention being called to the slight openings in the joints. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. On visiting the ice cream makers and vendors during the season, the London County Council (General Powers Act, 1902) was apparently carefully complied with. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts fifty-seven varied samples 179 have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analyses. Five on analysis were found to be adulterated—one only sufficiently to require the vendor to be cautioned by the Public Health and Housing Committee, whilst in the cases of the remaining four, summonses were issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples and results of proceedings are appended. Butter.—Adulterated with at least 7.4 per cent. excessive water. Fined £5 and 23s. costs. Milk.—-Deficient in solids not fat to extent of 17.6 per cent. Fined 40s. and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 6.6 per cent. and 5.9 per cent. respectively.

Deficient in fat and solids to the extent of 6 7 and 1.2 per cent. respectively. Fined 5s. and 23s. costs. 392 Margarine exposed without a label. Fined 5s. and 23s. costs. Workshops and Workplaces, &c. During the year the above premises upon the Register had been periodically inspected. Milk Shops. There are 57 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. 185 Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold has, in my opinion, been sound. Unsound Food. A large and varied assortment of food stuffs had been surrendered by the owners and destroyed. 264 tins of unsound milk were seized and taken to Court. Proceedings were afterwards taken, when the wholesale man was fined £10, and £5 5s. costs. This seizure led to a greater seizure by the Stepney officers, and the same dealer was fined a like penalty. Later on no fewer than 535 tins of unsound milk were surrendered and destroyed. Smoke Nuisances. Observations had been made throughout the district with respect to smoke nuisances. Several intimations had been served and the nuisances abated. Offensive Matter. There had been no cause for proceedings under this heading during the year 1907. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H.

Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act 1891, Metropolis Local Management Acts, London County Council General Powers Act, also Bye-laws, and Council's oivn Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorization granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances, remedying of defects and infringements of bye-laws respectively, as the statutory notices served were complied with. 189 Inspection of Bakehouses, etc. I have, as specially instructed, made periodical inspections of the bakehouses, and, where required, served Extracts of Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, " intimations " and statutory notices for the necessary work of cleansing and repairs, which were respectively complied with. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops in district were inspected with respect to the sanitary conditions of the premises and the cleanliness of the articles used in the business, and, where necessary, " intimations " and statutory notices were served and nuisances abated. Public-House Urinals. These have been kept as clean as possible and furnished with the necessary fittings in compliance with the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1904. Verminous Rooms. In the ordinary course 15 verminous rooms have been cleansed and it has been necessary only in one instance to enforce the provisions of the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1904. Inspection of Eating Houses, Coffee Shops, Pork Butchers, Sausage Makers and Fried Fish Shops. I have several times inspected the whole of the above-described business premises, and where necessary served " Intimations," Notices, etc., which in every case has been complied with by repairs and cleansing work done. In no instance upon such visits was there cause for complaint so far as the food was concerned. Dairy, Milk Sellers and Purveyors. The cowshed and above-described business premises have been frequently visited, and the register kept at the Public Health Offices from time to time corrected in the cases of those found to be non-registered through change of ownership of business. The new occupiers were O 190 furnished with forms, which were duly signed and forwarded for such alteration to be made. Constant attention has been given to the enforcement of regulations relating to cleanliness of utensils, sanitary surroundings, etc., but in no case has an infringement been discovered. Upon notice received for renewal of the licence of cowshed at the rear of 27, Abbott Road, the premises were again inspected and found in fair sanitary condition ; therefore no objection was made to the application of owner of business to the London County Council. 'Examination of Food. I have on several occasions, upon applications made by different itinerant vendors and tradesmen, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found " unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food," witnessed the same destroyed by the owners, certificates having been given to that effect. In no case was there any article of food "exposed for sale, deposited for sale, or preparation for sale" at the time of my visit to any premises in such condition as to justify seizure. Ice-Cream Makers and Vendors. All the premises where ice-creams have been made were visited, with the object of detecting nuisances and any infringement of the London Council's General Powers Act, 1902. The barrows were found to be legibly marked with names and addresses, etc., of vendors, also utensils, and the premises in question were clean and that the ice-creams were wholesome. Factory and Workshops Inspections. Nuisances arising within the several factories, workshops, workplaces, etc'., were dealt with. The whole of the ascertained business premises above described were inspected and found, in the majority of cases, to be in fair sanitary condition. In the remainder the work of repairs, cleansing, etc., has been carried out in compliance with " intimations," notices, etc. Smoke Nuisances. I have, where a nuisance has occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney other than belonging to a private dwelling-house, viz., factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., either on complaint or from my own personal observation, and in most cases the nuisances complained of were abated 191 on the service of " intimations," and when necessary followed by statutory notices. In no instance was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings. Inspection of Canal Boats (Barges). I have inspected 39 barges, 38 non-registered and one registered sailing barge, with the result that I have found the cabins fairly clean, and no infringement of regulations discovered.

MINERS, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of food and Drugs Acts and Canal Boats Act, Bromley Central Division. 194 Report of the Inspector West Combined Division. Public Health Department. 31st December, 1907. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my seventh Annual Report of the Sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith in the West Combined District during the past year, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. Inspection of Division. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds 1345 houses or other premises have been visited, 392 of these visits being on account of notifications of infectious diseases. This number shows an increase of 193 or nearly double the number of cases notified the previous year. This is practically accounted for by the abnormal amount of scarlet fever cases while the epidemic was at its height. During the time, 6th July to 12th September, 115 cases were notified in my district alone. Of the 392 cases, 3 occurred at the Poplar Union, 4 at Langley House Receiving Home and 2 at the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum. House to House Inspections. These visits to the number of 89 were carried out in the undermentioned places, a large number of the drains proving unsound (some exceedingly defective) on being tested :— 195 Canton Street. Mary Place. Duff Street. Manor Place. Ellerthorpe Street. Oriental Street. Gough Street. Rook Street. Grundy Street. Swale Street. Hale Street. Sussex Street. Hind Street. South East Row. Kerby Street. Drain Reconstructions. The drains of 129 premises have been tested with either smoke or scent tests and in 115 cases found to be defective. During the year the drains of the following premises were taken out and reconstructed, and where practicable, in order to comply with the bye-laws of the London County Council and Borough Council were intercepted, ventilated and provided with means of access for clearing in times of stoppages, the whole being subjected to a water test before being passed as sound. In a number of cases combined systems were dealt with as " Drains" at owners' expense :— Annabel Street, No. 2. Augusta Street, Nos. 18, 20, 84. Bath Street, Nos. 72, 74.

These have been periodically inspected during the year, new shops have been placed on the register, and in some instances others have been taken off. There are now 30 in my district. While inspecting these places, so far as possible attention has been paid to the food in preparation for cooking. They have been kept clean and no complaints have been made. Food Inspection at Wharf, etc. At Aberdeen Wharf, where food and skins and potted meats are landed for transit, inspections have been made from time to time and everything found in good condition. The butchers' premises and market stalls are inspected regularly, sometimes in the evening. In each place where sausages and brawn are made special attention 197 has been given. On each visit during the year the places have been found in good order. Several consignments of damaged wheat, rice, barley, etc., have been received into the district from the " docks " to be made up into poultry food. These have been watched through and dealt with. The following is a list of food destroyed during the year :— 1 barrel of herrings, 1 box of skate, 1 box of mussels, 1 box of tomatoes, 4 sacks of potatoes, and several small lots of damaged fruit have been dealt with. Factory and Workshops. All those now on the register are regularly visited, and when necessary, notices for cleansing have been served and are, as a rule, soon attended to. No overcrowding in any workshop has been found to exist. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited at intervals. Fresh ones have been added to the register and all changes of address duly noted. " Notices " to cleanse the rooms have been served and attended to. It was not necessary to take any legal proceedings during the year in respect of above. Bakehouses. The occupied bakehouses now number 24 and these have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily and the places conducted in a thoroughly good manner, everything at all times of visits being in order. In none of these bakehouses is "egg liquor" used but all eggs are cracked on the premises and any unsound ones discovered are at once destroyed. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops and Slaughterhouses. These places are regularly visited during the year. The dippers and 198 storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness and have, with few exceptions, been kept in a good condition and the milkpans have been kept covered over to keep out dust, etc. The licence for the slaughterhouse, viz., 57-9, Chrisp Street, has been stopped (on the evidence jointly of the Inspector to the London County Council and your Inspector) owing to repeated cautions as to the dirty state of the premises and contravention of bye-laws one way and another. The others have been kept in a proper manner. All changes of milkshop tenants (and these are frequent) have been noted and the registers altered accordingly and brought up to date. The number of these premises now on the list is as follows :— Milkshops 79 Cowshed 1 Slaughterhouses 2 Canal Boats Acts. During the year 12 canal boats have been visited. There does not seem to have been the traffic in any portion of canal during the past twelve months as in former years. Everything was found in good order. Smoke Nuisances. All complaints from the London County Council have been dealt with and also complaints from my own observations. It was not necessary to take legal proceedings except in one case, a firm in Barchester Street. This firm have had several cautions and were constantly making a nuisance on Sunday mornings by burning felt refuse, etc. I watched for three Sundays and found it was sheer neglect. The firm was fined the full penalty of £5 and 23s. costs. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. 50 samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis by the Public Analyst during the year, 3 of which proved to be adulterated badly. By direction of the Committee, legal proceedings were instituted in each case. In some of the others different preservatives were found, and in one viz.: the Whisky there was an excess of water, and a letter of caution was sent to vendor by order of the Committee. Also in one sample of Milk a deficiency of fat to extent of 3 per cent. was discovered and 199 a letter of caution was likewise sent to vendor, the Solicitor being of opinion this would be the best course of action. One defendant closed his shop and moved away from the district in the early morning and has not since been discovered, and a warrant ha3 been issued for his arrest. Below is a list of "Samples" which were adulterated and the Analyst's report of same :— Butter.—Adulterated with 30.1 per cent. of foreign fat and 18 per cent, of boracic acid. This defendant absconded. Butter.—Adulterated with 52.1 per cent. of foreign fat. Defendant fined £4 and 23s. costs. Whisky.—Adulterated with 2.4 per cent. of water. Letter of caution to vendor.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891. All cases of infectious diseases notified during the year have been followed up in order to trace their origin if possible. One summons was taken out re " Black Smoke." (See under Smoke Nuisances.) London County Council (General Powers) Act. A summons was taken out against a House Agent for not complying with the Borough Council's " Notice " to cleanse some verminous rooms. Defendant started the work the day before hearing of summons, and applied to have summons withdrawn upon payment of £2 2s. costs. This was done and no further proceedings taken, the work being proceeded with. 200 Ice-Cream Regulations. All premises where ice-cream is made have been inspected and attention given to all the utensils. The Italians in this respect seem very clean indeed, the wooden mixers being carefully scrubbed and the zinc tools scalded and scrubbed. The itinerant vendors have kept their names and addresses properly displayed on their barrows as required by the Act. Public-House Urinals. These have been kept under observation as far as possible and are cleansed at intervals. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH JOHNSON, R.P.C., Cert. San. Imp. Exam.

Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act 1891 and Bye-laws In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with the London County Council's and Council's own bye-laws, as the nuisances were satisfactorily abated previous to applying for summonses. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 52 varied samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Three on analysis were found to be adulterated, 2 only sufficiently to require the vendor to be cautioned by the Public Health and Housing Committee, whilst in the case of the remaining one a summons was issued against the vendor. Particulars of adulterated samples and result of proceedings are appended. Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 33.3 per cent. Vendor fined £3 and 23s. costs. 204 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine.—Deficient in ammonia to the extent of 13.5 per cent. Vendor communicated with. Butter.—Containing 2 per cent. excessive water and 0.3 per cent. Boric Acid. Vendor cautioned. In addition to the above adulterated samples, 6 others were found on analysis to contain Boric Acid (preservative) in small quantities, not sufficient to warrant legal proceedings. Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of premises where milk is sold throughout the district with the object of detecting any infringement of the regulations under "The Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886 with respect to means of storage, prevention of contamination, cleanliness and registration, and during the year there has been no occasion to take legal proceedings. Number of Milk Sellers 39 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 2 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 3 Number of Milk Sellers added to Register 0 Factory and Workshops. During the year the workshops, domestic workshops, workplaces and domestic workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number employed in each case being checked, and any alteration duly reported and entered in the register kept for that purpose. Particular attention has been given to the sanitary arrangements, cleanliness and means of ventilation, and when necessary notices have been served and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. Bakehouses. By your instructions I have made periodical inspections of the bakehouses throughout the district numbering sixteen, two of which are underground. The bi-annual cleansing in each case has been carried out satisfactorily. 205 The condition in some cases necessitated service of intimation with respect to the removal of sweepings from under the troughs, and cleansing of utensils, etc. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. Five notices were received for the renewal of licences. The premises were duly inspected, and where any infringement of the regulations was found intimations were served and the defects remedied before the licences were granted. The slaughterhouses have been frequently visited when killing was in progress, and everything found satisfactory. The number of these premises now on the register is—cowsheds, 2; slaughterhouses, 3. Overcrowding. During the year complaints of ten cases of overcrowding were received; in each case the nuisance was abated after the service of intimation and statutory notice without recourse to legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the past year the shafts throughout the district have had special observation, and in only three instances were nuisances detected, which is a diminution from the preceding year when the number was 7. In each of the above cases intimation and statutory notice were served, and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. There has been no recurrence of the nuisances, therefore no necessity to take legal proceedings. Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, Etc. Special attention has been given to these premises, all of which have been inspected periodically during the past year; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register kept for that purpose. At the time of inspecting these premises in every case the food has been found satisfactory; in several instances it has been necessary to serve intimations for cleansing to be done. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. All the premises where ice cream is made have been inspected with the view of detecting nuisances, also any infringements of the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1902, Part viii Each itinerant P 206 vendor's barrow has been inspected, and in each instance the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto. At the same time the utensils were found to be in a clean condition, and the ice cream of apparently good quality. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, Etc. There is only one wharf in my district where food (all tinned) is landed both for sale at home and abroad, viz.:—Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramournie Meat Co.). These premises have been frequently visited during the past year, and tins containing the following articles of food were found to be blown or otherwise damaged and consequently unfit for human consumption and condemned, the manager stating that the goods were not intended for sale:— February.—8 61bs beef. March.—43 13oz. beef; 3 1lb. tins beef; 23 26oz. beef; 43 21bs. mutton; 1 2½lbs. ox tongue. April.—4 61bs. beef; 24 21bs. beef; 123 61bs. mutton. May.—217 61bs. mutton.

December.—163 21bs. mutton; 18 61bs. mutton. Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently visited with the view of detecting unwholesome and unsound food. In no instance was there any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visit liable to be seized. Three cases of cods' roes, ½ a case of plaice and 1 barrel of sprats were brought to the Public Health Offices during the year and on examination were found to be unfit for human food and I gave the usual certificate to that effect. 207 Hairdressers' Shops. The whole o the hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected with respect to the Sanitary conditions of the premises and cleanliness of the articles used in the business, and where necessary intimations and statutory notices were served and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. There is a great improvement in the condition of these premises since they have been periodically inspected. Public House Urinals. These have been kept as clean as possible, and the London County Council General Powers Act, 1904, Section 22 complied with. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without particular incident. All the boats inspected appeared to be in fair condition and in compliance with the requirements of the Acts and Regulations. Cleansing of Cisterns. The cisterns of the following buildings have been inspected during the year, and the condition duly reported upon, the cleansing has been done, and the cistern lids where defective, amended, and made as far as practicable dustproof.

The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. In no instance was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking, as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits and cautions no doubt contributed to this result. Workshops, etc. The workshops and workplaces were regularly inspected—numbering 35—and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. During the year no summons was issued under the Public Health Act. The whole of the work executed and nuisances abated were carried out in response to either verbal or written intimations, or on the service of duly authorized statutory notices. In several instances a warning letter from yourself had averted legal proceedings. Premises where Food Stuffs are sold or prepared for sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises, and notices served as under:— Intimations and Notices served.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 215 Report of Lady Inspector (Miss Tattersall). Public Health Department, December 31st, 1907. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present to you my eighth Annual Report, which deals with the work done in factories, workshops and among outworkers during 1907. During the year ten notices have been served where the sanitary accommodation was insufficient, unsuitable, or not separate for the sexes. Ten new conveniences were erected and in six cases alterations were made. I have visited a number of houses from which children were excluded from school when suffering from scabies or on account of their verminous condition, and have had bedding disinfected and cleansing carried out. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 139 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 328 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs, containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 267 lists have been sent to other Councils, containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. Four employers were prosecuted and three fined for not sending in their lists as required. One summons was withdrawn on payment of costs. The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— 216 Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ending December 31st, 1907:— Poplar.

Public Health Department, December 31st, 1907. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to hand you my fourth Annual Report, and particulars of the work carried out under the Bye-laws, for the year ended December 31st, 1907. Registration. During the year, 93 houses were registered, making the total number of houses on the books 1,020. Inspection and Cleansing. Of the houses inspected, several were found to be in " fair condition." It will be seen that a very large number of rooms and other parts of premises required cleansing; and in some cases where houses were recently registered and received attention under the Bye-laws for the first time, walls were stripped of as many as nine and ten papers, a sure indication that such walls had not been stripped for several years. In many of the registered houses that receive constant attention there is now only one paper on the walls. In addition to cleansing, I may say that 35 window sashes on staircases and in rooms, that were defective, were repaired and put in working order, to conform with the Bye-laws. Legal Proceedings. In March, the owner of 24, Devas Street was summoned at Thames Police Court for not supplying certain information respecting houses in Bromley. Fined £2 and £1 3s. costs. In June, a lodger at a house in Lamprell Street, Old Ford, was summoned at Old Street Police Court for not complying with notices to abate overcrowding. Fined £1 and 2s. costs. 218 In October, a landlord was summoned at the Thames Police Court for not supplying certain information respecting a house in West Ferry Eoad, Millwall. but upon supplying the information prior to the date fixed for hearing, defendant elected to pay the Solicitor's costs, which course was duly agreed to. Costs £2 4s. Overcrowding. I would here mention that during the year a few urgent cases received attention, and notices were served without the usual course of registration being adopted. There was a slight increase in the number of cases as compared with the previous year, most of which were discovered within the congested areas. Included in the 127 cases abated are 13 cases that were outstanding from 1906. See tabulated statement. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 20. Under this Act a large number of "intimations" were served, respecting rooms infested with vermin, and I am glad to say that the whole of the rooms were efficiently cleansed, without the Medical Officer having to inspect in order to certify as to the condition, which is necessary before " notices " can be served under this Act. Nuisances. As usual, any nuisances that came to my notice and could not be dealt with under the Bye-laws, were duly notified to the Inspector of the district. Night Inspections. Night inspections were made throughout the year, when many cases of overcrowding were discovered. Tabulated Statement for the year ended December 31st, 1907. Houses registered 93 Intimations served re houses being registered 93 Rooms measured and capacity entered in registers 467 Cases of overcrowding discovered 135 Cases of overcrowding abated *(see remarks re overcrowding) 127 Cases of overcrowding outstanding 21 Notices and declarations for information sent out 93 Declarations with information returned 93 Notices served for abatement of overcrowding 70 Notices served for cleansing to be carried out 313 219 Notices served for windows to be put in working order 35 Final notices served re cleansing 19 Final notices served re abatement of overcrowding 2 Intimations served, for rooms to be rid of vermin, under London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 20 61 House-to-house inspections 397 Houses found to be in fair condition 83 House-to-house visits for registration purposes 329 Re-inspections 2,339 Night inspections 292 Rooms stripped and cleansed 756 Passages „ „ 108 Staircases „ ,, 123 Yard walls cleansed 247 Wash-houses „ 261 Waters closets „ 267 Areas ,, 37 Rooms rid of vermin 95 Staircase window sashes repaired and put in working order 18 Room „ „ „ „ 17 The registered houses are situated throughout the Borough as follows:— Bow 30 Bromley 370 Blackwall 16 Cubitt Town 70 Millwall 101 Old Ford 185 Poplar 248 1,020 And in the following Roads and Streets:— Arcadia Street, Poplar Beachy Road, Old Ford Allanmouth Road, Victoria Park Broomfield Street, Bromley Alpha Road, Millwall Blackthorn Street, Bromley Bartlett Street, Bromley Brabazon Street, Bromley Barchester Street, Poplar Cotton Street, Poplar Brunswick Street, Blackwall Clifton Street, Poplar Box Street, Bromley Charles Terrace, Millwall 220 Davis Street, Millwall Old Ford Road, Old Ford Devas Street, Bromley Oliffe Street, Cubitt Town Dace Road, Old Ford Perring Street, Bromley Eastward Street, Bromley Parnell Road, Victoria Park East India Road, Poplar Park Street, Poplar Ferry Street, Cubitt Town Portree Street, Bromley Franklin Street, Bromley Rothbury Road, Victoria Park Furze Street, Bromley Rook Street, Poplar Fern Street, Bromley Ruston Street, Old Ford Gale Street, Bromley Ranwell Street, Old Ford Gaselee Street, Blackwall St. Leonard's Road, Bromley Hawgood Street, Bromley Stewart Street, Millwall High Street, Bromley Stour Road, Old Ford High Street, Bow Stebondale Street, Cubitt Town Hill Place Street, Poplar Simpsons Road, Poplar High Street, Poplar Shirbutt Street, Poplar Hancock Road, Bromley Sophia Street, Poplar Johnson Street, Cubitt Town Sabbarton Street, Poplar Judkin Street, Millwall Samuda Street, Millwall Ingleheim Place, Millwall Tidey Street, Bromley Kerbey Street, Poplar Thomas Place, Bromley Langton Street, Poplar IJlmar Place, Poplar Libra Road, Bow Whitethorn Street, Bromley Latham Street, Poplar Wendon Street, Old Ford Lamprell Street, Old Ford Willis Street, Bromley Milton Road, Bow Wades Place, Poplar Mansfield Terrace, Millwall West Ferry Road, Millwall Manchester Road, Cubitt Town Wyke Road, Old Ford Otis Street, Bromley Wellington Street, Bromley I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM JOHNSON, Cert.

Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report on the health of the Borough during the year 1951. The report is mainly confined to factual matters because the work of the department was carried out under the direction of my predecessor, Dr. W. T. Donovan, whose untimely death occurred in October, 1951. Tribute must be paid to Dr. Donovan's untiring energy and zeal in the interests of the health of the citizens of the Borough, particularly in connection with housing and food hygiene. The general standard of health throughout the Borough remained satisfactory, and there were no outbreaks of the more serious infectious diseases. The total number of cases of infectious disease was high, mainly on account of the large number of cases of measles. Only one case of diphtheria was confirmed during the year, and this happy condition was undoubtedly due to immunisation against this disease. It cannot, however, be stressed too much that diphtheria has not been eradicated, but is merely being held in check, and that any serious falling off in the proportion of infants being immunised will result in further and possibly very serious outbreaks such as have occurred both in this country and abroad. The Registrar-General's estimate of the population of the Borough was 73,260, a decrease of 790 as compared with the previous year. The Birth Rate was 17.3 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 16.7 for the previous year, and with 15.5 for the country as a whole. The Infantile Mortality Rate was 31.5, which was 3.9 above that for the previous year, and 1.9 above that for the country as a whole. It must be remembered, however, that when dealing with small numbers the rate varies considerably from year to year, and the figure given cannot by itself be regarded as an accurate indication of the standard of child care. 6 The Death Rate was 12.8 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 10.8 for the previous year. The major amount of work in the Public Health Department was concerned with housing defects, and in spite of the continuing difficulties it was possible to maintain, and to some extent improve, the standard of house repair throughout the Borough. Throughout the year also the inspectors continued, with some success, the campaign to secure improved standards of hygiene in premises and staff engaged in the manufacture, distribution and storage of food. The documents and reports made during the year show the Council's interest in the health of the public, and I feel that it would be Dr. Donovan's wish to record his thanks to the Members of the Council and to the Officers and Staff, particularly of the Public Health Department. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, R. DUNCAN DEWAR, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1952. 7 SECTION A. STATISTICS OF THE AREA.

A demand for the highest standards of food hygiene continues. The food trade is obviously conscious of this demand and is making praiseworthy efforts to meet it. During the year the Council's Officers made 1,953 visits to food premises offering advice and encouragement, and where necessary taking appropriate action to enforce the maintenance of the standards required. These visits have resulted in many improvements being made, both with regard to premises and equipment. Considerable progress has been made in connection with postwar reconstruction of the larger food factories in the Borough. Organisations concerned with these schemes are making full use of the opportunity presented by rebuilding operations, not only to effect improvements in the design and sanitation of buildings, but also to introduce modern methods of production calculated to place the article manufactured entirely beyond any doubt as to its hygienic condition. 2S SECTION F.

The treatment of Scabies is referred to on a later page. REHOUSING AND DISINFESTATION. The practice of inspecting present accommodation, bedding and furniture of prospective tenants of temporary dwellings and new permanent houses continued throughout the year.

Certificate under these Acts were issued as follows to Tenants 198 to Owners 57 RODENT CONTROL. The committee considered a circular from the Ministry of Food, infestation Division, refrring to a special scheme for 1945/7 in connection with private dwellings. It was agreed that such a scheme should be considered when the necessity arose and should be approved by the Director of Infestation Control and the Divisional Rodent officer as well as by the Committee. During the year, however, the circumstances prevailing in the Borough did not warrant action under this Circular. The establishment of 6 men engaged as rat catchers on a temporary basis has been maintained during the year; one man retired on attaining 65 years of age and has been replaced. Allocation of working time has been as follows 50 men/weeks on dwelling-house complaints. 16 " " sewer treatments. 12 " " " cost of work basis. 2 " " lost in sickness. 220 " " on Contributory scheme work.

The number of sewer systems free from rats has materially increased; the results shorn in the first table again demonstrate that the level of the sewer rat population is highest in the most densely populated parts of the borough, and that in these areas there is an ample food supply for rats in the sewers. I should like to thank the Borough Engineer and his staff for their ready and willing co-operation, without which the success of the treatment would have been impossible. FACTORIES ACT, 1927. During the year 702 inspections were made and defects or nuisances were found at 150. Of these 131 were remedied. INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD.

During the ten years 1937-46 the average number examined was 708 and the percentage adulterated was 2.7. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938.

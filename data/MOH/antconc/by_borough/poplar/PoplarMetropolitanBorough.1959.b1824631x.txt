TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OP THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough during the year 1959, The general standard of health of the inhabitants of the Borough is satisfactory and it is pleasing to note that infant mortality which in 1958 showed the abnormally high figure of 37 has fallen this year to 21, which compares favourably with other London Boroughs. Infectious Disease notifications for the year showed a considerable increase but this was due almost entirely to the large numbers of measles cases which were notified. This follows the normal pattern of measles epidemics which shows a fairly marked two year cycle in which a high peak is reached in alternate years, the intervening years being marked by relative freedom from the disease. On two occasions outbreaks of dysentery occurred in schools in the Borough but I am happy to say that efforts made to contain these outbreaks were successful. It was found impracticable to carry out complete surveys of all areas involved in the Council's Clean Air Zones because of lack of staff but the appointment of a Clean Air Inspector and two trainee Public Health Inspectors in the early part of 1960 will enable the department to carry out its functions in relation to this very important Act. -6- The trespass by caravan dwellers on cleared sites in the Borough provided a serious nuisance during the year and gave rise to a large number of complaints from local residents. Every endeavour was made to clear these sites, and with the cooperation of the L.C.C. in relation to trespass on sites owned by that authority, very satisfactory results were obtained in removing this nuisance. However at the end of the year there were still several small pockets of land occupied by caravan dwellers. The attention of the department was drawn on several occasions to the existence in the Borough of the so called 'stink-weed' or American Thorn Apple (Daturastramonium). This is a weed producing substances of powerful medicinal activity and is comparable with the deadly night shade type of plant. Although it is poisonous it is unlikely that anyone would interfere with this plant because of the strong characteristic smell. Complaints were also received concerning other strange plants and it would appear that these were specimens of Indian Hemp (Cannabis Indica) also aplant with strong medicinal properties. Experiments were carried out with regard to the eradication of these weeds from cleared sites and allotments. The appointment of four Public Health Inspectors and Woman Welfare Officer during the second half of the year enabled an extension of services to the Public and increased activities in all sections especially of Housing Surveys, Food Hygiene Regulations, domestic dwelling complaints, smoke nuisances, and the establishment of a Welfare section for the Aged and infirm. I have to report with regret the death of Mr. A. A. Hamilton, Chief Clerk, in the early part of the year; he gave sterling service to the Council and Public -7- Health Department for over 30 years. I would like to express my thanks to the Members of the Council and in particular to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and encouragement. My thanks are also due to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for their assistance and co-operation at all times and to my own staff for their loyal support. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. C. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. -8- SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 383 but through rehousing and other reasons some 1,600 residents moved from the Borough to other areas and the home population estimated by the Registrar General to number 63,540 at the middle of the year shows a decrease of 1,240 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was 17.7 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 17.1 for 1958. To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar General. Factors are supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 17.0 as compared with 16.5 for England and Wales. The death rate in 1959 was 11.7 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 11.2 for 1958 . Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 12.9 as compared with 11.6 for England and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 12.6 and 11.7 respectively. The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 18.5 as compared with 33.2 for the previous year. The figures for England and Wales are 22.0 and 22.6 respectively. -9- The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from neoplasms of the lung, show a decrease on last years figures. No significant change in deaths from other diseases was recorded.

The domestic water supply for every dwelling in the Borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The results were uniformly satisfactory throughout the year. Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 in 308 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The District Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows. -14- TABLE II INSPECTIONS, INSANITARY CONDITIONS THEN EXISTING AND RE-INSPECTIONS DURING THE YEAR 1959 Number of Complaints received 1,856 Number of Inspections Dwelling Houses House-to-House - On complaint 1,804 After Infectious Disease 321 Factories Where power is used 90 No power used - Others - Outworkers - Stables - Smoke Observations 87 Miscellaneous visits and inspections (including visits to infectious disease contacts, school inspections, etc.) 1,634 Re-inspections 3,769 Premises requiring amendment Dwelling Houses 1,089 Others 17 Service of Intimations, etc. Intimations served 1, 121 Intimations complied with 736 Notices served 399 Notices complied with 229 Final notices served 36 Final notices complied with 37 Summonses applied for 55 Work done (number of instances not included above): (a) After legal proceedings 25 (b) Voluntarily 171 Defects, etc., found in Dwelling Houses: Nuisances, etc., found Works completed Drainage: Drains defective 62 58 Drains obstructed 184 174 Waste pipes defective, etc. 68 49 Rainwater pipes not disconnected 4 4 W.Cs. and flushing apparatus defective 149 145 (continued) -15- TABLE II (continued) Nuisances, etc., found Works completed Dampness: (Not due to defects shown elsewhere) 400 348 Water: supply cut off 24 22 Dust receptacles: Insufficient or defective 48 55 Miscellaneous: Rooms, etc., dirty and/or verminous 287 213 Cases of overcrowding 17 5 Yards, etc., not properly paved or drained 70 60 Roofs defective 634 689 Rainwater pipes and gutters defective 235 223 Public House urinals requiring cleansing - - Other nuisances or defects 2,179 2,140 Defects, etc., found in Factories: Sanitary defects 21 21 W.

During the year 48 plans of drainage work to new and existing buildings were submitted and approved. River Pollution. Various complaints were received regarding wide spread offensive smells on the Isle of Dogs. On investigation it was found that the smells emanated from the River Thames and that they were strongest at high tide. The River Thames has a fairly high sulphate content from the head waters with further additions from estuarine sources and also an almost saturated effluent from two flue gas washing plants at Battersea and Bankside which result in a very high sulphate level. In the middle reaches which are largely anaerobic due to an excessive number of bacteria from sewage and other polluting sources the high sulphate content encourages and supports the growth of 'sulphate reducing' organisms which cause the smell and blackness and other effects by producing hydrogen sulphide. Flooding. As a result of extensive rainfall on Friday 21st August and Saturday the 22nd a considerable amount of flooding took place in various parts of the Borough. In some properties over 3 ft. of water was experienced. As a result of the chaos caused, members of the department were fully occupied with dealing with this situation until late at night. Requests for assistance in drying of bedding were received from eight families and some hundred and fifty articles were put through the disinfecting machines including eleven mattresses. -19- Common Lodging Houses. There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 244 males, in the Borough. 12 inspections were made during the year. Seamen's Lodging Houses. There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 5. Personal Cleansing As in recent years the arrangement was continued with Stepney Borough Council whereby persons requiring personal cleansing were treated where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. The nurber of persons cleansed during 1959 was as follows:- Verminous Scabies Total Adults 49 4 53 Children 12 1 13 TOTAL 61 5 66 -20- Disinfection and Disinfestntion. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below:(a) Disinfection:- Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 151 1,066 Tuberculosis 74 559 Scabies 6 74 Miscellaneous 524 3,381 Disinfection for manufacturing firms - 35,608 TOTALS 755 40,688 In addition, 1,142 tons 1 cwt. of waste paper, and 30 tons of Sterilised Rags were disinfected.

The work of Rodent Control is carried out by skilled and experienced operatives with supervision by the Council's Officers and all repression work is carried out by methods approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood. Great care is taken to ensure that baits are protected from domestic animals and non responsible persons. The work of the section is divided into three main categories:- (a) Sewer Maintenance Treatment. (b) Business premises. (c) Dwelling houses - complaints from occupiers. Sewer Maintenance. Two treatments were carried out during the year in April and October to coincide with treatments in the neighbouring Authorities' areas. On both occasions Prepared Warfarin was used on the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood. Once again the results obtained have been highly satisfactory. Consideration is being given to the advisability of increasing the number of sewer treatments from two to four. Business Premises. The Council's Contributory Scheme of Rodent Control in business premises has again continued to function well. The income derived from this Scheme is now £3,523 per annum and the charges made to individual contributors are calculated in units of £5 to £200. The charge is based on the estimated number of visits, their length, the amount of labour involved and the materials used with an addition for overheads. -22- Dwelling Houses. Where rat infestation of dwelling houses has been discovered it has usually been found to be due to defects in the drain or sewer and suitable repairs have been effected. The number of complaints received during the year totalled 498. This service is carried out by the Council's Staff and no charges are made to occupiers of dwelling houses.

Prom time to time complaints are made concerning nuisance from pigeons and it appears this pest is multiplying in several areas in the Borough particularly those associated with grain wharves. Many of them are diseased and are known to be carriers of food poisoning organisms and it is important that their number should be kept at a low level. At the moment this nuisance is dealt with by the Council's Official Pigeon Catcher. -23- -24- FACTORIES ACT, 1937 & 1959 (TABLES IV.V.& VI) TABLE IV INSPECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OP PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH PREMISES Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers prosecuted 1.

One dresser of Furskins is established in the Borough Smoke Abatement under the Clean Air Act. During the year 65 complaints of nuisance from smoke were received. 87 smoke observations were carried out. "SMOKE CONTROL AREAS". The staff situation did not improve sufficiently to make any progress in this section in developing further Smoke Control areas, owing to delays while awaiting information concerning the number of flats, the number of appliances, and the estimated fuel consumption in the premises proposed to be re-developed by the London County Council on the sites, none of the Orders made in 1957 and formally submitted to the Minister have, in fact, yet been confirmed. Dock and River craft. Prom time to time nuisance is created by craft in the river or in the docks and these cases are referred to the appropriate Authority. Atmospheric Pollution recording. A recording apparatus for the measurement of deposited matter and sulphur dioxide (by the lead peroxide method), is installed on the roof of the Town Hall and details of the monthly results of recordings are shown in Table VII. It is important when assessing figures shown in the tables to take into consideration the nature-of the area which is mixed industrial, commercial and domestic property. Assuming that the industrial contribution to smoke in the atmosphere is fairly constant throughout the year then the considerable increase in deposited material and estimated sulphur occurting during the months of November, -27- December, January and February when compared with that for the months of June, July and August gives some idea of the amount of pollution from domestic sources which, although responsible for more than one half the total smoke in the air are producing practically no smoke at all during the summer months Taking the average readings for sulphur for the summer three months as 1.89 compared with the four winter months when the average was 5.18, this shows a nearly threefold increase during the winter, the cause of which must be apportioned almost entirely to domestic smoke Most industrial plants are capable of careful control, use and adjustment, and of burning smokelessly and as a result of co-operation with industrial users a fair degree of smokelessness has been achieved Industrial smoke is of a different nature from domestic smoke. In industrial furnaces the temperature of combustion is so much higher under the controlled conditions of burning that all the volatile constituents af the coal are distilled readily in a relatively short time. If there is sufficient secondary air admitted with sufficient turbulence to mix intimately with the "green" gas distilled off it will be completely oxidised and it will all burn off without smoke. If, however, turbulence is lacking or the quantity of secondary air is inadequate some of the gases will not be oxidised but will be "cracked" this is converted by reduction at the high temperature to molecular carbon the presence of which gives rise to the characteristic dark quality of industrial smoke in badly fired furnaces normally never seen emitted from the normal domestic chimney. -28- Domestic smoke differs in this respect, the volume of fuel being so much smaller, the associated temperature in the region of combustion is much lower with the result that there is a progressive distillation of the volatile constituents of bituminous fuel which come off one after another as the appropriate temperature is reached. In most old-fashioned grates the volume of air passing over the fire and up the flue is so vast compared with that necessary to burn the fuel that it cools and condenses these gases as soon as they are produced. They therefore become entrained in the flue gases and are emitted into the atmosphere. These domestic smoke particles are extremely small and behave as aerosols and are of an extremely complex nature They are tarry and hygroscopic and vary in their chemical content, depending on the temperature of production and whether or not the temperature in the region of combustion was sufficient to oxidise them and destroy them It is known that at least one of the components of coal distillation is a carcinogen (3-4 benz-pyrene) and there are others. Because of the small size of smoke particles they tend to disperse very widely in the lower atmosphere and because of their physical property of absorbing moisture the particle size can increase considerably with the rapid production of haze when meteorological conditions are suitable. Whereas the industrial chimney with this occasional black smoke is usually emitting gases at very high temperature and at very considerable height from a relatively few sources, the domestic chimney is emitting gases already cooled and is producing its very considerable filthy atmospheric pollution from numerous sources relatively close to the ground During the worst period of the year when -29- cold and humid conditions prevail the gases are cooled to such a degree that they are prevented from rising and dispersing, and on occasion so much smoke is trapped that a smoke fog is produced before true wet fog conditions exist. The importance of controlling the emanations from domestic chimneys in securing clean air becomes abundantly clear and every endeavour should be made by householders who would enjoy the improved conditions, to coroperate with the local authorities in demanding clean air in their area as soon as possible, and if the terrible toll of incapacity sickness, and death from respiratory conditions is to be prevented every endeavour should be made for the whole borough to be covered by Smoke Control Orders as soon as possible. Approval of Furnaces. Eight applications were received during the year for prior approval for the installation of new furnaces under the provisions of Section 3 of the Clean Air Act, 1956. In each case plains and specifications were submitted for plants which were capable of functioning without emitting smoke when burning fuel of a type for which they were designed. All applications were formally approved. -30- -31- TABLE VII ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RECORDING TABLE Constituents JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE WATER 15. 27 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 0.60 in. rain Tons per square mile 3.49 mm. rain Grams pet 100 sq. metres 0.14 in. rain Tons per square mile 24.54 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 0.97 in. rain Tons per square mile 36.45 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1.44 in. rain Tons per square mile 19.21 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 0.76 in. rain Tons per square mile 6. 45 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 0.25 in. rain Tons per square mile TOTAL WATER - INSOLUBLE MATTER 321 8.19 651 16.61 938 23.93 829 21.14 288 7.35 241 6.14 Soluble in CS2 5 0.13 12 0.30 17 0.44 5 0.13 3 0.07 3 0.07 Ash 261 6.64 483 12.32 808 20.61 733 18.69 220 5.60 203 5.17 Other Combustible matter 56 1.41 157 3.99 113 2.89 91 2.32 66 1.68 36 0.91 TOTAL WATER SOLUBLE MATTER 397 10.14 415 10.57 271 6.91 329 8.39 174 4. 43 111 2.82 Ca++ 34 0.87 58 1.48 42 1.07 55 1.41 32 0.81 20 0.50 Cl' 36 0.91 42 1.07 76 1.95 29 0.74 20 0.50 11 0.27 so"4 50 1. 27 153 3.89 118 3.02 117 2.99 63 1.61 38 0.97 TOTAL SOLIDS 719 18.32 1066 27.18 1209 30.34 1158 29.53 462 11.78 351 8. 96 Wt. of SO3 collected estimated on mg/100 sq. cm. /day.

The number of cases of aged and infirm persons in need of urgent care and attention increased steadily throughout the year. A large proportion of these cases were existing under appalling sanitary conditions and many were persuaded voluntarily to enter hospital or other suitable establishments. It was not found necessary on any occasion to seek compulsory removal. The appointment of a Woman Welfare Officer to the department made it possible to establish routine procedure whereby all cases known to the department were kept under periodical observation. Every possible facility and help is extended to these old people to enable them to live in clean and confortable surroundings and to maintain an adequate state of nutrition in order to keep them physically in good shape and enable them to participate in communal activities as long as possible. Tribute must be paid to the valuable assistance and co-operation of the L.C.C. Home Help Section, the W. .S., District Nurses, Local Medical Practitioners, Hospital Authorities, National Assistance Board and local welfare organisations. Incontinent Laundry. In order to meet increasing demands for facilities to assist those old persons and their relatives who were unable to cope with incontinent laundry, the service was increased in 1959 to two collections per week. Provision was made for the acquisition of suitable laundry equipment to provide a more efficient and suitable service -34- Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-mortem room. In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the pathologists and clerks. The total number of bodies received during 1959 was 478. (Residents 184, non-residents 294. Post-mortem examinations were made in 370 cases and inquests were held in 104 cases There were 4 cases for deposit only Public Cleansing. The arrangements for collection, removal and disposal of refuse are under the control of the Borough Engineer, who has supplied the following information:Refuse. During the year 21,383 tons 9 cwts 1 qr of house, trade, street, gully, market and kitchen refuse were collected and disposed of at the controlled tip. In addition 13,051 tons 4 cwts. of refuse from other boroughs were also dealt with at the Council's Refuse Disposal Depot. Street Cleansing. Two Mechanical/Sweeper/Collectors supplemented the work of the manual Road Sweepers, and as warranted by weather conditions a watering machine was used for washing and watering roads and street markets Gully Cleansing. Three Gully/Enptying machines have carried out 6,895 gully cleansings and the weekly emptyings of three cesspools. -35- Swimming Baths and Wash-bouses. The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent:- Poplar Baths Bow Baths Island Baths Wick Lane Baths Watts Grove Baths Sophia Street Baths Vapour, Foam and Slipper baths, Swimming Pools- Slipper Baths and Laundry. Slipper Baths and Laundry Slipper Baths Slipper Baths. Laundry only. Public Swimming Pools. There are two pools, both situated at the main establishment, East India Dock Road, E. 14, and I am indebted to the Chief Baths Superintendent for the information contained in the report which follows:- 1 Length. 2. Width. 3 Maximum depth. 4 Minimum depth. 5. Capacity. Large Pool 100 ft 39' 6" 8' 6" 3' 6" Small Pool 64 ft. 25 ft. 6' 6" 3 ft. 150,000 galls. 50,000 galls The water to the pools is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a mixture. from the Rivers Lea and Thames. Continuous filtration and chlorination of the water is carried out during the whole period the pools are in use, the period of complete turnover of both pools - 36 - being 3.5 hours. The pH value of the water is maintained between 7.6 and 7.8 while the chlorine content is maintained at 1.0 to 1.2 parts per million. As soon as the last bather leaves the pool at the end of the day, and for the week-end closure of the establishment, the chlorine content is increased to 1.5 (or even more) parts per million to ensure sterile water when the pool is re-opened. Wallace and Tiernam chlorinators supply the chlorine to the water and the filtration equipment used is made by United Filters. Sulphate of Alumina is used in required quantities in the filtering of the water and soda ash, or similar, is used to assist in maintaining the necessary pH. value of the water. Hourly tests are made of both pools to see that the correct pH. and chlorine values are present. Periodical bacteriological examination of the water is carried out by visiting pathologists from the London County Council Public Health Department Pathological Services. The water is maintained in such sterile condition that it is not necessary to empty the pools. However, as the large pool is closed during the winter season, and has to be drained down, the contents of the small pool are used to thoroughly wash out the filters servicing this pool, and then, 50,000 gallons of water from the large pool is filtered through both sets of filters into the small pool. This, in effect, means that both pools are emptied down each year. While the pools are empty opportunity is taken to thoroughly scour all sections of the pool steps that are under water, and all glazed tiling is cleaned down with an abrasive powder. -37- SECTION C HOUSING Details of new housing accommodation completed in the Borough during 1959 are as follows:- Poplar Borough Council 28 dwellings London County Council 349 dwellings The number of families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 31st December, 1959, was as follows:- Type of dwelling No. of Lettings Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,058 Post-war Council houses and flats 1,537 Temporary bungalows 403 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 68 Requisitioned Properties 72 Acquired properties (Req.

Of these. 538 were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination, the remaining 89 being sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service for biochemical or bacteriological report. Samples examined by the Public Analyst included a comprehensive variety of food. 17 samples were acquired formally and 521 informally. A total of 14 samples (2.6 per cent) were found to be adulterated Details of the unsatisfactory samples and the action taken are shown in Table VIII on page 45. During the year Thirty One samples of sausages were purchased mostly from different manufacturers, including local butchers. The meat content of pork sausages varied from 39.7 to 82.2 per cent., with an average of 61 5 per cent. (Prices varied from l/9d to 3/6d. per lb with an average of 2/4d. per lb.). In the case of beef sausages the meat content varied from 50.0 to 69.6 per cent. with an average of 58.5 per cent. (Prices were from l/4d. to 2/5d. per lb. with an average of l/10d. per lb,). Two samples of Pork Sausages were unsatisfactory Details of these samples and action taken are shown in Table VIII page 45 -46- Unsound food The Council's Pood Inspector is called upon to pass judgment of fitness on great quantities of food.

This summary differentiates only between canned food and others; foods preserved by salt, sugar, dehydration, etc., being included under the heading "Fresh Poods". Disposal of Unsound Food. The bulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned and destroyed by the Borough Engineer' s refuse disposal service as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned, arrangements may bemade under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch, or manure making. -48- Milk Supply. All domestic supplies of milk are sold in sealed bottles or cartons bearing a designation. Except for very small quantities of raw Tuberculin Tested milk from Attested Herds, all milk is heat treated. Although a large number of shop keepers are registered to sell milk, the greater proportion of milk supplied to domestic consumers is delivered to the door through twenty of the registered distributors. Samples of milk have been taken from shops and deliverymen for the purpose of checking quality, purity and bacteriological cleanliness. Samples are also taken on delivery from supplies to schools. During the year 142 inspections were made of premises from which milk is distributed Conditions on the whole were found to be satisfactory. Registration and Licensing. For details of registration of distributors see page 43. Licences issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation (Raw Milk)) Regulations, 1949:- Sterilised Pasteurised Tuberculin tested Dealers 117 64 26 Supplementary 27 23 23 Pasteurisers - 1 - -49- Milk sampling. A total of 23 samples of milk (- formal, 23 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination. All samples were satisfactory. For average solids in all samples, excluding Channel Islands milk, the figures were: Pat 3.5, Non-fatty solids 8.60. The Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956, fixed a minimum standard of 4 per cent. fat in connection with milk sold under the description Channel Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and South Devon. 2 samples of Channel Islands milk were taken and reports showed fat figures of 4.3 and 4.4 and in each case the non-fatty solids figure was 9.0 The 7 samples of designated milk submitted to Phosphatase and Methylene Blue Tests, were satisfactory. Ice Cream, Close supervision is exercised in connection with the manufacture, sale and storage of Ice cream. Premises, plant and refrigerators were kept under constant observation Pull and free consultation has taken place between manufacturers and the Council's Pood Inspector on problems of production. Inspections are made of the vehicles used by itinerant vendors; vehicles have been stopped, stocks inspected, temperature of containers checked and samples taken. A total of 71 samples were taken during the year. Of these 69 were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination by the Methylene Blue Test. The remaining samples were examined by the Public Analyst under the Pood Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951. Both samples were reported to be satisfactory, -50- the quality in general being much higher than the standards prescribed in the regulations. Ice Lollies. During the year 11 samples were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination. A satisfactory report was received in each case. Imported Food. The Council is a specially appointed Authority under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations, 1937. Inspections are made of direct landings of imported foodstuffs at the Sufferance Wharves in the Borough. No prohibited meat may be imported into the country for sale for human consumption and no meat or meat products may be imported without an official certificate of inspection issued by the Country of Origin, and approved by the British Government. Foods for Export. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 99 inspections were made of foods exported from the district; 99 certificates of purity were issued. -51- Food poisoning. 54 cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. One of these a salmonella typhi-murium infection proved to be fatal. Although the majority were isolated cases there was one small outbreak, this occurred in a school. Several of the school staff were affected by food poisoning with acute abdominal pains and diarrhoea after partaking of a school meal. Specimens taken for bacteriological examination indicated that the outbreak was due to heat resistant Clostridium Welchii. This outbreak stressed the importance of time and temperature factors in storage and service of meals This particular school kitchen prepared meals for three schools None of the school children were affected as the meals were kept at a proper temperature before serving In the case of the teachers the meal was served and put in a hot cupboard at an unsatisfactory temperature which permitted sufficient organisms to grow in just over half an hour to produce the symptoms. As is characteristic with this type of outbreak recovery was rapid. -52- SECTION E INFECTIOUS DISEASES The total number of corrected notifications of infectious disease during 1959 was 1518 which was approximately 3 times the figure, 513, for the previous year and mainly due to the increase in the number of cases of measles 1166 and 86 respectively, which were notified. Diphtheria. Although no cases of diphtheria were notified during the year there is little room for complacency with regard to this disease. This degree of freedom from diphtheria in Poplar can only be maintained by a vigorous policy of immunisation with the whole hearted support of the public. The tendency to disregard the seriousness of this disease is reflected in the percentage of immunisation which is far from satisfactory. Dysentery. The number of notified cases showed an increase of nearly 50 per cent when compared with the figures for 1958. There were two outbreaks at schools in this area. The first occurred in the north of the Borough. In all 25 pupils were excluded from attending school and the contacts of families concerned were visited and specimens taken. The number of children confirmed as positive cases amounted to twelve. The second outbreak concerned a school in the west of the Borough. Five members of the staff were involved and nineteen pupils. In every case bacteriological confirmation of the infection was obtained. A number of other cases exhibiting symptoms were also involved but no organisms were discovered in these cases. -53- Measles. The number of cases of measles notified during the year was 1166 as compared with 86 in 1958 and 1010 in 1957. These figures clearly illustrate the cyclic nature of this disease. Poliomyelitis. During the year one only confirmed case of poliomyelitis (paralytic) was notified. Tuberculosis. Although much progress has fortuitously been recorded in the apparent control of tuberculosis by reason of the advent of new drugs, in recent years there has been very little change in the number of cases notified and it is apparent that this disease is a long way from eradication. If we are to obliterate this scourge, as I think is possible, there is a very great need for every consideration to be given to the preventive approach. Whilst in England it is considered repugnant to insist on compulsion in the treatment of tuberculosis, from time to time individuals are found, open cases with positive sputum, who refuse all offers and persuasion to undergo treatment, and in London we are hampered in dealing with this because of the lack of suitable legislation. The table shown overleaf indicates the age and sex incidence of the cases notified. -54- TABLE IX TUBERCULOSIS - PRIMARY NOTIFICATIONS 0 yrs. 1 yrs. 2 yrs. 5 yrs. 10 yrs. 15 yrs. 20 yrs. 25 yrs. 35 yrs. 45 yrs. 55 yrs. 65 yrs. 75 yrs.

This shows a welcome decline in this disease which must still be regarded as one of the most serious of childhood because of the possibility of sequelae. -56- -57- TABLE X INFECTIOUS DISEASE D I S E A S E Corrected Notifications Removed to Hospital 0yrs. 1yrs. 3yrs. 5yrs. 15yrs. 25yrs. 45yrs. 65yrs.

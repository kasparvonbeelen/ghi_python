As re-development proceeds and new dwellings come into occupation the population should show a steady increase for several years as many of the new dwellings are being occupied by recently married couples and there is a tendency for families to be larger than hitherto. The current population is 67,340 Births Live births continue to show an increase with the total of 1,404 during the year, representing a rate of 20.84 per thousand, The illegitimate birth rate is still high and the death rate amongst these infants is higher than legitimate Still births are also slightly raised, although, in view of the small numbers involved the significance of this is not clear. Deaths Death rates are higher than last year. Those arising from cardiac conditions show an increase of 20% over the figures for 1961, and it is noted that these conditions are proving fatal at an earlier age. Deaths from pneumonia were up nearly 50% This probably reflects terminal broncho pneumonia in the elderly, Notifications for pneumonia were down considerably. Infectious Diseases The relatively few cases of infectious disease in the Borough are comparable with those which one might expect in a health resort There were no cases of poliomyelitis, diphtheria, or typhoid fever during the year; sporadic cases of dysentery showed a num erical increase and there were 17 cases of food poisoning, but there were no major outbreaks. Measles showed the usual decline in the quiescent year. 6 Housing Following the devastation which occurred in Poplar during the War the phasing of re-development in relation to tlie zoning of the London Plan has created a problem due to sites which have been cleared but which will not be developed until some period in the future. Before the war the population of Poplar was housed in small congested sub-standard dwellings with few communal amenities,which meant that in the future re-development there would be a need for provision of new open spaces, new schools, and other public buildings. Many of the sites are over-grown with weeds which favour surreptitious flytipping of every conceivable conmodity - old cars, builders" rubble, unwanted furniture, bedding and putrescible matter, This has occasioned considerable activity on the part of the Department to clear these sites to secure the abatement of nuisances and, where practicable, to arrange for them to be fenced in in order to obviate the recurrence of nuisance and to prevent trespass by caravans. (a) Mobile Dwellings The still pressing need for further units of accommodation and the fact that these existing sites were a serious source of nuisance, has encouraged the London County Council to develop mobile dwellings which can be erected in these areas with a minimum amount of site preparation. It is proposed to place a large number of these dwellings in Poplar during 1963. (b) Houses in Multiple Occupation The Housing Act and Houses in Multiple Occupation Regulations, whilst giving wide powers to Local Authorities to improve the amenities where houses are occupied by more than one family, is likely to give rise to problems relating to the difficulty of establishing ownership. The Council,have,therefore, decided to restrict the number of occupants to the facilities available. Investigations in connection with the application of these Regulations have entailed very considerable additional work in the Department owing to the need to obtain precise information, which often requires the service of Notice of Entry on occupiers of individual rooms,which entails multiple visiting of the same house, frequently outside normal office hours. Sinn Clearance The tenants in the McCullum Road Area have been rehoused and the work of demolition is in progress, including the old Roman Road Baths,the site of which will be incorporated in the new re-development. The Lefevre Road Area, the subject of an Enquiry last year, has been approved by the Minister and arrangements are in progress for the rehousing of the tenants. 7 There remains in Poplar only one large block of privately owned buildings comprising some 450 separate dwellings which, by reason of their age and general lack of modern amenities, is the cause of much unrest on the part of the tenants. Unfortunately, the buildings are structurally sound and it is not considered that the accumulated disrepair would justify them being included under Slum Clearance procedure, and their acquisition by Compulsory Purchase Order would be prohibitively expensive. In view of the size of the problem and in order to clarify the point the London County Council have been asked to consider the possibility of the inclusion of this property in future Slum Clearance. Caravans As a result of the continuous activity by the Department, the caravan trespassers have been almost completely eliminated, it is unfortunate that Poplar is situated on the north side of the Blackwall Tunnel, which is the route used by most of the caravans in their annual trek to Kent. They are discouraged from passing through the Tunnel in the day-time which means that they seek stopping points in the Borough, and often stay for long periods. The extent of the improvement can be seen from photographs elsewhere in the Report. One shows an area where, at one time, there were as many as 400 vehicles closely packed without any amenities. As a result of activity of the Department and the co-operation of the London County Council this area is now, as " Bartlett Park", a valuable amenity of the Borough. Old People's Welfare The work of the Welfare Section continues to expand as the number of people seeking help and advice increases steadily. The popularity of the Home Bathing Service has led to another Attendant being engaged on this work. During the year the Mayor arranged fora holiday for Poplar Old Polk and the Woman Welfare Officer was granted leave of absence to help them. Smoke Abatement 14 Orders have now been confirmed in the Borough and work is in progress on Order No,15 which covers the remaining portion of the Isle of Dogs which, together with Orders already in force will cover more than half the Borough. It is anticipated that the whole of the Borough will be "Smoke Controlled" by 1965. Smoke Nuisances from industry have been almost abolished. 8 River Pollution The improvement in the River water noted last year has continued and,for the first time, eels have been noted. It is believed that the last time they were seen in the River was over 30 years ago." Public Analyst Mr. H. A. Parkes, Public Analyst to the Council, retired on 31.12.62, after being associated with the Department since 1936. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking him for his help, assistance and co-operation, and to wish him a long and happy retirement. I would like to express my thanks to Members of the Council and, in particular, to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, for their help and encouragement. My thanks are also due to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for their assistance and co-operation at all times, and to my own staff for their loyal and ready support. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. C. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. 9 SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 627 and the home population estimated by the Registrar General to number 67,340 at the middle of the year shows an increase of 1,490 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was 20.84 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 20.62 for 1961. To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar General. Factors are supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 19.79 as compared with 18.0 for England and Wales. The death rate in 1962 was 11.55 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 10.85 for 1961. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 13.05 as compared with 11.9 for Qigland and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 12.26 and 12.0 respectively. The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 24.21 as compared with 27.98 for the previous year.The figures for England and Wales are 21.4 and 21.6 respectively. The causes of death are shown in Table 1 in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from neoplasm of the lung show no appreciable change, though coronary disease continues to show a marked increase and the bad winter has had an effect as portrayed by the number of deaths from pneumonia.

Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The water supply to the Borough has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity during 1962. The water supply to the area is a mixture of River Thames-derived and River Lee-derived filtered water in varying and unpredictable proportions. The water from these two sources is stored in the Board's reservoirs and filtered and chlorinated on the Board's works before being pumped into supply. Samples are collected at each stage of the purification process, as the water is pumped into supply, and in the distribution system. A summary of the results of the chemical and bacteriological analyses of the water passing into supply from these sources for the year 1962 is set out on page 16 The waters are not plumbo-solvent. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination revealed by inspection or analysis. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine and the water in them is checked as to its quality afterwards,before the structures are restored to service. All inhabited houses are supplied withapiped water supply direct to them and no houses are permanently supplied by standpipe. There have been no new sources of supply nor new important extensions of trunk mains in this area during the period under consideration,and there were no changes in the general scheme of supply. New mains were laid to the extent of 400 yards. Acknowledgements are due to Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, who supplied these facts and figures. 14 Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in 823 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough, some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes, but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, "the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. See overleaf for analysis of water suppli es. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. The District Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows, on page 17. 15 16 AVERAGE RESULTS OF THE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLIED TO BOROUGH OF POPLAR 1962 MILLIGRAMMES PER LITRE (Unless otherwise stated) Description of the sample No. of sajnples Ammonia Nitrogen Albuminoid Nitrogen Oxidised Nitrogen Chlorides as CI.

The disposal of sewage in London is the responsibility of the London County Council, and the position as far as Poplar is concerned is generally satisfactory. OFFENSIVE TRADES. One Dresser of Furskins is established in the Borough. -21- COMMON LODGING HOUSES. There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 244 males, in the Borough. 7 day inspections and 2 night inspections were made during the year. SEAMEN'S LODGING HOUSES. There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 and 26 Males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 5. Two were made at night and three during the day. Each year, when considering applications for renewal of licences for Common Lodging Houses and Seamen's Lodging Houses detailed inspections are made of the premises by:- (a) Public Health Department (b) Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department This includes fire precautions. (c) London Electricity Board and a licence is issued subject to the requirements and recommendations of these Departments being met. PERSONAL CLEANSING As in recent years the arrangement was continued with Stepney Borough Council whereby persons requiring personal cleansing were treated where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. The number of persons cleansed during 1962 was as follows:- Verminous Scabies TOTAL Adults 22 14 36 Children 2 3 5 TOTAL 24 17 41 -22- DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below:- a) Disinfection:- Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 19 222 Tuberculosis 26 358 Scabies 5 98 Miscellaneous 462 2,445 TOTALS 512 3, 123 In addition 531 tons of waste paper, and 52¼ tons of sterilised Rags were disinfected.

The work of Rodent Control is carried out by skilled and experienced operatives with supervision by the Council's Officers and all repression work is carried out by methods approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood. Great care is taken to ensure that baits are protected from domestic animals and non-responsible persons. The work of the section is divided into three main categories:- (a) Sewer Maintenance Treatment (b) Business Premises (c) Dwelling Houses-complaints from occupiers. -23- Sewer Maintenance After considerable success in lessening the number of rats in sewers which resulted from the use of new techniques and materials developed during and after the war,the rat population appeared to have achieved a static level. It was obvious that in order to bring about any further improvement new materials or improved methods of treatment had to be sought. Studies of the physiology of rats indicate that under optimum conditions young rats reach maturity and ability to breed in a little over two months after birth. This suggested that any new technique in order to be effective must take this factor into consideration. In May 1961 we began an experiment commencing with a complete pre-bait of the entire sewage system with sausage rusk in order to provide some basis for comparison in the future. This was followed by five poison treatments at two monthly intervals, using sodium fluoracetamide added to the same bait. A complete pre-bait was completed in May 1962. By comparison with the result of the previous pre-bait it was possible to assess with a reasonable degree of accuracy the effectiveness of the new methods. The results were very encouraging. The percentage of all man-holes treated at which "complete takes" (indicating the existence of heavy infestation) had been recorded, fell from 7.4% to 2.5%, and it was further noted that some sections were now completely free of rats, bait in good condition being untouched. The experiment is being continued, and it is hoped that progressive reduction in the rat population will be achieved with the gradual extension of the area of rodent-free sections of the system. Although it is early in the experiment, it is quite obvious that for it to achieve the maximum success possible, it is essential owing to the interconnection and complexity of the London sewerage systems that adjoining Boroughs should carry out comparable treatments at the same time. Business Premises This scheme was introduced in 1943. Following inspection of commercial premises and industrial sites, the Owners are encouraged to join the scheme. The charge for the service is based on the extent of infestation, the number of visits likely to be required, and the cost of labour and materials. In an area with nearly nine miles of river frontage to the Thames and Lea this enables the treatments to spread over a large number of premises and gives a very satisfactory measure of control. It is appreciated by the Commercial undertakers, and is a valuable part of rat repression work carried out in the Borough. The income derived from this scheme amounted to £4,224,18,8 during the year. Dwelling Houses 319 complaints relating to dwelling houses received during the year. No serious infestations were discovered, and practically all were traceable to defects in the drainage system, or failure to seal off disused drains on cleared sites. -24- TYPE OF PROPERTY Local Authority Dwelling Houses including Council houses All other (including Business Premises) TOTAL Number of properties in Borough 39 18, 150 3,574 21,763 Number of properties inspected as a result of (a) Notification 14 298 1,516 1,828 (b) Survey under the Act - 20 12 32 (c) Otherwise - - - - Total inspections carried out, including re-inspections 68 1,500 9,757 11,325 Number of properties inspected which were found to be infested by:- (a)Common Rats Major - 11 28 39 Minor 11 152 269 432 Ship (b) Rats Major - - - - Minor - - 13 13 (c) Mice Major 1 40 58 99 Minor 3 80 615 698 No. of Infested properties treated 15 283 972 1,270 Total treatments carried out 45 1,350 1,964 3,359 Number of Block control schemes carried out - - 210 210 -25- -26- FACTORIES ACT, 1961 (TABLES IV, V & VI) TABLE IV INSPECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH PREMISES Number on Register NUMBER OF Inspections Written Notices Occupiers prosecuted 1.

It appears from details gathered that by far the majority of these people are true wanderers with no permanent home whether they describe themselves as Gypsies or not. They obtain a living in various ways, by car-breaking, dealing in rags etc., or by door to door selling of various articles in the winter. During the summer months they usually leave town to work either in fairs or on farms. The children appear to be well clothed and nourished, often being sent to local schools. The environment and uncertain way of life must have a very adverse effect on the welfare and education of the children as a whole. Occupation of the sites give rise to numerous complaints from the local residents subjected to requests for water, annoyance, trespass and intimidation and the obvious annoyances occasioned by the lack of any sanitary facilities. In addition to caravans, families often erect temporary structures and tents for additional sleeping and living purposes. Most families have their quota of half-wild domestic animals which are a further cause of nuisance. The Public Health hazards are clear, since no water supply or sanitary accommodation is provided and there are no arrangements for the disposal of refuse. The chief method of disposing of soil and waste water is the furtive use of street gulleys and sewer man-holes, whilst household refuse becomes distributed all over the site. The following details give some idea of difficulties encountered:- A broken down motor coach, the engine of which was useless, was used as a "home" for a family of husband, wife and three children. It was parked on land cleared in preparation for inclusion in a larger re-development scheme. The site was in the process of transfer, and it was not until completion that the L.C.C. evicted them from the land. The coach with a towing vehicle and accumulated impedimenta moved to the other side of the road. It stood on the highway for nearly three years. A portion of the footway was taken up and a latrine erected. The husband had been in prison and his driving licence had been endorsed. At no time were the family prepared to accept any local authority accommodation. After every possible pressure, including Court action, they eventually purchased a new caravan, broke up the old and cleared the site The problem has been a most difficult one to deal with. Legal proceedings under the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1959, have proved to be protracted and no deterrent as the small fines are accepted by the trespassers as a payment in lieu of rent. The sympathy aroused by the difficulties and plight of these people constantly moved from place to place often obscures the basic problem. The indiscriminate parking on bombed and other cleared sites is a hazard to the community and the perpetrators. The only satisfactory solution is for sites to be enclosed on clearance, followed by immediate -29- re-development. The photographs overleaf show sites before and after development which were only cleared after vigorous and determined action by officers of the Public Health Department and the L.C.C. Prompt co-operation and action as soon as illegal parking is reported has resulted in the problem in Poplar being reduced to a minimum apart from a small hard core of caravanners who as single units move from site to site in the Borough.

This Order is the largest that the Council has yet made and covers an area of approximately 200 acres in the south east section of the Borough. It involves some 700 residential properties with an estimated total cost of adaptations of £14,000. It came into operation on the 1st November and by the end of the year the majority of adaptations had been carried out. Future programme of Smoke Control Orders. At the beginning of the Smoke Control programme it was felt that the existing cleared sites within the Borough should be made the subject of the first Smoke Control Orders so that when re-development took place the tenants would become accustomed to the use of smokeless fuel from the commencement of their tenancies and would not have to be educated into making subsequent changes. The first thirteen Orders related in large part to these cleared sites. Now that they have been the subject of Smoke Control Orders it is possible to turn our attention to the making of Orders covering the remainder of the Borough.It is anticipated that with the staff at full strength it will be possible to cover the whole Borough with three further Orders, the last of which would come into operation at the end of 1965. Smoke Abatement. During the year a number of smoke nuisances were reported to the Clean Air Section and many others were detected as a result of routine observations in the Borough. A total of 61 visits and inspections were made in connection with the smoke nuisances. A number of complaints were received regarding the emission of black smoke, grit and sooty particles from the chimneys of Watts Grove Power Station and investigation proved that these complaints were justified. The six steam generators at this Station were designed and erected with the object of being fired with pulverized fuel. Subsequently, however, it was decided to convert them to solid fuel burning and chain grate stokers were installed for this purpose. The result of this adaptation is that each steam generator contains an enormous combustion space with the main source of radiant heat in the lower portion; this is a contributory cause of the frequent emission of black smoke. This is a " booster" peak load station which may entail frequent lighting up and sudden heavy steam demand, all of which add to the difficulty of the Station Engineer. A number of improvements effected at the Station should alleviate smoke and grit nuisance unless another extremely severe winter is experienced. Eight Plans and specifications of proposed furnace installations were submitted for approval. -38- Atmospheric Pollution. The Smoke/Sulphur Dioxide Recording Stations set up at the Town Hall and Poplar Technical College have remained in operation throughout the year and much useful information has been obtained therefrom. It is hoped next year to set up a third station in Millwall Park. The Department co-operates fully with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research at Warren Spring Laboratory, Stevenage. Records of smoke and sulphur dioxide readings are sent to them monthly and, in return,from time to time, we receive from them similar and tabulated recordings covering the remainder of the country. Hourly Smoke Study. Poplar was one of the Boroughs co-operating with the College of General Practitioners in a Special Study seeking information on any possible correlation between increased respiratory sickness and air pollution levels during smogs, using a Sequential Smoke Analyser, operating at hourly or shorter intervals. Unfortunately, from the point of view of this, experiment, no smogs were experienced after the setting up of the instruments. The experiment did, however, show the benefit of this sort of co-operation. Trainee Public Health Inspectors. Pour Trainee Public Health Inspectors are on the establishment of the department and each week two of them are seconded to the Section to assist the Clean Air Inspector. -39- CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 ANNUAL STATISTICS 1st January to 31st December,196fe Code No, Section Inspections and revisits Dark Smoke Nuisances 1 1 14 Other Smoke Nuisances 2 16 18 Grit and Dust Nuisances 3 5 9 Notification of New Furnaces 4 3(3) 16 Prior Approval - New Furnaces 5 3(2) 15 Prior Approval -Grit/Dust Equipment 6 6 - Industrial Smoke Control 7 11 126 Non-Industrial Smoke Control 8 11 185 Railway Engines 9 19 - Survey Smoke Control Area No. 15 10 11 176 Inspection of work in connection with adaptations 11 12 59 Crown Premises, etc. 12 22 - Alkali Acts 13 17 - Atmospheric Pollution Stations 14 25 8 Health Education 15 25 2 Legal Proceedings 16 29 - Industrial Plant Records 17 8 - Height of Chimneys 18 1Q - Miscellaneous Visits 19 - 128 TOTAL VISITS 756 -40- TABLE VII ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RECORDING TABLE CONSTITUENTS JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE WATER 74 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 2.92 in. rain Tons per square mile 13 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 0. 51 in. rain Tbns per square mile 37 mm. rain Gramsper 100 sq. metres 1.46 in. rain Tons per square mile 40 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1. 58 in. rain Tons per square mile 31 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1. 22 in. rain Tons per square mile 7 mm. rain Gramsper 100 sq. metres 0. 28 in. rain Tons per square mile Total Water - Insoluble Matter 1,604 40.91 237 6. 04 588 15.00 507 12.92 533 13. 59 274 6.98 Soluble in CS2 7 0. 17 4 0. 10 3 0.07 1 0. 03 4 0.10 3 0.07 Ash 1,506 38. 39 171 4. 36 483 12.32 430 10.97 440 11. 21 201 5. 13 Other Combustible Matter 92 2. 35 62 1. 58 103 2.62 75 1.91 89 2.28 70 1.78 Total Water - Soluble matter 446 11.38 243 6. 21 258 6. 58 241 6. 14 184 4.70 136 3. 46 Ca++ 49 1. 24 26 0. 67 46 1.17 30 0.77 34 0.87 20 0. 50 CI' 87 2.21 41 1.04 47 1.21 36 0. 91 30 0.77 12 0. 30 S0"4 157 3. 99 71 1.81 121 3.09 84 2. 15 80 2.05 38 0.97 TOTAL SOLIDS 2,050 52. 29 480 12. 25 846 21. 58 748 19.06 717 18. 29 410 10.44 Wt. of F19 SOg collected estimated on mg/100 sq. cm/day (Pb02 cylinder) 3. 78 3.09 3. 67 2. 08 1.81 1.50 CONSTITUENTS JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WATER 57 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 2.25 in. rain Tans per square mile 39 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1.54 in. rain Tons per square mile 63 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 2. 48 in. rain Tans per square mile 40 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq, metres 1. 58 in. rain Tons per square mile 25 mm. rain Grass per 100 sq, metres 0.99 in. rain Ibns per square mile 43. 4 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1.71 in. rain Tons per square mile Total Water - Insoluble matter 516 13. 16 328 8. 36 534 13.63 388 9.90 457 11. 64 599 15.26 Soluble in CS2 4 0. 10 1 0.03 3 0.07 3 0.07 11 0. 27 Ash 413 10. 54 249 6.34 418 10.67 297 7. 58 334 8.52 423 10.78 Other combustible matter 99 2, 52 78 1.98 113 2.89 88 2. 25 112 2.85 Tbtal water - Soluble matter 284 7. 25 158 4.03 378 9.63 320 8.15 328 8. 36 459 11.70 Ca++ 34 0.87 26 0.67 45 1.11 39 1. 01 34 0.87 CI' 25 0. 64 20 0. 50 25 0. 64 29 0.74 45 1. 14 so"4 86 2. 18 79 2.01 82 2.08 128 3. 25 104 2.65 181 4. 62 TOTAL SOLIDS 800 20. 41 486 12.39 912 23. 26 708 18.05 785 20.00 1,058 26.96 Wt.of fl9 SOg collected estimated on mg/100 sq. cm. / day (Pb02 cylinder) 1.66 1.39 1.76 3. 28 3.81 4. 34 SHOPS ACT, 1950.

NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951, SECTION 1. As anticipated the work of the Welfare Section dealing with the Aged and Infirm continued to expand throughout the year. The number of new cases brought to the attention of the Department reached 309. The need for extra staff to cope with the increased volume of work had to be given serious consideration and arrangements were made for this to be dealt with early in 1963. -43- The excellent liaison between this department and the various services provided by the London County Council, W.V.S. and the National Assistance Board and voluntary bodies ensured that no undue delay was experienced in assessing and dealing with the problems and difficulties of the many Old Polk on our records. Once again it gives me satisfaction to say that on no account was it necessary to resort to the powers for Compulsory Removal of any Old Person. Details of inspections are as shown below Cases on the Register at 31st December, 1961 636 New cases added to the Register 309 Number of removals from Register (a) Deaths 115 (b) Transfers 33 (c) Other cases 2 Total number on Register at 31st December, 1962 795 Incontinent Laundry Calls 699 Home Bathing Visits 532 Visits to new cases 353 Visits to old cases 592 Miscellaneous visits and enquiries 1,541 This,the newest of the services provided by the Public Health Department has proved to be extremely successful.lt is normally restricted to the house bound and it meets a very great need amongst Old People.As the service becomes more widely known, so does the demand increase. An additional Home Bather was provided during the year and allowance for another made for the coming year. INCONTINENT LAUNDRY Provision of facilities for the Incontinent has become firmly established in the Borough and efforts to improve the service and increase daily visiting are being made to meet the increasing requests from residents. -44- MORTUARY AND CORONER* S COURT. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-mortem room In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the Pathologists and clerks The total number of bodies received during 1962 was 793 (Residents 298 non-residents 495) Post-mortem examinations were made in 682 cases and inquests were held in 111 cases PUBLIC CLEANSING The arrangements for collection.removal and disposal of refuse are under control of the Borough Engineer, who has supplied the following information:- Refuse During the year 22 449 tons 7 cwts 0 qrs.of house, trade, street, gully, market and kitchen refuse were collected and disposed of at the controlled tip In addition 14 205 tons 12 cwts 1 qr of refuse from other Boroughs were also dealt with at the Council s Refuse Disposal Depot Street Cleansing Two Mechanical/Sweeper/Collectors supplemented the work of the manual Road Sweepers, and as warranted by weather conditions a watering machine was used for washing and watering roads and street markets. Gully Cleansing Gully/Emptying machines have carried out 7,576 gully cleansings and weekly emptyings of three cesspools SWIMMING BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent Poplar Baths Vapour. Foam and Slipper baths Swimming Pools Island Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry Aberfeldy Street Launderette PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS. There are two pools, both situated at the main establishment, East India Dock Road, E 14., and I am indebted to the Chief Baths Superintendent for the information c aitained in the report which follows Large Pool Small Pool Length 100 ft. 64 ft. Width 39" 6" 25 ft Maximum depth 8" 6" 6" 6" Minimum depth 3" 6" 3 ft Capacity 150,000 galls 50,000 galls -45- The water to the pools is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a mixture from the Rivers Lea and Thames. Continuous filtration and chlorination of the water is carried out during the whole period the pools are in use,the period of complete turnover of both pools being 3.5 hours. The pH value of the water is maintained between 7.6 and 7.8 while the chlorine content is maintained at 1,0 to 1.2 parts per million. As soon as the last bather leaves the pool at the end of the day and for the week-end closure of the establishment, the chlorine content is increased to 1.5 (or even more) parts per million to ensure sterile water when the pool is re-opened. Wallace and Tiernam Chlorinators supply the chlorine to the water and the filtration equipment used is made by United Filters. Sulphate of Alumina is used in required quantities in the filtering of the water and soda ash, or similar, is used to assist in maintaining the necessary pH. value of the water. Hourly tests are made of both pools to see that the correct pH. and chlorine values are present. Periodical bacteriological examination of the water is carried out by visiting pathologists from the London County Council Public Health Department Pathological Services. The water is maintained in such sterile condition that it is not necessary to empty the pools. However, as the large pool is closed during the winter season, and has to be drained down, the contents of the small pool are used to thoroughly wash out the filters servicing this pool, and then, 50,000 gallons of water from the large pool is filtered through both sets of filters into the small pool. This, in effect, means that both pools are emptied down each year. While the pools are empty opportunity is taken to thoroughly scour all sections of the pool steps that are under water, and all glazed tiling cleaned down with an abrasive powder. -46- SECTION C HOUSING Details of new housing accommodation completed in Borough during 1962 are as follows Poplar Borough Council 56 dwellings London County Council 690 dwellings Private 7 dwellings The number of families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 31st December, 1962, was as follows :- Type of dwelling No. of Let tings Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,058 Post-war Council houses and flats 1,692 Temporary bungalows 330 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 122 Acquired properties 153 Other properties 6 TOTAL PROPERTIES 3,361 -47- RENT ACT, 1957.

During the period of public anxiety in January following cases of Small Pox imported into the country from Pakistan, a large local industrial undertaking employing a considerable number of Indian and Pakistani nationals sought advice in connection with vaccination. Some 340 vaccinations were performed. One recently arrived member of the staff, heavily pock-marked, also had open lesions on his face and forehead of recent origin, and this had given rise to a rumour amongst his workmates that he was suffering from Small Pox. On investigation it was quite clear that the man was suffering not from Small Pox but from Hansen's Disease, later confirmed by biopsy, and further that it was in an infectious phase. Having no English,communication was difficult but through an interpreter it was ascertained that he had been in touch with his local doctor and had visited a nearby hospital as an out-patient. Arrangements were made for his immediate admission to the Dreadnought Hospital on the I7th January 1962. He was still being detained in a Colony at the end of the year, and the condition appeared to be responding to treatment. He was a married man with two children. These and other home contacts were examined with negative results. -61- MASS RADIOGRAPHY : Arrangements were made for Mass Radiography Unit 6B of the North-East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board to hold sessions at St.Clement's Hospital, Bow Road, and Poplar Baths, East India Dock Road.

During the year lectures continued to be given by members of the Public Health staff on food hygiene,welfare and care of the aged, clean air talks and other health topics. The free distribution of " Better Health" the Central Council for Health Education journal has been augmented to old people's clubs and youth groups. The advent of the Poplar News' a public relations publication, in October, provides a valuable channel for reaching an even wider public, and each edition has items of information and interest concerning health matters calling for the co-operation of the public, and simple explanations of the effect of new legislature. Extra notice boards for poster propaganda have been acquired. SMOKING AND HEALTH In a circular dated 12th March 1962 the Minister of Health asked Local Authorities to use all possible means at their disposal to draw public attention to the health hazards of smoking, with particular emphasis on the need to prevent young people taking up this habit. Throughout the autumn posters and advertising material on the dangers to health of smoking were displayed and distributed to organisations that had agreed to participate in the campaign. In addition a mobile exhibition unit was hired for use during the period 5/13th November, The unit included film projection and tape recording amongst its equipment, and was staffed by two male graduate lecturers who were specially trained to deliver talks and lectures on this subject. Arrangements were made for units to visit schools, clubs and church organisations, A detailed ifcinery was provided in order to obtain the maximum use of the exhibition.

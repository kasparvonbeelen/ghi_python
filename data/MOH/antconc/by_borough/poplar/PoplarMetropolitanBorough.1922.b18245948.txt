The estimated population of London for the year 1922 is 4,534,230. CENSUS. The population of the Borough at the time of the Census (June, 1921) was as follows:—Poplar sub-district, 56,924; Bromley, 65,441; Bow, 40,253; Borough, 162,618. * These figures are calculated upon the acreage of the district including the inland water area, not tidal and foreshore. Exclusive of area covered by water they are:— 77.57 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 57.80 for the Sub-District of Poplar, 113.19 for the Sub-District of Bromley, and 75.48 for the Sub-District of Bow.

During the year the marriages of 2,486 persons were registered in the Borough, giving an annual rate of 15.00 per 1,000 of the estimated population, the rate for England and Wales being 15.8, and for London 18.4. The annual marriage rate per 1,000 living being:— Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

During the year 2,396 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 540 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1,573 in Bromley, and 283 in Bow ; from the 540 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 57 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 383 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 866 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1,573 registered deaths in Bromley in a similar manner, viz., deducting 824 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 184 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 933. From the 283 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 2 nonresidents and added 292 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 573 deaths. * The birth rate in England and Wales in 1922 was 20.6 per 1,000 of the estimated population. 6 In dealing separately with the sub-districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II., and III., that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub-districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2,396 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 480 deaths of actual non-residents, and 456 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2.372 upon which the death rate is calculated.

The male births belonging to the Borough exceeded those of the female by 141, and the male deaths exceeded those of the female by 150 making a gain of 9 females. The following figures are the death rates per 1,000 living for the past 5 years (see pace 2):— Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

Mortality rate among infants visited was 65.5 per 1,000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough, and the rate refers to those born in 1920. In 1910 and 1911 the rates were 105.69 and 115.62, because diarrhæa was prevalent in 1911. The infantile mortality rate is based on deaths occurring in any one year and births occurring in that and the preceding year The rate of mortality amongst infants visited by Health Visitors is calculated upon births occurring in one particular year and deaths in that and the following year.

The rates are calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population. * In Column 6 are included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the borough, but excluding the deaths of soldiers and sailors that have occurred in hospitals and institutions in the district. In Column 12 are entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. † "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence— e.g., casuals—are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (6) below. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission, If the person dying in an institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission. the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first institution. (2) The deaths of infants bora and dying within a year of birth in an institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (6) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known;and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the " Intimations " which are followed, if necessary, by " Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are " in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Acts, will be brought into operation. * The London County Council (General Powers) Act), 1922, came into operation 20th July, 1922. The Act repeals sections 19, 20, 21, sub-section (1) of section 24, and definition of " house " in section 26 of the 1904 Act. The word " vermin " includes bugs, fleas, lice and itch-mites, their eggs, larva; and pupa'. † For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons, see pages 56-58. 89 During the year 498 Intimation Notices were served in respect of verminous rooms, and the verminous rooms cleansed were :— East Combined Division 23 West Combined Division 7 Popiar South Division 2 Bromley North Division 66 Bromley Central Division 62 Bow East Division 24 Bow West Division 118 Housing Inspectors— Poplar 32 Bromley 93 Bow 50 No summonses were applied for. 497 A fluid insecticide is given and sprayers loaned to tenants in order to rid rooms and contents of bugs. Sixty gallons were distributed during year. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. During the organised "Rat Weeks" a large quantity of barium carbonate paste was distributed to applicants, the results being highly satisfactory. Lithographic varnish traps were also used with success. The number of complaints of the presence of rats and mice has greatly diminished. It must be added that every week is a " rat week'' in Poplar, and the work of destruction proceeds, principally by the use of barium carbonate paste which is still being distributed to tenants of houses, where necessary, and is recommended for use in factories, etc. Where rats are still persistent after the use of poison the ground is opened and the drain examined as a matter of routine Accumulations of refuse are also directed to be removed.

A number of cases of overcrowding were reported but on account of lack of housing accommodation remained unabated. No cases of overcrowding were found in workshops. General. 3,251 complaints (including 77 smoke) as to nuisances were made. 3,727 communications on general matters were despatched, and 5,328 in connection with the supply of milk. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen. Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health.. Metropolitan Borough of poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E March, 1923. 96 Free Milk Scheme. Mr. Dyer, Chief Clerk, reported : During the 12 months ended 30th December, 1922, 18,082 applications for free milk were received, of which 16,215 were granted. (Compared with 23,799 applications and 18,270 granted for 1921.) It must, however, be remembered that the year 1921 the age limit was reduced from 5 years to 3 years except in special cases. Orders for 621,796 pints of fresh and 1,664 lbs. of dried milk were issued, the total commitments amounting to approximately £8,500. Personal enquiry was made into 2,969 cases by the Investigation and Enquiry Officer, In 15 cases it was found that applicants had commenced work and received an income which rendered them overscale while receiving free milk without notifying the fact. In 5-of these, letters of caution were sent and the remaining 10 were instructed to refund the value of milk supplied to them. Proceedings were taken in the County Court against 4 debtors and Orders made. In one case a Judgment Summons was issued for non-compliance with the Order and later the man was committed to prison for 10 days—but even now nothing has been paid towards his debt. During the year the sum of £94 was repaid on account of milk supplied on incorrect information, making a total sum to date of £270. By arrangement "with the Dairymen's Association, the Council pays 2d. per gallon below the ruling retail price. The price per pint (to the Council) varied during the year as follows: 1st January, 4¼d.; 2nd April, 2¼d.; 2nd July, 2¾d.; and 1st October, 3¾d. 97 Report of Dr. W. C. P. Smith, Tuberculosis Officer and Assistant Medical Officer of Health for Tuberculosis Purposes. Information required by Ministry of Health. (i.) A list of dispensaries, specifying also branch dispensaries and visiting stations ; a list of the Tuberculosis Officers employed ; a statement of the numbers of other officers employed in dispensary work ; a list of residential institutions, specifying for each the number of beds normally available for patients from the area of the Local Authority, and the type of case for which these beds are used. In the case of residential institutions belonging to the Local Authority, the names of the Medical Officers and the number of other officers should be given. (1) (a) Tuberculosis Dispensary.—Alexandra House, 135, BowRoad, E. As pointed out in previous reports, the premises are in several respects inconvenient. No. 1, Wellington Road, will, however, shortly become vacant, and it is proposed to move there as soon as the necessary alterations have been carried out. (b) Proposed Branch Dispensary.—No further action has been taken with regard to the proposed branch dispensary at ] 34, High Street. Poplar. In the meantime, the fares to and from the Bow Road Dispensary are refunded to necessitous patients living south of the East India Dock Road. Tuberculosis Officer : W. C. P. Smith. Assistant Tuberculosis Officer : D. H. Geffen. Other Officers :— 3 Health Visitors. 1 Dispenser. 1 Clerk. 1 Assistant Clerk. 1 Part-time helper (female). 1 Caretaker. Arising out of the Ministry of Health Circular 308, of May 8th, 1922, on the subject of care committees, a resolution to appoint a paid officer to act as secretary to the care committee and organiser of after care work, was passed by the Council. The matter has for some time past been in the hands of the Ministry of Health, who have not yet communicated their views on it. 98 Residential institutions :— (а) Sanatoria—hospitals and homes available under the L.C.C. scheme (which now includes all classes of patients, whether insured, uninsured, or ex-Service men). (b) The Poor Law Infirmary. (c) A few In-patient letters for Victoria Park or other hospitals when obtainable. (ii.) In the case of administrative counties, precise particulars of arrangements for co-operation with Sanitary Authorities and their officers. Nil. (iii.) The nature and extent of co-operation with general and special hospitals, school clinics, and other institutions. General Hospitals.—Under an agreement between the Council and the London Hospital, cases of surgical tuberculosis and certain other cases are referred to the hospital for opinion or treatment. Cases of lupus are also sent to the hospital for treatment by the Finsen Light, on the recommendation of the Tuberculosis Officer ; a fee of 5s. is charged for each treatment, and if more than twelve applications are required in any case, a further recommendation from the Tuberculosis Officer is necessary. During the year five new cases have been recommended and eleven cases in all have attended the hospital for lupus ; they have received a total of 169 Finsen Light applications. Special Hospitals.—No special arrangements exist except that cases in which an artificial pneumothorax has been produced may be referred to Brompton Hospital for the necessary refills at a charge of 10s. for each refill. Non-tuberculous pulmonary cases are referred generally to Victoria Park Hospital either by cards or out-patient letters. Similar cases in children are sent to one or other of the Children's Hospitals—at Shad well and Hackney Road. School Clinics.—-Co-operation with the School Medical Officers has been continued, and found to work satisfactorily. A further extension of the scheme has been evolved so as to embrace a certain number of contacts who on examination by the Tuberculosis Officer are found to be healthy, and others who for some reason the Tuberculosis Officer has not been able to examine. This arrangement comes into use on January 1st, 1923. As in previous years, a number of schoolchildren having defects of various kinds—aural, nasal, dental, etc.—have been referred to the Divisional School Medical Officer for the provision of necessary treatment. (iv.) Any special arrangements made to secure the co-operation of medical practitioners and the working of the arrangements for periodical reports on insured patients under domiciliary treatment. 99 The Tuberculosis Officer communicates with every local practitioner, who notifies a case of tuberculosis, offering to confer as to the best means of dealing with the case. The practitioner is also invited to avail himself of the services of the care committee for any case occurring in his private practice in which he thinks they will prove helpful. A large number of patients have been sent to the dispensary during the year by local practitioners for an opinion, and in each case a report has been sent by the Tuberculosis Officer. 438 such reports have been sent during the year. The number of periodical reports received from practitioners on patients under domiciliary treatment has been something under onethird of the number asked for. (v.) The arrangements for following up patients in cases where the diagnosis is doubtful. Cases of doubtful diagnosis are kept under observation at the dispensary, and every effort is made to come to a definite conclusion in as short a time as possible. Owing, however, to the frequent failure of patients to return for re-examination when requested, and the consequent need to visit or write for them, it is not always possible to do so. (vi.) The arrangements for securing the examination and systematic supervision of " home contacts." Home contacts are examined at the dispensary—as a rule by special appointment. The arrangements for their attendance and their subsequent supervision are in the hands of the Health Visitors. A special-effort is made to keep under observation the contacts of sputum positive cases, and to re-examine them at short intervals. (vii.) Information as to special methods of diagnosis and treatment in use and the number of persons to whom these special methods have been applied. The X-Ray apparatus is in constant use as an aid to diagnosis. It is used almost exclusively for screen work. No record of the number of cases so examined has been kept. (viii.) The results of local experience as to the relative value of each form of treatment. No special treatment has been in use. (ix.) The nature and extent of any dental treatment provided by the council for tuberculous patients. A dental clinic has been held weekly at the Old Ford Wesleyan Mission Hall since October, 1922, to which all cases needing dental treatment and for whom no provision is otherwise made, are referred by the Tuberculosis Officer. Cases requiring new dentures are referred to the Care Committee 100 for assessment of the amount of contributions payable by the patient, and for any assistance the committee may be able to furnish towards the cost. Details of the work done are given in the Dental Surgeon's Report. (x.) Any arrangements for the provision of nursing or of extra nourishment for patients living at home. No special arrangements for the provision of nursing for adults and children over 10 years of age exist, but it is frequently possible to obtain such assistance in the persrtn of a district nurse or from the local nursing associations. The Borough Council undertake the nursing of children up to 10 years of age. Extra nourishment has, since April 1st, 1922, been granted to certain cases—on the lines laid down by the Ministry of Health. The nourishment in the form of dried milk and eggs has been given chiefly to patients awaiting admission to, or recently returned from Sanatorium, and to certain other cases in which the patient's working capacity is likely to be restored. (xi.) The arrangements for treating non-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially tuberculosis of bones and joints in adults and in children, and for the provision of 'surgical apparatus, etc. Non-pulmonary cases requiring residential treatment are referred to the L.C.C. for sanatorium or hospital treatment. Cases that can suitably be dealt with as out-patients are referred to the London Hospital according to the terms of the agreement referred to, as are also cases of lupus for Finseji Light treatment. Surgical apparatus is obtained through hospital almoners, Invalid Children's Aid Association, Charity Organisation Society, or other charitable bodies. (xii.) The arrangements for " care " and " after care " and their working. The Care Committee meets fortnightly at the dispensary. It consists of some fifteen members (exclusive of the dispensary staff), among whom are representatives of the chief official and voluntary organisations engaged in social work in the district. The amount of work done by the committee has increased considerably during the year. The services of the committee are available for any case of tuberculosis in the Borough. The proposal to appoint a paid officer for care and aftercare work has already been referred to. (xiii.) Particulars as to any local arrangements for finding employment for patients. No arrangements exist for finding employment for patients except the Labour Bureaux, which are of little or no value to the tuberculous patient, who usually requires a light occupation. 101 (xiv.) Statement as to the supply and supervision of shelters at the homes of patients. No shelters are at present out on loan. (xv.) Any special points noted locally as to the incidence of tuberculosis [i.e., occupation). No special occupational incidence has been noted : as pointed out last year a considerable proportion of the cases occur in patients out of employment, or among general labourers or casual workers. (xvi.) A ny special methods adopted or proposed for the prevention of tuberculosis. No special method outside the general scheme which includes the examination and supervision of home contacts, the dissemination of information and the supply of spit cups and sputum flasks with a view to the prevention of massive infection, the improvement where possible of the housing conditions, and the removal of the infectious case, or of the contacts from close association with it. (xvii.) Special difficulties encountered. The general lack of employment is still acute and the possibility of finding suitable light or part-time employment such as many tuberculous patients would be capable of is practically non-existent. There is always difficulty in finding suitable residential accommodation for cases which for one reason or another the County Council are unable to accept under the scheme. Though it is often desirable to get such cases away from home for a time, they are frequently unwilling to enter a local hospitel, while on the other hand they are not suitable for a home for the dying. The difficulty of improving adverse home conditions caused by overcrowding is constantly experienced. W. C. P. SMITH, Tuberculosis Officer. 102 Report to Medical Officer of Health of Miss A. E. Hall, Chief Health Visitor. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. 3. January, 1923. Sir, I beg to present the fifteenth Annual Report of the work of the Maternity and Child Welfare Department. Resignations.—There were two resignations during the year—Dr. Lane (the Medieal Officer of the Bow and Poplar Clinics) on removal from London ; Miss Burtt, Health Visitor for No. 4 District, on her marriage. The vacancies were filled by the appointments of Dr. Ward and Miss Little wood. Removal.—-On the expiration of the lease of the premises in Shirbutt Street, the North Poplar Clinic was removed to 134, High Street, Poplar —everyone was delighted with the change. New Scales were provided at the Island Clinics, and are much appreciated. They are most comfortable, both for the babies and the workers. Infant Clinics.—Nine sessions weekly are held—all show an increased attendance. High Street, Poplar, heads the list with an average attendance of 44.8 per session. Allanmouth Road at the bottom with an average attendance of 25.8 per session. This, however, is an increase of 5 per session over the attendance last year. The figures for Bow (37.2) really do not give a fair idea of the attendance. Friday morning is an awkward time for mothers, and the comparatively poor attendance at this session adversely affects the average. The attendance of Expectant Mothers is not reckoned on the average. Dental Clinic.—The attendance has been very unsatisfactory, falling from an average of 7.6 in 1921 to 4.3 during the year under review, An enquiry into probable causes was held at the end of the year, and if the suggestions made are carried out, I feel sure that this branch of the work will, in time, be as successful as the others—the need for it is as great. Infantile Mortality.—The rate for the Borough—79 per 1,000 births —exactly half what it was eleven years ago—is certainly a matter for congratulation, especially when one considers that the rate per 1,000 Still-births and Deaths before visit is practically unchanged. I am still of the opinion that an improved midwifery service would do more to decrease these rates than the provision of Ante-natal Clinics. 103 Toddlers.—The mortality amongst the toddlers has been very heavy. The rate between 1—2 years and the 2—3 years having more than doubled, between the 3—4 almost doubled, that of the previous year. The 4—5 show a slight decrease. The increase in the mortality is accounted for by_the deaths from respiratory diseases in the early months of the year. London County Council.—Two thousand and sixty case sheets relating to children who had attained the age of 5 years were forwarded during the year to the Education Department. New Year's Party.—The Staff entertained the Mothers and children attending the various Clinics to a Tea Party at the Town Hall on January 3rd. Our thanks are due to the Poplar Borough Council for the free use of the Hall, to the Commercial Gas Company for installing a boiler free of charge, and to all who assisted. Baby Show.—This was held on July 13th. Our thanks are due to the then Mayor (Alderman C. Sumner, L.C.C.) for a generous donation from the Mayor's Fund, to the Medical Practitioners of the Borough who so kindly undertook the arduous duties of the Judging, and to all who assisted. Garments were given as prizes, all of which were made by the members of the Staff. Transfers.—We failed to trace thirty-five of the cases transferred from Out-lying Institutions, supposed to be living at addresses in this Borough. These cases are always found to be unsatisfactory, and much time is wasted in trying to find them.

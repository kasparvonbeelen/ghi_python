Treating the 1784 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz , deducting 882 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 223 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 1125 From the 355 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 4 non-residents and add 334 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 685 deaths.

The 966 deaths in Poplar included 11 illegitimate children, 6 male and 5 female; the 1,125 deaths in Bromley included 7 illegitimate children, 5 male and 2 female ; the 685 Bow deaths included 10 illegitimate children, 4 male and 6 female, making a total for the Borough of 28 deaths of illegitimate children.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899 and 1900, there was a gain of females from the Sub-Districts of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the years 1901-1909 and 1911-1913, there was also a gain of females, but for the year 1910 the males gained over the females. 9 The following figures are the death rates per 1,000 living for the past 30 years (see page 2):— Poplar.

Mortality rate among infants visited was 83.20 per 1,000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough, and the rate refers to those born in 1913. In 1910 and 1911 the rates were 105.69 and 115.62, because diarrhoea was prevalent in 1911. ‡ In the County of London during the year 1914 there were 109,667 children born, of whom 11,395 died under one year of age. "The rate in 1910 was only 103 per 1,000 births. This is the lowest London rate recorded, and is 29 per 1,000 below the average in the preceding 10 years." —Registrar-General. The rate for the County of London was even lower in 1912 being only 90 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality rate is based on deaths occurring in any one year and birth occurring in that and the preceding year. The rate of mortality amongst infants visited by Health Visitors is calculated upon births occurring in one particular year and deaths in that and the following year. The children born in 1910 and dying during 1910-11 are shown in the rate for 1910, so that the diarrhoea months June, July, August and September of 1911 affected not only the children born in 1911 but also those born in 1910 who had not yet reached one year of age, hence the higher rates amongst infants visited during the two years 1910 and 1911. 1908 Mortality rates amongst infants visited 10419 1909 „ „ „ 98.75 1910 „ „ „ 105.69 1911 „ „ „ 115.62 1912 „ „ „ 90.10 1913 „ „ „ 83.20 (See Chart, page 14) 14 The infantile mortality rate is based on deaths occurring in any one year, and births occurring in that and the preceding year.

During the year 5,012 notifications were received under the Notification of Births Act, 1907. National Conference on Infantile Mortality. The Council was invited to appoint delegates to the National Conference on Infantile Mortality, held in Liverpool on July 2nd and 3rd. It was hoped to follow up at Liverpool the good work done at the last Conference, through which resolutions dealing with the need for a Commission on Venereal Diseases, and the payment of the Maternity Benefit to the mother, have already been carried into effect. Fruitful action has also been taken on resolutions relating to the registration of still-births and death certification; to the necessity for giving a more prominent place in the medical curriculum to the teaching of infant hygiene ; to the training of midwives, and several other matters. The Council was represented at the last Conference which was held in London, and the Committee were of opinion delegates should be appointed to attend the Conference in July. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that Councillor Mrs. T. S. Attlee, with the Medical Officer of Health, be appointed delegates to the National Conference on Infant Mortality held at Liverpool on July 2nd and 3rd, 1914. The following resolutions were passed at the Conference on Infant Mortality, held at St. George's Hall, Liverpool, on July 2nd and 3rd, 1914 :— Registration of Stillbirths. (1) That this Conference respectfully urges the President of the Local Government Board to take into consideration the advisability of making provision to secure early knowledge by Public Health Authorities of all stillbirths. Instruction of Girls in Mothercraft. (2) That steps be taken to encourage the more general education of girls in matters relating to mothercraft. Maternity Benefit. (3) This Conference urges that any further grants in aid of Maternity should provide in the first place for mothers now outside the operation of the Maternity Benefit under the Insurance Act, and, in the second place, for adequate care for pre-natal conditions, and that in the administration of the fund means should be taken to secure adequate return for the money spent. 16 Compulsory Notification of Births. (4) That the President of the Local Government Board should be requested to make the Notification of Births Act compulsory throughout the Kingdom. Reduction of Infant Mortality. (5) That the time has come for carrying on a general educational campaign throughout the country with the object of further reducing infant mortality and securing the better care of the mother before and after the birth of the child, and that the Executive Committee of this Association be requested to take the necessary steps to this end. Grants in aid for Infant Welfare Centres. (6) That in the opinion of this Conference any grant from the Exchequer in aid of Schools for Mothers, Babies' Welcomes, and similar organizations should be administered under the Local Government Board through the Public Health Authority in order that administrative overlapping be avoided. The Royal College of St. Katharine. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— 14, Great Marlborough Street, London, W. 6th April, 1914. Sir, Her Majesty, Queen Alexandra, the Patron of the College of St. Katharine, has declared her will that the benefits of the ancient Foundation shall be restored to the poor of East London, and has entrusted the Lord Chancellor with the necessary authority to frame new Rules for carrying her will into effect. These Rules provide that there shall be established in the East of London a College of resident Health Visitors (that is, women possessing nursing, obstetric and public health Certificates and experienced in maternity work), who shall (1) devote themselves to maternity and health visiting in defined areas under the direction and control of the Medical Officers of Health of the Borough Councils in the poorer districts of East London, and (2) report to the Medical Officers through the principal (the official head of the College who shall possess similar qualifications) the results of their visits. 17 A preliminary meeting of the Council or Chapter of St. Katharine's College set up under the Scheme was held on Monday last, and I was instructed to enquire whether, having regard to the size of your area and the density of population therein, you would not consider it advantageous to the health both of the mothers and of their offspring, were one or more of these ladies working under your control and direction, to visit children above the age of ten days and under that of one year. Enquiries have been made and there is reason to believe, that having regard to the heavy demand made on the ratepayers for the various public services now required, Medical Officers of Health are unable to secure so large a number of Health Visitors as are needed, and that therefore they would be glad to avail themselves of the gratuitous, so far as the Borough Councils are concerned, help of duly qualified visitors selected and appointed under the Scheme. I am permitted to add that Queen Alexandra learns that such visiting tends not only to reduce infantile mortality, but also to prevent the physical deterioration of the mothers ; and, as you are well aware, Her Majesty has always promoted by every means the improvement of the public health, especially the health of mothers and children. I enclose herewith for your information a copy of the Scheme under which this ancient Foundation is to be administered. The District in which the College would be established would depend in part on the area to be served. I should be glad to learn whether you would be prepared to co-operate in giving effect to the provisions of the Scheme ; perhaps you might find it desirable to confer with me on behalf of the Council or Chapter. I should add that I am in communication with the Medical Officers of Health for the Borough of Stepney, Bethnal Green, Poplar and Shoreditch. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, To the Mayor of Poplar. HENRY A. WHITE. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable the fullest possible co-operation should be afforded by the Council in giving effect to the provisions of the Scheme, and that advantage should be taken of the offer to provide additional Health Visitors, as 18 suggested, to act under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health. The Committee recommended that the Council concur in this opinion, and that all necessary arrangements be made to give effect thereto. On 7th April, 1914, as stated above, a letter was received by His Worship the Mayor of Poplar from Henry A. White, Esq., stating that Her Majesty Queen Alexandra, had declared her will that the benefits of the ancient Foundation of St. Katharine's College, shall be restored to the poor of East London, entrusted the Lord Chancellor with the necessary authority to frame new Rules for carrying her will into effect. Such Rules have been duly made and Clause 3 thereof states :— " The objects for which such College shall be established are : (1) The provision of a body of duly qualified Resident Health Visitors (i.e., Women possessing Nursing, Obstetric, and Public Health Certificates, and having had experience of maternity work) who shall devote themselves mainly, but not necessarily, to Maternity and Health Visiting, working in defined areas under the direction and control of the respective Medical Officers of Health of the Borough Councils in the poorer districts of East London, and reporting to the Medical Officers, through the Principal, the results of their visits ; (2) the training for such work of Students, being women, who possess similar qualifications to those above mentioned, but lack experience." On July 22nd, the Rev. Thory Gardiner, Rector of Lambeth, called upon the Medical Officer on behalf of Queen Alexandra. The Rector was accompanied by Miss Macqueen, the Principal of the College. There will be six Health Visitors (trained Nurses) who will visit cases after the tenth day, and in cases of diarrhoea they will visit even five times a day if necessary. On July 23rd, the Rev. Thory Gardiner wrote to the Medical Officer of Health that as regards the age of children to be visited, the Chapter have decided that, subject to approval, the children shall be visited from ten days old up to the day when their names are entered on the Register of an Elementary School, and that by this means a continuous record of the children's health will be made possible and some valuable evidence will be accumulated. The Principal and Nurses are to reside within the Borough. On August 6th, Miss Macqueen, Principal of the College, wrote stating that it had been decided to take Bromley Hall, Brunswick Road, for St. Katharine's College, for a term of three years. 19 Maternity and Child Welfare—Return as to Notification of Births during the Year 1913. (1) Births notified by Hospitals and other Institutions undertaking maternity work (specifying each institution) :— (a) Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum 41 (b) Poplar Workhouse 46 (c) Stepney Workhouse 12 (d) 31, Sturry Street 7 (e) Nurses of St. John the Divine 548 (f) Nurses of Dr. Guinness' Home 45 (2) Births notified by mid wives who are in private practice 1,466 (3) Births not coming within the first category notified by medical practitioners 915 (4) Total number of births notified 4,650 (5) Total number of births registered 5,082 Maternity and Child Welfare. The following letter was received by the Medical Officer of Health on 9th September :— " Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 8th September, 1914. Maternity and Child Welfare. Dear Sir, With reference to our circular of 30th July, a further copy of which is enclosed, I should be much obliged if you would inform me, by return of post, what action has been taken in your Borough either by the Borough Council or by voluntary agencies towards the establishment of such a scheme as is outlined in the memorandum attached to the circular. I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, (Signed) W. Mackenzie, For Assistant Secretary." The circular referred to stated, inter alia, as follows :— That an estimate had been laid before Parliament for a grant to be distributed by the Board in aid of the expenditure of local authorities and voluntary agencies in respect of institutions or other provision for maternity and child welfare. This grant, if voted by Parliament, will be made in aid of expenditure in respect of clinics, dispensaries or other institutions primarily concerned with the provision of medical and surgical C 20 advice and treatment, as well as in respect of the salaries of health visitors and other officers engaged for this work. Up to the present, local authorities, in their infant welfare work, have concerned themselves more especially with the child in its first year of life ; the matter is, however, one which needs to be dealt with on a more comprehensive basis and it is clearly desirable that there should be continuity in dealing with the whole period from before birth until the time when the child is entered upon a school register, i.e., the register of a public elementary school, nursery school, creche, day nursery, school for mothers, or other school. Extension of the existing work is accordingly needed in two directions; on the one hand it is necessary that measures should be taken for securing improved ante-natal and natal conditions, and on the other provision should be made for continuing the work in relation to children beyond the first year of life. The work of home visitation is one to which the Board attach very great importance and in promoting schemes on the lines laid down in the accompanying statement the first step should be the appointment of an adequate staff of Health Visitors. It will be desirable, at all events in the case of the larger urban authorities, to provide consultation centres which may fitly be termed Maternity Centres, to which expectant mothers and mothers with infants and little children may be referred for advice and treatment; the operation of these Maternity Centres will be rendered most effective if co-operation is secured with the midwives of the district and with any local hospital having a maternity department. It will be necessary to arrange for a medical officer to be in charge of such a Centre and for the attendance at the Centre of members of the staff engaged in home visiting. Careful records, for which the medical officer should be responsible, will need to be kept, and in regard to children the records should be in such a form that they may subsequently be available for the information of the School Medical Officer when the child is entered at a school. It is not expected that all local authorities will be able at once to initiate complete schemes, but it is important that any partial arrangements that may be made shall be such as can ultimately form part of a more extended organisation. Subject to the estimate now before Parliament being accepted by Parliament, the Board will be willing to consider applications for grants in respect of any work falling within the scope of the scheme outlined in the memorandum accompanying this letter; the grants 21 will normally amount to one-half the approved expenditure on any of these purposes, but may be less if the Board so decide. Grants to institutions of the nature of Schools for Mothers, the object of which is primarily educational, which provide training and instruction for mothers in the care and management of infants and little children, and which may include systematic classes, or home visiting, or infant consultations (the provision of specific medical and surgical advice and treatment, if any, being only incidental), will be administered by the Board of Education. Any cases of doubt or difficulty will be investigated by a Joint Committee of Officers of the two Boards, which will include women Medical Officers. In sending a copy of this circular to voluntary agencies engaged in infant welfare work, the Board will state that applications for grants in respect of voluntary work may be made by a voluntary agency either directly or through a local authority. The grant now presented to Parliament will be appropriated in aid of the expenditure of the half-year ended 30th September, 1914, and applications for grants should be accompanied by an account of the work undertaken by the authority, and by a detailed statement of the expenditure incurred, certified by the officer of the local authority in charge of the accounts. A reply was sent as follows :— " 9th September, 1914. Maternity and, Child Welfare. Dear Sir, I am duly in receipt of your letter of the 8th inst. enclosing copy of a circular of the Local Government Board, dated 30th July. This is the first communication I have received from the Board in this matter, I cannot trace any previous letter to yours, and the matter has not been considered by the Public Health and Housing Committee of this Council. At a meeting of that Committee last night, however, I mentioned that I had been and am still arranging with a member of the Poplar Infant Care Association for the visitation of expectant maternity in the wives of our Soldiers and Sailors resident in this district, whose husbands are at the War ; and that I had practically framed a scheme to work harmoniously with the health visiting in this Borough, so that cases will be visited both before and after the birth of the infant. C 2 22 So far as this Borough is concerned there are— (i.) Two paid official health visitors and a lady sanitary inspector; (ii.) The Poplar Infant Care Association which has, I believe, two paid qualified health visitors and numerous voluntary helpers; and (iii.) The College of St. Katharine, which is being established in this Borough by H.M. Queen Alexandra, to which will be attached a principal and six qualified health visitors who are also certificated midwives. It is hoped that this College will be in full working order by 1st proximo. I have interviewed the Principal of the College and have practically arranged with her for the visitation of the expectant maternity cases as mentioned above; I have also arranged with the Senior Health Visitor employed by this Council in respect of the visitation of such cases. If this scheme be successful—as no doubt it will be— I see no reason why all expectant maternity cases should not be dealt with. With regard to St. Katharine's College, it is the intention of H.M. Queen Alexandra that their health visitors shall visit cases practically until such time as the children are able to attend school, and in the event of diarrhoea occurring the health visitors will call many times each day. In view of this visitation of cases of diarrhoea, I am asking my Committee at their next meeting to recommend the Council to make diarrhoea a notifiable disease in this Borough during certain months of the year. In short, the scheme which has tentatively been arranged and which will be discussed further by a member of the Poplar Infant Care Association and myself, on Friday, is as follows :— (a) The school care committees, who feed infants, will ascertain whether mothers are expecting to be confined, and the respective care committees will forward names and addresses of such cases to me at these offices; (b) A card index system will be used here and the cases resident in the sub-districts of Poplar, Bromley and Bow will be distributed respectively to the Poplar Infant Care Association, St. Katharine's College, and this Department, such cases being undertaken by those bodies. 23 (c) To save time, these bodies will forward their information and recommendations direct to the several ward committees who at this present juncture have the consideration of relief under H.R.H. Prince of Wales' National Fund ; and at the same time copies of such information and recommendations will be forwarded to this Department by the Poplar Infant Care Association and St. Katharine's College, the same being entered in the card index system here. (d) When the statutory notification of their birth is received here the requisition for the visitation can be forwarded to the health visitor who has had the particular case in hand before the birth of the child. I will point out to the representative of the Poplar Infant Care Association that from their circular letter it is apparent the Local Government Board desire that children should be visited not only for one year, as has been previously undertaken, but until their names of the children are entered on a school register, etc., etc. I have mentioned to the Principal of St. Katharine's College, the Representative of the Poplar Infant Care Committee, and also to my Committee that for the scheme to work successfully the initiative and records must be at these offices, and I may say now that that has been practically agreed upon. Without doubt the Board have been supplied with a copy of the Rules of the College of St. Katharine, made by Viscount Haldane. I enclose herewith a set of pamphlets which are posted to all mothers in the Borough and would call your particular attention to the one— "Mother Bring Your Baby to be Weighed." I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) Fredk. Wm. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health. P.S.— I note the remarks in the Board's circular relative to securing co-operation with midwives. Up to the present I have not suggested any such co-operation, but I can quite appreciate that a circular letter can be forwarded to midwives practising in the Borough asking them to choose such cases as in their judgment would benefit by visits before and after birth." 24 On behalf of the Local Government Board, Dr. Janet E. LaneClaypon, Medical Inspector, interviewed the Medical Officer of Health and stated that the circular letter of the Local Government Board, dated 30th July, extracts from which appear in the Medical Officer of Health's Report, had been prepared quite apart from the War ; it was only a coincidence that the circular letter had been issued at the time of hostilities. The object of the circular is to deal, as far as possible, with all ante-natal cases and to follow them up to school age. It will be seen by the circular letter of the Local Government Board that an estimate has been laid before Parliament for a grant to be distributed by the Board in aid of the expenditure of local authorities and voluntary agencies in respect of institutions or other provisions for maternity and child welfare. Dr. Janet Lane-Claypon informed the Medical Officer of Health that the first instalment of this grant, for the six months ending 30th September, 1914, is now available. It is clear that this scheme was prepared before the War, and that the grant is not for necessitous maternity cases, and it is not for purposes of material benefit (for example, food), but it is in aid of expenditure in connection with clinics, dispensaries, or other institutions primarily concerned with the provision of medical and surgical advice or treatment (which includes the supply of cod liver oil, malt, drugs and very special infants' food for a brief period) as well as in respect of the salaries of the health visitors and other officers connected with this work. Therefore, it appears that the Poplar Borough Council will be entitled to receive, upon application, which should be made at once, a grant from the Local Government Board ; and it also appears that the Poplar Infant Care Association is entitled to apply for a separate grant. So far as the Poplar Borough Council is concerned the grant from the Local Government Board would help to cover the salaries of the health visitors and any expenses legitimately in connection with the health visiting work of the Public Health Department in pre-natal and post-natal cases as regards maternity or child welfare. No contribution has been received from the London County Council towards the salaries of the health visitors of the Poplar Borough Council. With regard to the Poplar Infant Care Association, application for the grant mentioned above can be made either direct or through the Poplar Borough Council. The Medical Officer of Health understood from Dr. Janet Claypon that when the application is made she would be pleased to meet the Heads of the Association, and it would appear from the work which is being carried out by the Association that they are entitled to the grant. 25 With regard to the Prince of Wales' National Relief Fund, it must be quite clearly understood that this Fund has nothing to do with the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme of the Local Government Board. The scheme, as laid down in the report of the Medical Officer of Health, refers to cases which would not only benefit from assistance under the Prince of Wales' Fund so far as the Ward and Care Committees are concerned, but also to the visiting of all ante-natal cases in the Borough of Poplar which would benefit under the conditions of the letter of the Local Government Board, dated 30th July. No relief in money or kind can be given under the Local Government Board scheme except as treatment, which includes the supply of cod liver oil, malt, drugs and very special infants' food for a brief period. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme is a valuable one, and that advantage should be taken of the proposed Government grant to extend the work of the Council's Health Visitors, in conjunction with St. Katherine's College and the Poplar Infant Care Association, in accordance with the proposals of the Medical Officer of Health as outlined in his letter to the Local Government Board, and conformably with the scheme set out in the Board's memorandum. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the Scheme of the Medical Officer of Health in connection with the Government Maternity and Child Welfare proposals be approved generally for submission to the Local Government Board ; that application be made for a grant in aid, including a moiety of the salaries of the Council's Health Visitors, and that representations be made to the Board that the Poplar Infant Care Association should participate in the Government Grant. In order that notification of expectant maternity cases may be obtained, it is desirable that there should be co-operation with the School Care Committees in the Borough. There are 40 Council Schools and 12 Non-provided Schools, each with its own Children's Care Committee. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that a copy of the Report and resolution on the subject of the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme be forwarded to each School Care Committee in the Borough with a request that the Committee will supply the Medical Officer of Health with particulars relating to expectant maternity cases, together with any suggestions of recommendations in respect of such cases. Leonard Potts, Council Offices, Town Clerk. High Street, Poplar. October, 1914. 26 It will be observed that the Local Government Board's Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme contemplates a grant not exceeding one-half of the salaries of Health Visitors, as well as of the other administrative cost of any scheme. The Council's Health Visitors were appointed on the understanding that the London County Council should contribute one-half of their salaries, but in view of the deficiency in the Exchequer Contribution Account nothing has hitherto been received from that source. The London County Council intimated, however, that the Council was now prepared to consider applications for a moiety of the Health Visitors' salaries for the year ended 31st March, 1914, and application by the Poplar Borough Council was made for such amount. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Council Offices, High Street, Poplar, Encl. 12th October, 1914. Dear Sir, or Madam, Maternity and Child Welfare. I am directed by the Council of this Borough to forward you the enclosed Heport on the above subject, and to ask that your Care Committee will be good enough to forward from time to time to the Medical Officer of Health, at the Public Health Offices, Bow Road, the fullest particulars of expectant maternity cases which may come to the knowledge of the Committee, in connection with their work at the school, together with any suggestions or recommendations they may desire to make in respect of any of such cases. Yours faithfully, Leonard Potts, Town Clerk. The Secretary, School Care Committee, School. The following letter was circularised among the registered midwives in the Borough :— 13th October, 1914. Dear Madam, Maternity and Child Welfare. I beg to enclose herewith copy of the report of the Public Health and Housing Committee which was adopted by the Council on the 8th instant. 27 If you have any ante-natal cases which you think would benefit by visits under the scheme will you kindly let me know, and also any recommendations or suggestion that you may desire to make. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) Fredk. Wm. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health. The Public Health and Housing Committee had under consideration the question of whether assistance, other than advice and medicines, should be afforded in suitable necessitous cases under the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme. Expenditure for such purpose is not at present authorized by the Local Government Board; but the Committee were of opinion that power to give sustenance to mothers, other than in Poor Law cases, would be a valuable adjunct to the scheme. If the Local Government Board approve the proposal, one-half the cost would be met by the Board from the Government Grant. The Committee recommended the Council that strong representations be made to the Local Government Board urging the pressing necessity for authorising in pre-natal and postnatal cases intended to be assisted under the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme, the provision (outside the Poor Law) of sustenance for the mother in suitable necessitious cases ; and that the cost of such provision should rank for contribution from the Government grant. The Public Health and Housing Committee had before them the reference from the Council to re-consider the position of Miss Grant and Miss Pankhurst in relation to the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme in the Borough. The following report on the Scheme was submitted to the Committee, viz.:— "After lengthy and careful consideration and discussion the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme has now crystallized The Borough has been divided into three portions—the Poplar Infant Care Association undertaking the work south of East India Dock Road; the Royal College of St. Katharine the work between East India Dock Road and Bow Road; and the necessary work in the sub-district of Bow will be performed by the two qualified Health Visitors of the Public Health Department. The sub-district of Bow contains the best residential portion of the Borough, and the greater portion of the South Ward would not require visitation, as, more especially that part west of Fairfield Road in the Central Ward, there are few streets where the services of a health visitor would be required. The Council's two Officers will therefore concentrate their energies in the North and West Wards of Bow. 28 The scheme of the Local Government Board provides for the institution of consultation centres, which may be more fitly termed 'Maternity Centres,' to which expectant mothers and mothers with infants and little children may be referred for advice and treatment, and this scheme also provides for a medical practitioner to be in attendance at such centres, and also for the attendance at the centre of members of the staff engaged in home visiting. Careful records, for which the medical officer of the centre will be responsible, will have to be kept and, in regard to children, the records should be in such form that they may be subsequently available for the information of the School Medical Officer when the child is entered at school. All this is necessary to secure recognition by the Local Government Board of the Council and the approved Associations and for their participation in the benefits of the Grant, in which is included half the salaries of the medical practitioners and qualified health visitors employed in connection with the Scheme. The Poplar Infant Care Association and the Royal College of St. Katharine have been communicated with and informed of the above facts, and they are at present considering the re-arrangement of the existing ' maternity centres ' (so that each Association may have its own ' Centres ') and the appointment of medical officers. So far as Bow is concerned, there has been a 'Maternity Centre' at the Roman Road Public Baths, where once a month, for the past two and a half years, Dr. Eleanor Gorrie, of 78, Bow Road, has voluntarily given her services, and it may be added, Dr. Gorrie has also given her services at other 'centres' in the Borough. Dr. Gorrie states that she is perfectly willing to continue to do this, and will attend once a week, instead of once a month, at the Roman Road Baths. On a yearly average there are 1,200 births occurring in Bow, of which 700 or 800 would be visited by the Council's Health Visitors, and from the experience gained during the past seven years, during which the Notification of Births Act has been in force, these two Officers and the 'maternity centre' in Bow would be sufficient for that district, more especially as the visiting work of the Council's Health Visitors has been relieved by the establishment in the Borough of St. Katharine's College with its staff of qualified health visitors. Miss Hall, the Council's Senior Health Visitor will also be able to carry out the necessary administrative work." The Public Health and Housing Committee reported to the Council that in the case of Miss Grant's settlement in Fern Street, this would not in any case be recognised by the Local Government Board, the Board being opposed to the splitting up of Districts into small areas. 29 With regard to Miss Pankhurst's organisation, the Committee pointed out that the organisations included in the scheme adopted exist primarily for purposes such as are contemplated in Maternity and Child Welfare Schemes, and the arrangements made have been completed after much careful consideration. The Committee were very strongly of opinion that the organisation, being amply sufficient for the effective conduct of the scheme, within the powers conferred by the Government scheme, should not now be altered to bring in other bodies until, at any rate, the scheme, as at present arranged, has been given a reasonable trial. The Committee reported :—"As the Council is aware, the Government scheme does not at present permit the provision of nourishment, but application has been made by the Council to the Local Government Board for such powers; meanwhile, cases in which such provision is necessary are referred to the several voluntary feeding centres. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended to the Council, that the reference be discharged. The Public Health and Housing Committee reported to the Council that in connection with the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme, it is necessary, in order to secure recognition by the Local Government Board, that a medical practitioner should be in attendance at the maternity centres, and voluntary assistance had been given by Dr. Eleanor Gorrie for two and a half years past. Dr. Gorrie was quite willing to attend at Bow once a week instead of once a month, and the Committee considered that her offer should be gratefully accepted. The Committee were of opinion, however, in view of the extension of the work, and of the fact that one-half the cost would be repaid by the Local Government Board, that a fee for her attendance should be paid to Dr. Gorrie, and recommended the Council that the continuance of Dr. Eleanor Gorrie's services as medical attendant at the Bow Maternity Centre, under the Maternity and Child Welfare Scheme, be accepted, and that the payment of fees for such attendances be adopted in principle, the amount to be subsequently agreed. Handbill—Maternity Centres and Weighing of Babies. The following handbill, which is sent to every mother upon notification of a birth, has been compiled by Miss Hall (Health Visitor) :— 30 Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. MOTHER, the Poplar Borough Council, with the assistance of the Royal College of St. Katharine and the Poplar Infant Care Association, are anxious to do all they can to help you in any difficulty you may have with your little ones, and wish to BRING to your notice the fact that there have been established throughout the Borough "Maternity Centres" (as under) to which mothers who are expecting little ones may come, or to which you may bring YOUR baby or any child under school age to consult the doctor or trained nurses who are in attendance, and obtain advice either about your own health or that of the BABY Perhaps you do not know that over 500 (five hundred) babies under one year of age die each year in your own Borough, others, who struggle on, are weak and unhealthy. This ought not TO BE and the Royal College of St. Katharine, the Poplar Infant Care Association, and the Poplar Borough Council are doing their best to prevent it, and want you to co-operate with them. Most of the deaths are due to improper feeding, mothers in their anxiety often giving the wrong thing because they think baby is not getting on. The best way to find out is to have baby WEIGHED regularly, a steady increase in weight being a sure indication that baby is thriving, and as there is a proper machine for this purpose, you are cordially invited to bring your baby to be weighed, and get advice if you need it.

Grants to Schools for Mothers and Infant Consultations The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee, viz. :— St. Pancras Borough Council. Town Clerk's Department, Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W. Dear Sir, 12th June, 1914. Grants to Schools for Mothers and Infant Consultations. On the 3rd instant the Council's Medical Officer of Health communicated with the Medical Officers of the Metropolitan City and Borough Councils as to calling a Conference of the Chairman or other Member of each Public Health Committee with the respective Town Clerks and Medical Officers to consider the above subject. The proposed Conference was convened and met here yesterday, when the following resolutions were unaminously agreed to:- (a) That in view of the fact that the work of Schools for Mothers and Infant Consultations is intimately associated with that of local sanitary authorities for the reduction of infantile mortality and sickness under the Notification of Births Act and otherwise, this Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils is of the opinion that the proposed grants to these institutions should be made by the Local Government Board through the local sanitary authorities. (b) That a copy of the foregoing resolution be forwarded at once to the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Local Government Board, and the President of the Board of Education. (c) That a copy of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to the several Metropolitan City and Borough Councils, and that they be requested to urge their local Members of Parliament to support the action taken. 32 As the matter appears to be somewhat urgent I shall be glad if your Council will, as soon as possible, communicate with the Member or Members of Parliament for your Borough requesting them to support the action taken. Yours faithfully, C. H. F. Barrett, Hon. Sec. to Conference. To the Town Clerk, Town Clerk, St. Pancras. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Committee recommended the Council that the members representing the Borough in Parliament be asked to support the action taken by the Conference. Second Health Visitor—A Resignation and an Appointment. Miss Alldritt submitted her resignation as second Health Visitor, on the occasion of her forthcoming marriage, and asked that a testimonial be granted her. Miss Alldritt proved a most capable officer, and the Committee regretted her resignation while congratulating her on the occasion, and recommended the Council that a testimonial under the Seal of the Council be given to Miss Alldritt on her resignation. Owing to the outbreak of war, alterations in the arrangements made for Miss Alldritt's marriage were necessitated, but the wedding took place on the 27th August at a few hours' notice, and the bridegroom, Mr. Giles, an engineer, left, with his ship, a few days later, for an unknown destination. Under these circumstances, Mrs. Giles asked that she be allowed to retain her position as second Health Visitor until the end of the year, or until affairs became more settled. The Committee recommended the Council that Mrs. Giles continue to act for the present as Second Health Visitor. Mrs. Giles resigned her appointment in October and Miss E. R. Wain was appointed in her stead and commenced duties on the 1st January, 1915. Infants' Milk Bill. (A Bill to ensure the Supply of Pure Mill; to certain Persons.) 1. On and after the passing of this Act it shall be the duty of the local sanitary authority to provide for the supply of pure milk, free of all adulteration as defined by any regulation made by the Board of Agriculture under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, to the persons entitled under this Act. 33 2. Any married woman or widow, or any other woman entitled to the maternity benefit provided for in section eight of the National Insurance Act, 1911, shall be entitled, on giving reasonable notice, to buy from the local sanitary authority of the borough or district in which such woman may be at the time of her confinement pure milk as provided by this Act, on condition that she shall have resided in such borough or district for a month previous to her confinement. 3. The quantities of pure milk provided in this Act shall be such quantities as such person shall require, but shall not exceed in the case of any person more than one quart per diem, and the period for which such pure milk shall be supplied shall not exceed three months from the date of the confinement of the person for whose benefit pure milk is provided, and the prices charged shall be such prices as the Local Government Board shall, by regulation made after consultation with the local sanitary authority, from time to time fix. 4. No person shall suffer any disqualification or shall suffer any disfranchisement by reason only of the provisions provided by this Bill. 5. This Act may be cited as the Infant Milk Act. 1914 OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Notifications; The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1914. Notifications of Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Seventy-five cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum were notified during the year, see Tables XXV.-XXVIII., 28 Poplar, 30 Bromley and 17 Bow. Upon receipt of a notification the case is immediately visited by one of the Health Visitors. The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1914. The Local Government Board issued an Order, dated 6th February, 1914, under Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, extending the compulsory notification of the disease to every sanitary district in England and Wales. The regulations require that certain additional information shall be given in each case beyond that required in connection with notifications under the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act. 34 In districts in which the disease is already notifiable (Poplar being one of the districts) a medical practitioner when giving a notification is required by the Regulations to furnish the additional information to which reference has been made. By Article VI. every certified midwife attending on a child whom she suspects to be suffering from the disease is required to furnish a notification unless the case has already been notified by a medical practitioner. The order came into force on the 1st April, 1914. The Board were advised that general notification of this disease is desirable. A large proportion of the blindness contracted in childhood is due to the neglect of proper precautions against the disease, and, in the Board's view, it is important that Medical Officers of Health should have early information of all cases. The following is a copy of a circular letter addressed to the Medical practitioners and midwives :— Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. (Corner of Fairfield Road). 23rd February, 1914. Enclosure. The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1914. Notification of Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Notice to Medical Practitioners and Midwives. Dear Sir or Madam, The Local Government Board have issued an Order in Reference to the notification of Ophthalmia Neonatorum, a copy of which is enclosed herewith together with a copy of the circular letter of the Board with regard to the same. The Order comes into operation on April 1st, 1914, and I would call your attention to the definition of Ophthalmia Neonatorum in Article 1 (i) of the Order—" a purulent discharge from the eyes of an infant commencing within twenty-one days from the date of its birth." Notification by Medical Practitioner. The medical practitioner will notify on the usual form in the ordinary way, but it will be seen by Article 5 of the Order that the additional information is required, and a special book of forms is being forwarded to each medical practitioner in order that he may write the necessary information on a form and attach it to the notification. Notification by Certified Midwives. Midwives will notify under Article 6 of the Order and a book of forms is being forwarded to each certified midwife for her use in notifying cases occurring in her practice. Transmission of Notifications. Under Article 7 of the Order notifications are to be forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health, Public Health Offices, Bow Road (corner of Fairfield Road), E., in sealed envelopes. I am, dear Sir or Madam, Yours faithfully, Fredk. W. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health. 35 AGE MORTALITY.

The General Purposes Committee reported that they had considered the reference to them to negotiate with the Committee of the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption for an agreement for treatment at the Dispensary of insured and non-insured cases of Tuberculosis. The General Purposes Committee appointed representatives to act in conjunction with representatives of the Public Health and Housing Committee to interview the Dispensary Committee on the subject, and the General Purposes Committee received the following report, viz. :— "Report of Joint Committee re Agreement with the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption. It will be remembered that at the last meeting, after receiving such information as was then available, three members were appointed to act with three members to the Public Health and Housing Committee in joint Conference with the Executive Committee of the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention and Treatment of Consumption, and after very careful examination of the expenditure of that institution during the year 1913, the joint Committee consider that out of the total expenditure of £2,246, a sum of £1,200 would be a fair and approximate annual sum for the Council to contribute towards the treatment of insured and non-insured patients resident within the Borough of Poplar. Of this £1,200, part will be contributed by the London County Insurance Committee, who have already offered to the Dispensary a sum of £200 which the Executive Committee of that Institution did not consider adequate. Assuming the sum of £200 were sufficient, of the remaining £1,000 fifty per cent. (£500) would be provided by the Local 56 ment Board, twenty-five per cent. (£250) by the London County Council and twenty-five per cent. (£250) would come out of rates of the Borough of Poplar. The figures, £1,200, are approximate, and it was considered by the joint Sub-Committee and the Executive Committee of the Dispensary, that at the end of each year an adjustment should be made providing always that the Council shall in no case be liable for more than fifty per cent. of the total expenditure of the Dispensary; provided also, if 50 per cent. of the expenditure of the Dispensary should in any one year not amount to the £1,200 to be paid by the Council, then the Dispensary will refund the difference. Since the meeting of the joint Sub-Committee, we have received a copy of the Annual Report of the Dispensary (which we are informed has been sent round to each member of the Council) shewing the number of patients treated at the Dispensary. Insured persons have not been treated since 30th June, 1913. Upon page 14 of this Report, under the heading of 'Attendances at the Dispensary during the year,' there were 1899 new cases and a total number of attendances of 8,310, of whom 438 patients were found to be tubercular. The Dispensary also examines free of charge, the specimens of sputum submitted to the Medical Officer of Health, for the presence of the Tubercle bacillus. The £1,200 will, of course, secure the continuance of the following among other advantages provided by voluntary support but for which public funds are not available :— As will be seen from the Report of the Dispensary, beds, bedding, etc., are loaned (page 8), and in urgent and necessitous cases food and fares are supplied (page 22); also in co-operation with other voluntary agencies, children suffering from the disease secure the advantage of admission into convalescent homes in the country (page 18). The Dispensary Nurses and Voluntary Care Committee made upwards of 1,000 visits to the homes of patients during the year. It should also be remembered that the Committee arranged and maintained a Tuberculosis exhibition for one week for educational purposes in the Borough. In any agreement which is drawn up, the Dispensary Committee will, on completion, again receive insured persons for treatment, resident in the Borough of Poplar, the payments to be made quarterly by the Borough Council to the Dispensary Treasurer, and in submitting the agreement to the Local Government Board and the London County Council, a copy of the Annual Report of the Dispensary should accompany the Agreement, as this will show that the scheme which has been working in Poplar for nearly two years 57 practically complies with the "Astor" Report and with the requirements of the Local Government Board and the London County Council. We have communicated with the Medical Officer of Health and he informs us that, from 1st February, 1913 (the date when the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912, came into operation) to January 3rd, 1914, a period of eleven months, out of an estimated population of 160,222 for the Borough, 1,057 cases of tuberculosis were notified:—Bow, 244; Bromley, 446; Poplar, 367, out of which 121 were from the Isle of Dogs; and that the eleven-monthly rate per thousand was in each case respectively:—Borough, 6.04; Bow, 5.53; Bromley, 6.37; Poplar, 6.04 (inclusive of Isle of Dogs) and Isle of Dogs, 5-98 (approximate). So far as the Isle of Dogs is concerned the means of travelling to and from the Dispensary are by motor omnibus from Cubitt Town and Millwall, and trains from North Greenwich and Poplar, and we understand from the Executive Committee of the Dispensary that where patients are unable to afford the fares, they are paid for them. We, therefore, recommend that the Council undertake the payment of the sum of £1,200 in quarterly instalments, during the year 1st April, 1914, to 31st March, 1915, and thereafter from year to year with an adjustment at the end of each year, providing always that the total payment by the Borough Council shall in no year exceed fifty per cent. of the total expenditure incurred at the Dispensary; and that an agreement be drawn up to this effect and submitted to the Council for approval and also to the Local Government Board and the London County Council, such agreement being determinable by either party giving the other six months' notice in writing to that effect." The Council had already adopted the scheme in principle and the General Purposes Committee were of opinion that the proposed contribution of the Council of £1,200 per annum is reasonable. Certain amounts will be recoverable from the Government, the London County Council and the Insurance Committee, the net cost to the Council of the proposed scheme being £250 per annum. The General Purposes Committee recommended that the scheme be approved, and submitted to the Local Government Board and London County Council for approval. On the 21st May the General Purposes Committee reported to the Council— We, your Committee, beg to report that we have further considered the scheme for Dispensary treatment of Tuberculosis in the Borough. 58 Negotiations have proceeded with the Poplar Dispensary for Prevention of Consumption, for Dispensary treatment; with the London Hospital, for linking up the Hospital with the Dispensary for consultative purposes ; with the London Insurance Committee, for treatment of insured persons at the Dispensary; and with the Local Government Board and the London County Council, as approving and contributing authorities. The Council has already approved the scheme in principle, on the basis of the following estimate :— £ Annual Contribution of Borough Council to Poplar Dispensary for Prevention of Consumption, not exceeding 50 per cent. of the expenditure incurred at the Dispensary 1,200 Less—Estimated amount to be paid by the London Insurance Committee for treatment of insured persons 200 1,000 Less—Contribution of Local Government Board, 50 per cent. 500 500 Less—Contribution of London County Council, 25 per cent. of £1,000 250 Net Contribution by Borough Council £250 A general agreement has been arrived at, and the terms are embodied in the following Draft Scheme :— Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Draft Scheme for Dispensary Treatment of Tuberculosis. The Medical Officer of Health for the Borough for the time being shall be the Chief Executive and Organising Officer in the execution of this scheme. . The Poplar Borough Council has agreed with the Committee of the Poplar Dispensary for Prevention of Consumption, for treatment at the Dispensary established by such Committee, at Alexandra House, 135, Bow Road, of cases of tuberculosis, on the following terms and conditions :— The Dispensary Committee's Medical Staff shall examine and treat as may be necessary all persons suffering or suspected to be suffering from tuberculosis, who are resident within the Borough of Poplar, and who apply voluntarily to the Dispensary, or who 59 are referred thereto by any qualified medical practitioner or by any officer of the London Insurance Committee. The Dispensary Committee shall comply with any rules which the Local Government Board may make as to dispensaries in London, and will work in co-operation with the Borough Council and the London County Council. The Dispensary Committee shall provide an adequate staff, and maintain the Dispensary in an efficient condition so as to ensure the continued approval of the Local Government Board under Section 16 (1) (a) of the National Insurance Act, 1911. The duties of the Medical Officer of the Dispensary shall include the examination of tuberculous contacts and suspects, and such Medical Officer will be prepared to visit for this purpose the homes of the patients, where this is necessary, and the officers of the Dispensary shall be available as far as practicable to undertake, under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough, the domiciliary visits and enquiries under the Tuberculosis Regulations, 1912. The Medical Officer of Health of the Dispensary shall act as consultative officer under the Local Government Board's Tuberculosis Order of 26th July, 1912, relating to domiciliary treatment of insured persons suffering from tuberculosis, and he will be available to examine insured persons resident within the Borough of Poplar applying for sanatorium benefit, and report thereon to the Insurance Committee, and attend the meetings of such Committee when required. The Medical Officer of the Dispensary shall also be available to act if required as consultant in cases of non-insured persons resident within the Borough of Poplar suffering from tuberculosis. The Medical Officer of the Dispensary shall refer any specially difficult cases to the London Hospital for consultative purpose, when necessary, in accordance with an agreement entered into with the House Committee of the London Hospital. The Dispensary shall be open for inspection at any time to the Local Government Board's officers or inspectors. Such records shall be kept at the Dispensary, as the Local Government Board, after consultation with the Insurance Commissioners, may from time to time require. The Local Government Board shall be informed of any proposed change in the ownership or management of the Dispensary or of any proposed alteration in or addition to the medical staff of the Dispensary. 60 The management of the Dispensary is vested in an Executive Committee of six members, of whom two are representatives appointed by the Borough Council and one is the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough as an ex officio member, and during the operation of the agreement with the Dispensary Committee, such proportionate representation of the Borough Council shall be continued, and if the number of members of the Dispensary Committee be at any time enlarged, the Council shall thereupon be entitled to appoint additional representatives in equal proportion. The Medical Officer of Health of the Borough for the time being shall at all times be an ex officio member of the Dispensary Committee. Separate accounts shall be kept by the Dispensary Committee of such portion of their expenditure as the Borough Council would be legally entitled to incur in the case of a dispensary established and maintained by the Council. Subject to observance by the Dispensary Committee of the conditions of the agreement, the Borough Council will pay to the Dispensary Committee a sum at the rate of one thousand two hundred pounds per annum, in four quarterly instalments, during the year ending 31st March, 1915, and thereafter from year to year, provided the total payments by the Council to the Dispensary Committee shall in no year exceed a sum equal to fifty per cent. of the total expenditure of the Dispensary Committee for such year. The agreement between the Poplar Borough Council and the Dispensary Committee shall remain in operation until determined by either of the parties thereto giving to the other six calendar months' notice to terminate such agreement. Summary of proposed agreement with the London Hospital— The Medical Officer of the Dispensary shall, when necessary refer non-pulmonary cases of tuberculosis to the London Hospital for consultation or operation, including cases of glandular, bone, joint or skin cases, tabes mesenterica, tuberculosis of the organs (such as liver, spleen, kidneys and testicle), tubercular meningitis, hydro-thorax and empyema, and such other cases whether pulmonary or non-pulmonary as he may deem desirable, and the Hospital Committee agree that any cases so referred shall be treated as may be necessary as special cases for consultative purposes, and not as ordinary out-patients at the London Hospital. The first 25 of such cases in any year will be treated free of charge, a capitation fee of 2s. 6d. per case to be paid for additional cases. 61 The Dispensary Committee agree to afford, at the discretion of the Medical Officer of the Dispensary, facilities for medical students from the London Hospital (and especially post-graduate men) to visit the Dispensary for the purpose of enlarging their knowledge of tubercular diseases, and of becoming acquainted with the equipment and organisation of a tuberculosis dispensary. The agreement may be determined by six calendar months' notice. The Insurance Committee for the County of London are prepared, subject to the consent of the Insurance Commissioners, to enter into an agreement with the Council to provide treatment for the period to 31st December, 1914, at the Dispensary, for persons recommended by the Committee for sanatorium benefit, and in consideration thereof to contribute towards the cost of maintenance of the Dispensary, subject to certain conditions, such a sum as is represented by the proportion which the number of attendances made by insured persons bears to the total number of attendances made at the Dispensary, together with an agreed sum in respect of other services rendered to the Committee not specifically referred to in the conditions. It is anticipated experience during the limited period contemplated may enable an arrangement to be made for a fixed sum over a period of years in accordance with the suggestions of the Local Government Board. The General Purposes Committee recommended the Council that the draft scheme for dispensary treatment of tuberculosis in the Borough be approved, and that the Seal of the Council be affixed to the necessary agreements to give effect thereto. The Dispensary has now been in full working order for nearly two years, and Dr. Cullen, the Tuberculosis Officer, reported that 64 consumptive patients during the year 1914 had been brought back to working capacity as the result of treatment at the Dispensary; 21 of these patients were under tuberculin injections. No deaths under tuberculin treatment occurred. In all probability, but for the Dispensary, many of these patients would have been dead, and their dependents on the rates.

The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 5th February, 1914. Sir, With reference to previous correspondence on the subject of the provision of dispensary treatment for uninsured persons suffering from tuberculosis, I am to ask that the Council may be informed what steps, if any, the Borough Council proposes to take to obtain, from those patients who can afford to pay for treatment received, reimbursement of the expenditure incurred in providing that treatment. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Laurence Gomme, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. It has been the practice at the Bow Road Dispensary not to treat patients able to pay for treatment, and to communicate with the medical practitioner concerned in cases where patients who apply for treatment are already under medical care. The Committee were of opinion that in cases in which uninsured patients treated at the Dispensary are able to pay, the Council should take steps to recover the cost of treatment when the necessary agreement with the Dispensary Committee has been completed. The Committee were further of opinion, however, that consumption being a disease in which treatment is required over prolonged periods, it would be only in very exceptional cases that residents would be in a position to pay for Dispensary treatment. The Committee recommended that the Council do concur in this opinion, and the London County Council be so informed. 65 Treatment of Tuberculosis—Local Scheme for Dispensary Treatment—Poplar. Extract from Minutes of the London County Council at a meeting held, on Tuesday, 13th October, 1914, at 2.30. 2. The Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council, in connection with the dispensary treatment of tuberculosis persons in the borough, proposes to utilise the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption, an institution opened in April, 1912, which has been supported entirely by voluntary contributions. The borough council's scheme provides for the examination and treatment of tuberculous persons in the borough, and for the examination of contacts and suspects either at the dispensary or in the home. The dispensary is linked up with the London Hospital, to which doubtful and specially difficult cases are referred. The total annual expenditure of the dispensary is estimated as £2,246, and the scheme provides that the borough council shall pay to the dispensary committee a sum at the rate of £1,200 a year on condition that such payment shall in no year exceed 50 per cent. of the total expenditure of the dispensary committee during that year. We are of opinion that this is a saisfactory arrangement, and on the assumption that 85 per cent. of the persons treated will be uninsured, and that the Council contributes one-fourth of the cost of their treatment the expenditure falling on the county fund will not exceed £255 during the current year. The borough council proposes to take steps to recover the cost of treatment of uninsured persons in those cases in which the patients are able to pay, but it is anticipated that such cases will be very exceptional. The agreement between the borough council and the authorities of the London Hospital provides that the first 25 cases referred in any year from the dispensary to the hospital shall be treated free of charge, and that, in respect of any additional cases, a fee of 2s. 6d. shall be paid. The borough council assumes that not more than 25 cases will be so referred during the year, and no provision is made in the estimate in respect of any expenditure under this head. We considered whether the needs of the persons residing in the Isle of Dogs required special consideration, having regard to the fact that this area is to a great extent cut off by the docks from the rest of the borough, and it occurred to us that it might be desirable for a clause to be inserted in the agreement with the dispensary committee to the effect that, if found necessary, they would provide a small branch dispensary for the convenience of these persons. The borough council 66 states, however, that this point was considered, but the provision suggested was not deemed necessary, having regard to the adequate travelling facilities. In the circumstances, we are of opinion that the borough council's proposals may be approved, subject to certain conditions relative to the keeping of records, etc. We recommend :— (a) That the proposals of the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council as set out in the statement (No. 1) separately submitted by the Public Health Committee, on 13th October, 1914, for the provision of dispensary treatment for persons within the borough, suffering from tuberculosis, be approved as part of a comprehensive scheme for London, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) That the borough council agrees to observe the principles Nos. IV., V., VII. and VIII. specified in the resolution No. 1 (a) of 18th November, 1913 (p. 1087). (ii.) That the Council's approval is in respect of the year ending 31st March, 1915. (b) That, subject to the payment by the Local Government Board of a grant of one-half of the cost of the dispensary treatment of uninsured persons in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar suffering from tuberculosis, and subject to the provisions of the foregoing resolution (a) a contribution be made from the county fund amounting to one-half of the cost which would otherwise have to be defrayed out of the funds of the borough in respect of the treatment of such persons during the year ending 31st March, 1915, provided that such contribution shall not exceed £255. Treatment of Tuberculosis—Scheme for London. The following letter has been received from Dr. Hamer, the Medical Officer of Health for the County of London, and a copy of the reply is appended :— [Copy.] London County Council, Public Health Department. 10th September, 1914. Circular to Medical Officers of Health, London Boroughs. Dear Sir, I enclose herewith a supply of Form A and B for use in connection with the nomination of cases recommended for sanatorium treatment under the Council's scheme. Yours faithfully, W. H. Hamer, The Medical Officer of Health, Medical Officer. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. 67 [Copy of Reply.] Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Department, Bow Road, E. 11th September, 1914. Tuberculosis. Dear Sir, Adverting to my letter of the 11th ultimo, to which I have received no reply, I am this morning in receipt of yours of the 10th instant enclosing a supply of Forms A and B. In order to save time, I shall be glad to hear from you what particular cases, at the present time, of uninsured persons, would be eligible for partaking of the benefits of the Council's scheme. I have an extract before me of the Minutes of the London County Council of 26th May, 1914, giving the reports of the Public Health Committee for 30th April, and 7th and 21st May. On page 8, I notice "Selection of Cases," and I shall be much obliged if you will inform me whether there has been any further report of your Public Health Committee, or whether a memorandum has been issued as to the type of case suitable for the various forms of institutional treatment. I presume that these forms will also refer to patients who have exhausted their Insurance benefits. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) Fredk. Wm. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health. Dr. Hamer, London County Council, 2, Savoy Hill, W.C. The following letter has been received :— [Copy.] London County Council, Public Health Department, 2, Savoy Hill, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 18th September, 1914. " Dear Dr. Alexander, With reference to your letter of the 11th inst., I have to say that the Advisory Board, which it is contemplated under the Scheme of the Council will specify the type of case for sanatorium treatment, has not yet been appointed. In the meantime, borough medical officers of health are invited to nominate persons who, from the particulars set out on forms A. and B. appear to be suitable for sanatorium treatment, and to forward the papers to this office. Such cases will then be considered on their f 68 merits and will be sent to a suitable institution as vacancies arise. At the moment there are no vacancies, but it is desired to have in hand a number of suitable cases in order that vacancies may be immediately filled. Uninsured persons are all persons who are not entitled to sanatorium treatment as insured persons under the National Insurance Act. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) W. H. Hamer, Medical Officer of Health. F. W. Alexander, Esq., L.R.C.P., Borough of Poplar." Insurance Committee for the County of London and Services of the Tuberculosis Officer. On 4th September a letter was received from the Clerk of the Insurance Committee for the County of London, with reference to the Town Clerk's letter of 18th June last that the services of the Tuberculosis Officer of the Poplar Dispensary would be available for any purpose required by the Insurance Committee, that he had been directed to state that the Committee now propose to refer to him (the Tuberculosis Officer) for examination all applications received from insured persons residing within the Borough; and that he would be glad to know whether such applications should be forwarded direct to Dr. Cullen. The Medical Officer of Health replied that it would be desirable to forward such applications direct to Dr. Cullen, at the Dispensary, 135, Bow Road.

(A Bill to amend the Law relating to the Registration of Deaths and to Burials.) The object of this Bill is to give effect to the principal recommendations put forward in 1893 by the Select Committee on Death Certification (House of Commons Paper, 373, of 1893), and intended to guard against (1) crime, and (2) premature burial. The Committee reported that they were much impressed " with the " serious possibilities implied in a system which permits death and burial " to take place without the production of satisfactory medical evidence of " the cause of death. It is a most important duty of society to guard its " members against foul play, and it appears to your Committee that, as fur " as may be, it should be made impossible for any person to disappear " from his place in the community without any satisfactory evidence being " obtained of the cause of his disappearance. Your Committee, fortified " with the weighty opinions of the witnesses who have appeared before " them, have arrived at the conclusion that uncertified deaths should, as a " class, cease to exist, and that means should be devised, whereby a medical " certificate should be obtained in every case not certified by a registered " medical practitioner in attendance." The Departmental Committee on Coroners, which sat in 1009, in their Second Report (page 20), state that . . . . "It is no fault of "the law if premature burials do not take place. The present law of death "certification offers every opportunity for premature burial and every "facility for the concealment of crime. "In connection with the law of coroners, we think that . a certificate of death should not be accepted, from a medical practitioner unless it slates that he has, by personal inspection of the body, satisfied himself as to the fact of death. At present he may certify merely on the information given by the relatives, and we have had evidence that many certificates have been carelessly or even recklessly given." During the seven years, 1907 to 1913 inclusive, there were 47,911 deaths in England, and Wales, the causes of which were not certified. 94 The following death rates* for the year 1914 are interesting when compared with one another :— Annual Rate per 1,000 persons living.

The percentage on the total (admission) scarlet fever cases was 3.76, diphtheria cases 6.25 and enteric fever cases 12.00. Among the 23 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 2 chicken pox, 1 measles, 2 tonsillitis, 2 rotheln, and 2 erythema. Among the 18 cases wrongly certified as diphtheria were 12 of tonsillitis, and 1 Vincents angina. One case was scarlet fever and not diphtheria.

Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of typhoid fever and also sputum from suspected tuberculous patients bacteriologically examined. (See pages 156, 142 and 46). Arrangements are still made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the medical officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. Two cases of scarlet fever were connected with milkshops in Poplar. Two cases of scarlet fever, one of diphtheria and four measles were connected with milkshops in Bromley. One case of scarlet fever and one of measles were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.* Forty premises with outworkers were † connected with infectious cases notified, six in Poplar, twelve in Bromley, and twenty-two in Bow— eleven scarlet fever, eight diphtheria, two erysipelas, 18 measles and one of cerebro-spinal meningitis. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and.110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Eighteen cases of measles were connected with out-workers' premises—three Poplar, four Bromley, and eleven Bow. For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 134. London County Council and suggestion of new "Order" to the Local Government Board re Infectious Diseases. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 18th March, 1014. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state for the information of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, that the Board * See page194. † See page 183. 112 have received a representation from the London County Counci that it should be made the duty of the Medical Officers of Health of the City of London, the Port of London Sanitary District, and each Metropolitan Borough to— (a) "notify the County Medical Officer of Health forthwith on the occurrence of cases of plague, cholera, small-pox or any epidemic disease," and (b) " furnish him with any subsequent information elicited in the course of enquiry," and I am to request that the Board may be furnished with the observations of the Metropolitan Borough Council upon the subject. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. J, Willis, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the matter and reported to the Council:— "If it is intended that outbreaks, as distinct from individual cases, should be included in the proposed Order, these appear to be already sufficiently dealt with under the Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1801, Article XVIII., paragraphs 16 and 17, which require reports to the Local Government Board and the London County Council. ,,If individual cases, however, are meant, there seems to be no necessity, so far as the commoner diseases are concerned, for an Order imposing upon the Medical Officer of Health the routine duty of notifying and reporting, having regard to the labour that would be entailed, both upon the Borough Councils and the London County Council, and the infinitesimal advantage to be obtained; moreover the information if required by the London County Council, may be obtained by them from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, to whom notifications are sent, and who make weekly lists of the notifications received from all London. In the case of cholera, plague and small-pox, there seems to be no necessity for an Order, since the Medical Officers of Health are accustomed and have expressed their willingness to notify the County Medical Officer of Health forthwith upon the occurrence of cases." The Committee recommended the Council that representations, to the effect stated, be made to the Local Government Board. 113 Metropolitan Asylums Board—Accommodation. On June 20th notice was received from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board that in view of the increasing number of scarlet fever patients requiring to be admitted to the Board's Hospitals and of the necessity of having sufficient accommodation for such patients, the admission of cases of measles and whooping cough had had to be temporarily suspended. The Medical Officer of Health as Sanitary Adviser to the Military Authorities. The Public Health and Housing Committee approved acceptance by the Medical Officer of Health of the honorary position of Sanitary Adviser to the Military Authorities in respect of any encampments or billeting in the Borough. Precautions—Civil and Military. A letter was received from the Headquarters (London District) Horse Guards as to whether a shelter would be available at which soldiers can be temporarily isolated if they have been exposed to infection from small-pox, and the Public Health and Housing Committee directed the Council's shelter be offered for the purpose, subject to payment of additional costs (if any) incurred in connection with such cases. The Local Government Board directed attention to the fact that, under present conditions, the introduction of small-pox is not unlikely, and emphasizes the importance of having in immediate readiness adequate arrangements for dealing with any cases that may appear. In a memorandum, the Board pointed out that it is by vaccination and re-vaccination that the spread of small-pox can be most effectually prevented, and asked that Sanitary Officers should assist in the administration of the Vaccination Acts by spreading a knowledge of the advantages of vaccination and re-vaccination. The precautions suggested: of disinfection of infected houses and things, and isolation of the sick and contacts, are already effectively provided for in this Borough. Bathing and Wash-house facilities for Soldiers. A letter was received from the Lieut.-Col. at the Horse Guards asking whether the Poplar Borough Council would extend to soldiers the privilege of using the Public Baths and Wash-houses without charge. The Baths and Wash-houses Committee raised no objection to the free use of the Public Baths within the Borough at stated times, 114 Nurses Registration Bill. A Bill to regulate the Qualifications of Trained Nurses and to provide for their registration. This Bill has been prepared at the instance of the Central Committee for the State Registration of Trained Nurses, which represents by delegation the British Medical Association, the Matrons' Council of Great Britain and Ireland, the Royal British Nurses' Association, the Society for the State Registration of Trained Nurses, the Fever Nurses' Association, the Association for the Promotion of the Registration of Nurses in Scotland, the Scottish Nurses' Association, and the Irish Nurses' Association, comprising not less than 30,000 medical practitioners and nurses. Hitherto no minimum standard of knowledge for professional nurses has been defined or enforced. The object of the Bill is to ensure that the community shall have a guarantee that the nurses they employ are skilled in their professional duties, and through standardisation to give security to the public that the services of fully qualified nurses shall be readily obtainable. The Bill establishes a "General Council for the Registration of Nurses in the United Kingdom,"composed of persons appointed by the Privy Council, the Local Government Boards in the United Kingdom, associations of registered medical practitioners, and direct representatives of the nursing profession. The duties and powers of this Council are defined in clause 10 of the Bill; amongst the most important of them are the standardisation of training, and the examination and registration of nurses. In 1905 a Select Committee of the House of Commons on registration of nurses, which took evidence during two sessions, unanimously reported that "Your committee are agreed that it is desirable that a register of nurses should be kept by a central body appointed by the State."

A total 1,224 gallons were supplied to four London County Council Public Elementary Schools for spraying and cleansing floors of class rooms. Swimming Baths, the use therein of the Electrolytic Fluid. The fluid continues to be added to the water in the swimming baths in the same quantity and strength as mentioned in the Annual Report for the year 1909, viz., 1 part of Chlorine to 2,000,000 parts of water. 9,340 gallons were supplied to the Poplar Baths, 9,043 gallons to the Bow Baths and 2,800 gallons to the Island Baths, making a total of 21,183 gallons. The Baths Superintendents repeat their statements that the addition of the fluid prevents the formation of slime in the water, the slime is not found at the bottom of the baths when they are emptied, and there is no offensive smell when the baths are being cleansed. It should be said that the electrolytic fluid in the Poplar Baths is not used with the idea of rendering unnecessary periodic changes of the pond water, but to keep the water in the pond fresh and free from harmful organisms all the time it is in use. The class of persons who use the swimming ponds in Poplar is always likely to contain uncleanly or infected individuals, and it is to guard against danger from the latter that the fluid finds its chief application. At Poplar the electrolytic fluid costs in its preparation about £2 per 1,000 gallons, or a little less than ½d. per gallon. Thirty gallons are added to a swimming pond of 85,000 gallons capacity on first filling, and subsequent additions are made as required, at intervals of two or three days. Comments on Adverse Criticisms respecting the process. See annual report, 1911. At Poplar, the hypochlorite of magnesia solution is prepared by the electrolysis of Water Board water, containing certain definite proportions of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride. 130 In spite of adverse criticisms, the process has been a success for eight years.* Hypochlorite of magnesium belongs to the magnesia and not to the alkali group. It is not caustic, is non-poisonous, and to the clothes is the least destructive of all the hypochlorites. It is obvious that the stable solutions of electrolytically-made hypochlorites of magnesium are preferable to those of sodium and potassium or even calcium, because for the purposes of rendering the three last mentioned solutions stable there would have to be used hydroxide of the metals of the alkali or the alkaline earth calcium, which are extremely caustic, alkaline, and very soluble, and where varying strengths of electrolytic fluid, containing the hypochlorites of sodium and potassium, are produced, one may add too much or too little of the hydroxides of the alkalies when working with unskilled labour. But when the extremely insoluble hydroxide or oxide of magnesium is added and mixed, one can add and stir in any quantity, but only the necessary amount will be absorbed. VERMINOUS CHILDREN ATTENDING SCHOOLS.† LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1907, CHILDREN ACT, 1908. Number of Verminous Children Bathed ; Itch Cases. Re-infesting of School Children and the Purchasing of Secondhand Wearing Apparel. Number of Verminous Children Bathed. The following numbers of children were cleansed, during the year ended 31st December, at the Council's Cleansing Station, Glaucus Street, under an agreement renewed with the London County Council 28th August 1912, by which the London County Council make payment to the Poplar Borough Council at the rate of two shillings per cleansing, such payment to cover any number of attendances of the child for a period of one calendar month from the date of the first cleansing, viz. :— * In addition to the plants already supplied to the British War Office and Admiralty, plants have been sent to Finland, Buenos Aires, Rangoon and Guernsey. The Gateshead Municipal Corporation have also erected a plant and a large plant has been installed for the Portsmouth Corporation. It is interesting to note that in the last case, the fluid to be electrolysed is sea-water itself which, of course, is close at hand, and a ready and powerful disinfectant is manufactured by this process without cost of materials but merely that of electric current. One feels sure that, when this is generally known, without doubt. other seaside towns will follow the example of Portsmouth, and afford an unlimited supply of a disinfectant for municipal purposes for the benefit of the health of the townspeople and visitors. Whilst this report is being written small plant is on order for Finchley. † Verminous Rooms, London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, see page 229. 131 Quarter. Total number of Cleanings.

Miss Tattersall made 932 visits in connection with verminous school children—203 Poplar, 457 Bromley, and 272 Bow. Re-infesting of School Children and the purchasing of Secondhand Wearing Apparel. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from Hackney Borough Council, calling attention to the re-infesting of school children who had been cleansed at the Council's Cleansing Station. Enquiries show that this is to a large extent due to purchase of second-hand clothing at ragshops and other places, and it is suggested that the sale of wearing apparel from rag-shops should be prohibited by law, and offers made to sterilize second-hand clothing before use. The Committee recommended the Council that the Local Government Board and the London County Council be informed that the Council is of opinion that the sale of wearing apparel from rag-shops should be prohibited by law and that notices be circulated in the Borough pointing out the necessity for sterilizing second-hand wearing apparel before use, and undertaking such sterilization gratuitously, on application. The following letter was addressed to pawnbrokers and dealers in second-hand wearing apparel:— J 132 Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. February, 1915. Dear Sir, or Madam, At the meeting of the Poplar Borough Council, held on 28th January, 1915, the following resolution was passed by the Council— That notices be circulated in the Borough pointing out the necessity for sterilizing second-hand wearing apparel before use, and undertaking such sterilization gratuitously, on application. I have therefore to inform you that if you desire any secondhand wearing apparel to be sterilized or disinfected, if you will apply to these offices in writing, the necessary operation will be carried out as promptly as possible. Yours faithfully, Fredk. Wm. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health. Itch Cases. Six boys with itch were bathed and their clothes disinfected. Miss Tattersall made 76 visits in connection with children suffering from itch—20 Poplar, 33 Bromley and 23 Bow. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. The Council is empowered by the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, to give any person applying, on the ground that he is infested with vermin, free use of any apparatus for cleansing his person and clothing, and may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants for this purpose. Provision was made in 1905 for cleansing verminous persons. During the year 202 persons (including 190 from Common Lodging Houses—see below) had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfested. Since the notices were posted throughout the Borough, a total of 5,478 persons, exclusive of non-residents, had applied for baths, etc., as mentioned above. 133 VERMINOUS PERSONS IN COMMON LODGING HOUSES, LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1907.

The agreement with the London County Council for the cleansing at the Borough Council's Cleansing Station, of verminous inmates of common lodging-houses, expired on the 22nd July, 1912, and it was renewed for a period of three years. The agreement provides that the Council shall cleanse free of charge any inmate of a common lodging-house in the Borough, and at a charge to the County Council of one shilling any inmate of a common lodginghouse outside the Borough, sent to the Cleansing Station by the London County Council.

It had been found in some cases that Form Q, set forth in the Schedule to the Vaccination Order. 1910, has been read as implying that a statutory declaration under Section 1 of the Vaccination Act, 1907. is valid if made within seven days after the child is four months old. This is not the case. The Act requires that the declaration shall be made within four months from the birth of the child, and that it shall be delivered or sent by post to the Vaccination Officer of the district within seven days thereafter. The Local Government Board have now issued an Order, dated 10th October, 1914, rescinding the Order of 1910, and substituting a new Form Q for the Form which was prescribed by that Order. 142 A paragraph has been added inviting the parent to inform the Vaccination Officer if he proposes to have the child vaccinated by some doctor other than the Public Vaccinator. In cases where the request is complied with, the Vaccination Officer should add a footnote to Form H informing the Public Vaccinator of the fact, so that the Public Vaccinator in arranging his visits may be aware of the expressed intention of the parent, and may be able to defer his visit to those parents if for the convenience of his practice he should desire to do so.

Ten cases of Typhoid Fever were stated by the patients or their friends to be due to eating shellfish, as follows:— * While this report is being written The Public Health (Shellfish) Regulations, 1915, have been issued by the Local Government Board, and they will come into operation on 1st March, 1915. By Article II(2) of the Regulations "the Local Authority may require any fishmonger supplying shellfish in the district to furnish to the Medical Officer of Health, within a reasonable time fixed by them, a list of all the layings, so far as, with the exercise of due diligence, he can ascertain them, from which his supply of shellfish is derived or has been derived during the six weeks last preceding the date of the requirement, together with any information in his possession which will assist the Medical Officer of Health in ascertaining the particular laying or layings from which the suspected shellfish were derived, and, if the supply or any part of it is obtained through any other fishmonger, may make a similar requisition upon that fishmonger, and a fishmonger on whom such a requisition is made shall comply with the requisition." Machinery is provided by the Regulations for the closing of shellfish layings in regard to which there is evidence to show that shellfish from such layings have actually caused infectious or other disease, or are likely to be a source of danger to public health. The power to close layings is vested by the Order in the Sanitary Authority in the district in which the layings are situated, and a right of appeal to the Board is provided for in the particular case specified in Articles VI. and XI. of the Regulations. The Sanitary Authority of the district in which the layings are situated are required to take action on receipt of a representation from another Local Authority, in whose district the shellfish are consumed, indicating that the shellfish have caused or are likely to cause infectious or other disease, or, on the report of their own Medical Officer of Health, if such shellfish are found in their own district. Apart from any representation from another district, the Medical Officer of Health of every district in which shellfish are laid should examine the conditions of the layings in his district and should report to the Local Authority any cases in which the layings are so situated as to be liable to dangerous contamination, with a view to steps being taken under the Regulations to prevent shellfish being distributed for sale for human consumption from such layings unless the shellfish have been relaid in fresh water for a period sufficient to free them from contamination. The Board are advised that, as a general rule, the period of relaying required to rid shellfish of micro-organisms should not be less than a fortnight. 150 Mo. Date. Age. Sex. Address.

Suggested Notification of Zymotic Enteritis (Summer Diarrhoea). In order that the work of the district may fully benefit by the efforts of the Royal College of St. Katharine, it was considered that the Council should request the Local Government Board to approve an order, under section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requiring the notification within the Borough of Poplar of cases of Zymotic Enteritis (Summer Diarrœa), such order to be in force for a period of four months, June to September, in each year.

(Statutory notice was given of the above proposal on 5th October, 1914.) The Council resolved that the before mentioned Order be submitted to the Local Government Board for approval. On the 8th October the Council made an Order under Section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to put into operation in the Borough Section 55 of the Act for compulsory notification of Zymotic Enteritis (Summer Diarrhœa) with the exception of the provision of the Section requiring a copy of any certificate to be sent to the head teacher of the school attended by the patient or by any child who is an inmate of the same house. The Local Government Board, however, pointed out that the Act contains no provision for such exception, and suggests the Council should pass a fresh resolution omitting this limitation. Statutory notice of intention to make such order was necessary and the Public Health and Housing Committee therefore gave notice that at the meeting of the Council to be held on Thursday, January 14th, 1915, the Public Health and Housing Committee would propose that the following Order be made and submitted to the Local Government for approval, viz. :— That the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar being satisfied that summer weather is favourable to the prevalence and development of Zymotic Enteritis or Epidemic Diarrhoea, and of the necessity for any cases which may occur being notified, do hereby make an Order that for a period of four calendar months from the 31st day of May, 1915, and for the same period in each succeeding year, or until such Order be revoked or varied, Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, be applied in the said Borough of Poplar to the infectious disease known and described as Zymotic Enteritis or Epidemic Diarrhœa. The Local Government Board have approved the Order made by the Poplar Borough Council on the 14th January, extending the application of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the Borough to Zymotic Enteritis or Epidemic Diarrhœa, for a period of four calendar months from the 31st May, 1915, and for the same period in each succeeding year. 169 INQUESTS AND DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE.

Inspections of the premises in Poplar were made and it was reported that there were no objections to be made to the granting or renewal of licenses, so far as the Poplar Public Health Department was concerned. 174 CANAL BOATS. For the year ended 31st December, 1914, the inspections and reports of the Inspectors respecting registered canal boats and non-registered canal boats were as follows:— Non- Registered. Registered. Mr. J. Bullock, East Combined Division - *Mr. J. Johnson, West Combined Division - Mr. C. Foad, Poplar South Division - Mr. H. J. Langley, Bromley North Division — 41 Mr. R. E. Miners, Bromley Central Division 5 12 Mr. A. J. Field, Bow East Division 6 — Mr. W. Boyce, Bow West Division — 54 11 107 *Mr. Johnson reported that on each occasion when passing the portion of canal in his district no canal boats have been observed. WORKSHOPS,* WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES AND OUTWORKERS, Registers and Inspections; Employment and Distress; Underground Workrooms Bill (H.L.); Children Bill; Children (Employment and School Attendance) Bill; Eight Hours Working Day Bill ; Daylight Saving Bill; Weekly Restday Bill; The Shops Bill. Registers and Inspections. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 178 and 180. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,397, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 178, and Tables C and D, pages 182 and 183. * See Footnote, page 175. 175 The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 274 and 275 and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 237-208. For out workers connected with infectious cases, see pages 111 and 183. * A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 182-185) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops,* and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. Employment and Distress. The following letter was forwarded to be dealt with by the Public Health Department. Intelligence Department, (Copy.) Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 10th September, 1914. Dear Sir, The Committee which has been appointed by the President of the Local Government Board to collect information as to conditions of employment and distress in the Metropolis is desirous of obtaining information which is gathered by the Medical Officer and his staff of inspectors and visitors on the following matters: (a) the nutrition of children under school age and how far it is affected by conditions arising out of the war ; (b) unemployment or distress among home workers, especially in the cabinet making and clothing trades. * To wit, in Table A, under "Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 8 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were "Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 176 The Intelligence Department would be much obliged if your Council would see their way to arrange that the Medical Officer of Health should make for the use of the Committee a brief monthly report on these subjects. It is not desired that he or any of his officers should undertake special research in the matter but simply that he should make a short report on what is ascertained in the ordinary course of duty. It will be convenient if the first report is made at the end of this month. Yours faithfully, (Signed) K. I. Gibbon. The Town Clerk. Instructions were therefore issued to the staff to furnish, without fail, at the end of each month, any information which may have been obtained in regard to the subject-matter of the above letter. Underground Workrooms Bill. A Bill to regulate the use of Underground Workrooms. This Bill seeks to enact that no underground room in a factory, workshop or workplace shall be used for the purpose of any of the processes or occupations specified unless duly certified by the Council to be suitable. This Bill was considered by the General Purposes Committee and it would appear that an underground room unconnected with a factory, etc., would not come under the Bill. The Committee were of opinion the Bill should be amended to include such a room, and recommended the Council that representations be made to the local Members of Parliament on the subject. Children Bill. A Bill to provide for the more effectual treatment and prevention of Destitution and Sickness among Children, and to regulate the Hours and Conditions of Labour among Children. Children (Employment and School Attendance) Bill. [As amended by standing committee A.] A Bill to amend the Law in respect of the Employment of Children and their Attendance at School. 177 The principal changes in the existing law proposed by this Bill are— A. Limitation of powers of local education authorities: (1) No exemption from school attendance allowed for children under thirteen years of age; (2) Restrictions in exemption above thirteen. B Extension of powers of local education authorities: (1) Optional powers granted to extend school leaving age to fifteen; (2) Optional powers granted to make employment bye-laws for children up to age of sixteen (instead of fourteen as at present). C. Abolition of exsiting half-time system. D. Restriction on street trading. This Bill renews proposals passed by Standing Committees of the House of Commons in 1912 in the Education (School Attendance) and the Employment of Children Bills. The chief objects of this Bill not contained in those Bills are the transference of the duty of approving bye-laws relating to the employment of children from the Home Office to the Board of Education, and the raising to fifteen of the school leaving age and the minimum age for boys engaged in street trading. Eight Hours Working Day Bill. A Bill to limit the Hours of Employment to Eight per Day. Daylight Saving Bill. A Bill to promote the earlier use of Daylight in certain Months yearly ; and for other purposes in relation thereto. Weekly Rest-Day Bill. A Bill to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to Sunday employment, and to regulate the conditions of Labour upon the basis of six Working Days in the Week with Sunday as the normal Rest-Day, and for other purposes connected therewith. The object of this Bill is to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to Sunday employment and to regulate the conditions of labour upon the basis of six working days in the week with Sunday as the normal rest-day, having regard to present-day social and industrial conditions. 178 By clause 1, Sunday employment is made generally unlawful, both for a person who is himself carrying on an occupation and for persons employed by him. Clause 2 deals with the Sunday closing of shops. Clause 3 enables certain occupations of necessity or mercy (specified in the First Schedule) to be carried on upon a Sunday. By clause 4 a local authority is given power, with respect to such occupations only as are specified in the Second Schedule, to make orders permitting them on Sunday, on the grounds of necessity or mercy, and to grant exemptions to Jews who observe Saturday as the weekly rest-day. Under clause 5, the Home Secretary may supervise the powers of the local authority as to the making of orders, and may add occupations to, or withdraw them from, the Second Schedule. By clause 6 it is provided that in cases of employment on Sunday, with certain necessary exceptions, an equivalent period of rest shall be given within the week, and that no person shall be employed on more than 26 Sundays in the year. The remaining clauses contain the necessary machinery for carrying the Act into effect. The Shops Bill. A Bill to amend the Shops Act, 1912; the expression "shop" to include any premises where any retail or wholesale business is carried on, and any premises, warehouses, or offices (other than factories, workshops or laundries, or premises connected with mining or railway undertakings) where persons are employed for hire; the Bill defines "hours of employment and meal times" and "employment," and provides for a " universal half-holiday."

East London Soap Works Soap Boilers. 241, Old Ford Road 1 80, White Post Lane Fat Melters. 31, White Post Lane Messrs. C. & B. Webb, Yeo Street Tallow melters and bone boilers. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 9.— Fish Curers and Vendors of Frted Fish—Bye-Laws. The Bye-laws provide as follows:— Fish Curers. No person suffering from infectious disease may assist in preparation, storage or distribution. Gutting, cleansing and curing (otherwise than by drying or smoking) to be carried on in a room or place with roof (if clone in wet weather), such room to be adequately lighted. Area of windows or openings to be equal to l-10th of floor area, half to be made to open. Openings to be provided for permanent ventilation: walls and floor, so far as necessary to prevent absorption of filth, to be made of impervious material, and drainage to be provided. Precautions to be adopted to prevent effluvium arising, and the work not to be done in any place in which animals or poultry are kept. Means for securing personal cleanliness to be provided. 191 Vessels with closely fitting covers to be provided for garbage, and to be kept clean. Floors, walls and ceilings to be kept in repair and limewashed four times a year. Kilns for smoking or drying to be of proper fireproof materials and fumes to be effectually conveyed away. Impervious material for gutting surfaces to be provided. Vats or tanks for salting, etc., to have impervious interior surface. (These bye-laws were allowed by the Local Government Board, 28th February, 1014). Vendor or Fried Fish. Similar provisions are made as in the case of a fish curer, and, in addition baskets, etc., in an offenisve condition which have contained wet fish are not to be kept on the premises more than 24 hours; fish to be thoroughly gutted and cleansed before frying. (These bye-laws were allowed by the Local Government Board, 28th February, 1914.) The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the reference back from the Council of their recommendation that they should be empowered to act on behalf of the Council in respect of any proceedings which it might be necessary to take to enforce the Bye-laws made by the London County Council for regulating the businasses of Fish Curer and Fried Fish Vendor. The Bye-laws in question had been under consideration for several years past and the revised draft of the present Bye-laws was finally approved by the Borough Council on 5th June, 1913. Copies of the Bye-laws were forwarded to members of the Council. The Bye-laws had been approved by the Home Secretary and are now in operation. It is the duty of the Borough Council to administer the Bye-laws, and in default the London County Council may take any proceedings necessary and recover the cost from the Borough Council. It is desirable the Public Health and Housing Committee should be empowered to authorise any necessary proceedings to be taken under the Bye-laws, and they repeated their recommendation to the Council. "That the Public Health and Housing Committee be empowered to authorize any proceedings to be taken under the Byelaws made by the London County Council, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, relating to the conduct of the businesses of Fish Curer and Fried Fish Vendor." 192 Rag and Bone Dealer—Proposed Bye-Laws. The Bye-laws relating to Rag and Bone dealers have been made by the London County Council, but the Local Government Board has not yet given its approval to the series. No article intended for food to be in a place where sorting, dusting or grinding of rags is carried on. No bones, fat or rags collected from dust wharf, dust bin or cart, or infected premises, to be brought on to premises, unless acquired in ordinary course of business from a sanitary authority. No rags, bones, rabbit skins, etc., to be stored in a room or place unless such room or place is enclosed with walls of brick, stone, concrete or other impervious material, so constructed as to prevent the harbouring of vermin, and to have rain-proof ceiling or roof. The room or place to be lighted with windows or openings equal to 1—10th of floor space, and to have permanent openings for ventilation. Floor to be constructed of, or covered with, impervious material, to prevent harbouring of vermin. (This Bye-law not to apply to storage of rags in bales or sacks in a room used solely for such storage, and not to apply to room in which materials are manipulated until 12 months after confirmation). Rags, bones, fat, rabbit skins, etc., not to be stored or manipulated in any room used as sleeping room, or which communicates with any sleeping apartment, except by means of close fitting and self-closing door.

Refuse from rag sorting to be burned or put into suitable vessels daily. Storage receptacles to be removed at least once a week. Floor surfaces, yards, window lights, utensils and appliances to be cleansed as often as necessary to ensure cleanliness and prevent harbouring of vermin. Inner surfaces of part of premises used for the business to be limewashed twice a year. Premises to be kept in repair and properly drained. 193 Storage of Petroleum. The General Purposes Committee considered a letter from the Council of the Borough of Battersea with reference to a case in which the London County Council had issued a licence to store 24,000 gallons of petroleum spirit on a site regarded by the Borough Council as being very unsuitable for the purpose. It was urged that in future Borough Councils should be consulted before such licences are granted. The General Purposes Committee were strongly of opinion this course should be adopted and recommended the Council that the London County Council be requested to consult the respective Metropolitan Borough Councils before granting a license for storage of petroleum spirit in any of their Boroughs. In response to representations, the London County Council stated that before granting licenses for storage of petroleum spirit in bulk extending 10,000 gallons, the Council will notify the Council of the Borough in which it is desired to store the spirit, of the proposal. COFFEE SHOPS, EATING HOUSES, FRIED.FISH SHOPS, HOTELS, AND RESTAURANTS, ETC.† Loudon County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908.—Sanitary Regulations for Premises used for Sale, etc., of Food for Human Consumption. The number of premises in the Borough where food is sold or prepared for sale is 300: 152 Poplar, 77 Bromley, and 71 Bow. (See Table A, page 178.) London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. 991 visits were paid to these premises during the year and the Sanitary Regulations under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 8, were enforced. Want of cleanliness was found in 206 instances, and 187 other defects existed. 101 intimations were served, which in 5 cases were followed up by Statutory notices and one final notice was served. A register of these premises is kept. See Sanitary Inspector's report, pages 237-268. † See Tables A and C, pages 178 and 182. 194 HAIRDRESSERS' PREMISES. The hairdressers' premise were inspected during the year. MILKSHOPS. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908.—Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Register Names of Dairymen in certain circumstances. Milk and Dairies Act. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 334 registered premises (including 12 cow-houses, 1 Poplar, 4 Bromley and 7 Bow) where milk is sold, 101 Poplar, 149 Bromley and 84 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspectors' reports pages 237-268). Cleansing of premises was necessary in 23 instances. Four other defects were remedied. 6 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 4 Poplar, 1 Bromley, and 1 Bow. 32 premises were on account of change of occupiers re-registered as milkshops, 9 Poplar, 13 Bromley and 10 Bow. The sale of milk was discontinued on 8 premises—1 Poplar, 4 Bromley and 3 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 111. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. Part II. Sanitary Provisions. Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Register Names of Dairymen in certain Circumstances. No circumstances arose during the year calling for the enforcement of the power given to the Sanitary Authority under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section (5). See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 237-268. 195 The Milk and Dairies Act. The Milk and Dairies Act was to come into force on 1st January, 1915. unless the Local Government Board exercised its power to postpone the date on which the Act would take effect. The Board may by regulation prescribe the conditions under which milk is permitted to be sold as "certified milk" and to prevent the use of the term "certified" in the sale of milk which does not comply with these conditions. Regulations are to be made for the inspection of imported milk and milk products, while the clause in the Act, authorising sanitary authorities to maintain depots for the supply of milk for infants was amended, so as to require that the sale should not be at a rate under cost price. New regulations are authorised by the Act for the prevention of infection, the inspection of dairy cows, the prevention of the contamination of milk in transit or delivery, and various other matters. These will be framed, and the Local Government Board has to obtain the consent of the Board of Agriculture to their use. A copy of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1914, was supplied to each member of the Committee as it is seen by Section 12 (2), that:— "A local authority may delegate to a committee any of their powers or duties (other than the power of raising rates) under the provisions of this Act or of any Milk and Dairies Order, and in such case anything required or authorised by those provisions to be done to or by the local authority, may be done to or by the committee to which such powers and duties have been so delegated." Whereas, by section 18 (1) of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1914, it is enacted that the Act shall come into operation on 1st January, 1915, or such later date, not being later than 1st October, 1915, as the Local Government Board may, by Order, appoint, the Local Government Board, by their Order of 17th December, 1914, appointed and directed 1st Octobcr, 1915, as the date on which the Act shall come into operation. SMOKE NUISANCES. Number of Nuisances. London County Council and Suppression of Smoke Nuisance ; Coal Smoke Abatement Society—Annual Report. Smoke Abatement Bill. Number of Smoke Nuisances. 65 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year:—27 Bow East, 2 Bow West, 3 Bromley North, 10 Bromley Central, 7 East Combined, G West Combined, and 10 Poplar South. N 196 31 intimations and 31 statutory notices were served. No summons was applied for. London County Council and Suppression of Smoke Nuisance. The following was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 8th April, 1914. Sir, Smoke Nuisance. The Council has recently had under consideration, the question of taking further steps with a view to mitigating the evils of smoke nuisance. During the year, 1913, particulars of 204 cases of smoke nuisance, reported by the Council's officers, were forwarded to the sanitary authorities and the Council assumes that the smoke nuisance is also reported by the Officers of these authorities. The Council observes, however, from the particulars which have been furnished representing the total work of the Metropolitan Borough Councils in the suppression of smoke nuisance, that the number of statutory notices served upon offenders was 174 and that legal proceedings were instituted in only seven cases. As the result of special observations made recently, a large number of cases of nuisance were reported and particulars of these have been forwarded to the sanitary authorities. The Council has done its utmost in the past to deal effectivey with the question, and it will be within general recollection that in the session of Parliament of 1910 the Council sought to extend the provisions of the law as to smoke nuisance, the principal amendment suggested being the deletion of the word "black" from section 24(b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Council's efforts for the amendment of the law were not wholly successful, but it is possible that the nuisance as a whole might be reduced if the existing law on the subject, although limited in operation, were more strictly enforced. The question of the suppression of smoke nuisance is a matter of paramount importance as affecting the health and general wellbeing of the community, and the Council gladly recognises that some of the Metropolitan Borough Councils realise this and take active measures to combat the evil. 197 I am, however, directed to communicate with all the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and to express the hope that each of them will take all possible steps with a view to the suppreisson of the nuisance. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Laurence Gomme, Clerk to the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. In Poplar all practicable steps have been taken to deal with smoke nuisance, and apart from the service of statutory notices and the taking of legal proceedings, which have been carried out when necessary, communications addressed to firms have resulted in adoption of more effective furnaces and appliances for prevention of smoke in various instances. Difficulties have arisen in dealing under the Public Health Act, 1875, with nuisance from smoke in the Borough arising outside the County boundaries, by reason of the fact that actual nuisance must be proved, whereas in London, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the fact of the emission of black smoke is, in itself, an offence. We are of opinion that in any future legislation on the subject, this provision of the Public Health (London) Act should be made applicable to nuisance in London arising from smoke from outside. The Committee recommended the Council that a communication to the effect stated be addressed to the London County Council, and the Local Government Board. Coal Smoke Abatement Society—Annual Report. Extract from the Annual Report (Fifteenth) of the Coal Smoke Abatement Society, for the year 1914. In a few instances, however, the most lamentable slackness is still apparent in the administration of the law by local authorities. These are generally outside the area controlled by the London County Council, and there can be no doubt that the winter gloom in the Metropolis is greatly accentuated by dense clouds of smoke blown in from such industrial districts as West Ham and Dartford. "That these nuisances can be prevented is borne out by what has recently occurred in West Ham. The Society pointed out to the London County Council that many of the offending premises were in close proximity to the county boundary, and expressed the n 2 198 view that in such cases it would be possible to deal with the nuisances although they originated outside the Metropolitan area. The County Council referred the Society's suggestion to the Poplar Borough Council, and that authority has served statutory notices upon nineteen of the West Ham firms. This step has been already followed by a remarkable diminution in the volume of smoke from the premises dealt with, a condition of things which, it is hoped, may continue. "The Society desires to record its appreciation of the services rendered to the community in this matter by the Poplar Borough Council and by their Medical Officer of Health, Dr. F. W. Alexander, and his staff." Smoke Abatement Bill. (h.l.). A Bill intituled, an Act to provide for the Abatement of Smoke. To simplify and strengthen the law relating to emission of smoke by extending to the whole country provisions based on enactments in force in the metropolis and in some few local areas, the practical utility of which has thus been proved by experience; and thereby to satisfy the public need and demand for such legislation as attested by resolutions strongly urging such need passed by many local authorities, including (amongst others) the corporations (or their health committees) of the cities of Bath, Bradford, Chester, Coventry, Kingston-upon-Hull, Liverpool, Manchester, and Sheffield, and of the county boroughs of Blackpool, Dewsbury, Stockport, West Bromwich, and Wigan. Argument. Experience has shown the causes of emission of smoke from furnaces to be mainly two, viz.:— (1) Improper and uneconomical construction of the furnace resulting in wasteful consumption of fuel as well as unnecessary smoke, so that "smoke abatement" and "fuel economy" may be said to be convertible terms. (2) Careless use and working of the furnace. On the recognition of these two facts are largely based the provisions in force in the metropolis under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and in certain provincial areas under local acts, e.g., the Bradford Corporation Act, 1910. 199 On such last-mentioned provisions the operative clauses of this Bill are founded, and they seek on the one hand to secure construction of the furnace on the principle of consumption of its own smoke, and on the other to put the onus of proof of careful user and working on the person using and working the furnace. Apart from the benefit to the public, and experience has shown that it is no hardship to require the former because of the resulting economy in fuel that has been abundantly proved, and as to the latter, in any case in which there is emission of smoke to such extent as to constitute an offence, while it is by no means easy for the local authority to show that it is not, it is comparatively easy and so not unfair to expect the person using the furnace to show that it is due to accident or other non-preventible cause, and in such case it is provided there shall be no offence. In order to protect any industry in which, from its nature or requirements, it is not reasonably practicable to secure smoke abatement, power of exemption by the Local Government Board after due inquiry is proposed to be given. The Bill further seeks also to confer powers upon county councils, to authorise local authorities to set up joint committees, with the approva 1 of the Local Government Board, for dealing with the emission of smoke; and, following the analogy of the Alkali Acts, to give the Local Government Board power to appoint trained inspectors who may prosecute offenders in cases where the local authority has failed to perform its duty in the matter. Existing General Provisions (found to be inadequate). The statutory provisions now generally applying throughout England and Wales—the metropolis excepted—are contained in the Public Health Act, 1875. This Act places upon sanitary authorities the power and duty of dealing with nuisances. Section 91 (7) enacts that "any fireplace or furnace which does not, as far as practicable, consume the smoke arising from the combustible used therein, and which is used for working engines by steam," or in certain defined premises or in any manufacturing or trade process, save, with certain modifications in favour of metallurgical works and mines, and (8) "any chimney (not being the chimney of a private dwelling house) sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance, shall be deemed to be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily in manner provided by this Act." 200 In practice it has been found that the former of these provisions is quite unworkable and illusory, and that the latter is of comparatively little practical avail owing to the expense and difficulty of legal proof that any smoke, no matter what its colour or density, constitutes " black smoke " within the scientific meaning of the words; so much so indeed that many authorities hesitate and even decline to take any proceedings at all. ICE CREAM. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, Sec. 43. Twice annually and as often as may be necessary all the known premises within the Borough where ice-creams are manufactured are inspected. There are 122 such premises within the Borough, 56 Poplar, 40 Bromley, and 26 Bow. (See Table A, page 178). Cleansing of premises was necessary in 16 instances. Eight other nuisances were remedied. See Inspectors' reports, pages 237-268. MOTOR VEHICLES, Etc. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards ; Bye-law as to Breakdown of Vehicles in Streets; Bye-law as to Slow Moving Traffic ; Motor Traffic (Street Noises) Bill. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards. From time to time the General Purposes Committee have considered the matter of the provision of proper splash guards on motor omnibuses (see Annual Reports, 1910-1913). The General Purposes Committee reported to the Council that they had again had under consideration, on a communication from the Metropolitan Boroughs Standing Joint Committee, the question of Splash Guards for Motor Vehicles. The matter had been brought before the Commissioner of Police on various occasions, but he repeated the opinion that no effective device had yet been brought to the notice of the Police. The Committee reported to the Council that they were informed, however, that the trouble had been effectively dealt with by splash guards in other places, and are of opinion there would be no insuperable difficulty in 201 dealing with the nuisance in London, and recommended the Council that further communications be addressed to the Home Secretary and the Commissioner of Police in support of the proposal that a regulation should be made requiring motor vehicles to be fitted with a suitable contrivance to prevent mud splashing. The following Bye-laws made by the London County Council, are now in operation:— By-law as to Breakdown of Vehicles in Streets. In any case where a vehicle breaks down and causes obstruction to traffic in any street or public place and the breakdown of such vehicle is due to its defective condition or to its being overloaded, the owner of such vehicle or any other person who caused or permitted it to be used and the driver thereof shall each be guilty of an offence and be liable on conviction to a penaity not exceeding 40s. Provided that no person shall be convicted under this by-law if he satisfies the Court that he had taken all reasonable means to put and maintain the vehicle in proper condition or to prevent its being overloaded, or, being the driver of the vehicle, that he was unaware of its defective or overloaded condition. By-law as to Slow-moving Traffic. Every person driving or being in charge of any vehicle which is moving at a slow pace in any street shall, as far as practicable, keep the vehicle on the left or near side of the street and close to the kerb of the footway, or, where tramway lines are laid upon the left or near side of the street, as close to such lines as possible, but so as not to obstruct any tramway carriage using such lines. Every person who shall offend against this by-law shall be liable for every such ofience to a penalty not excoeding forty shillings. Motor Traffic (Street Noises) Bill. A Bill to amend the law in respect of Warning Instruments on Motor Vehicles. The object of this Bill is to give powers to make regulations prohibiting the use in special areas or during specified hours of certain warning instruments on motor vehicles. The regulations will be made under section six of the Locomotives on Highways Act, 1890, under which there is power to confine the application of any regulations to a particular area. 202 FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.

The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Borough of Southwark. Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. 30th September, 1914. Dear Sir, lie Adulteration of Baking Powder and other Commodities. I am instructed by my Public Health Committee to submit for your consideration particulars of the following case:— At the Lambeth Police Court on the 10th inst., the vendor of a sample of baking powder was prosecuted for selling adulterated baking powder. The sample in question contained 2.4 per cent. of available carbon dioxide, and was certitied as being 60 per cent. deficient in available carbon dioxide, using the 6 per cent. standard. My Council as prosecutors admitted that there was no legal standard for this commodity. The defence was based on the following proposition, viz., that the sample in question was a large packet which cost a Id., the amount of powder contained in it being three times as much as is often found in a 1d. packet. If the whole of the large packet, containing say 2 per cent. of available carbon dioxide were used it would produce the same effect as if a packet one-third the size containing 6 per cent. (which would be passed as genuine by the Public Analyst) had been used, therefore there was no prejudice to the purchaser. The Defendant's plea and the fact that there was no legal standard for baking powder prevailed with the Magistrate who dismissed the case and mulcted the Council in two guineas costs. The Committee would point out that on several occasions packets as large as the above have been purchased which contained over 6 per cent. of available carbon dioxide, and they submit that if the argument of the Defence in the case under consideration be pushed to its extreme limits the result becomes reductio ad absurdum and it may happen that to obtain the ends for which the baking powder is used, the housewife would have to use the powder in such large proportion that the loaf or cake for which the powder is used would be virtually composed of powder. 210 My Committee are of opinion that if the argument for the Defence be a sound one a very dangerous precedent is created which may be easily used for vinegar and other foods, even for milk. Under these circumstances they have written the Local Government Board, and I am instructed to ask your Public Health Committee to co-operate and make similar representation, strongly urging the great necessity for the fixing by the Board of a legal standard in respect of baking powder and similar commodities. Yours faithfully, Percy H. Gray, Town Clerk. To the Town Clerk, Poplar. The Committee recommended the Council that the representations made by the Houthwark Borough Council to the Local Government Board in the matter be supported. Vinegar—Minimum Standard. The Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington has urged upon the Local Government Board that the minimum standard for vinegar should be 4 per cent. of acetic acid (in accordance with the suggestion of one of the Local Government Board Officers, made in 1908), in place of the 3 per cent. standard generally adopted. The Committee recommended the Council that the proposal be supported. Public Analyst. Consideration of New Appointment. The Committee considered the question of the arrangements to be made in view of Mr. Young's retirement, and received the following Report from the Medical Officer of Health on the subject:— Present. Number of Samples. At present seven samples per week are taken, one in each Inspector's district, a total of 304 samples per annum for the Borough=2.25 per 1,000 inhabitants. Proposed. According to generally recognised procedure there should be taken four samples per thousand people per year. This would mean in a district like Poplar at least 644 samples per annum. 211 If 14 samples per week were taken, two in each Inspector's district, this would mean 728 per annum (which would allow for samples on delivery at Institutions), and would be at the rate of 4.5 samples per 1,000 inhabitants. A report of the Local Government Board states: "In London one sample was analysed for every 179 persons, being at the rate of 5.6 per thousand of the population of 1911." Expenditure. Present. The Public Analyst's salary and emoluments at the present time are £150 per annum for 250 samples, 7s. 6d. for each extra sample, and £40 in lieu of laboratory. With a minimum number of seven samples per week this gives a total cost of £233 per annum. It will be seen that the first 250 samples are analysed at the rate of 12s. per sample. Whole Time Appointment. Salaries, Rent, etc. Should the Council resolve to appoint a whole time analyst and to establish a laboratory within the Borough, providing that not one of the existing buildings has suitable accommodation, premises would have to be provided, with a probable rent and expense as follows:— Salary of Public Analyst a young man at a commencing salary of say £300 Laboratory Assistant (improver) 52 Rent and Taxes 100 Light, Water and Chemicals 50 £502 Competency of Analyst. Under Sub-section 5(3) of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, the Local Government Board on the 7th March, 1900, made a Regulation as to Competency of Analysts, and in a letter of the 8th March, 1900, as to proof of skill, state: "the Board may state that it would accord with their existing practice to accept as sufficient documentary evidence of the requisite qualification under the Acts, the diploma of fellowship or associateship of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland, together with the certificate granted by the Institute after an examination, conducted by them on lines approved by the Board, in therapeutics, pharmacology, and microscopy." o 212 Apparatus and Fittings. The apparatus of the laboratory would cost £250-£300, to fit same about £100, office furniture possibly £50, scientific library £50, a total of £450-£500. Bacteriological. So far as the bacteriological work is concerned, sputums are examined free of charge at the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption; the typhoid and diphtheria specimens are examined at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine at an average cost of £38 per annum. It is very questionable whether for the salary mentioned the services of a bacteriologist as well as a public analyst could be obtained, and if the Council established a separate building the services of a caretaker would be required. The following may be of interest to the Committee:— Recommendation of the Council of the Institute of Chemistry and the Council of the Society of Public Analysts. Public Analysts.—In appointments under county and municipal authorities involving the examination of a comparatively small number of samples per annum to be analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts at present in force—whatever be the exact method of payment, be it by fee per sample or by a combination of salary and fee—the total remuneration should be equivalent to a minimum fee of £1 1s. per sample for the first 100, and 10s. 6d. for each sample beyond 100. For a moderate number of samples per annum (say from 200 to 500) the fee should be not less than 15s. per sample. For 500 or over, the fee should be not less than 12s. 6d. per sample. In cases where a substantial salary is paid, or where an adequate laboratory, with or without assistants, is provided, special arrangements (not based upon fee per sample) may legitimately be made. Alternative Schemes (part time). (a) If there is accommodation in the Borough with light, water, and a telephone, an analyst could fit up three or four rooms and could analyse all samples taken under the Food and Drugs Acts and under the Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912, at a fee 213 of 10s. 6d. per sample, a minimum of £382 for 14 samples per week, and there would be an occasional extra guinea for attendance at the Police Court. In addition to this £382 there should be a standing fee of a guinea per sample for the analysis of coal, water softening composition, boiler coverings, paints, concretes, water, rag flock, lubricating oils, bitumens, carbons for arc lamps, and disinfectants. So far as the bacteriological samples are concerned, at the commencement of the scheme matters should be left as they are as stated above, as to carry out this work properly the bacteriologist should be on duty constantly, this being the practice at the Lister Institute. (b) On the other hand an advertisement could be issued for a public analyst whose appointment would be sanctioned by the Local Government Board, asking for the services of a properly qualified public analyst who would fit up his own laboratory in or near the Borough and who would undertake the analysis of a minimum of 728 samples per annum under the Food and Drugs Acts and the Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912, at 12s. 6d. per sample, the minimum total cost being £455, with extras as mentioned above under scheme (a). Prima facie it would appear that unless 1,000 to 2,000 samples were taken every year a local authority would not save money by appointing a whole time analyst and establishing a laboratory. The Committee reported to the Council that they had for a long time felt that the number of samples taken for analysis is inadequate, and are of opinion the number should be increased from 7 to 14 samples per week. This would increase the cost to the Council, in respect of payments to the Analyst, from £233 to £369 per annum if the period of service of the present Analyst be extended from year to year. If a new Public Analyst be appointed, the cost, under either of the alternative schemes submitted, would not be less than £500 per annum, with the addition of £120 per annum payable to the retiring Analyst, a total of £620 per annum. Under all the circumstances the Committee recommended the Council that Mr. Young's period of service as Public Analyst should be extended, and that the number of samples taken for analysis, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, be increased to a number not exceeding 728 samples a year. Sale of Food and Drugs Bill. A Bill to consolidate with amendments the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, the Margarine Act, 1887, and the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907. 214 RAG FLOCK ACT. Inspection of Premises; Cleansing and Purifying of Filthy Rag Flock for Bedding. Inspection of Premises. Inspection was made of the several premises in the Borough where Rag Flock is manipulated, and it was reported that there is no reason to believe that any other genuine rag flock is being used; there was, therefore, no necessity to procure samples for analysis. In several instances it was found that the rag flock used in Poplar is obtained from manufacturers who reside in other Boroughs, and the Medical Officers of Health of the respective districts were duly informed by letter. Cleansing and Purifying of Filthy Rag Flock for Bedding. The Paddington Borough Council adopted the following resolution:— That the Local Government Board be urged to submit to Parliament at an early date a Bill to amend the Rag Flock Act, 1911, so as to prohibit the re-making of bedding containing filthy rag flock without such flock being efficiently cleansed and purified. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion that amendment of the Rag Flock Act as indicated is necessary, and recommended the Council that the action of Paddington Borough Council in the matter be supported.

The following is a list of dwelling-houses inspected, and the work was executed; but in 10 cases "Representations" were made followed by " Closing Orders":— Premises Inspected. Albert Terrace, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Bow Road, 216, 218 Demolished (No Closing Order made). Eastward Street, 12, 14, 16, 18, Closing Orders made 7.5.14 22, 24 and 28.

The Appeal entered against the Closing Orders made by the Council in respect of Nos. 321, and 323, West Ferry Road, was abandoned by the appellant. Closing Orders determined 16.7.14. High Street, No. 300, Poplar Closing Order made Oct. 8th, 1914. Determining Closing and Demolition Orders, Section 17 (6). On the 25th September last the Council made Closing Orders, and, on the 26th February last, Demolition Orders were sealed under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, in respect of No. 2 Box Street. The Demolition Orders were suspended in March for four months to enable the house to be made fit for habitation. The house having been rendered fit for habitation, the Committee recommended the Council that the Orders be sealed cancelling the Closing and Demolition Orders made by the Council in respect of No. 2, Box Street. Closing Orders were made on the 19th December, 1912, under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, in espect of No. 18, Victoria Cottages. This house was rendered fit for human habitation, and the Committee recommended the Council that the Seal of the Council be affixed to Orders determining the Closing Orders made on the 19th December, 1912, in respect of No. 18, Victoria Cottages. 217 Closing Orders were made by the Council on the 6th November, 1913, in respect of Nos. 232, 234 and 236, Wes. Ferry Road. The owner appealed to the Local Government Board, but subsequently withdrew the appeal. On the 23rd April, 1914, the houses not having been made fit for habitation, Demolition Orders were made by the Council. The owner again lodged an appeal with the Local Government Board, but withdrew the appeal, and the houses having been rendered fit for human habitation the Committee recommended the Council that the Seal of the Council be affixed to Orders determining the Closing Orders made on the 6th November, 1913, and to Orders determining the Demolition Orders made on the 23rd April, 1914, in respect of Nos. 232. 234 and 236, West Ferry Road. Demolition orders and Extension. Section 18. The owner of certain of the houses in respect of which Demolition Orders were made by the Council on the 26th February last, appeared before the Committee and gave an undertaking to execute forthwith the works necessary to render the houses in question fit for human habitation. The Committee were of opinion the houses could be so rendered fit, and in order that the work might be proceeded with, the Committee considered that the Demolition Orders might be suspended for the period necessary for completion of the work and recommended the Council that the operation of the Demolition Orders made by the Council under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, on the 26th February, 1914, in respect of No. 2, Box Street, Nos. 5, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19, Furze Street, and Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 9, Eastward Street, be suspended for a period of four calendar months from the date of such Orders. On the 23rd October last, Closing Orders were made in respect of No. 7, Eastward Street, and No. 7, Furze Street. The Committee interviewed the owner, but were of opinion that Demolition Orders should be made, the operation of which, on the necessary undertaking being given by the owner to render the houses fit for human habitation, might be subsequently suspended for a period to enable the necessary work to be carried out, and recommended the Council that the Seal of the Council be affixed to Demolition Orders, under Section 18 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, in respect of Nos. 7, Eastward Street, and 7, Furze Street. On the 6th November last, Closing Orders were made by the Council in respect of Nos. 232, 234 and 236, West Ferry Road. The owner appealed to the Local Government Board, but subsequently withdrew the appeal. Some patching up of these houses was done, but no serious attempt was made to render the houses fit for habitation. The Council 218 agreed on the 26th February that the owner should be invited to attend the meeting of the Public Health and Housing Committee on the 7th April, to show cause why Demolition Orders should not be made. The Committee interviewed the owner and were of opinion he had not used due diligence to render the houses fit for human habitation, and the Closing Orders having remained in operation for a period exceeding three months the Committee considered the Council should make Demolition Orders. In the event of the owner undertaking to render the houses fit for human habitation, the Council might subsequently postpone the operation of the orders for such time, not exceeding six months, as might be necessary for giving the owner an opportunity of executing the necessary works. The Committee also interviewed the Surveyor to the Ironmongers' Company, who are the Freeholders, and the Surveyor confirmed the representations of the Medical Officer that the houses were unfit for human habitation. The Committee recommended the Council that the Closing Orders, made by the Council on the 6th November, 1913, in respect of Nos. 232, 234 and 236, West Ferry Road, having remained operative for a period exceeding three months, and such dwelling houses not having been rendered fit for human habitation, the Seal of the Council be affixed to Demolition Orders, under Section 18 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, in respect of such dwelling houses. A Closing Order was made in respect of No. 1, Victoria Cottages, on the 6th November, 1913, and on the 26th February the Council agreed that the owner should be invited to attend the meeting of the Committee on the 7th April, to show cause why a Demolition Order should not be made. The owner, however, did not appear, and no steps had been taken by him to render the house fit for habitation. The Committee recommended the Council that the Seal of the Council be affixed to Demolition Orders, under Section 18 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, in respect of No. 1, Victoria Cottages. Demolition of Premises; Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Section 34 (1), and Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903, Section 9. Demolition Orders were made by the Council under the Housing and Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, on the 20th November, 1913, in respect of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17, Victoria Cottages, Bow. The period of three months given under the Act for compliance with the Orders had expired, and the owner having neither appealed against the Orders nor carried them into effect, the Committee were of opinion the Council should proceed to demolish the houses in question 219 and recommended the Council that tenders from Housebreakers be invited for the demolition of the houses referred to, in accordance with the specification of the Borough Surveyor. Tenders invited by public advertisement, in accordance with the direction of the Council, were received for the demolition and removal of Nos. 2 to 7 and 11 to 17 (inclusive) Victoria Cottages, Ford Street (13 cottages) in accordance with the specification of the Borough Surveyor, such tenders being as follows Amount required from Council C. Griffiths £22 10 0 C. Brooks & Son 35 0 0 Thos. York 50 0 0 N. Fortescue & Sons, Ltd. 75 0 0 The specification provided that the materials should become the property of the contractor, who was required to shore up the remaining houses and to cut off and seal up all branch drains. The Committee recommended that the tender of Mr. C. Griffiths, at £22 10s. 0d., be accepted. No. 1, Victoria Cottages was also demolished, the Closing and Demolition Orders having been made respectively, 6th November, 1913, and 23rd April, 1914. Local Government Inquiry—Housing Scheme under the Education Board Provisional Order Conformation (London, Nos. 1, 2 and 3) Acts, 1913. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 24th February, 1914. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, relative to the application of the London County Council for a decision under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903, that a housing scheme is not necessary in respect of certain working class dwellings in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar which the Council are authorised to acquire under the Education Board Provisional Order Confirmation (London Nos. 1, 2 and 3) Acts, 1913; and I am to state that the Board have decided to comply with that application in so far as it relates to Nos. 11, 12 and 13, Ashton Street, and Nos. 11 and 13, Woolmore Street, Poplar, E., occupied by thirty-six persons. 220 With regard to the other dwellings in Poplar authorised to be acquired by the County Council, I am to state that the Board will hold a public local inquiry into the Council's application. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, A. B. Symonds, The Town Clerk, Assistant Secretary. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. As a result of the Inquiry held 25th May, 1914, by a Local Government Board Inspector into the application of the London County Council that the Council should be relieved of its liability to re-house the persons to be displaced by the School Extension Schemes in Poplar, the Board decided that a scheme for the provision of housing accommodation for 750 persons was necessary, and that a substantial part of this accommodation should be provided in the neighbourhood of the East and West India Docks. The Housing Committee of the London County Council reported to the Local Government Board under date 31st July, as follows:— " The Committee have for some time past been searching for building sites which might be suitable for the provision of housing accommodation for the persons of the working class to be displaced in this district. Certain sites in the Borough of Poplar itself were considered, but upon estimates of the financial results being prepared the deficiency was found to be so considerable in every case that the Committee were unable to entertain any proposal for a building scheme. Moreover, there is very little vacant land in Poplar, and, if it were possible to find a suitable housing site in that Borough it would probably be necessary to build block dwellings, a type of building which the Committee are averse from recommending the Council to erect if it can possibly be avoided. The most suitable of the sites which have been brought to the notice of the Committee consist of 11 plots of surplus land comprising 4.89 acres belonging to the Council in Tunnel Avenue and Blackwall Lane, East Greenwich. The majority of these plots, which are shown by purple colour on the accompanying map, are situated quite close to the entrance to Blackwall Tunnel which affords convenient access both to the East and West India Docks. From the preliminary scheme of development which has been prepared it appears that accommodation can be provided on this land, as follows;— 221 32 two-roomed flats at a rent of 5s. 6d. per week. 67 three-roomed cottages at rents of 7s. to 8s. per week. 97 four-roomed cottages at rents of 8s. 6d. and 9s. per week. 3 five-roomed cottages at a rent of 11s. per week. 1 shop at a rent of £25 a year net. Total 200 tenements containing 676 rooms and one shop. Each cottage and cottage flat would in addition contain a scullery and separate sanitary convenience, and accommodation would be afforded, on the usual basis of two persons to each habitable room, for 1,352 persons. This provision, it will be observed, would be much in access of that which the Local Government Board requires in order to meet the displacement in Poplar, and might become useful in connection with any further displacements which the Council may have to make in certain districts south of the Thames. The rents mentioned, which are inclusive of rates, are generally those ruling in the neighbourhood and would be subject to adjustment as local conditions varied. Before proceeding with the preparation of a draft scheme for the approval of the Council, the Committee will be glad to know whether the Local Government Board woxdd be prepared, subject to the submission of a detailed scheme, to regard working class dwellings erected on the sites indicated as the accommodation required to be provided in connection with the displacements now under consideration." In reply, under date of 20th August, 1914, the Local Government Board stated that:— "Before definitely approving of the proposal to erect the required dwellings on the sites in East Greenwich referred to, it will be neccessary for the Board to consider any observations on the subject which may be made by the Metropolitan Borough Council of Poplar, with whom the Board are in communication. Subject to the observations which the Metropolitan Borough Council may make, the Board will be disposed to accept the proposed sites as suitable. In the meantime the Board would suggest that the County Council might proceed with the preparation of the draft scheme under the Act on the assumption that the sites in Tunnel Avenue will be accepted. The scheme required by the Board extends only to the provision of accommodation of 750 persons, and those sites may possibly be found sufficient for that number," 222 A communication, under date 2nd September, was addressed to the Local Government Board, on behalf of the Poplar Borough Council, pointing out the unsuitability of the site in East Greenwich for rehousing the persons to be displaced in Poplar, and submitting the following sites in Poplar suitable for the purpose, viz.:— Grove Hall Estate. Eastward Street area and Violet Road. Manchester Road (opposite No. 226). ,, ,, (Railway Station to " Lord Nelson "). East Ferry Road (Fire Station to Railway). Chapel House Street (West Ferry Road to East Ferry Road). Kingsfield Street (Stebondale Street to Manchester Road). Seyssell Street . The Public Health and Housing Committee regretted that the Local Government Board should have thought fit to express tentative approval of the East Greenwich site before approaching the Borough Council in the matter, and are strongly of opinion a vigorous protest should be made against approval of that site for rehousing those dishoused in Poplar Borough. The numbers of persons to be displaced amount in Poplar Division to about 700, and in Bow and Bromley to 658. Housing in East Greenwich would not be available for these people, by reason of distance and difficulty of access, and cannot be taken as being in any sense a compliance with the decision of the Board, that a substantial part of the accommodation to be provided should be in the neighbourhood of the East and West India Docks. The Committee recommended the Council that an emphatic protest against the East Greenwich site being approved for rehousing the persons to be displaced in Poplar be made to the Local Government Board. The Local Government Board, however, decided to accept the scheme of the London County Council for re-housing persons to be displaced by School Extension Schemes in Poplar, on the sites in possession of the Council, at Tunnel Avenue, East Greenwich, and the Public Health and Housing Committee recommended that the Council do protest against the decision of the Local Government Board in this matter, and representations be made to the Board and the London County Council, urging that at least some of the housing required should be provided on the site possessed by the County Council at Blackwall. 223 Regulations† as to Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. Section 17 (7). Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. During the year no closing order was made under these regulations. Two intimations were served by the Inspector of Houses let-in-lodgings for infringement of regulations. Other infringements were abated upon calling attention to the regulations. The Town Planning Procedure Regulations. The Local Government Board issued The Town Planning Procedure Regulations (Preparation of Schemes by Local Authorities) 1914. Dated February 11th,1914. The Housing Act, 1914. An Act to make provision with respect to the Housing of Persons employed by or on behalf of Government Departments where sufficient dwelling accommodation is not available. The Housing (No. 2) Act. 1914. An Act to give the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in Agricultural districts and the Local Government Board elsewhere powers with respect to Housing and to make similar provision for Scotland. The President of the Board, replying to a deputation from the National Housing and Town Planning Council which waited upon him, assured them that it was not the intention of the Government to use any of the money for the purposes of grants-in-aid, but that the Treasury would consider advances to Local Authorities for approved schemes of buildings at the rate at which the Government would be able to borrow. Mr. Samuel also stated that "the Local Government Board in fixing the period for the repayment of the loan could not allow the maximum period adopted by them, namely, sixty years, unless the houses were to be built substantially.'' Housing of the Working Classes Bill. A Bill to provide for the better application and enforcement of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and to amend the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899. †Set out in extoiso on pages 212-211 of Annual Report of Medical Officer of Health, 1910. 224 This Bill amends and adds to the powers of the Local Government Board and those of Local Authorities under the Housing Acts. These Acts are already very complicated, and, until a consolidating enactment is passed, an amending Bill, drafted as it must be with reference to the existing Acts, cannot avoid adding to the complication. The Bill adopts the principle of the existing Acts, especially those of the principal Act, of 1890, and, apart from some minor alterations, aims only at the better enforcement of those principles, in the view that, subject to minor alterations, existing legislation would be sufficient, if it were properly enforced. The main alterations proposed with a view to enforcing the Acts are:— (a) A special department of the Local Government Board is to be formed which will be employed exclusively in the supervision of the operations of local authorities under the Housing Acts. This department will co-ordinate the work of the various officers of the Board already employed in the work. It will assist local authorities by advice and information, and will annually make a special report to Parliament on housing matters. Where a local authority is culpably neglecting its housing duties, the Local Government Board will be empowered, after application to the High Court, to deal with insanitary houses and to provide housing accommodation itself in place and at the cost of the local authority. (b) In some areas the failure to deal with insanitary property and to carry out housing schemes under Part III. of the principal Act arises not from any unwillingness on the part of the local authority, but from financial difficulties. It is therefore proposed by the Bill to provide parliamentary grants in aid of housing operations. Various other alterations of the existing Acts are proposed by the Bill with a view to lessening the cost of, and facilitating in other ways, the exercise by local authorities of their housing functions. In particular, an amendment is proposed of the compensation sections of the Act of 1890 which aims at carrying the principles of these sections-—at present often nugatory—into effect. As a shortage of working class dwellings sometimes arises from the closing of existing houses as being insanitary, it is proposed to require a local authority when enforcing closing orders to consider the need for 220 the provision of, and if necessary to provide, other houses in place of those closed at rents suitable to the persons displaced. It is also provided that in certain circumstances a local authority may be called upon to house its own employees, so as to relieve pressure upon the accommodation of any particular neighbourhood. In order to encourage building of working class houses by private enterprise, the Bill proposes to increase the facilities for cheap loans already allowed to such enterprise under the principal Act, so as to enable it to borrow on the same terms as a local authority. Moveable Dwellings, (h.l.) A Bill intituled an Act to provide for the Regulation of Moveable Dwellings. Cheap Trains Bill. A Bill to amend the Law relating to Cheap Trains for the Working Classes. The purpose of this Bill is to remove some of the difficulties experienced in London and other large towns in housing the working classes, by making provision for an ample service of trains for workmen, so as to provide a cheaper means of communication between the central stations and the outer suburbs. " The Cheap Trains Act of 1883, 46 & 47 Vict. c. 34, by means of which a bargain was struck between the nation and the railway companies, requires all companies to provide proper and sufficient workmen's trains for workmen going to and returning from their work, at such fares and such times between six p.m. and eight a.m. as may appear to the Board of Trade to be reasonable." There has been no general legislation on this subject since 1883, when the Cheap Trains Act was passed, whereby the passenger duty was remitted on all fares not exceeding the rate of one penny a mile, and a reduction from five to two per cent. of the duty on first and second class fares in certified urban districts, on condition that all railway companies should provide sufficient workmen's trains for workmen going to and returning from their work, at such fares and such times between six p.m. and eight a.m. as may appear to the Board of Trade to be reasonable. The object of this Bill is to provide for a sufficient service of cheap trains, and to fix for passengers by all workmen's trains arriving at the various stations up to eight a.m. a maximum return fare between any central station and the outer suburbs up to 20 miles. The Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes strongly urged the need for cheap workmen's trains to run up to eight o'clock in the morning. 226 WATER. Water Certificates. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—15, 17, 21 and 23, Baldock Street; 29, 31, 33 and 35, Ridgdale Street, Woolmore Street School House. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Work Executed by Council. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. Sewers and Drains Bill. Work Executed by Council. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order:—12-30, Norris Road; 22 and 24, Dewberry Street and 26, Wilson Street; 214, West Ferry Road; 43 and 45, St. Leonard's Road; 285-287, St. Leonard's Road; 39 and 41, High Street, Bromley; 149-151, Manchester Road: 15, 17 and 19, Furze Street (in combination with 13 and 15, Eastward Street). Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill.* The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee had in 1913 under consideration a Bill to be promoted at the joint cost of the Borough Councils, by re-introduction of a Bill on the lines of the Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill of 1908. The Bill was not re-introduced during the year 1914. The Bill would provide that all means of drainage, other than a sewer approved by the proper Authority as a sewer, shall be a drain maintainable by the owners. Public Health (Sewers and Drains) Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to amend the Public Health Acts with respect to sewers and drains, but this Bill does not relate to the Metropolis. * This Bill was set out in extenso Annual Report, 1910, pages 216 and 217. 227 SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. Works Department; London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1914-15. Works Department. The Borough Surveyor having reported to the Works Committee that complaints had been made with respect to sewers at Millwall, the Works Committee reported to the Council that they had approved insertion of manholes in Janet Street, Malabar Street and Havannah Street sewers to facilitate cleansing, especially in view of the fact that the London County Council sewer is too shallow to allow of proper selfcleansing gradients in these sewers. They also approved construction of a manhole on Stainsby Road sewer, and erection of a ventilating column, it having been found impossible recently to remain in the sewer to relieve a blockage owing to accumulation of sewer gas. They also reported it is intended to erect a similar ventilating shaft at the junction of Teviot Street and Yatton Street. The Borough Surveyor reported to the Works Committee that in Robin Hood Lane an ancient single ring brick sewer, with a diameter varying from 18 in. to 2 ft. 6 in. was in a very defective condition. Part of the sewer was out of use and had been demolished and filled in. The remaining portion of the sewer was too large for the then present requirements and the Borough Surveyor proposed to replace this portion, from No. 18. Robin Hood Lane to the junction of the sewer with the London County Council sewer, with 9-in. stoneware pipes with a selfcleansing gradient, and provision of proper access. The Works Committee directed the Borough Surveyor to carry out the work. London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1914-15. See page (235). The London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1915, proposes to empower the London County Council, in certain circumstances, to compel owners to alter the existing system of drainage of buildings, and to fill in and discontinue the use of the basements thereof. The Wandsworth Borough Council convened a Conference of Borough Councils on the subject, and expressed the view that these powers, if granted, should* be exercised by the Borough Councils, and not by the London County Council. p 228 The Conference adopted the following resolutions, viz. :— Sections 6-17. (1) That, in the opinion of this Conference, the powers sought in Part III. of the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1915, are neither necessary nor desirable, unless modified, and if passed into legislation would lead to great hardship and expense, and to the duplication of the powers and duties of the Borough Councils, who are the drainage authority under the Metropolis Management Acts, and that the Borough Councils be urged to oppose this part of the Bill in Parliament. (2) That this Conference is of opinion that, in the event of Parliament deeming it desirable to grant an extension of the existing powers of local authorities in London with regard to drains, any such additional powers should not be conferred upon the London County Council, but on the Borough Councils. Sections 18-22. (3) That the Borough Councils be also urged to oppose Part IV. of the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1915, which contains provisions to prohibit, except with the consent and under regulations of the London County Council, the erection or re-erection of any building on land the surface of which is less than 5 ft. 6 in. above Trinity High Water Mark, and which cannot be drained by gravitation into an existing sewer of the County Council under all conditions of flow in such sewer. The Borough Councils are the Authorities responsible for the administration of the law relating to drainage, and the Public Health and Housing Committee considered it most undesirable that conflicting powers should be conferred on the London County Council, and recommended the Council that the resolutions of the Conference be supported, and that the Members representing the Borough in Parliament be asked to oppose the Bill with a view to securing the necessary modifications. The Council referred the matter to the General Purposes Committee. Later on the General Purposes Committee considered, inter alia, the sections in question and recommended the Council to join with other Borough Councils in opposition, BUSINESS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1. Cap. 8, Sect. 26 (2). 229 REVENUE ACT, 1903. 3 Edw. 7, Cap. 46. No certificates for exemption under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890-1, and the Revenue Act, 1903, were granted during the year. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Verminous Rooms.* Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the "Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices, more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. One hundred and twenty-four certificates had to be given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 288 rooms have been cleansed of vermin Poplar South Division 13 West Combined Division 25 East Combined Division 25 Bromley Central Division 30 Bromley North Division 40 Bow West Division 40 Bow East Division 15 Houses Let in Lodgings 102 No summonses were applied for.

Pans and Traps without Notice. In one case where w.c. pans and traps were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders were written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings which had been authorised by the Committee, would be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work is found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. Overcrowding. Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting five cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 56 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 61 of overcrowding abated; 6 cases of overcrowding were found in workshops (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 274); 89 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, page 276). Legal proceedings were not instituted in any instance. General. 9,136 communications were received, and 846 complaints (including 65 smoke) as to nuisances were made. 5,121 communications were despatched. 233 Police Court Proceedings, No. of Street or Name of Premises or Locality, &c.

March, 1915. 237 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1914. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my twenty-fifth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ended 31st December, 1014, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances. 1,110 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 520 Do. on house-to-house visitation 20 Do. Canal Boats 54 Re-inspections 1,273 Making a total of 2,977 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public (Health London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,650 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 25.15 per cent. of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 415 written intimations, 234 statutory, and 23 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precede the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, and in only one case was it found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating two attendances at the police-court re overcrowding at No. 158, St. Stephen's Road, abated, and summons withdrawn. Bag Flock Act, 1911. Bag Flock Begulations, 1912. Rag flock is used by only 3 upholsterers within the West Division obtained from manufacturers carrying on business in other Boroughs. The flock has been frequently examined throughout the year. In no case was any action deemed necessary. 238 House-to-House Visitation. The house-to-house inspection comprised the undermentioned:— A section of Appian Road. Drainage Reconstructions.

Rag Flock Act and Regulations. Under your instructions 75 samples of food stuffs have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst, and reported as being genuine. Out of this number 28 milks were sampled. During the year 4 itinerant milk vendors were sampled in the streets, and 10 Sunday samples were taken, 17 other samples were taken at Institutions. Two samples have been taken from the London County Council's Schools and found to be genuine. Factories, Workshops, Workplaces and Outworkers. During the year the premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected, and where necessary, for sanitary purposes, notices have been duly served upon the responsible persons, and the nuisances were abated thereon. Milk Shops. There are 56 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all registered by name. Q 2 246 Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation of milking; I find that in all of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. Canal Boats. These boats are visited whenever found to be lying alongside a wharf. 41 have been inspected during the year without cause of complaint. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed slaughterhouses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Oft-times a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress, and the carcases are inspected. Killing is often carried out during the late evening hours. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are nine fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public. Bake-Houses. There are 16 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 20 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean. Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small scale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period frequent visits are made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored overnight is particularly investigated. 247 Schools. There are 5 in the Bromley North District and these are visited twice a year re drinking water supply and w.c. accommodation. On each visit everything has been found in perfect order. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view to preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. Unsound Food. Large quantities of unsound food are received from outlying wharves and sent into the Bromley North Division for destruction; such food stuff is not allowed to be destroyed until the District Inspector has verified the amount and weight of each load sent from the wharf to his district. The goods are then destroyed under his supervision. The following quantities have been destroyed so as to prevent its re-appearance on the market as a cheap food for the working class. The residue is used only for cattle food and manure. Total destroyed:— 4,094 tins of various meats. 9,024 lbs. of meat. 12 tons 12 cwt. 2 qrts. of wheat. Smoke Nuisances. A few smoke nuisances have been notified, but on the service of an intimation in each case the nuisance was abated. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive material is conveyed through the district. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Cert. Sanitary Inspector Exam.

While inspecting these places, so far as possible attention has been paid to the food. The premises have been cleansed when found necessary. Food Inspection at Wharves, etc. At Aberdeen Wharf, where food of different kinds is landed for transit, inspections have been made from time to time, and everything found in first-class condition. The food nearly all comes from Scotland. The butchers' premises and stalls in Chrisp Street Market were inspected at night times and at week-ends, and once at least every day. In each place where sausages and brawn are made, special attention has been given. These premises are registered, and the businesses are conducted in a clean and proper manner, and the premises are regularly cleansed. Odd consignments of damaged wheat, rice and barley, etc., have been received into the district from the docks to be made up into poultry food. These consignments have been inspected throughout the process. Odd lots of condemned foodstuff have been dealt with and destroyed in the Council's destructor. Factories and Workshops. These places have been visited periodically, and where necessary cleansing "Notices" have been served and complied with. New workshops opened have been placed on the register and duly inspected. No case of overcrowding or infectious disease had been found to exist, but some cases of infectious diseases, notified as residing in the district, were dealt with by notifying the authorities in whose districts they worked. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited at intervals. Changes of address have been noted and registered, and where necessary, cleansing work has been carried out. In cases where infectious disease has occurred at these premises the work has been disinfected before its return to the factories, 257 Bakehouses. The occupied bakehouses have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily, and the places kept in very good order. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops. These places were regularly visited as necessary during tho year. All dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness, and have, generally speaking, been kept as clean as possible. In some cases, where infectious disease has occurred at any milkshop, the milk on the premises has been destroyed and the utensils disinfected before milk has been allowed to be sold again. No case has been "nursed" at home whore milk was sold. Smoke Nuisance. All complaints from outside quarters have been attended to, and also my own observations of shafts. No legal proceedings have been necessary, all "Notices," whether verbal or statutory having been attended to. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1007. During the year samples of various kinds of food and drugs have been purchased for analysis, and in each case where adulteration has been found legal proceedings have been instituted with results as shown:— Milk—Deficient in fat to extent of 8 per cent. and in solids not fat 1.4 per cent. Defendant fined 5s. and 23s. costs. Butter—Consisting wholly of foreign fat. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. Milk—Deficient in fat to extent of 13 per cent. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. The milk taken on delivery at the Institutions in the district and at the Schools has proved genuine, 258 Public Health Act (London), 1891. In some instances legal proceedings were necessary to enforce the carrying out of the Council's Notices which had been served, the results are shown below:— Owner of a cul-de-sac summoned for not paving the passageway. Summons withdrawn by request on payment of all costs and the work being executed forthwith. Owner of 2 houses summoned for not having a supply of water reinstated to the premises. "Closing Orders" in each case with 27s. costs in each case. Agent of premises summoned for not reinstating water supply to premises. Forthwith "Closing Order " and 27s. costs. Owner of premises summoned for not reinstating water supply to premises. £2 penalty and £2 4s. costs. When requested I have visited the places together with a representative of the Local Government Board and inspected the foodstuffs and Army rations being dealt with and found everything very satisfactory. The factories and workers were exceptionally clean and the conditions under which work was carried on were very healthy. Tuberculosis. Very many premises were visited in connection with cases of tuberculosis notified and precautionary measures advised. Where patients had removed the new addresses were found and the places vacated were disinfected. Measles. All cases of measles notified have been followed up as required. Fried Fish Shops. According to instructions, leaflets of the new London County Council regulations have been delivered to the fried fish shops and the necessary alterations have been carried out effecting considerable improvement in these places. 259 Ice Cream Regulations. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice cream is made have been inspected, and attention given to the utensils used. They have been kept in a most clean and satisfactory condition. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Under this Act 25 rooms have been freed from vermin, all walls being thoroughly stripped and crevices and cracks raked out and properly filled in afterwards to prevent recurrence of the nuisance.

I have, as instructed, made periodical inspections of the bakehouses, sixteen in number. Three of the bakehouses are underground, and, where required, served extracts of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, for the necessary work of cleansing, etc., and "intimations," "notices," etc., for the remedying of sanitary defects and nuisances of such premises in general. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. Four notices were received for renewal of licences. The premises were duly inspected regarding the cleansing, limewashing and general sanitary conditions in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds Order. Any defects found to exist were remedied, and limewashing done before renewals of the licences were granted. The slaughterhouses have been frequently visited, often when killing was in progress, and everything found satisfactory. Limewashing in each case has been done in compliance with the London County Council Bye-laws. The number of these premises now on the register is—cowsheds, 1; slaughterhouses, 3. Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Metropolis Local Management Acts, London County Council (General Powers) Acts, Bye-laws, and Council's Bye-laws. A summons was taken out against the owner of a house in Follett Street for not complying with a "Notice" from the Council to do some work under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The work having been completed before the hearing, defendant was fined 5s. and 44s. costs. A summons was taken out against the agent of a house in St. Leonard's Road for not complying with a "Notice" from the Council to do some work under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. At the adjourned summons defendant consented to do the work and an order made to pay £2 2s. fine and 2s. costs. 264 Factory and Workshops Acts. The workshops, domestic workshops, workplaces and domestic workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number engaged in each case being checked, particularly in respect to overcrowding ; the terms of the Acts relating thereto have been met with in response to intimation and statutory notices when necessary, and in no instance has there been occasion to take legal proceedings. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without any particular incident during the year. Ice-Cream Regulations. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice-cream is made have been inspected and attention given to all the utensils used, which were found to be clean and in a satisfactory condition. Each itinerant vendor's barrow and utensils have been inspected, in each case the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 84 varied samples have been taken and submitted for analysis. Two were found to be adulterated. Summonses were issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples, and results of legal proceedings, are appended:— Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids, not fat, to the extent of 13.3 per cent. and 12.5 per cent. respectively. Vendor fined 7s. and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 13 per cent. Summons dismissed on production of warranty. Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have, by your instructions, made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is stored and sold in the district with the object of enforcing the regulations of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the 265 premises, cleanliness of the measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, especially in respect to other articles kept for sale in close proximity to where milk is kept. Number of Milk Sellers registered 36 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 5 Number of Milk Sellers, discontinued selling milk 2 Number of Milk Sellers added to register 2 Overcrowding. During the year fourteen cases of overcrowding were dealt with: in each case the nuisance was abated after service of an intimation followed by a statutory notice, without recourse to legal proceedings. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, no case of overcrowding discovered, premises were found to be in a sanitary condition. Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection has been made of these premises during the past year ; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register. At each inspection particular attention was paid to the food under preparation, and in no instance was there cause for complaint; in some cases it was necessary to serve intimations and statutory notices respecting cleansing of the kitchens, etc. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected, the sanitary conditions of the premises, cleanliness of the articles used in the business being carefully noted. In some few cases intimations were required to be served. Generally there is a marked improvement in these premises. Smoke Nuisances. During the year the shafts throughout the district have been under careful observation, and in three instances only, nuisances were detected. In these cases intimation and statutory notices were served, which has had the effect of abating the nuisances, therefore there was no necessity to institute legal proceedings. 266 Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected, there has been no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-law under Public Health (London) Act, Section 50).

Public House Urinals. The public house urinals in the district have been frequently inspected, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, strictly enforced (see tabulated list, page 231). Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, etc. There is only one wharf in my district, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramornie Meat Co.), where food (all tinned) is landed, some of which is warehoused for various firms. The Ramornie Meat Co.'s consignments are examined by an expert examiner employed by the firm before being sent out, either for home consumption or for exportation. A large amount is purchased for the Mercantile Service, all of which is again examined, specially labelled and passed by Board of Trade officials before leaving the premises. The following tinned foods were found, on examination by the consignees, to be unfit for human consumption and were rejected, being set aside by the consignees in a separate building for the purpose of being sent to a fat boiler in the district to be rendered down for fat, precaution being taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose:— 1,323 6-lb. tins Beef and Mutton. 20 3-lb. tins Beef, etc. 67 2½-lb. tins Beef, etc. 1,903 2-lb. tins Beef, etc. 863 1-lb. tins Beef, etc. 4,176 267 Public Elementary Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Elementary Public Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supplies and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main. The storage cisterns (which are used for supplying the sanitary conveniences only) are cleansed out every three months; the sanitary conveniences were found to be in a clean and satisfactory condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, East Combined Dioision. 268 Report of Inspector, South Division of Poplar. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1914. To the Medical Officer of Health.

Janet Street. Galbraith Street. West Ferry Road. Alpha Road. Strafford Street. Manilla Street. Gaverick Street. Crew Street. Of the total premises inspected 1,058 were found to be in fair condition; 30 per cent. required various works of sanitary improvement, which necessitated the service of 403 written intimations, 165 statutory notices, and 31 final notices. 269 Drains. During the year 40 drains were proved defective by the smoke and chemical tests, and in 322 instances the application of tests revealed no defects. Drainage construction and reconstruction, including means of access and ventilation, were carried out at the following premises:— 214, 216, 218, West Ferry Road. 19 to 35, odd Nos., Tooke Street 149, 151, Manchester Road. "Manchester Arms," p.h., Manchester Road. Parish Hall, Manchester Road. "North Pole," p.h., Manilla Street.

West Ferry Road. Devonshire Terrace, 7. Havannah Street, 46. Glengall Iron Works, Glengall Road. West Ferry Road, 311, 315, 317, 245, 251, 291, 191, 193, 34, 60, "Glengall Arms." 270 Factories. Improved or additional sanitary accommodation for workmen has been provided at the following factories Regents Dry Dock, West Ferry Road. Messrs. Coubro & Scrutton's Factory, Samuda's Yard, Manchester Road. Levy Bros. & Knowles, Sack Makers, West Ferry Road. Messrs. Burrell's Paint Factory, West Ferry Road. Messrs. Young's Factory, Glengall Road. Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were inspected and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations, and in three instances were reconstructed with approved sanitary arrangements. Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 47—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Rooms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms were inspected and dealt with where necessary. In every case an antiseptic was in use. Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. t 271 Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. At three schools works of sanitary improvement were found to be necessary in connection with the sanitary offices and accommodation. In two cases the work was completed after intimation to the Authorities. At one school the work is in hand at the time of writing this report. At the remaining schools the sanitary condition of the lavatories, conveniences, water supplies, and fittings was satisfactory. Tuberculosis and Measles. In addition to the ordinary notification of infectious diseases, in all cases of measles notified from schools and in cases of tuberculosis the homes of the patients were inspected and advice given re isolation and disinfection, to prevent the spread of infection and all insanitary conditions were dealt with. Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. The premises 232, 234, 236, West Ferry Road, Millwall, closed as unfit for human habitation by an order of the Council under the above Act, were rendered habitable, the orders were rescinded and the premises are now re-occupied. The premises 321, 323, West Ferry Road, were reported under this Act to be unfit for human habitation. In this case time was allowed the owner to complete the necessary repairs to render these houses habitable. This work having been duly completed no orders were made. Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises:— Bakehouses, 7. Slaughterhouses, 1. Tripe dressers and sausage makers, 9 Dairies and milk shops, 21. Ice cream vendors, 22. Coffee shops and dining rooms, 34. Fish shops, 12. In all cases where cleansing, limewashing, or other works of sanitary improvements were necessary the matter was brought to the notice of the occupiers by written intimation, which in every case was complied with. The regularity of the periodical inspection of these premises has impressed upon the occupiers the necessity of cleanliness and limewashing, etc., of kitchens and places where food is prepared or stored. This was proved by the amount of work already completed or in progress (without notice) at the time of my visits. 272 London County Council Bye-laws re Fish Frying and Fish Curing. Copies of these new bye-laws were left at all fish shops in this division. These together with intimation notices, repeated visits and re-inspections, resulted in many structural improvements, ensuring a higher standard of cleanliness and sanitation at these premises than was previously possible. Riverside Wharves and Food Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the wharves and factories, and records were kept of all unsound foodstuffs and methods of destruction. The total amount of foodstuff, comprising meat, poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables in tins rejected by the consignees and destroyed during the year was 135 cases containing from 48 to 100 tins per case and 118 loose tins. At St. Andrew's Wharf and Cattle Food Factory, West Ferry Road, 37 cases of walnuts and 107 bags of cocoa nuts, in damaged and unsound condition, were received at this factory for conversion into cattle food and for extraction of oils for soap and paint making. No notice was received from H.M. Office of Customs under the regulations made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, of food stuff imported by water into this district during the past year, and no infringement of the Act was observed by me. Exportation of Meat Food Products. In cases where meat food products, prepared or packed in factories in this division for exportation abroad to countries where certificates of origin, etc., are required to accompany each consignment, I have visited the particular factory, under your direction, and examined the articles during preparation and packing prior to signing of certificates by yourself. Food Preserving Factories. Army Rations.—Since the outbreak of war a daily visitation has been made to the factories in Millwall where Army rations are being manufactured in very large quantities. The Army ration weighs 22 ozs. made up as follows :— Beef (exclusive of bone) 12 oz. Potatoes 5 „ Carrot 1 „ Haricot Beans 1 „ Onions 1 „ Beef Stock Gravy 2 „ Salt 0.22 „ 273 Quantities of Roast Fowl, Meat Extract, Sausages and Jams have also been prepared in tins. The meat, poultry and vegetables used have been inspected daily, in the meat stores, cutting, filling and weighing rooms and kitchens, and were sound and of good quality. Samples of finished rations were taken from time to time—the tins opened and contents examined with no cause for complaint. The weights and proportions were observed and frequently tested and found satisfactory, and in accordance with specification. The benches, utensils and floors were washed down daily, and the walls of meat stores and meat cutting room re-limewashed when and where necessary. Inspection of Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 80 samples of food were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis as under :— *Milk 34 Rice 1 Butter 16 Ground Rice 2 Margarine 8 Golden Syrup 1 Lard 2 Arrowroot 2 Coffee 4 Pepper 1 Cocoa 2 Demerara Sugar 2 Glycerine 2 Ammoniated Tincture of Quinine 1 Saffron 2 *14 of the milk samples were obtained from itinerant vendors, 7 of which were purchased on Sunday morning, and 3 were purchased on delivery. Of the butters and magarines taken 4 of each of these articles contained boric acid preservative ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 per cent. Of the total samples taken one milk was certified to be deficient in fat to the extent of 9.6 per cent. A summons issued against the vendor was withdrawn on the advice of the Council's solicitor. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 274 Report of Lady Sanitary Inspector. Public Health Department, 31st December, 1914. Sir,— I beg to present my fifteenth Annual Report which deals with the work done in factories and workshops, among outworkers, and other miscellaneous inspections during 1914. Verminous Children, Scabies and Phthisis. There has been a diminution in the number of children reported as attending school in a verminous condition and it is encouraging to find that the large amount of effort devoted to this work during the last few years is showing a result. Many of the cases, even those where the parents have been prosecuted , return periodically and will probably continue to do so. It is difficult to make dirty and careless mothers clean. The cases of scabies (itch) have also decreased, and this being essentially a filth disease will possibly do so as the home conditions of the children improve. I have made enquiries in cases of Phthisis especially where the dispensary Committee have supplied nourishment or sent children to the country or seaside. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation for the girls and infants in the 36 elementary schools in the Borough have been inspected and various defects remedied or reported to the London County Council (Education Department). Outworkers. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 126 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 307 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 198 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. 275 The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1914.

Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. January 4th, 1915. Sir,— I beg to present the seventh Annual Report of my work. As this will be the last report under the old scheme of working (the extended Maternity and Child Welfare scheme of the Local Government Board coming into full operation this month), I thought it would be interesting to give a short resume of the work accomplished during the seven years since my appointment, together with a comparison of the rates of Infantile Mortailty for the seven years, 1901-1907 and 1908-14 (inclusive), especially as extravagant statements have been made in the Press regarding the conditions of infant life in the Borough, and no doubt equally extravagant claims will be made regarding the improvement. It will certainly be interesting to note whether the ratio of improvement (when shown in cold facts and figures) during the next seven years, will warrant the enormously increased expenditure in the Borough, supposing of course, that the present rate of expenditure by the various Societies working in the Borough, is kept up. Poplar Infant Care Association. *This Association, under its old name of The Poplar Health Visiting Association, was organised and founded entirely by this department in 1908, in accordance with the expressed wish of the Council (and under the recognition of the Local Government Board), that work should beorganised amongst voluntary workers, when the Notification of Births Act came into operation and I was appointed as Health Visitor by the Council. The number of visits paid by the voluntary workers increased from 2,308 during 1908 to 9,771 for the six months ended June 30th, 1912, when *The following is an extract from my first Monthly Report to the Council, under date 1st June, 1908:— Public Health Offices, Bow Road, June 1st, 1908. Gentlemen,— I beg to submit to you my first monthly report. I commenced my duties on May 4th, and have visited some few infants, but the greater part of my time has been occupied in trying to arouse the interest of the inhabitants in the formation of a Voluntary Helpers' Association. To aid in this, the Medical Officer of Health had the following notice typed:— 280 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR. PROPOSED POPLAR LADIES' VOLUNTARY HELPERS' ASSOCIATION FOR THE PREVENTION OF INFANTILE MORTALITY. 4,046 Infants under one year of age have died in Poplar during the last five years. IMMEDIATE OBJECT: To visit systematically at the homes of newly-born infants, giving friendly advice and counsel to the mother on the value of breast feeding, cleanliness and fresh air. OBJECT IN VIEW: The formation of a "Centre" in each District, from which may be worked a "Nursing Mothers' Milk Fund," "Baby's Welcome," and " Cradle " Clubs, etc. HELPERS ARE ASKED. To try and interest others in the work. To visit each case at LEAST once a month. To enter particulars of each case on the paper supplied. To report each month to the Health Visitor the number of visits paid to each case, together with particulars as to Feeding, Mother's work, &c. Not to prescribe in case of illness, but to advise a visit to a medical man, or attendance at one of the hospitals. The Health Visitor will always be pleased to give advice in any case of difficulty, or doubt. Office hours, 9-10.30 a.m. Telephone "Eastern 737," or a postcard to Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. Cost of postage for monthly reports, &c., will be refunded. Public Health Department, Bow Road, E. 18th May, 1908." I am pleased to state that several definite promises of help have been received, and it is hoped that these will be greatly augmented at a meeting which it is proposed shall be held sometime in June. The Committee will of course understand that it is impossible for all the births notified to be visited. One visit does no permanent good, it is absolutely essential that friendly relations shall be established with the mother, before hoping to effect any reform, and this can only be done by regular visits. A small area has been chosen in each parish (Poplar, Bromley, and Bow), and these will be enlarged as additional help is forthcoming. The ideal method would certainly be for a TRAINED worker to visit EACH birth, and then pass on to the Voluntary Helper those requiring systematic visiting. .............. 281 my resignation as Organising Secretary took effect. Since that time the work of the Association has ceased to be entirely voluntary, as the Association appointed a paid Organising Secretary. The number of visits paid during the year 1914 was 10,792, a little over 1,000 more than for the half-year in 1912. The first Consultation Days were started in January, 1909, and were made possible by the kindness of Miss Holt, who gave the weighing-machine, and also the money to provide light refreshments for the mothers attending. The attendances at these consultations grew from 1,522 during the year 1909, to 1,199 during the six months ending June 30th, 1912. No figures have been given since. The first effort to provide funds for the association was made in February, 1911, when a concert, organised with the help of my fellow-officers and Mr. Hobday, resulted in over £20 being handed over. The financial aid extended by Lord and Lady Buxton is of later date. The work of the Association has now been re-organised, and, besides the voluntary workers, paid helpers, viz., Organising Secretary, Lady Doctor and a Health Visitor, undertake the whole of the work south of East India Dock Road. Comparison of Rates of Mortality. Average rate of Infantile Mortality 1901-1907 (inclusive) 150.20 per 1,000 Births. Average rate of Infantile Mortality 1908-1914 (inclusive) 124.34 ,, Average decrease in rate of Infantile Mortality 1908-1914 (inclusive) 25.86 ,, Average rate of Infantile Mortality per 1,000 births visited (1908-1914 inclusive) 99.59 „ The average decrease in the sub-districts give some very interesting results, for the sub-district of Bow, being considered the best residential part of the Borough, has had least attention paid to it, and shows ieast improvement; however, now under the new scheme of the Local Government Board, Bow is receiving its proper share of attention. Average decrease in rate of Infantile Mortality during 1908-1914 in the sub-district of :— Bromley 30.74 per 1,000 Births. Poplar 23.69 „ Bow 19.18 „ The number of infants kept under supervision during 1913 shows an increase (81), the rate of mortality amongst them a decrease (6.39 per 1,000), compared with 1912. I have had to write off 139 Case Papers issued to the P.I.C.A. and not returned. The workers of 282 the Royal College of St. Katharine started in October, the figures are tabulated below. They undertake the whole of the work between East India Dock Road and Bow Road. Case Papers to both the P.I.C.A. and the Royal College of St. Katharine are sent out weekly, and are returned monthly for the purpose of tabulating the figures for the monthly report. VISITING.

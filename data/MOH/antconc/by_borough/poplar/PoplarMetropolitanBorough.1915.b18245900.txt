In the 52 weeks 3,139 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 708 deaths having occurred in the Sub.District of Poplar, 2,052 in Bromley, and 379 in Bow; from the 708 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 64 deaths of non.residents, and to the remainder must be added 523 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1,167 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 2,052 registered deaths in Bromley in a similar manner, viz., deducting 1,084 deaths of non.parishioners and adding 187 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub.district will be found to be 1,155. From the 379 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 3 nonresidents and add 361 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 737 deaths. 8 In dealing separately with the sub-districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II., and III., that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub-districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 3,139 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 587 deaths of actual non-residents, and 507 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 3,059 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1,167 deaths in Poplar included 11 illegitimate children, 2 male and 9 female; the 1,155 deaths in Bromley included 12 illegitimate children, 9 male and 3 female; the 737 Bow deaths included 6 illegitimate children, 1 male and 5 female, making a total for the Borough of 29 deaths of illegitimate children.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899 and 1900, there was a gain of females from the Sub-Districts of Poplar and Bromley.

The actual deaths inside the Borough without deducting non.residents and not, including deaths occurring in outlying institutions were 584—155 Poplar, 316 Bromley and 113 Bow. ** See Health Visitor's Report (page 195). Mortality rate among infants visited was 117 per 1,000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough, and the rate refers to those born in 1914. In 1910 and 1911 the rates were 105.69 and 115.62, because diarrhoea was prevalent in 1911. J In the County of London during the year 1915 there were 101,649 children born.* of whom 11,369 died under one year of age.* "The rate in 1910 was only 103 per 1,000 births. This is the lowest London rate recorded, and is 29 per 1,000 below the average in the preceding 10 years.".—Registrar.General. The rate for the County of London was even lower in 1912, being only 90 per 1,000 births. The infantile mortality rate is based on deaths occurring in any one year and births occurring in that and the preceding year. The rate of mortality amongst infants visited by Health Visitors is calculated upon births occurring in one particular year and deaths in that and the following year. The children born in 1910 and dying during 1910.11 are shown in the rate for 1910, so that the diarrhoea months June, July, August and September of 1911 affected not only the children bom in 1911, but also those born in 1910 who had not yet reached one year of age, hence the higher rates amongst infants visited during the Uo years 1910 and 1911. 1908 Mortality rates amongst infants visited .. 104.19 1909 „ „ „ 98.75 1910 „ „ „ 105.69 1911 „ „ „ 115.62 1912 „ „ „ 90.10 1913 „ „ „ 83.20 1914 „ „ „ 117.00 *Children born in 1914 were 109,667 and 11,395 died under one year of age. 12 Notification of Births Act, 1907.

The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a circular letter from the Local Government Board on the subject of the institutional treatment of Tuberculosis in London, and having referred the matter to the Dispensary Committee for their observations, received the following reply "The Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption. Alexandra House, Bow Road, E. The Town Clerk, 12th May, 1915. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Council Offices, Poplar. Dear Sir, Treatment of Tuberculosis. I duly received your letter of the 5th instant enclosing circular letter of the Local Government Board, dated 29th April, which you have forwarded by direction of your Public Health and Housing Committee for the observations of my Executive Committee. This letter and circular were placed before my Committee on Wednesday last, and I am asked to make the following observations:— (1) Tuberculosis Officers. Our present Tuberculosis Officer, Dr. Child, is at present absent on Military duty, but his position is being filled temporarily by a locum tenens, who has, on previous occasions, performed this work for the Dispensary. Our two Tuberculosis Officers have all the qualifications required as laid down in recommendation (3) paragraph 48 of the Final Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis (CD. 6641), 1913. (2) Medical Education. The Committee has entered into an Agreement with the London Hospital for Medical Students to attend at the Dispensary if they so desire, to acquire familiarity with the methods of diagnosis and treatment adopted, and the Medical Practitioners of the district also visit the Dispensary when they so desire. 30 With regard to recommendation (4) in paragraph 48 of the Final Report, the Committee are quite alive to the necessity of the Tuberculosis Officers increasing their knowledge by post-graduate instruction and agree that it is wise that this should be done. The Executive Committee will do all in their power to offer the necessary facilities as circumstances admit, but under the abnormal circumstances now existing, nothing more definite than this can be said at present (3) Relation of General Practitioners to Dispensaries. The Dispensary is always open to the general practitioners of the Borough, and they can, and do, avail themselves of the services of the Tuberculosis Officer. We cordially invite all Medical Practitioners to continue to do so. So far as insured persons are concerned, we have been working in conjunction with the Insurance Committee for some time past. All insured patients are treated at the Dispensary when sent by the Insurance Committee or by a Panel Doctor with the consent of the Insurance Committee. So far as dependents and non-insured cases are concerned, the Dispensary is always open for examination and treatment of these cases, but at the same time great care is exercised by the Tuberculosis Officer to see that no infringement of the rights of the Medical Practitioner takes place. Careful enquiries are made to ascertain whether a patient is already being attended by a Medical Practitioner, and if such should prove to be the case, the consent of the Medical Practitioner is obtained before further treatment is afforded. Also, if it is considered that a person can well afford to pay, such person is referred to a Medical Practitioner for treatment. (4) Examination of Contacts. In all cases under treatment at the Dispensary, the home is visited either by the Nurse or Medical Officer, or both, and all contacts are examined. Many contacts who have been infected by the disease have been sent away by this Institution to homes in the country for periods of from 3 to 6 months, and where contacts have shown unfavourable signs, and are living in homes under circumstances such as to lead the Tuberculosis Officer to believe that, whilst not infected at the time of examination, they would very possibly become so if allowed to remain in such circumstances, they have also been sent away in very many cases. 31 To emphasise the necessity of so treating the latter class, the following family case is given as an instance:— Family A.—The Original Case was a Boy, aged 15. Mi. A. Aged 40. No evidence of P.T. found. Mrs. A. ,, 29. Suffering from active disease, with Tubercle Bacilli in sputum. Samuel A „ 15.—Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis (the original case). Florence A. ,, 12. Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Annie A. „ 8. Shows marked Peribronchial shadows on right side, probably been infected ; no active mischief now ; should be watched. Fred A. ,, 7. Slept with his definitely Tuberculous brotherr now found to be suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Lily A. ,, 6. Suffering from Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Violet A. „ 3 „ „ (since dead). The advent of another member of this family may be expected soon The children referred to have all been sent away at very considerable expense to this Dispensary, and it is the opinion of my Committee that this expense should be borne by the London County Council, as, in its Tuberculosis Scheme, provision was intended to be made for all such cases. We have written to the London Conuty Council pointing out that the provision so made is altogether inadequate, but we cannot get any satisfaction We are informed that an Advisory Committee was being constituted and that we should receive from this Committee an intimation as to the class of case suitable to be dealt with under their scheme, but we can get no information whatever, and we very earnestly ask your Council to back us up in obtaining all we are entitled to under the Tuberculosis Scheme for London. To assist you in understanding how the position stands at present, I enclose herewith copy of correspondence w hich has taken place between the London County Council and ourselves. (5) Tuberculosis Care Committee. There are two Committees in connection with this Dispensary dealing with patients, viz.: the Care and Executive Committees. The Care Committee consists of eight ladies who carry out important social and voluntary work in the Borough, the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough and two Medical Practitioners (one of whom 32 is Chairman of the Committee) nominated by a Society of Medical Practitioners in the Borough. The Tuberculosis Officer and Nurse attend all meetings and report as to cases. At present no School Medical Officer is a member of this Committee, but one would be welcome, and we are taking steps to have the schools directly represented.* All cases needing financial assistance are referred from the Care Committee to the Executive Committee and, if approved, additional nourishment, clothing, beds, bedding and shelters are provided. The Dispensary has two beds at Sanatoria, one for male and one for female suitable cases. Children of necessitous parents, needing change of air, are also sent away to suitable homes at the expense of the Dispensary. The Executive Committee, of which the Medical Officer for the Borough is ex officio a member, is in close touch with the Board of Guardians, Insurance Committee, and all charitable and social organisations in the Borough. In fact, everything is being carried out according to the Interim Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis. The Tuberculosis Officer of the Dispensary is Deputy Medical Officer of Health for the Borough, and is in close touch with the Public Health Department. So far as paragraph 4 on page 3, with regard to expenditure is concerned, this is, of course, included in the general expenditure towards which cost your Council have agreed to contribute onehalf of the expenditure, such one-half not to exceed the sum of £1,200 per annum (6) Nursing Generally speaking, so far as nursing is concerned, it is our opinion that, judging from the cases that come before us needing nursing in their own homes, it would be better if such cases were treated in Institutions provided in the Borough. In one or two instances we have provided a nurse from the Institutions mentioned later on in this letter and if necessity demanded it, the same steps would be taken again, but we very much doubt, at this critical period, whether it would be possible for us to obtain the necessary nurses to perform the work. * Dr. George Chaikin, Divisional Medical Officer (School) London County Council, is now a member of the Care Committee. 33 We would like to say, further, that the suggested arrangements under heading 6 'Nursing' are difficult when one looks at them in conjunction with paragraph 4 on page 2 of the Scheme for institutional Treatment of Tuberculosis issued by the Local Government Board dated 6th December, 1912, which reads as follows:— 'It is not contemplated, nor is it in the Board's view 'desirable, that the dispensary officer or any member of the 'dispensary staff should undertake ordinary domiciliary treat'ment. As a general rule, should any domiciliary treatment be 'required by patients who are attending a dispensary for 'treatment, or by other persons, it should be carried out by 'general practitioners, but the services of the dispensary staff 'should be available in emergencies, and for purposes of 'consultation.' It would also be difficult to avoid dual control over the Nurse by the Medical Officer of this Dispensary, and the Medical Practitioner in charge of the case. The following Nursing Institutions are established in East London, viz.:— Nursing Sisters of St John : 1, Bow Lane, Poplar. East London Nursing Association : Montford House, Victoria Park Square, and Holt House, Bancroft Road. Queen Victoria Jubilee Institution for Nurses: 198, Cable Street, E and it might be possible, if Nurses were wanted for cases, to enter into some arrangement financially with these Institutions, more especially as, in the circular letter under the heading of 'Nursing' in the first paragraph 'The Board are willing to consider an applicaticn from 'the Council under Section 3 of the Public Health (Prevention and 'Treatment of Disease) Act, 1913, for their sanction to arrange'ments of this kind, which may be extended, when circumstances 'permit, by the employment of additional Nurses, either direct or 'by arrangement with a voluntary nursing Association.' 34 Herewith I enclose copy of Annual Report of the Dispensary, one for your Council, and one for you to send to the Local Government Board. Yours faithfully, A Evans Thorp, Chairman." The Committee directed that a copy of the ietter be sent to the Local Government Board. The Public Health and Housing Committee also considered the representations made by the Dispensary Committee to the London County Council, with reference to the deficiency in accommodation of a residential character for children, and recommended the Council: That such representations be supported.

In Column 12 are entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. † "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or WalesBatch3-2854 die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence—e.g., casuals—are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (i>) below. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths :— (1) Persons dying in institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent.

" Sib,—I am commanded by the Army Council to infrom you that they have had under consideration the assistance which local public health authorities, under the guidance of the Local Government Board, have rendered since the outbreak of the war to troops stationed in their administrative areas. They are of opinion that this assistance in the unexampled circumstances of the last eight months has been invaluable in safeguarding the health of the forces and in preventing the spread of infectious disease to an extent which would otherwise have been imppracticable, and I am to ask that the Local Government Board will be so good as to convey to the councils of the counties, boroughs, and sanitary districts concerned the thanks of the Army Council for the work thus undertaken. I am in particular to refer to the valuable services which have been given by medical officers of health, sanitary inspectors and other officials of the local authorities in co-operating with the Army sanitary service. 80 The Army Council trust that during the coming summer months they may continue to secure the assistance, advice and co-operation of these authorities and their expert officers, under the general supervision of the Board's medical inspectors, with a view to maintaining the present favourable record as to disease among troops stationed in camps and billets in the United Kingdom.

PORT SANITARY NOTICES On the 28th January information was received from the Medical Officer of Health for Folkestone that 20 passengers (Chinamen) of the s.s. "Mecklenberg," from Flushing, had arrived at Folkestone and were proceeding to Poplar apparently in good health, and that a case of Small Pox had occurred on board the ship. The passengers had not arrived on the 1st February, and the Folkestone Port Medical Officer was informed of the fact by telegram. One address given was in the Borough of Stepney, but the Medical Officer of Health for that Borough stated the passenger was not known at the address given, and furnished further addresses in Poplar where the passenger might possibly be found. The London County Council was informed of the notice respecting the intended arrival of the Chinamen in order that enquiries could be made at seamen's lodging-houses frequented by Chinamen, as probably wrong addresses had been given. The Officers of the Public Health Department endeavoured to trace the Chinamen so that they might be kept under observation for 14 days.; but no evidence that they had arrived at the addresses given, or at other addresses in Poplar, could te found.

CANAL BOATS. For the year ended 31st December, 1915, the inspections and reports of the Inspectors respecting registered canal boats and non-registered canal boats were as follows :— Registered. NonRegistered. §Mr. J. Bullock, East Combined Division — — *Mr. J. Johnson, West Combined Division — — §Mr. C. Foad, Poplar South Division — — Mr. H. J. Langley, Bromley North Division — 11 ‡Mr. Wm.

As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 131 and 132. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. * Mr. J. Johnson reported that on each occasion when passing the portion of^canal in his district, no canal boats have been observed. † Mr. Field reported that one registered boat was visited four times. ‡ Mr. Wm. Johnson reported that on one registered canal boat water was stored in a pail. A letter of caution was sent to the owners. § No canal in Sub-division ; deputises when necessary for other Inspectors. * See Footnote, page 130. 130 The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1569, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 131 and Tables C and D, pages 134 and 135. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 190 and 191 and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 160-189. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 78. * A special form, is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 134—135) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note-books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops,* and even factories; workshops may become factories ; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Table A, under "Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 3 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were " Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 131 TABLE A.

Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the ''Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. One hundred and twelve certificates have been given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 299 rooms have been cleansed of vermin:— Poplar South Division 10 West Combined Division 15 East Combined Division 29 Bromley Central Division 25 Bromley North Division 41 Bow West Division 38 Bow East Division 20 Houses Let in Lodgings 121 No summonses were applied for. * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons, see pages 97-100. 154 Licensed Premises Urinals.

Pans and Traps without Notice. Where w.c. pans and traps are fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders are written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings will be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work is found to have been executed and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. Overcrowding. Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting five cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 43 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 48 of overcrowding abated; 3 cases of overcrowding were found in workshops (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 190); 59 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Tibbatts's report, page 192). Legal proceedings were not instituted in any instance. General. 8,803 communications were received, and 835 complaints (including 33 smoke) as to nuisances were made. 4,686 communications were despatched. 153 Police Court Proceedings, No. of Street or Name of Premises or Locality, &c.

March, 1916. 160 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31s#, 1915. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to lay before you my twenty-sixth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ended 31st December, 1915, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 1,227 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 384 Do. Canal Boats 41 Re-inspections 1,478 Making a total of 3,130 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,611 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 29.29 per cent. of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 472 written intimations, 186 statutory, and 41 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases preceded the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable. In no case was it found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings. Rag Flock Act, 1911. Rag Flock Regulations, 1912. Rag flock is used by only 3 upholsters within the West Division obtained from manufacturers carrying on business in other Boroughs. Drainage Reconstructions.

By your direction I have submitted 109 varied samples of food and drugs to the Public Analyst for Analyses. Of the milks submitted, 39 were certified to be genuine but varied from very poor to very good quality; 12 of the butters and 1 of the margarines contained boric acid in varying small proportions, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 per cent. The remaining articles were all genuine. Places where Food is prepared. The 17 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food-stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Unsound Food. The market places have been regularly inspected. In no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. Factory and Workshop Acts. The workshops, workplaces and outworkers' premises on the Register havd been visited, and the terms of the Act relating to them have been required by notice, where necessary, to be complied with. No summonses were necessary, as the works were immediately executed on the service of intimation or notice. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM BOYCE, Sanitary Inspector Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats, Bow West Division. 163 Report of Inspector, Bow East Division. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. December 31si, 1915. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to report that during the year ended December 31st, 1915, 1,251 primary inspections due to complaints, Notifications of Infectious diseases, and house-to-house inspections, were made in the Division. The House-to-House Inspection was made in the following streets:—- Trego Road, Spring Street, Cadogan Terrace, Autumn Street, Rothbury Road, Bakers Alley, High Street. Construction and reconstruction of drainage was carried out at the undermentioned premises:— Fairfield Road, Messrs. Bryant & May; Wyke Road, 23, 25; Malmesbury Road, 85; Old Ford Road, 704; Coborn Street, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 24, 25; Creswick Road, 5; Bakers Alley, 7—13; High Street, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, 53; Guerin Street, 4; Albert Terrace, 8, 9; Trego Road, 16. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 105 samples were procured and submitted to analyses. Two were found to be adulterated, necessitating legal proceedings being taken against the vendors. Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 11.6 and 10.5 per cent. respectively. Vendor fined 10s. and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 13 and 30.4 per cent. respectively. Vendor fined 20s., including costs. It was noticeable that during the year 1913 the samples of milk and butter analysed were all free from boric acid or other preservative, but the practice of using preservative so far as butter and margarine are concerned was reverted to during the year 1914, and its use further extended during the past year. A409 M 164 Of 17 samples of butter submitted to analyses, 10 contained boric acid in small proportions, and of ten samples of margarine, seven contained the same preservative. Three samples of Butter contained 01 per cent. boric acid.

Twenty verminous rooms were required to be cleansed in conformity with the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. Tuberculosis. Only 58 new cases of Tuberculosis were notified as against 68 for the previous twelve months, and 101 for the year preceding. General. The cowsheds, milkshops, coffee houses and places of every description where food is prepared for human consumption have been subjected to observation and inspection from time to time.

Food and Drugs Acts. Acting under your instructions, 106 samples of various food stuffs have been purchased and submitted to the analyst. Out of this total, 43 were milk samples, 14 of which were purchased on Sunday, 6 from itinerant vendors and 8 from shops. Twelve samples were taken on delivery at institutions. During the year only 2 samples of milk proved to be adulterated, summonses were taken out and fines imposed. Out of 63 other various samples, 2 butters turned out to be wrong and fines were imposed. Several milk samples showed upon analysis to be very poor in quality and in these cases letters of caution were sent to the vendors. Factories, Workshops, Workplaces and Outworkers. During the year the premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected, and where necessary, for sanitary purposes, notices have been duly served upon the responsible persons, and the nuisances were abated thereon. Milk Shops. There are 56 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation of milking; I find that in all of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. 167 Canal Boats. These boats are visited whenever found to be lying alongside a wharf. Eleven have been inspected during the year without cause of complaint. Slaughter Houses. There are three licensed slaughter houses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition, Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Oft-times a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress, and the carcases are inspected. Killing is often carried out during the late evening hours. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are nine fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public. Bake-Houses. There are 16 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 20 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small scale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period frequent visits are made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored overnight is particularly investigated. Schools. There are five in the Bromley North District and these are visited twice a year re drinking water supply and w.c. accommodation. On each visit everything has been found in perfect order. 168 Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view to preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. Unsound Food. Large quantites of unsound food are received from outlying wharves and sent into the Bromley North Division for destruction; such food stuff is not allowed to be destroyed until the District Inspector has verified the amount and weight of each load sent from the wharf to this district. The goods are then destroyed under supervision The following quantities have been destroyed so as to prevent its re-appearance on the market as a cheap food for the working class. The residue is used only for cattle food and manure. Total destroyed:— 2,852 tins of various meats; 20 qrs. of oats; 169 bags of pepper; 5 boxes of kippers; and tons of unsound meat from the Docks. Smoke Nuisances. No smoke nuisances have been notified from outside authorities during the last year, and where black smoke has been noticed, a visit to the firm caused better attention to be paid to the stoking of the furnaces. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive material is conveyed through the district. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Cert.

In addition to these a large number of pulmonary tuberculosis notifications and notifications of tuberculosis in neck and legs have been attended to, and dealt with as circumstances required. This number shows a difference of 54 as compared with last year, and is attributable to the fluctuations of circumstances. House-to-House Inspections. These visits were carried out under the Public Health (London) and Housing and Town Planning Acts as opportunity offered in various localities, and any works requiring attention were put in hand.

The drains of a number of premises have been taken out and reconstructed in compliance with the bye-laws of the London County Council and Borough Council, they have been intercepted, ventilated, and provided with proper means of access for clearing in times of stoppages, the whole work being thoroughly tested before being passed. The drains of a number of premises have also been amended where o und necessary. 175 Coffee and Eating Houses.

The food nearly all comes from Scotland. The butchers' premises and stalls in Chrisp Street Market were inspected at night times and at week-ends, and once at least every day. In each place where sausages and brawn are made, special attention has been given. These premises are registered, and the businesses are conducted in a clean and proper manner, and the premises are regularly cleansed.

The occupied bakehouses have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily, and the places kept in very good order. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops. These places were regularly visited as necessary during the year.

In some cases, where infectious disease has occurred at any milkshop, the milk on the premises has been destroyed and the utensils disinfected before milk has been allowed to be sold again. No case has been " nursed " at home where milk was sold. London County Council Bye-Laws. Removal of Dead Horses.

The magistrate not being satisfied as to the improper covering up of the cart dismissed the summons. Smoke Nuisance. All complaints from outside quarters have been attended to, and also my own observations of shafts. No legal proceedings have been necessary, all "Notices," whether verbal or statutory having been attended to. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. During the year samples of various kinds of food and drugs have been purchased for analysis, and in each case where adulteration has been found legal proceedings have been instituted with results as shown:— Milk.—Deficient in fat to extent of 18 per cent. Defendant fined 20s. and 21s. costs. 177 Milk.—Deficient in fat to extent of 8-6 per cent. Defendant fined 20s. and 21s. costs.

A large amount is purchased for the Mercantile Service, all of which is again examined, specially labelled and passed by Board of Trade officials before leaving the premises. The following tinned foods were found, on examination by the consignees, to be unfit for human consumption and were rejected, being set aside by the consignees in a separate building for the purpose of being sent to a fat boiler in the district to be rendered down for fat, precaution being taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose :— 1,058 6-lb. tins Beef and Mutton. 848 2-lb. tins Beef, etc. 1,211 tins of Meat, various. 3,117 Public Elementary Schools.

Sir, I beg to present my twenty-sixth Annual Summary of the sanitary work, executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1915, viz :— The details of which were entered in my journal day by day and reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee month by month. Number of Inspections, special, periodical, and on complaint of nuisances 1,183 ,, Inspections re notifications of infectious diseases .. 419 „ Inspections, house-to-house visitations 52 ,, Inspections under Town Planning Act 1 Total Inspections 1,655 Re-inspections 2,402 House-to-House Inspections. House-to-House inspections were carried out as follows :— Sections of Manilla Street, Manchester Road, Galbraith Street, Crew Street, Plevna Street, Ship Street, Havannah Street, Maria Street, West Ferry Road. Of the total premises inspected 1,255 were found to be in fair condition ; 25 per cent, required various works of sanitary improvement, which necessitated the service of 290 written intimations, 92 statutory notices, and 32 final notices. Drains. During the year 19 drains were proved defective by the smoke and chemical tests, and in 211 instances the application of tests revealed no defects. Two drain systems were reconstructed and one newly constructed, each with means of access and ventilation. 186 Forty-three drains were reconstructed wholly or partially on the old lines—or repaired, in most cases including the fixing of new traps and pans and yard gullies.

Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were inspected and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations, and in three instances were reconstructed with approved sanitary arrangements. Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 43—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Rooms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms were inspected and dealt with where necessary. In every case an antiseptic was in use. Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. 187 Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. At one school works of sanitary improvement were found to be necessary in connection with the sanitary offices and accommodation, the work was completed after intimation to the Authorities. At the remaining schools the sanitary condition of the lavatories, conveniences, water supplies, and fittings was satisfactory. Tuberculosis and Measles. In addition to the ordinary notification of infectious diseases, in all cases of measles notified from schools and in cases of tuberculosis the homes of the patients were inspected and advice given re isolation and disinfection, to prevent the spread of infection and all insanitary conditions were dealt with. Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. The premises, 3, Ingelheim Cottages, West Ferry Road, closed as unfit for human habitation by an order of the Council under the above Act are now unoccupied.

In all cases where cleansing, limewashing, or other works of sanitary improvements were necessary the matter was brought to the notice of the occupiers by written intimation, which in every case was complied with. The regularity of the periodical inspection of these premises has impressed upon the occupiers the necessity of cleanliness and limewashing, etc., of kitchens and places where food is prepared or stored. This was proved by the amount of work already completed or in progress (without notice) at the time of my visits. 188 London County Council Bye-Laws re Fish Frying and Fish Curing. Under the new Bye-laws many structural improvements were made in the fish shops in this division, ensuring a higher standard of cleanliness and sanitation at these premises than was previously possible. Riverside Wharves and Food Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the wharves and factories, and records were kept of all unsound foodstuffs and methods of destruction. The total amount of foodstuff, comprising meat, poultry, fish, fruit and vegetables in tins rejected by the consignees and destroyed during the year was 170 cases containing from 48 to 100 tins per case and 202 loose tins. One hundred and sixty-seven bags pimento spice were landed at a wharf in damaged condition. With your permission portions of the above consignment were removed and the Medical Officer of the district of its destination was communicated with, so that it could be dealt with under his supervision. Seventeen bags of desiccated cocoanut damaged by water were removed from a wharf to another wharf and factory in West Ferry Road, with a written undertaking that it would not be used for human food, but converted into food for cattle. Thirteen boxes of rancid butter were received at a works, and utilised in the manufacture of soap. Exportation of Meat Food Products. In cases where meat food products, prepared or packed in factories in this division for exportation abroad to countries where certificates of origin, etc., are required to accompany each consignment, I have visited the particular factory, under your direction, and examined the articles during preparation and packing prior to signing of certificates by yourself. No notice was received from H.M. Office of Customs under the regulations made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, of food stuff imported by water into this district during the past year, and no infringement of the Act was observed by me. 189 Food Preserving Factories. Army Rations.—During the year, as far as practicable, a dailyvisitation has been made to the factories in Millwall where Army rations are manufactured in large quantities as follows :— Meat and Vegetable Rations in tins. Roast Fowl ,, Rabbit ,, Sausages „ Jams and Marmalade ,, The meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables used have been inspected daily, in the meat stores, cutting, filling and weighing rooms and kitchens, and were sound and of good quality. Samples of finished rations were taken from time to time—the tins opened and contents examined with no cause for complaint. The weights and proportions were observed and frequently tested and found satisfactory, and in accordance with specification. The benches, utensils and floors were washed down daily, and the walls of meat stores and meat cutting room re-limewashed when and where necessary. Inspection of Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. 74 samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the public analyst for analysis. Of 26 milk samples taken, 12 were purchased from itinerant vendors, 8 of which were obtained on Sunday mornings, and 2 were taken in course of delivery—one milk sample was certified to be deficient in fat to the extent of 15.6 per cent. In this case the vendor proved a written warranty. Of 11 butters taken, 6 contained a boric acid preservative not exceeding 0.3 per cent. Of 4 margarines taken, 3 contained boric acid preservative not exceeding 0.2 per cent. The remaining samples were genuine and free from preservative.

The sanitary accommodation for the girls and infants in the 37 elementary schools in the Borough, has been inspected and various defects remedied. Workshops. A feature of the year has been the number of small employers who have commenced to run their machines by electric power, many of them are doing Government work and the matter of speed is important. This has caused a decrease in the number of workshops on the registers. Outworkers. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 133 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 319 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar. 292 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. 191 The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended 31s£ December, 1915.

William Johnson. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, HORACE A. TIBBATTS, Sanitary Inspector for Houses Let in Lodgings. Cert. San. Insp. Examn. Bd., Lond. 195 Public Health Department, Bow Road, E. January 3rd, 1915. Sir, I beg to present the eighth Annual Report of my work—the first under the Local Government Board's extended scheme for the Prevention of Infantile Mortality. The scheme includes visiting (1) Expectant mothers, (2) Infants from birth up to school age, (3) Cases of zymotic enteritis (notifiable 1st June—30th September), and (4) Measles (from 1st January, 1916) occurring in children under five years of age, (5) Ophthalmia neonatorum, and (6) the provision of maternity centres for attendance for advice of expectant and nursing mothers, and children under school age. Case papers are sent from this Department weekly—in the case of births ; as notifications are received—for zymotic enteritis and measles. Cases of ophthalmia neonatorum are visited from this Department. Poplar Infant Care Association Undertake all the work south of East India Dock Road. The Royal College of St. Katharines Undertake all the work between East India Dock Road and Bow Road. The Public Health Department Undertake all the work of north of Bow Road. The working arrangement between the above bodies and this Department has proceeded smoothly and harmoniously. Still-births. At your request, visits were paid to all cases notified diiring November and December. It does not appear to me that any case is made out (in our Borough, at any rate) for the theory that wives of soldiers, and A400 o 196 women who work during pregnancy, are unduly affected. The percenage of still-births for the period under review is 3.3 per cent. of the number of births notified. The approximate (I cannot give them quite correctly) figures for the same period 1914, was 1.9 per cent. Maternity Centre. No expectant mothers attended at Bow Baths. Total attendance of infants 793 Average weekly attendance 15.5 „ attendance of each infant 3.4 Miscellaneous. The visits under this heading, were nearly all paid to cases of births not notified to this Department. Several false addresses had been given —in each case the Registrar affected was communicated with. Vital Statistics. This is the last time these figures will be given in the form appended. Practically the whole of the births notified are now visited, and any comparisons drawn between the rate of infantile mortality, Borough v. Infants visited, would only lead to misunderstandings. The mortality amongst the infants has increased (117 per 1,000 visited, as against 83.209 in 1913), despite the amount of money and energy spent in the Borough by the various organisations working directly and indirectly for the preservation of infant life. One sometimes thinks there is too much visiting. I myself was unfortunate enough to be the fifth to call on one mother, and the number of visitors who might call is positively staggering when you try to reckon them up ! New Register of Births. This has now been in use a full year, and has effected a great saving both in time and money—indeed, with the great yearly increase in the number of infants kept under supervision, it would have been impossible to have coped with the work under the old Birth Card system, without help. The "Card Index" of streets serves as an Index to the Register. The Birth Cards for Infants born in 1914, are, of course, still to be worked off. 197 Second Health Visitor.

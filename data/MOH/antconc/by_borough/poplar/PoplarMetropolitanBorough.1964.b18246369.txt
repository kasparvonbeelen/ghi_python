TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR Dear Mr.Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough during the year 1964. My apologies are offered for the late publication of this report which has arisen owing to quite extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances relating to the transfer of documents and staff arising from the amalgamation of the borough with Bethnal Green and Stepney. Population The population rose by 700 to reach a total of 68,530. This is in keeping with the trend indicated in my previous report. It is anticipated that there will be a small but steady increase towards a planned total of 90,000 when redevelopment of the area is completed at the end of the century. Births Live births totalling 1,374 were 2c/o higher than last year. Still-births decreased by nearly one-third in the year. Deaths The peri-natal mortality rate declined by 2.62%. Deaths from lung cancer increased by more than 50c/% and the fall of 22% in bronchitis may indicate that as a result of improved diagnosis deaths from bronchitis may previously have included some cases of cancer of the lung - although a diminution in bronohitis deaths was to be anticipated from changed smoking habits, the mild winter and improvements in treatment. Deaths from heart conditions, coronary disease and hypertension showed an approximate increase of 10%. Infectious Disease The number of cases of infectious diseases was a third less than the total for last year. Measles accounted for more than a half and although 20% were cases of Dysentery the majority of these were in isolated outbreaks not connected. Scarlet Fever accounted for 12%. There were no notified cases of Diphtheria, Food Poisoning Poliomyelitis or Typhoid. Mobile Dwellings During the year licences were granted to the London County Council for the erection of 186 ijobile homes on various sites throughout the Borough. Not only are they providing many families with urgently needed accommodation but, at the same time, their erection has reduced the number of open sites which have occasioned so much nuisance and undesirable occupation by caravan trespassers in the past. Houses in Multiple Occupation Work under this section of the Housing Act produced a number of problems. There was difficulty on many occasions in establishing not only the ownership of premises but also the occupation of individual rooms. The frequent changes of the tenancy of rooms made it necessary for regular revisiting of all premises registered under this section of the Housing Act and, in many cases, this entailed inspection at night. As the survey of the Borough proceeded and more premises oame under surveillance, in order that satisfactory progress be maintaine1 a separate section dealing full-time with the problems of multiple occupation has been created. It is important that the practice of over-occupation of houses be stopped before it becomes out of control. The law needs strengthening so that houses suitable for multiple occupation can be registered before reoccupation, as the nuisance is made worse by owners many being recent immigrants, who purchase old property when vacant and proceed, in many cases, to let each room separately. Welfare The Welfare Section of the Department dealing with the ascertainment of the needs of old people and their problems is now well established and the number of cases registered is expanding. The regular routine viniting where necessary and checking of living conditions and welfare is maintained. At the same time every effort is made to discover new cases where assistance is required. 4 The Incontinent Laundry Service is being utilised to its full capacity, while the Home Bathing Service has increased by the appointment of a male attendant. The Annual Holiday under the supervision of the Welfare Officer, arranged by the Mayor, was extremely successful and enjoyed immensely by the participants. Clean Air The area of the Borough now under Clean Air Zones amounts to 929 acres, which does not include the Bock area of 515 acres under the control of the Port Health Authority. A further Order affecting 488 acres comes into operation on 1st July 1966 and, in addition, preparations are in hand for the survey and representation of the remaining area in 1966 which will bring the whole of the Borough under control. Health Education Greater consideration is being given by the Department to increasing activity in the field of Health Education. There is a great need for a more strenuous policy by all authorities connected with public welfare; unnecessary infection, home accidents and injuries are brought about by carelessness, ignorance and failure to take elementary precautions. A vigorous campaign to spread knowledge is a matter of urgency. I would like to express my thanks to Members of the Council and, in particular, to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, for their help and encouragement. My thanks are also due to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for their assistance and co-operation at all times, and to my own staff for their loyal and ready support. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. C. TURNER, Medical Offioer of Health 5 SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 680 and the home population estimated by the Registrar-General to number 68,530 at the middle of the year shows an increase of 700 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth-rate was 20.04 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 19-82 for 1963- To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar-General. Factors are_ supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth-rate would be 19*03 as compared with 18.4 for England and Vales . The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 24.01 as compared with 23.04 for the previous year. The figures for England and Wales are 20.0 and 21.1 respectively. The death rate in 1964 was 10.41 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 11.05 for 1963* Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 12.7 as compared with 11.3 for England and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 13.48 and 12.2 respectively. The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar-General. Deaths from Neoplasms of the lung show an increase of nearly 50 per cent over last year, the deaths among males accounting for over 60 per cent of the total. Coronary disease shows an increase over last year. 6 'TAble I DEATHS - 1964 (Registrar-General's Return) CAUSE OP DEATH ALL AGES Age Groups Total M F -1 1- 5- 15- 25- 35- 45- 55- 65- 75- 1 Tuberculosis, respiratory 1 1 - - - _ _ - - 1 - - 2 Tuberculosis, other 1 - 1 - - - - - 1 - - - - 3 Syphilitic Disease 2 - 2 - - - - - - 1 - - 1 9 Other infective and parasitic diseases 1 - 1 - - - - - - - - 1 - 10 Malignant neoplasm, stomach 18 11 7 - - - - - - 1 3 6 8 11 Malignant neoplasm, lung bronchus 65 56 9 - - _ _ 5 8 17 27 8 12 MaDgnant neoplasm, breast 14 - 14 - - - - - 1 2 7 3 1 13 Malignant neoplasm, uterus 4 - 4 - - - - - 1 - 1 1 1 14 Other malignant and lymphatic neoplasm 69 41 28 - _ 1 1 3 6 16 17 25 15 Leukaemia, Aleukaemia 5 3 2 - - - - - 1 2 1 1 - 16 Diabetes 4 3 1 - - - - 1 - - - 1 2 17 Vascular lesions of nervous sys tem 57 25 32 _ _ _ _ _ - 3 8 15 31 18 Coronary disease, angina 140 82 58 _ - - - - 4 15 20 45 56 19 Hypertension with heart disease 6 3 3 - - - - - - 1 - 1 4 20 Other heart disease 45 18 27 - - - - 2 1 l 6 13 22 21 Other circulatory disease 41 21 20 - - - 1 - 2 4 8 10 16 22 Influenza 1 - 1 1 - - - - - - - - - 23 Pneumonia 53 29 24 5 - - - - - 3 5 4 36 24 Bronchitis 60 44 16 3 - - - - 1 - 15 21 20 25 Other diseases of respiratory sys tem 6 5 1 - - - - - 1 - 1 1 3 7 (Contd.) 8 Table 1 (continued) CAUSE OF DEATH Total M F -1 1- 5- 15- 25- 35- 45- 55- 65- 75- 26 Ulcer of stomach and duodenum 6 5 1 - - - - - - 1 2 - 3 27 Gastritis, enteritis and diarrhoea 4 2 2 1 - - - - l 1 - - 1 28 Nephritis and nephroses 3 2 1 - - - - - - 1 1 - 1 29 Hyperplasia of prostate 3 3 - - - - - - - - - 1 2 31 Congenital malformations 7 5 2 5 - -- - - - - 1 1 - 32 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 62 29 33 18 2 2 1 _ 4 3 6 12 14 33 j'lotor vehicle accidents 10 10 - - 1 - 2 - 1 1 1 2 2 34 All other accidents 14 10 4 - 3 1 2 2 2 - 1 1 2 35 Suicide 11 6 5 - - - - - 2 - 6 3 - 36 Homicide and operations of war 1 1 - - - - - - 1 - - - - Males- 416 27 5 2 4 6 23 39 86 116 108 Females- 298 6 1 1 3 — 9 16 40 71 151 GRAND TOTAL5 714 33 6 3 7 6 32 55 126 187 259 E IXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR Males Females TOTAL Live Births: Legitimate 652 573 1,225 Illegitimate 91 58 149 Birth Rate per 1,000 estimated resident population 20.04 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 10.84 Stillbirths Legitimate 8 11 19 Illegitimate 1 - 1 Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 14.34 Total live and still births 1,394 Deaths 416 298 714 Death rate per 1,000 estimated resident population 10.41 Deaths of Infants under one year of age: Legitimate 25 6 31 Illegitimate 2 — 2 Death rate of Infants under one year of age; Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 24.16 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births 6.71 All infants per 1,000 live births 24.01 Neo-natal mortality rate (under 4 weeks) per 1,000 live births 16.02 Early neo-natal mortality rate (under 1 week) per 1,000 live births 14.55 Perinatal mortality rate (stillbirths and deaths under 1 week combined) per 1,000 live and still births 28.69 Maternal deaths (including abortion) - Maternal mortality rate per 1,000 live and stillbirths - SECTION B SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA Water Supply The domestic water supply in the Borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The water supply to the Borough has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity during 1964. The water supply to the area is a mixture of River Thamesderived and River Lee-derived filtered water in varying and unpredictable proportions. A summary of the results of the chemical and bacteriological analyses of the water passing into supply from these two sources for the year 1964 is set out on page The waters are not plumbo-solvent. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination revealed by inspection or analysis. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine and the water in them is checked as to its quality afterwards, before the structures are restored to service. All inhabited houses are supplied with a piped water supply direct to them, and no houses are permanently supplied by standpipe. Most have a supply for potable purposes direct off the main. There have been no new sources of supply or new important extensions of trunk mains in this area during the period under consideration, and there were no changes in the general scheme of supply. New mains were laid to the extent of 468 yards. Acknowledgments are due to Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, who supplied facts and f igures. Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in 585 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough, some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes, but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for 10 ation so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. Sanitary Inspection of the Area The District Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows, on page STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (excluding water) 2,136 acres Area (including water) 2,331 acres Population, estimated mid-year 68,530 Number of inhabited houses (according to Rate books) 18,921 Rateable Value £4,773,735 General Rate (1964-65) 8/2d in £ Sum represented by a penny rate (1964-65) £18,050 11 Table II INSPECTIONS.

SEWAGE DISPOSAL AND SEWERAGE The disposal of sewage in London is the responsibility of the London County Council, and the position as far as Poplar is concerned is generally satisfactory. OFFENSIVE TRADES One Dresser of Furskins is established in the Borough. 18 COM}.'ION LODGING HOUSES There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 244 males, in the Borough. Eleven day inspections and 8 night inspections were made during the year. SEAJEN'S LODGING HOUSES There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 sod 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 7• Each year, when considering applications for renewal of licences for Common Lodging Houses and Seamen's Lodging Houses detailed inspections are made of the premises by (a) Public Health Department (b) Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department (This includes fire precautions) (c) London Electricity loard and a licence is issued subject to the requirements and recommendations of these Departments being met. PERSONAL CLEANSING As in recent years the arrangement was continued with Stepney Borough Council whereby persons requiring personal cleansing were treated where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in eo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re -opened at any time should this be necessary. The number of persons cleansed during 1964 was as follows:- Verminous Scabies Total Adults 35 10 45 Children 2 1 5 Totals: 35 11 46 19 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below; (a) Disinfection Premises Dis infected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 26 229 Tuberculosis 43 458 Scabies - - Miscellaneous 180 683 TOTALS? 249 1,370 (b) Disinfestation: Inspections; Number of visits 793 Premises requiring treatment 792 Furniture requiring treatment 201 Number of treatments 1,663 Re-inspections after disinfestation 55 Miscellaneous visits and revisits 54 Disinfestation carried out?

Great care is taken to ensure that baits are protected from domestic animals and nonresponsible persons. The work of the section is divided into three main categories; (a) Sewer Maintenance Treatment (b) Business Premises (c) Dwelling-houses - Complaints from occupiers 20 RODENT CONTROL IN SEWERS In 1961 an experiment was begun using Sodium Fluoracetamide (l08l) with six treatments each year. The basis of the experiment was that a rat matures and is capable of reproduction at about two months; if rats coulgl he killed before reaching maturity this would be the most satisfactory way of reducing their numbers. The results are highly encouraging and it is now reported that several sections of the sewerage system have been freed of rats and have remained free. Table A shows the variation in results over a period of years, Table 3 shows the distribution of results over the Borough. Allowing for certain infiltration from extensive dock and railway property and from adjoining boroughs, the improvement in the overall situation is regarded as being very satisfactory.

The charge for the service is based on the extent of infestation, the number of visits likely to be required, and the cost of labour and materials. In an area with nearly nine miles of river frontage to the Thames and Lea this enables the treatments to spread over a large number of premises and gives a very satisfactory measure of control. It is appreciated by the commercial undertakings, and is a valuable part of rat repression work carried out in the Borough. The income derived from this scheme amounted toover £5,000 during the year. DUELLING HOUSES 321 complaints relating to dwelling-houses were, received during the year. No serious infestations were discovered. 23 DETAILS OF WORK CARRIED OUT UNDER THE PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 DURING THE YEAR UNDER REVIEW TYPE OF PROPERTY Local Authority Dwelling Houses including Council Houses All Other (inoluding Business Premises) TOTAL Number of properties in Borough 21 18,921 3,658 22,600 Number of properties inspected as a result of: (a) Notification 6 182 2,041 2,229 (b) Survey under the Act - 20 41 61 (c) Otherwise - - 5 5 Total inspections carried out, including re-inspections 69 1,641 11,399 13,109 Number of properties inspected which were found to be infested by: (a) Common Major 1 - 11 12 Rats - Minor 9 73 408 490 (b) Ship Major — _ - Rats - Minor 1 23 - 24 (c) Mice - Major - 100 163 263 Minor 1 96 590 687 Number of infested properties treated 12 - - - Total treatments carried out 37 1,498 2,080 3,615 Number of Block Control Schemes carried out - 9 131 140 24 FACTORIES ACT, 1961 (Tables IV, V & Vl) Table IV INSPECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted 1.

However, 19^4 brought an influx of persistent offenders which involved the 'officers of the Public Health Department in a great deal of work caused by inspections, visits, service of notices and surveying of unprotected sites. The only effective remedy to illegal parking is to develop all unused sites at the earliest possible moment.

At the end of the year the No.l6 Order was submitted to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for confirmation, and when this Order comes into operation it means that the whole of the Borough, with the exception of a small portion to the north, will be subject to smoke control. It is anticipated that this remaining portion will be dealt with in one further Smoke Control Order. Smoke Abatement During the year 36 smoke nuisances were reported, and 21 were detected as a result of routine observations. A total of 170 visits and inspections were made in this connection. Although during the winter several complaints were received covering the emission of grit and sooty particles from Power Stations, these were fewer in number than in the previous year as a result of representations to the Central Electricity Generating Board, and several meetings and discussions with the Engineers concerned and H.M. Alkali Inspector (who is responsible for the operation of the Clean Air Act in Power Stations.) In this respect the worst offender proved to be Watts Grove, and although every effort is being made to minimise the nuisance from this Station, some nuisance is likely to continue during the winter months as it is only a booster station and is required to cope with sudden demands for extra power, and v7hen working at full capacity the steam generators are overloaded. As has been mentioned in previous reports the furnaces of the steam generators were designed primarily for firing on pulverised fuel, but subsequently conversion to solid fuel and the addition of chain grate stokers, for which these generators are not really suitable, has created a permanent problem. 29 Air Pollutio4n Three smoke and sulphur dioxide recording stations are in continuous operation, and are situated at the north of the Borough (Poplar Town Hall), at Poplar Technical College in the centre of the borough, and at Millwall Park in the south. The Public Health Department has continued to co-operate fully with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. During periods of fog when heavy pollution may be expected, special recordings are made. The Department continued to co-operate with the Thames Hospital Group Pathologist in a special study of air pollution in hospital wards. Instruments were provided, maintained and supervised by the Clean Air Section, and readings were carried out by the Pathologist and his staff. Owing to the absence of any considerable quantities of fog this winter, no further significant data, additional to that collected last year, was obtained. It is anticipated, however, that these experiments will continue during the next winter. Hourly Smoke Study Poplar is one of six Metropolitan Boroughs co-operating with the College of General Practitioners and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research in a special study which seeks information on any correlation between increases in respiratory disease and air pollution levels during smog. For this purpose a special sequential smoke sampler is used, which may be set to operate automatically for periods of 1, 3 or 24 hours, depending on the density of smog experienced. Trainee Public Health Inspectors The Department has an establishment for four Trainee Public Health Inspectors, and normally two of them are seconded each month to assist the Clean Air Inspector. Two of these Trainee Public Health Inspectors qualified in July and were appointed as Public Health Inspectors, and the two vacancies thus created have not so far been filled; as a result of which, for approximately six months, the Clean Air Section had the assistance of only one Trainee instead of the normal two. 30 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 ANNUAL STATISTICS 1st January to 31st December, 19&4 Soction Inspections and revisits .

SECTION 1 It was necessary on one occasion to resort to the powers of Compulsory Removal. The person concerned was an elderly spinster of 83 years who had been under observation by the Department for a number of years. She lived alone in a 3-room first floor flat and sanitary facilities were located on the ground floor. Shortly before her removal she took to her bed and got up only for short periods. She was unable to carry water upstairs or use the toilet, which created conditions that made it impossible for her to look after herself 34 quately. In addition she refused any assistance from the District Nurse or Hone Help. As her condition deteriorated arrangements were made on two occasions for her to enter hospital voluntarily and, in both instances, she declined on the arrival of the ambulance. Under these circumstances there was no alternative but to arrange for her removal compulsorily under the provisions of the National Assistance Act. The removal was accomplished smoothly, and with the minimum of inconvenience to the old lady. WELFARE OF THE AGED INFIRM As can be seen from the table below, the number of new cases brought to the attention of the Department as in need of help or care amounted to 478. They were dealt with as expeditiously as possible, depending upon the urgency of each particular case, at the same tine observation and routine inspection being made of those already under the notice of the department. The most difficult cases are those of old people who are completely isolated, without relatives, friends or organisations to keep them under observation. Quite often they live in loneliness and without any participation in the life of the community around them, which has an effect on their mental stability. It is this kind of case that need3 most help and one of the greatest obstacles is discovering then for, in many cases, they have a fear of "charity" and very rarely seek assistance of their own accord. Their living conditions are often appalling and they are in need of medical care, meals-on-wheels, and assistance with housework. Every effort is made to enlist the co-operation of the public to assist by informing the Welfare Officer in this department where such cases are suspected or known to exist. I am pleased to say this has resulted in our being able to help a number of cases which otherwise would have gone undetected much longer. Detail of Inspections Cases on the Register at 31st December 1963 969 New cases added to the Register 478 Number of removals from Register; (a) Deaths 84 (b) Transfers 42 (c) Other cases 31 Total number on Register at 31st December 1964 1290 Incontinent Laundry calls 1085 Home Bathing visits 2482 Visits to new cases 279 Visits to old cases 1059 Miscellaneous visits and enquiries 1482 35 Hone Bathing The number of Hone Bathing visits more than doubled the total of the previous year, amounting to 2482 as compared with 1205. It is anticipated that the need for this service will increase year by year. Incontinent Laundry The demand for this service, as in the case of Hone Bathing, has shown a great increase. However, I an pleased to say that the staff were able to cope satisfactorily with the extra burden of work. MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court. It is fitted with nodern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-norten roon. In addition there is a viewing roon, a waiting roon and acconnodation for the use of the Pathologists and clerks. The total nunber of bodies received during 1964 was 573 (residents 248, non-residents 325). Post-norten only exaninations were nade in 491 cases and inquests were held in 78 cases. PUBLIC CLEANSING The arrangenents for collection, renoval and disposal of refuse are under the control of the Borough Engineer, who has supplied the following information:- Refuse; During the year 23,899 tons of house, trade, street, gully, narket and kitchen refuse were collected and disposed of at the controlled tip. In addition 15,048 tons of refuse fron other boroughs were also dealt with at the Council's Refuse Disposal Depot. Street Cleansing? Two nechanical sweeper-collectors supplemented the work of the manual road sweepers, and as warranted by weather conditions two watering machines were used for washing and watering roads and street narkets. Gully Cleansing: Three gully emptying machines have carried out 6253 gully cleansings and weekly emptyings of three cesspools. SWIMMING BATHS AND WASHHOUSES The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendents- Poplar Baths - Vapour, Foam and Slipper Baths, Swimming Pools Bow Baths - Slipper Baths Aberfeldy Street - Launderette. 36 PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS There are two pools, both situated at the main establishment, East India Dock Road, E.14, and I am indebted to the Chief Baths Superintendent for the information contained in the report which follows:- Large Pool Small Pool Length 100-ft. 64-ft. Width 39'6" 25'0" Maximum depth 8'6" 6'6" Minimum depth 3'6" 3'0" Capacity 150,000 galls. 50,000 galls. The water to the pools is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board. Continuous filtration and chlorination of the water is carried out the whole period the pools are in use, the period of complete turnover of both pools being 3.5 hours. The pH.value of the water is naintained between 7.6 and 7.8 while the chorine content is maintained at 1.0 to 1.2 parts per million. As soon as the last bather leaves the pool at the end of the day and for the week-end closure of the establishment, the chlorine content is increased to 1.5 (or even more) parts per million to ensure sterile water when the pool is reopened. , Wallace and Tiernam Chlorinators supply the chlorine to the water and the filtration equipment used is made by United Filters. Sulphate of Alumina is used in required quantities in the filtering of the water, and soda ash, or similar, is used to assist in maintaining the necessary pH. value of the water. Hourly tests are made of both pools to see that the correct pH. and chlorine values are present. Periodical bacteriological examination of the water is carried out by visiting chemists from the London County Council Public Health Department Scientific Branch. The water is maintained in such sterile condition that it is not necessary to empty the pools. However, as the large pool is closed during the winter season, and has to be drained down, the contents of the small pool are used to thoroughly wash out the filters servicing this pool, and then 50,000 gallons of water from the large pool is filtered through both sets of filters into the small pool. This, in effect, means that both pools are emptied down each year. While the pools are empty opportunity is taken to thoroughly scour all sections of the pool steps that are under water, and all glazed tiling cleaned down with an abrasive powder. 37 SECTION C HOUSING Details of new housing accommodation completed in the Borough during 1964 are as follows; Poplar Borough Council - 70 dwellings London County Council - 423 dwellings The number of families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 31st December, 1964 was as follows:- Type of Dwelling No. of Lettings Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,058 Post-war Council houses and flats 1,804 Temporary bungalows 327 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 117 Acquired properties 152 Other properties 6 TOTAL PROPERTIES 3,464 38 RENT ACT, 1957 Details of action taken between 1st January and 31st December, 1964, are as follows:- Applications for certificates 27 Decisions not to issue certificates 1 Decisions to issue certificates 26 (a) in respect of some but not all defects 4 (b) in respect of all defects 22 Undertakings given by landlords 18 Undertakings refused by Council Nil Certificates issued 7 Applications by landlords to Council for cancellation of certificates 18 Objections by tenants to cancellation of certificates 11 Council decisions to cancel in spite of tenants' objections Nil Certificates cancelled 4 CLOSING ORDERS (PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT. 1956) No Closing Orders were made under this Act during the year.

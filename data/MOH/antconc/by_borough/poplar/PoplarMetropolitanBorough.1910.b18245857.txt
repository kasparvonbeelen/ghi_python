In the 52 weeks 2547 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 636 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1582 in Bromley, and 329 in Bow ; from the 636 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 51 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 397 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 982 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1582 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 734 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 181 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 1029. Prom the 329 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 3 non-residents and added 278 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 604 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III., that in considering the deaths of nonresidents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2547 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 354 deaths of actual nonresidents and 422 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2615 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 982 deaths in Poplar included 10 illegitimate children, 4 male and 6 female; the 1029 deaths in Bromley included 7 illegitimate children, 4 male and 3 female; the 604 Bow deaths included 6 8 mate children, 3 male and 3 female, making a total fnr the Borough of 23 deaths of illegitimate children.

During the year 4595 notifications were received under the Notifications of Births Act, 1907. Discrepancies in Registration of Births. On 27th June a letter was received from the Registrar of Births and Deaths for Bow stating that a birth (female) which had been returned by him on 4th June as occurring at an address in Parnell Road really occurred at an address in Clay Hall Road, and that the Registrar-General had ordered proceedings to be taken against the father for giving the Registrar false information. This birth was duly notified to the Medical Officer of Health under the Notification of Births Act as occurring at the address in Clay Hall Road on 24th April, 1910. The Appointment of the Health Visitor. The Local Government Board sanctioned the appointment of Miss A. E. Hall, as Health Visitor for the Borough, under the Health Visitors Order, from the 3rd February, 1910, at a salary of £130 per annum rising to £140 per annum on the 1st April, 1910, and thence by annual increments of £10 and one of £5 to a maximum of £185 per annum. Working Class Women Bill. A Bill to improve the Conditions of Life of Women of the Working Classes. Presented by Sir Charles M'Laren, supported by Mr. Atherley-Jones, Mr. J. M. Robertson, Mr. Snowden, and Mr. Theodore Taylor. Memorandum. "The object of this Bill is to deal with cases where women are prevented by statute from working before or after childbirth, or where the husband is imprisoned for cruelty to his wife or children. In these circumstances the wife is to be provided by the guardians with maintenance without being considered a pauper for the purpose of disqualifications." "The Bill also seeks to introduce, after the model of Paris, Berlin, and other continental cities, a system of municipal creches, wash houses, public kitchens, with the view of economising domestic labour, and making home life more attractive to working men, and also lodginghouses for women, to be provided by the local authorities. It also embodies a clause on the lines of the Government Milk Bill of last session, and provides for the appointment of certified midwives in every district. 14 All the above, except wash-houses, are to be self-supporting, as a charge will be made to users." Midwives (No. 2) Bill [H.L.J [As amended on Report.] A Bill [as amended on report] intituled an Act to amend the Midwives Act, 1902. The Lord President (E. Beauchamp). Memorandum. "This Bill is for the most part founded upon the Report of the Departmental Committee appointed to consider the working of the Midwives Act, 1902 (1909, Cd. 4822), but departs from the recommendations of that Committee in one or two details." "The effect of the reconstitution of the Central Midwives Board is to increase the number of the Board from 9 to 13 members, representation being given to the following bodies, who were previously unrepresented:" (1) The Local Government Board; (2) The Association of Municipal Corporations ; (3) The Society of Medical Officers of Health ; (4) The British Medical Association. "The member appointed by the last-named Association must be a medical practitioner. No special qualification is prescribed in the case of the members appointed by the other new bodies." "In addition to this increase in numbers, the qualifications of the members appointed by the Incorporated Midwives Institute and the Royal British Nurses Association have been altered. In the future the members appointed by these bodies must be certified midwives. At present the member appointed by the Incorporated Midwives Institute must be a medical practitioner, whilst with respect to the member appointed by the Royal British Nurses Association no special qualifications are required." The attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee was called to the provisions of Section 17 of the Midwives (No. 2) Bill, introduced into the House of Lords by the Lord President of the Council. The section provides that where a medical practitioner has been summoned upon the advice of a certified midwife attending a woman in childbirth, to render assistance in case of emergency, he shall be entitled 15 to recover from the Guardians such fee as may be prescribed, and the Guardians may, if they think fit, recover the amount as a civil debt from the patient or the person liable to provide the patient with medical aid. It is provided such assistance shall not be considered as parochial relief. The Committee were of opinion, however, it is undesirable that medical assistance rendered in such circumstances should be associated in any way with the administration of the Poor Law, but that the London County Council should be the authority in London responsible for the payment of the fees of medical practitioners in such cases. The Committee recommended that the Council concur in this opinion, and that the Lord President of the Council be urged to amend the Bill to this extent. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee, viz.:— Poplar Board of Guardians, Upper North Street, Poplar, E. 3rd November, 1910. Dear Sir, Midwives' Act, 1902. In March, 1906, the London County Council called the attention of Boards of Guardians in the Metropolis to the rules made by the Central Midwives Board under the above Act, one of which rules prohibits a midwife from attending alone upon certain cases of difficulty, and places on her the duty of advising that the services of a medical practitioner be obtained, but no provision is made either in the Act or rules made thereunder for the payment of fees of medical practitioners who may be summoned in such cases, and in which the patients are too poor to pay. Upon consideration of the representations made to them on the subject, the Guardians agreed (in cases in which the patient was not in receipt of poor law relief) to pay the fee of any medical practitioner called in by a midwife under the rule of the Central Midwives Board, where the person was obviously too poor to pay. The amount of the fees paid by the Guardians during the past twelve months under the above-named arrangement, in non-pauper cases, was £24 11s. 6d.; but the Guardians are strongly of opinion that, as such cases do not otherwise come in contact with the Poor Law, it is undesirable that they should be dealt with by the Poor 16 Law Authority, and at their meeting on the 26th instant they unanimously adopted the following resolution:— "That the Clerk be instructed to write to the Poplar Borough Council asking if it will, in future, pay the fee of the doctor whom the midwife is compelled to send for in dangerous emergencies in non-pauper cases within the borough, in accordance with its powers under the Public Health Acts; and to point out that this Board has hitherto been doing so, but that it considers that as such cases do not otherwise come in contact with the Poor Law it would be preferable on all grounds that the Borough Council should do so." I am, accordingly, to ask you that you will be good enough to submit the matter to the Borough Council for consideration, and the Guardians will be glad to be informed of any action which the Council may take thereon. Yours faithfully, G. HERBERT LOUGH, Clerk. L. Potts, Esq., Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, enacts that any Sanitary Authority may, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, themselves provide, or contract with any person to provide, a temporary supply of medicine and medical assistance for the poorer inhabitants of their district. It would appear therefore that the Council may, subject to the sanction of the Local Government Board, pay the fees of medical practitioners as suggested. The Midwives (No. 2) Bill introduced in the House of Lords proposes to make provision for payment by Boards of Guardians of the fees of medical practitioners called in by midwives. The Council had agreed it is undesirable that medical assistance rendered in such circumstances should be associated with Poor Law administration, and urged that the London County Council should be the authority in London responsible for such payments. In the meantime, having regard to the undesirability ot such cases 17 being associated with Poor Law relief, the Public Health and Housing Committee thought the Borough Council should undertake liability for these payments in non-pauper cases, and recommended the Council that application be made to the Local Government Board for sanction to payment by the Council of fees of medical practitioners whom the midwife is compelled, under the rules of the Central Midwives Board, to summon in dangerous emergencies in non-pauper cases within the borough, where the patients are too poor to pay such fees. The following reply was received from the Local Government Board, viz.:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 13th December, 1910. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 18th ultimo, with regard to the payment of fees to medical practitioners summoned by midwives in cases of emergency, and I am to draw the attention of the Borough Council of Poplar to the marked paragraph of the enclosed circular letter on this subject, which the Board addressed to Boards of Guardians on the 18th February last. At the present time it does not appear to the Board to be desirable to make any change in regard to this matter. As the Borough Council are aware, legislation is proposed in regard to it. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, F. J. WILLIS, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk, Poplar. The marked paragraph referred to in the above letter is as follows : Payments to medical practitioners summoned by midwives in cases of emergency. The Committee recommend (paragraphs 71 and 77 of the report of the Departmental Committee on the working of the Midwives Act, 1902) that the Act of 1902 should be amended so as to give any medical practitioner summoned by a midwife in cases of emergency "a secure expectation of payment"; and that the C 18 Poor Law Authority should be responsible for the fee, when the medical man cannot otherwise obtain payment, and should be empowered, if they think fit, to charge the fee paid as "relief on loan." Full effect could not be given to this recommendation without legislation, but the Board regard it as of immediate importance that medical practitioners should, so far as practicable, feel assured of a reasonable payment for their services in such cases; and they desire to impress upon Boards of Guardians that they should give effect, if they have not already done so, to the suggestion made in the circular letter of 29th July, 1907, viz.:—that medical men and certified midwives practising in the poor law union should be informed that, as regards any poor person in whose case the attendance of a registered medical practitioner is required (see Rule E 18 of the Rules of the Central Midwives Board), the Guardians will be prepared to exercise their powers under Section 2 of the Poor Law Amendment Act, 1 48, and to pay a reasonable remuneration to the medical man called in. The Board think that any medical practitioner who makes a claim on the Guardians for a fee in such a case, might properly be asked to state definitely that after making reasonable efforts he had failed to secure payment from the person attended. The fees paid by the Board of Guardians in non-pauper cases during the past year amounted to £24 11s. 6d. The Public Health and Housing Committee were informed these cases are dealt with under the Poor Law in the same manner as applications for parochial relief, by investigation by relieving officers, etc. The Committee were strongly of opinion it is extremely undesirable that non-pauper cases should become associated with Poor Law administration under the circumstances in which these fees become due, and that such association must lead in many cases to the weakening of the spirit of selfdependence which now restrains many of the poor from relying upon parochial relief except in case of urgent necessity. The Committee recommended that the Council concur in this opinion, and that further representations be made to the Local Government Board to this effect, and urging that sanction be given to payment of these fees by the Council as proposed, pending legislation on the subject; also reiterating the opinion that Section 17 of the Midwives (No. 2) Bill should 19 be amended by substituting the London County Council for Boards of Guardians in London as the authority responsible for such payments. COMPULSORY NOTIFICATION OF OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Resources of the Borough for obtaining the Information desired respecting ophthalmia neonatorum—correspondence with the London County Council respecting Proposed Compulsory Notification. The following report was presented to the Public Health and Housing Committee on the 7th June:— "A letter has been received from the Secretary of the Social Welfare Association for London in which it stated: I am writing to ask you if you would be so good as to bring it before the Public Health Committee on behalf of this Association, into which the Association of Subscribers to Charities has been merged. "As you are doubtless aware, Mr. Bishop Harman (Occulist to the London County Council Blind Schools, Chief Clinical Assistant, Moorfields and Middlesex Hospital, etc., etc.) estimates that forty per cent. of the blindness of the children in the Council Schools is due to ophthalmia neonatorum. In a paper reprinted from ' Public Health, January, 1909, Mr. Harman says:— ' Our present methods even with the aid of the Notification of Births Act do not give us effective control over the disease. It is still appallingly common to get children brought to the Eye Hospitals with their eyes irretrievably damaged within the first month of life. Compulsory notification of all cases has been suggested as the best means of controlling the disease. The idea is an excellent one. Notification of a disease is one of the first requisites of our knowing what is the true incidence of the disease. The tale of its effects we may know, but the number of cases from which these arise we do not know.' "From one district 22 cases out of 60 were first seen by Mr. 20 Harman three or more weeks after the onset of the disease. In 18 of these one or both eyes were permanently damaged. The other 38 were seen in the first week of the disease and only one suffered any permanent injury to the eyes, and in that one the parents lived 20 miles from the hospital and failed to bring the child for attention. "The remedy therefore is obvious. Get the case3 early and treatment will be a brilliant success. At present midwives under the rules of the Central Midwives Board are instructed to call in a medical man if the child's eyes are inflamed ever so slightly, and to inform the local supervising body, that is in London the London County Council, that they have done so. But there is no machinery at present by which to ascertain how many midwives fail in this respect; whereas if the disease were compulsorily notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health, his visitors would find this out and the Medical Officer of Health would thus help to raise the standard of work of the midwives. In cases where a medical man is called in by the midwife and the case needs daily attendance, but the people are too poor to pay for it, the doctor would doubtless send the child to an eye hospital. But he has no means of seeing that his order is carried out, and it is obvious that when the mother is in bed it is sometimes very difficult to arrange for a child to be taken constantly to the hospital. Here again the Medical Officer of Health and his staff can intervene and see that the child is adequately treated. "Lastly, notification would result in an increased knowledge of the prevalence and causes, essential and contributory, of the disease The percentage of cases occurring in the practice of medical students and midwives would be arrived at, and this knowledge would make it possible for measures to be taken by which in time the disease could be stamped out. "Several of the provincial towns have obtained compulsory notification of ophthalmia neonatorum, and it is much hoped by those interested in the prevention of blindness that all the Metropolitan Officers of Health will help to obtain it in every London borough (under the Infectious Diseases Notification Act, 1889). "The following towns have already obtained compulsory notification of ophthalmia neonatorum: Chester, Stoke-on-Trent, and all the other towns in the Potteries district. 21 "Ophthalmia neonatorum or inflammation of the eyes of the new-born is a very dangerous infectious disease; it is set up by germs which gain access to the infant's eye in the act of birth. It is readily prevented by suitable measures, and easily cured if taken in time. If not treated promptly, and allowed to run its course, it may entirely destroy the eye-ball and lead to incurable blindness. On the slightest sign of inflammation of the eyes in a newly-born child, medical advice should at once be obtained. "The disease has not the wide prevalence of the common infectious diseases, and it does not as a rule threaten life. Nevertheless its results are most disastrous. The Royal Commission on the Blind, the Deaf and the Dumb, which reported to both Houses of Parliament in the year 1889, estimated that about 7,000 persons in the United Kingdom had lost their sight from ophthalmia neonatorum. It has been estimated by Mr. Stephen Mayou (medical Press and circular, 16th December, 1908), from the census statistics for England and Wales, that there are now about 3,000 children under the age of 15 years blind from ophthalmia neonatorum. It is said to cause 10 per cent. of all cases of blindness in this country. It was found to be responsible for 42 per cent. of all cases of blindness in the Sheffield School for the Blind, and for 36 per cent. of cases in the London County Council Blind Schools. "When it is borne in mind that all this could be prevented by the simplest prophylactic care, the continued blinding of babies in a civilised community becomes a crime. "Notification of the disease was recommended by the Midwives Act Committee, in their report published 25th August, 1909 (B.M.J. 1909 ii. p. 559): and by the Ophthalmia Neonatorum Committee of the British Medical Association, approved by the Central Council 28th April, 1909 (B.M.J, i. 1909 supp. p. 221). It is actually notifiable at present in Germany, Austria, France, Switzerland and 15 States of the U.S.A. The Public Health Committee of the Town of Stafford have recommended its addition to the list of notifiable diseases. "By the Rules of the Central Midwives Board, Midwives are already enjoined to call in medical aid on observing the slightest evidence of inflammation of the infant's eyes. Most cases, therefore, should automatically come under medical treatment, but notification would bring the disease into greater prominence. It might be reinforced by leaflets of advice to parents. Notified cases 22 might be visited by the Health Visitor and the voluntary workers who would urge parents to carry out the doctor's instructions, or in suitable cases to seek institutional treatment for the child. Notification is the only certain means of ascertaining to what extent the measures now in use are effective in saving eyes. "Notification should be carried out within a certain number of hours after the baby's eyes have been observed to be red or to run with matter, and the responsibility of reporting the disease should devolve upon the medical practitioner, head of family, nearest relatives, any person in charge of patient, or, in default of those, the occupier of the building. Any failure to comply with the law should entail an adequate penalty, monetary or otherwise. "Figures as to frequency in this country are not at present available, but a conjecture of the probable prevalence of the disease may be made from these returns Breslau in 2.35 per cent. of births. Stockholm 2.27 ,, ,, Valladolid 2.933 ,, ,, Switzerland 0.45 ., ,, "At a similar rate Poplar, with 6,000 births per annum, might furnish some 120 cases in a year at a cost of £15 for notification fees. "One Chester boy, who is being educated at the Liverpool School for the Blind (Wrexham Branch) under the Elementary Education Committee (Blind and Deaf Children) Act, costs the City £19 16s. per annum. "In the Borough of Stoke-on-Trent the notification apparently only relates to patients suffering from Ophthalmia Neonatorum or inflammation of the eyes, who are under two weeks old; but in Chester no age limit is imposed, as in leaving the age limit undefined the duty to notify lies on the persons concerned, otherwise the defence might be made that the case did not come under notice till the child was over the age limit. 23 EXTRACT FROM THE CHILDREN ACT, 1908. PART 2. SECTION 12. "If any person over the age of sixteen years who has the custody, charge or care of any child or young person causes such child to be ill-treated or neglected in a manner likely to cause such child unnecessary suffering to his health (including injury to or loss of sight) that person shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. EXTRACT FROM RULES FRAMED BY THE CENTRAL MIDWIVES BOARD. "By Rules E 18 and 19 (5) of the Rules framed by the Central Midwives' Board under Section 3 1. of the Midwives Act, 1902 (2 Ed to. 7, c. 17), at the Council Chamber, Whitehall, on 24th April, 1907, a midwife has to request the husband or nearest relative or friend to obtain medical help, and the midwife is also required by Rule E 20 and 21, to send notice to the local supervising authority, which in London is the London County Council. "So far as the local sanitary authority is concerned, with its Health Visitor, no notice has to be given, and it is obvious that if notification were compulsory the Health Visitor and the voluntary workers would be able to visit the cases, and where there was no doctor or where there had been a doctor and he had ceased to attend, the cases could be kept under observation. "With regard to the notification of ophthalmia neonatorum, there is no doubt that compulsory notification would act as a deterrent in the prevention of carelessness or inefficiency. "It may be accepted as proved that the careful adoption by midwives and nurses of very simple measures will reduce the incidence of ophthalmia neonatorum to a very low point. For example, a mere wiping of the infant's eyes free from adherent secretion as soon as possible after the head is born. "Immediately after the birth of a baby, and before anything else is done, wipe the eyelids and all parts surrounding the eyes with a soft dry linen rag; soon afterwards wash those parts with tepid water before any other part is touched. "The saving of the sight depends entirely upon the greatest 24 care and attention to cleanliness; small pieces of clean rag are better than sponges, as each rag should be used once only and then burnt immediately. Sponges should never be used except they are burnt after each washing. "A little vaseline smeared along the edges of the eyelids prevents them from sticking. "Water used in the first bath is known to be responsible for many infections of the baby's eyes, hence it should be an absolute rule that separate water should be employed for the face and the rest of the body. "If there is the slightest redness or discharge from the eyes, a medical man should be sent for at once, as the disease requires prompt attention, otherwise the child may lose its sight. "The best thanks are due to the Medical Officers of Health of the City of Chester and the County Borough of Stoke-on-Trent for the information they have so kindly afforded on the matter. "Without doubt arrangements could be made with the London and Poplar Hospitals to admit both mother and child into wards set aside for the purpose. So far as poor persons are concerned, there would be no difficulty in transferring mother and child to the temporary care of the Poor Law Authority, which might reasonably be asked to make provision for such cases. "Under the Public Health Act, 1875, any Local Authority may make provision for the conveyance to a hospital or other place of destination, of persons suffering under any infectious disorder. "Under the Infectious Lisease (Notification) Act, 1889, the Local Authority may pay the expenses of a person in hospital, even although such may not be a pauper, and may provide nursing attendance on patients who cannot be removed to hospital (vide footnote page 226, supplement B.M.J,, Report of Ophthalmia Neonatorum Committee, 8th May, 1909)." The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable ophthalmia neonatorum should be made a notifiable disease. As it is necessary 14 clear days' notice should be given to the members of the Council of the meeting at which it is proposed to adopt a resolution applying Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act to any infectious disease other than those specifically mentioned in the Section, the Committee proposed to recommend the Council at its meeting on the 7th July next to make the following order, viz.:— 25 "That the provisions of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to infectious disease, shall apply to ophthalmia neonatorum." The order would be subject to approval by the Local Government Board, and would come into operation on a date to be fixed by the Council not less than one week after public advertisement of the approved crder. The Committee recommended the Council that the provisions of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to notification of infectious diseases, shall apply within the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar to ophthalmia neonatorum. On reception of the report, it was moved by Mr. Alderman A. E. Thorp, seconded and resolved— "That the attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee be called to the following extract from their report on ophthalmia neonatorum, viz.: — "By Rules E. 18 and 19 (5) of the Rules framed by the Central Midwives Board under Section 31 of the Midwives' Act, 1902 (2 Edw. 7, c. 17), at the Council Chamber, Whitehall, on 24th April, 1907, a midwife has to request the husband or nearest relative or friend to obtain medical help, and the midwife is also required by E. 20 and 21, to send notice to the local supervising authority, which in London is the London County Council." and that the Committee be asked to consider and report as to the advisability of making it obligatory on the part of midwives, at the same time that they inform the London County Council to also inform the Medical Officer of Health, instead of making ophthalmia neonatorum a notifiable disease." At a meeting of the Council on the 7th July, it was moved by Mr. Councillor A. H. Warren, and seconded— "That the recommendation of the Committee be adopted." After debate: Amendment moved by Mr. Councillor G. Lansbury, and seconded— "That the recommendation be referred back to the Committee." Amendment put and declared carried. Resolved accordingly. 26 At the same meeting of the Council, 7th July, the Committee reported that they had considered the reference to them from the Council, viz.:— "That the attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee be directed to the following extract from their report on ophthalmia neonatorum, viz.:— "By Rules E. 18 and 19 (5) of the Rules framed by the Central Midwives Board under Section 3 I. of the Midwives Act, 1902 (2 Edw. 7, c. 17), at the Council Chamber, Whitehall, on 24th April, 1907, a midwife has to request the husband or nearest relative or friend to obtain medical help, and the midwife is also required by Rule E. 20 and 21, to send notice to the local supervising authority, which in London is the London County Council," and that the Committee be asked to consider and report as to the advisability of making it obligatory on the part of midwives at the same time that they inform the London County Council to also inform the Medical Officer of Health, instead of making ophthalmia a notifiable disease." The Committee in their report stated that:— "The Rules of the Central Midwives Board provide that in certain cases, including inflammation of the eyes, however slight, a medical practitioner shall be called and notification made to the London County Council. "We are advised by the Medical Officer that no material additional cost to the Council would be incurred by making ophthalmia neonatorum a notifiable disease, any case notified being dealt with by the existing staff, and that a list of cases attended by midwives would not include all such cases, but we think that an attempt may be made to utilise existing facilities for obtaining the information desired, and that in the meantime our recommendation to make ophthalmia neonatorum a notifiable disease may be withdrawn." "We have directed the London County Council be requested to furnish the Medical Officer of Health with particulars of all cases in the Borough notified by midwives in which medical assistance has been called in at their request on account of inflamed eyes in new-born infants, and have also requested the Medical Officer of 27 Health to report as to existing resources within the Borough for obtaining information in such cases." The Committee recommended the Council: — "That our action be approved." The Committee's recommendation was accordingly withdrawn. Resources of the Borough for obtaining the Information desired respecting ophthalmia neonatorum. On the 5th July the following report was presented to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— "The means at the disposal of the Public Health Department for discovering the frequency with which cases of ophthalmia neonatorum occur in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar are, under present arrangements, practically nil. "During the year 1909, 5,035 births occurred in the Borough; all these, however, were not notified under the Notification of the Births Act, 1907, and as some considerable proportion of the nonnotified cases may have consisted of those where neither a registered medical practitioner nor a certified midwife was in attendance it would, even if all births notified were visited, constitute a grave deficiency. To visit these 5,000 infants the Council have one Health Visitor. "If the sole duty of the Health Visitor were to visit infants, one visit to each (the only way in which cases of ophthalmia neonatorum could be discovered WITHOUT notification) would necessitate the regular payment of 20 visits per day on every working day in the year. This might be kept up, but it is doubtful, as is also the amount of good which this flying visit would do. "In addition, however, to visiting infants, the Council's Health Visitor has to organise work amongst the voluntary workers, and she acts as organising secretary to the Voluntary Association. There are some 50 helpers, paying an average of 1,000 visits per lunar month. Every four weeks notices are sent to these visitors who return the case papers. Each one has to be read and signed by the Health Visitor, the number of visits paid to each case 28 checked, the papers relating to infants who have removed, died, or completed a year picked out, and the information thus obtained has to be copied on to the duplicate sheets kept in the office. Forms (with duplicates) are made out to replace those which are depleted, and all forms are returned with letters of advice, etc., for which the remarks of the voluntary helpers may call. Some idea of the amount of clerical work entailed may be deducted from the fact that in 1909 1,126 communications were sent through the post by the Health Visitor. Six consultation days are held during each month; at five of these the Health Visitor superintends and also keeps in order the forms used by the hon. consultants, all this in addition to the organisation of meetings, with notices, preparation of agenda, etc., and attendance at same. "In 1909 922 infants were visited (this INCLUDES the work of the Health Visitor and the voluntary helpers), not a fourth of the number of infants born, but it must be remembered that the visiting is carried out on the assumption that no permanent good will result from the payment of one flying visit, so frequent visits are paid to each case for a whole year. "If the Council should decide, however, that for the purpose of detecting cases of ophthalmia neonatorum—instead of adopting compulsory notification—a visit shall be paid to each birth occurring in the Borough, no statistical work regarding the causes of infantile mortality can be done, and it will be absolutely impossible for the work of the voluntary helpers to be utilised, even if they be willing. should Miss Hall diminish devoting any of her time to organising. Moreover, no voluntary worker will visit except at her own convenience, and it could not be expected that she would pay the immediate visits required. "Furthermore, the voluntary worker is untrained, and without wishing to detract in any way from the exceedingly good work she does, it is quite possible that, unless she were specially trained, in cases where signs of ophthalmia neonatorum were showing, the helper would be quite ready to agree with the mother, that the baby had a cold in the eye, and then let the matter rest, the very idea which causes so much mischief, and which it is desired to uproot. "Referring to the possibility of coming to an arrangement with the London County Council regarding the notification of ophthalmia neonatorum. True! the duty of advising the calling in of medical 29 aid in cases showing the least inflammation of the eyes is laid upon the midwife and reporting to the London County Council, but is it always carried out? In cases which have come under the notice of the Health Visitor, this has not been done, two of them being such flagrant evasions of the duty, that the Medical Officer of Health reported them to the London County Council in order that the midwives concerned could be dealt with by the Inspector of Midwives for the County. "The Central Midwives Board could without doubt give some very interesting figures relating to the percentage of cases of misdemeanour reported to them from the various authorities in England and Wales, in which failure to call in medical aid in such cases figured. It formed part of the charge in four out of five cases reported to the Central Midwives Board by Miss Hall when acting as Inspector of Midwives for the City of Bradford, and in each case the midwife's name was removed from the roll. "Even if the Council be afforded by the London County Council the information furnished by the midwives, what about cases where there are no midwives? It must be remembered there is always the grave danger where medical men are called in that responsible persons may dispense with their services even after one visit, but if there were compulsory notification these cases would be notified to the Sanitary Authority and the Health Visitor or voluntary workers would watch them and the responsible persons could be dealt with under the Children Act if the infants be not cared for properly. Correspondence with the london county council respecting Proposed Compulsory Notification of Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Council Offices, Poplar. 30th June, 1910. Sir, I am directed by the Public Health and Housing Committee to state that they have had under consideration the question of ophthalmia neonatorum in new-born infants, and the desirability of making this a notifiable disease under Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Committee, however, in view of the fact that midwives are required to request the calling in of a medical man in all cases of inflamed eyes in new-born infants and to notify 30 the London County Council in such cases, think the information so obtained may be sufficient. I am directed, therefore, to inquire whether the London County Council would be prepared to inform the Medical Officer of Health of all cases of inflamed eyes notified in this borough by midwives, in order that adequate precautions may be taken. I am also to ask you to be good enough to state the number of such cases in this borough so notified during the past year. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) LEONARD POTTS, Town Clerk. The Clerk, London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. Council Offices, Poplar. 23rd July, 1910. Sir, Ophthalmia Neonatorum, Referring to my letter of the 30th ultimo, I am directed by the Council of this borough to press for an immediate reply as to whether the London County Council is prepared to supply the information desired. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) LEONARD POTTS, Town Cleric. The Clerk, London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 23rd July, 1910. Sir, The Council has received from the Medical Officer of Health for the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar a copy of two special reports recently presented by him to the Public Health Committee of the Borough Council on the subject of the notification of ophthalmia neonatorum. 31 With reference thereto, I would point out that notification to the Council of all cases of this disease occurring in the County of London in the practice of certified midwives is already required by the rules made by the Central Midwives Board under the provisions of the Midwives Act. Inquiry into all cases so notified is conducted by the inspectors under the Midwives Act, who are qualified medical practitioners, but the Council has no authority to incur expenditure for the medical treatment of infants suffering from ophthalmia. At the present time a medical practitioner is not required to report the occurrence of a case of ophthalmia in his practice to the Council of the County or of the Metropolitan Borough; but, in order that more complete information as to the occurience of this disease in the County of London may be obtainable, the Council has under consideration the question of making an order under Section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, declaring ophthalmia neonatorum to be a notifiable infectious disease within the whole of the County. Should this order be made and approved by the Local Government Board, notification of the occurrence of any cases of the disease would be made to the Council of the borough in which the disease occurred, certified midwives being required also to give notice to the Council. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) G. L. GOMME, Clerk of the Council. London County Council. County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 26th July, 1910. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, I have to inform you that, in all cases in which a midwife gives notice to the Council that a child, upon whom she has been in attendance at birth, is suffering from inflammation of the eyes, the infant is immediately visited by one of the Council's inspectors under the Midwives Act, with the object of ensuring that steps are taken to secure the proper treatment of the child. In these circumstances, the Council would suggest that the Medical Officer of Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar 32 should discuss the subject generally with the County Medical Officer of Health, more especially as the question of making ophthalmia neonatorum a notifiable infectious disease throughout the County is at present under consideration by the Council. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) G. L. GOMME, Clerk oj the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The suggestion of the London County Council was acted upon and the following report was presented to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— "Accordingly the Medical Officer interviewed the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council, who stated that the subject of the compulsory notification of cases of ophthalmia neonatorum throughout the county would come under the consideration of the Public Health Committee at the first meeting after the recess. "In 1908, for the whole county 97 cases, in which medical aid had been called in upon the least inflammation of the eyes in newly-born children, were reported by midwives to the London County Council. In 1909, 162 such were reported. "Taking London as a whole, a quarter of the cases of confinements are attended by midwives, but in Poplar half the cases are attended by midwives. "In 1909, in Poplar, nine cases of inflammation of the eyes in which medical aid had been called in were reported by midwives to the London County Council, so that if this figure of 9 represents all cases of inflammation of the eyes in births attended by midwives, 18 cases of ophthalmia neonatorum would represent the number occurring in Poplar. But are all cases reported by midwives? (See Medical Officer's report presented to the Committee on 5th July, 1910.) "Taking the 162 cases reported by midwives in 1909 for the whole of London, and a quarter of the confinements in London being attended by midwives, then there would happen in London some 600 cases of inflammation of the eyes in newly-born children, 33 but a large number of these cases would not be ophthalmia neonatorum of the dangerous kind. The cost for these 600 notifications would be £75. "Without doubt the expenditure of this £75 would be the means of saving the sight of a number of eyes. It has been estimated that forty per cent. of the blindness of the children in the London County Council schools is due to ophthalmia neonatorum. "The Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council stated his authority has two female medical officers, and immediately upon the receipt of a notice from a midwife that medical aid had been called in, in cases showing the least inflammation of the eyes, these medical officers visit the cases. "The London County Council have an arrangement with three nursing institutions for these ophthalmic cases to be attended to and watched where necessary. "So far this is good in respect of the cases reported to the London County Council, but what about the cases which have not been notified, for it must be remembered there is always a grave danger where medical men are called in that their services may be dispensed with after a first visit. But as pointed out by the Medical Officer in his report of 5th July, if there be compulsory notification these cases would be notified to the Sanitary Authority and the Health Visitor or a voluntary worker would watch them, and the responsible persons could be dealt with under the Children Act if the infants be not cared for properly.'' A letter dated 20th December was received from the Local Government Board, stating that the Board on that date approved an Order by the London County Council extending the application of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the Administrative County to ophthalmia neonatorum. A copy of the Order, stating the date on which it comes into force, has not yet come to hand from the London County Council. The Order will come into operation one week after a public advertisement has been made by the London County Council.* *The Order was made by the London County Council on the 7th February, 1911, and came into operation on the 13th March, 1911.

Together with the Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, Mr. Councillor Warren, and the Rev.

The Conference was held in the Caxton Hall, Westminster, on Wednesday, 25th May. The following motions were carried:— (1.) "That this Conference is of opinion that the provision of 43 Sanatoria for the educational and curative treatment of cases of tuberculosis is advisable." (2) (a) "That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that a Sanatorium should be established for the accommodation of persons of the working classes of the Metropolis suffering from tuberculosis, and that such institution should be maintained by a charge upon the several Metropolitan Boroughs in accordance with their respective rateable values." (b) "That in the opinion of this Conference the proposed Sanatorium should be under the direct control of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and that such Authority be asked to seek the necessary Parliamentary powers for that purpose (if necessary)." (c) "That copies of the above resolutions be forwarded to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and to the Local Government Board." (3.) "That pending the provision of a Sanatorium for the working classes, it is desirable that each Municipal Authority should secure beds in some existing Sanatorium according to the provisions of Section 75 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891." (4.) "That in the opinion of this Conference the establishment of Tuberculosis Dispensaries in each of the Metropolitan Boroughs would be a desirable adjunct to the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis."

At the centre depot alone, in one day, over eight hundred vessels of all descriptions were filled with the fluid, and at this depot on the same day 70 bottles of the Council filled with the fluid were distributed. Nearly one thousand vessels were filled. The output of fluid during each month of the year 1910 was as follows:— January 1,708 Gallons.

Since the plant has been installed, a period now reaching five years, 140,000 gallons have been manufactured at a cost for electricity and materials of under £271. The great monetary advantage to the Borough since the installation of the Electrolytic Plant need not be referred to in detail, as the fact has been the subject of reports again and again. The Public Health Department is not only furnished with the disinfectant and the various institutions of the Council (the public baths, etc.), but the institutions of the Managers of the Sick Asylums and of tha Board of Guardians (within and without the Borough) are supplied with an unlimited quantity free. For the fluid supplied to the Works Department a charge of 1d. per gallon is made; the Public Health Department is credited with this amount although no actual monetary transaction takes place. As applicants now usually bring their own receptacles to the depots, there is also a very appreciable saving in the expenses on bottles alone. 92 The two plants can deliver in eight hours 400 gallons of electrolytic fluid at a strength of 4.5 to 6.1 grammes of Chlorine per litre. The quantity mentioned above can of course be increased or diminished by opening or shutting the valves, the strength varying in proportion to the number of amperes allowed by the rheostat to pass through the electrodes.

Condition of Plant. After working for nearly five years and not having been cleaned for a period of over twelve months, the apparatus was taken to pieces, overhauled and thoroughly cleaned. The platinum wire and slates upon which it is wound were found in perfect condition—these are the positive electrodes and are the costly portion of the plant. The somewhat altered shape of the new zinc electrodes will without doubt considerably increase their lives and give greater efficiency in the working of the plant. With a current of 25 amperes there is obtained over 6 grammes of chlorine per litre. This efficiency is no doubt due to the new shape of the electrodes and to the earthenware tanks. The tanks are made of earthenware (which if well glazed will never wear out). Earthenware is one of the best insulating materials. Tanks made of slate contain iron (it seems impossible to obtain slate free from iron) and were being constantly destroyed by the action of the electric current and had to be often replaced. 96 Spraying and Cleansing Floors of London County Council Schools with Electrolytic Disinfecting Fluid. Council Offices, Poplar. 29th September, 1909. Sir, The Public Health and Housing Committee have had under consideration the question of the possibility of the spread of infectious disease by means of dust raised in school rooms by the movements of the children, and they are advised this is a probable source of infection. On the 26th September, 1906*, an offer was made to the London County Council by this Council, but not then accepted, to deliver, free of cost, supplies of disinfectants for use in the schools in the Borough. » I am directed to suggest that, experimentally, supplies of the disinfectant should be accepted for use in sprinkling the floors in six selected schools in the Borough, and the effect on the condition of the children and their attendance noted. I am to add that the Public Health and Housing Committee will be prepared to recommend the Council to renew its offer of September, 1906, to supply •Council Offices, Poplar. 27th September, 1906. Sir, Disinfectants. I am directed by the Public Health and Housing Committee to offer supplies of electrolysed salt water disinfectant manufactured by this Council for use in the public elementary schools in this Borough. I enclose papers describing the nature, power and use of the disinfectant. The Committee will be pleased to arrange for delivery to the schools, with necessary instructions for use. It is not proposed to make any charge in connection with the supply. Yours faithfully, (Signed) LEONARD POTTS, Town Clerk. The Clerk, London County Council, Education Department, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 97 the disinfectant, with instructions for use, free to all the schools in the Borough should the County Council desire to continue its use. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) LEONARD POTTS, Town Clerk. The Executive Officer, London County Council. London County Council, Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 5th August, 1910. Sir, Adverting to your letter of 29th September, 1909, with reference to the supply of disinfectant for use in sprinkling the floors of six selected L.C.C. schools in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, I am directed to state that the Council, on 21st June, 1910, decided to accept the offer of the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council to supply disinfectant as an experiment for six months for the purpose of sprinkling the floors of the following L.C.C. schools in the Borough :— Knapp Road Alton Street Bromley Hall Road Marner Street Ricardo Street Culloden Street The schoolkeepers of these schools have been informed that the experiment will be carried out from 20th August, 1910, on which date the first sprinkling should be made. Perhaps you will be good enough to arrange for the delivery of the disinfectant with the necessary direction for use. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Signed) R. BLAIR, Education Officer. Leonard Potts, Esq., Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Town Hall, Poplar. Accordingly the schools mentioned in the Education Officer's letter were visited, the schoolkeepers interviewed, the necessary directions given h 98 as to the use of the electrolytic disinfecting fluid, and arrangements made for its delivery. The days for delivery are Tuesdays and Fridays. To the end of the year the six schools mentioned in the Education Officer's letter of the 5th August were supplied with 3,146 gallons. For the purposes of the experiment the infants' departments only are being followed up at present. The directions given to the schoolkeepers are to well soak with electrolytic fluid the sawdust used for scattering over the floors and to sprinkle the floors with the fluid by means of an ordinary galvanised iron watering-can with a large rose on the spout. The scattering of the soaked sawdust and the sprinkling of the floors with the fluid is to be daily carried out previous to sweeping the floors, as dry sweeping only spreads the dust, for while part of it is removed, the rest, which has been stirred, settles down when the disturbance is over. The schoolkeepers were also directed to use the fluid in the water when washing the floors of the classrooms. The floors of the classrooms are washed once in three weeks, but the babies' rooms are cleansed more frequently. The spraying or sprinkling must be carried out with much care, as with a too free use of moisture the floors will not be dry by the morning. In damp weather the drying process must naturally be delayed. Experience showed that the holes in the roses of the watering-cans in use were too large. Probably garden syringes with fine roses would give better results. The floors would not become so damp and consequently would be dry in the morning. Using the fluid undiluted or too strong a perceptible odour is given off at the time of sprinkling or washing on account of the presence of organic matter in or upon the floors, consequently the oxidising process must be gradual. Each schoolkeeper must, therefore, by experience, find out the necessary dilution the fluid requires when it is used for sprinkling or spraying floors. Filth from the streets is brought in on the boots and shoes of the scholars during all sorts and conditions of weather. The daily tramp of the children must work the filth into the wooden floors and cause them to become impregnated. Without doubt, sputum, the results of the habit 99 of spitting in the streets, is carried in on the boots and shoes, therefore, for the sake of the health of the scholars, it must be good to endeavour to oxidise or to render inert this organic matter, and the daily spraying of the floors with the electrolytic disinfectant fluid tends to bring this about. As mentioned above the dust of a schoolroom is chiefly composed of mud, carried in by the children's boots, added to which are atoms of organic material from the eyes, mouths, noses, and garments of the scholars. This dust is particularly stirred up by the movement of the feet of the scholars and must be inhaled by them. The application of the electrolytic fluid to the floors will not stain them but will tend to bleach them, so that there will be no unpleasant and depressing effects of darkened floors, and there will be no soiling of the teachers' skirts. Until the floors have been sprayed daily for some length of time with the fluid they may have a spotted appearance, as the bleaching effect of the electrolytic fluid will take time in affecting the old stains. There is a possibility that diseases in scholars and epidemics of infectious diseases in schools are due to the dust of the classrooms and the clothing of the scholars. It will be interesting to watch the result of this experiment to see whether the attendances in these schools is better than that of schools in which dust-allaying and germ-killing processes are not carried out. Swimming Baths, the use therein of the Electrolytic Fluid. The fluid continues to be added to the water in the swimming baths in the same quantity and strength as mentioned in the Annual Report for the year 1909, viz., 1 part of chlorine to 2,000,000 parts of water. The Bath Superintendents repeat their statements that the addition of the fluid prevents the formation of slime in the water, the slime is not found at the bottom of the baths when they are emptied, and there is no offensive smell when the baths are being cleansed. 100 VICTORIA PARK BATHING LAKE. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 19th July, 1910. Sir, The Parks and Open Spaces Committee of the Council have had before them a letter, dated 12th May, 1910, from the Medical Officer of Health of Poplar, drawing attention to the condition of the water in the men's bathing lake at Victoria Park, and suggesting that the lake should be cleaned out. With reference thereto, I am directed to state that an analysis of samples of water taken from the lake has recently been made by the Council's Chemist, who has expressed the opinion that the water is not in any way offensive and is of sufficiently good quality for the purpose in question. I am to add that all reasonable steps are taken to maintain the water in good condition, there being a constant stream of fresh water running through the lake, and the lake being cleaned out every two years. The Committee have recently made an inspection of the lake, and, after having carefully considered the matter, they do not think it necessary to take any action in the direction suggested until next Spring, when in the ordinary course the periodical cleaning of the lake will be undertaken. I am, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, Clerk of the Council, The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered reports on the subject, and were satisfied the condition of the water had been most unsatisfactory. In view of the large number of bathers using the lake the Committee were of opinion provision should be made for a complete 101 annual cleansing and for more adequate flushing during the summer months. The Committee recommended :— " That the Council concur in this opinion, and a communication on the subject be addressed to the London County Council; and further that the Borough Councils of Hackney and Bethnal Green be invited to support the action of this Borough Council." The Bethnal Green and Hackney Borough Councils agreed to support the representations made by the Poplar Borough Council to the London County Council as to the condition of the water in the Victoria Park bathing lake, and urged annual cleaning out and more adequate flushing during the summer. SHELTER AND DISINFESTING STATION. New Shelter and Disinfesting (Bathing) Accommodation. Appointment of New Attendant and Caretaker. The Public Health and Housing Committee had under consideration the provision of shelter accommodation, and of bathing and disinfesting facilities. The Committee viewed the cottage and workshops at Bromley Depot then in use, or reserved for these purposes, and which had hitherto been found sufficient. The Works Committee had on several occasions represented to the Committee the desirability of vacating the cottage in order that it might be available for the purposes for which it was originally provided. The Committee were informed that in view of the completion of the new dust destructor the cottage was required for the residence of the destructor foreman, to ensure efficient supervision of the destructor. New Shelter and Disinfesting (Bathing) Accommodation. Plans for the utilisation of the upper workshops at the Destructor Depot for the purpose of an Infectious Disease Shelter and the Disinfesting House and yard, were approved by the Public Health and Housing Committee, and the adoption of this scheme rendered unnecessary the projected initial outlay of £1,260 on new buildings for these purposes, as well as the rental of £40 per annum for a proposed site 102 The Works Committee were satisfied the centralisation of stores and mechanics' work contemplated in the scheme submitted would be of advantage in promoting economical administration and securing more effectual supervision, and recommended the Council to adopt the scheme for re-organisation of the Council's Depots, and provision, in existing buildings, of Shelter and Disinfesting House. Appointment of New Attendant and Caretaker. Miss A. Bacon, for domestic reasons, resigned the position of attendant and caretaker at the Infectious Diseases Shelter, to which she was appointed in September, 1905. The Committee accepted Miss Bacon's resignation with regret, and desired to record their appreciation of her service, and the manner in which she had carried out the duties of her position, necessarily of an unattractive nature. The Committee recommended the Council—That a testimonial under the Seal of the Council be given to Miss Bacon in respect of her service with the Council. The Committee appointed Mrs. A. Howe, widow, of Vernon Road, Bow, to fill the vacancy. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897.* The Council is empowered by the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, to give any person applying on the ground that he is infested with vermin, free use of any apparatus for cleansing his person and clothing, and may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants for this purpose. Provision was made in 1905 for cleansing verminous persons. During the year 686 persons had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfested. Since the notices were posted throughout the Borough, a total of 4,256 persons had applied for baths, etc., as mentioned above.

The Public Health and Housing Committee considered correspondence with the London County Council with reference to verminous children in schools, and the report of Miss Tattersall (Sanitary Inspector), with regard to her visits to cases notified from the schools. It appeared the children * See page 293. † See page 295. ‡ Varminous Rooms, London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, see page 219. 104 notified as verminous were not excluded from the schools, pending cleansing, and the Committee directed a communication be addressed to the London County Council urging that such children be excluded from the school until cleansing had been effected, and that if such children, after exclusion, presented themselves at the schools without being cleansed, they should be dealt with under the compulsory powers conferred on the London County Council under Section 30 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, or Section 122 of the Children's Act, 1908. The following is the correspondence which passed upon the subject: — Public Health Offices, Bow Road. 22nd September, 1910. Dear Sir, Re Verminous Children (Schools). I may add that Miss Tattersall informs me that in the large majority of these cases reported by you the children continue to attend school. Would it not be better if these children were excluded from attending school, and then if the parents refused to have the children's clothing disinfested and their bodies bathed proceedings could be instituted ?

London County Council, Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 29th September, 1910. Dear Sir, With reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, I have to state that we are forwarding the names and addresses of all children found to be in attendance at schools in your Borough with verminous bodies and clothing, as requested in your letter of the 21st July last. The question of the cleansing of these children is still under the consideration of the Council and as soon as arrange- 105 ments have been completed only the names of those cases which have been cleansed at a station will be forwarded to you. Yours faithfully, (Signed) JAMES KERR, Medical Officer (Education). P. W. Alexander, Esq., D.P.H., Borough of Poplar. Council Offices, Poplar. 3rd October, 1910. Dear Sir, Verminous Children in Schools. Adverting to your letter of the 26th July last, I am desired by the Public Health and Housing Committee to state they are informed the verminous children found in the schools, and notified to the Medical Officer of Health, are not excluded from school pending cleansing of their person. The cases notified are immediately visited by the lady sanitary inspector with a view to inducing attendance at the cleansing station and securing disinfesting and cleansing of the bedding and the homes, but owing to the continued attendance of the children at the schools, 17 children only out of 59 notified were reported as having attended at the cleansing station. I am directed to urge that the London County Council should exclude verminous children from school, and if any return without cleansing, that the provisions relating to verminous children contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, or the Children's Act, 1908, should be put into operation. Yours faithfully, (Signed) LEONARD POTTS, Town Cleric. The Medical Officer (Education), Education Offices, Victoria Embankment. 106 London County Council, Council Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 25th October, 1910. Sir, Cleansing of Children infested with Vermin. The Appropriate Committee of the Council have had under consideration the suggestion contained in your letter of the 3rd instant., as to the exclusion fiom school of children found to be in a verminous condition. As you are aware, the Council has for some time had under consideration the general question of dealing with verminous children throughout London, and the use of the cleansing stations established by the Borough Councils in connection therewith. The Council has itself established, as an experiment, three cleansing stations, viz., at the "Chaucer" School (Bermondsey), Bath Street School (Finsbury, E.), and Finch Street School (Whitechapel). The procedure set out in the attached statement has been put into operation at these centres, and it is hoped that arrangements will shortly be made which will enable this pi-ocedure to be extended throughout London. I am now directed to state that the Committee are unable to see their way to adopt the suggestion of the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council as to the exclusion of verminous children, and to point out that the necessity of such a course being adopted will be obviated when the general arrangements above referred to are complete. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) B. BLAIR, Education Officer. The Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Council Offices, High Street, Poplar, E. 107 Cleansing Scheme (Bodies and Clothing).—Suggested mode of Procedure. In order that effect might be given to the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, and the Children Act, 1908, it was suggested from the Education Offices that the following procedure should be adopted :— (a) The nurse will visit the school and note all children whose persons or clothing are infested with vermin, or who are in a foul and filthy condition, and supply the head teacher with a copy of the following card for each child who requires to be cleansed:— M.O. 24. Obverse. (Private.) London County Council. Cleanliness. Your attention is called to the unsatisfactory condition of as regards body and clothing. If the directions on the other side of this card are complied with the condition can be remedied in a few hours, in which case the Council does not propose to take any proceedings under Section 122 of the Children Act, 1908. JAMES KERR, Medical Officer (Education), Date Reverse. The child's clothing being removed should be exposed for ten minutes to boiling water or steam at the same temperature, and then thoroughly dried and brushed ; in the meantime the child should be well washed all over with soft soap and water, and then given a hot bath ; by these means the vermin and their eggs will be destroyed. These cards will be enclosed in sealed envelopes and given to the children to take home, in order that the parents may have an opportunity of doing the necessary cleansing. 108 (b) At the end of 48 hours the nurse will again visit the school and all cases not cleansed will be separated from the other children, and the nurse will immediately forward the names to the medical officer (Education) and the Divisional Superintendent, giving the days and times when children can attend the station. Arrangements will then be made for the divisional superintendent to serve the following notice upon the parents : — London County Council. 5 A 149 Children Act, 1908.—Cleansing of Children.—Warning to Parents.

R. BLAIR, Education Officer. 111 Directions. The child's clothing being removed should be placed for ten minutes in boiling water or exposed to steam at the same temperature, and then thoroughly dried and brushed ; in the meantime the child should be well washed over with soft soap and water and then given a hot bath; by these means the vermin and their eggs will be destroyed. Should you not have convenience at home for doing this cleansing, arrangements have been made whereby your child can be bathed and its clothes cleansed at on presenting this form between the hours of and on Section 122 of the Children Aet reads :—(Here follows Section 122). April, 1910. Arrangement with the London County Council for the Cleansing of School Children infested with Vermin. In March the Public Health and Housing Committee directed the London County Council Education Committee be informed that the exclusive use of baths at the existing cleansing station would be available between 9 a.m. and 12 noon for the cleansing, under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, and the Children's Act, of 12 verminous school children at a fee of 2s. for each bath, including disinfection of clothing. The Borough Council approved the action of the Committee. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the reference back to them by the Council of their proposal with reference to the terms on which the Council should undertake the cleansing of verminous school children. The following letter embodied the terms proposed by the London County Council Education Committee, viz.:— London County Council. Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 4th May, 1910. Sir, Cleansing of Children infested with Vermin. The Appropriate Committee of the Council have again had 112 under consideration the question of the cleansing of school children infested with vermin. The Committee have provisionally agreed upon the general outline of the following scheme for the treatment of children throughout London 1. That the cleansing stations provided by the various Metropolitan Borough Councils should, as far as possible, be utilised by agreement with the Borough Councils. 2. That the treatment of children should be entirely distinct from any establishment used for the isolation of suspected cases of infectious disease contacts. 3. Thpt the exclusive use of the baths for the cleansing of children should be allowed on certain days. 4. That the cleansing station should be in a convenient position, and that the children should be efficiently supervised, with female attendants for the treatment of the girls. 5. That a uniform payment to the Borough Councils at the rate of 2s. per child, irrespective of the numbar of baths required before a child can be regarded as cleansed, should be arranged throughout London. 6. That this scheme be subject to the Borough Councils undertaking, where necessary, to deal with the homes of the children cleansed. The Committee understand that the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council are in general agreement with the terms of the above outlined scheme. In this connection, I am directed to call particular attention to paragraph 5 of the scheme, and to ask whether, in the event of the Council adopting this scheme, the Metropolitan Borough Council would be willing to co-operate with the Council in accordance therewith, and also to deal with the homes of the children cleansed. An early reply will oblige. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, E. BLAIB, Education Officer. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Council Offices, High Street, Poplar, E. 113 The Council on the 17th March approved the Public Health and Housing Committee's suggestion to the London County Council that the fee for each child cleansed should be 2s. for each attendance at the cleansing station. The Committee on the 23rd June recommended the Council that the cleansing of verminous school children be undertaken on the terms stated, subject to the condition that if a child, after cleansing, does not again attend at the cleansing station within a fortnight, any further cleansing of such child shall be paid for as a fresh case. On the 3rd January, 1911, the Committee considered a letter from the London County Council stating that Council is prepared, as an experiment for one year, to enter into an agreement with the Borough Council for the cleansing of school children infested with vermin subject to the following conditions, viz. :— 1. The place of treatment of children shall be entirely distinct from any establishment used for the isolation of suspected cases of infectious disease contacts. 2. The exclusive use of the baths for the cleansing of children shall be allowed on certain days. 3. The cleansing station shall be in a convenient position, and the children must be efficiently supervised with female attendants for the treatment of the girls. 4. A payment at the rate of 2s. per child shall be made to the Borough Council in respect of the cleansing of children infested with vermin ; the payment shall cover a period to the end of the calendar month subsequent to that in which the Srst cleansing takes place, and within the period specified it shall be irrespective of the number of baths required before a child can be regarded as cleansed. 5. This scheme shall be subject to the Metropolitan Borough Councils undertaking, where necessary, to deal with the homes of the children cleansed. The Committee reported to the Council on the 19th January, 1911 :— " It is anticipated the new cleansing station at Bromley depot will be completed within two months, when it will be practicable to comply fully with the condition that the place shall be distinct from the infectious diseases shelter. t 114 " The conditions appear to be reasonable and have been in the main already approved by the Council." The Committee recommended the Council that the arrangement with the London County Council for the cleansing of school children infested with vermin, on the conditions stated, be approved, and an agreement sealed in due course. Arrangements with London County Council for the Cleansing of Verminous Inmates of Common Lodging-houses. Under Section 37 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, the London County Council may, by its Medical Officer or any person authorised by him, examine the persons and clothing of inmates of common lodging houses, and if such authorised person is of opinion that the person or clothing of an inmate is infested with vermin or is in a foul or filthy condition, he may give to such inmate notice in writing to submit his person and clothing, within twenty-four hours, to be cleaned, in suitable premises and with suitable appliances, to be specified. If such notice is not complied with the inmate may be taken to the premises specified and detained until the necessary cleansing is effected. In March the London County Council inquired whether the Borough Council would be prepared to cleanse any person of common lodging houses in the Borough if sent by the County Council, and also whether the Borough Council would be prepared to enter into an arrangement for cleansing inmates from common lodging houses in a neighbouring Borough if sent by the County Council. In view of the fact that the Council has established, under the Verminous Persons Act, accommodation for cleansing verminous persons who apply voluntarily, and that such accommodation will be sufficient for other cases, the Public Health and Housing Committee directed the London County Council be informed cases sent by them from common lodging houses in the Borough would be dealt with at a charge of 2s. per head, and that cases from an adjoining Borough would also be dealt with on the same terms, subject to limitation or discontinuance if found to interfere unduly with the proper working of the cleansing station. The Council approved the action of the Committee. In December, the Public Health and Housing Committee had under further consideration the question of the cleansing of verminous inmates of 115 common lodging houses. The London County Council asked that the Council should treat any such case from lodging houses in the Borough without charge, and that the London County Council should pay Is. per head for any sent from outside the Borough. The proposal made by the Committee was that the London County Council should pay 2s. for each case sent from common lodging houses inside or outside the Borough, but having regard to the fact that the proposal made by the London County Council had been generally adopted by other Boroughs, the Committee recommended the Council to cleanse verminous inmates of common lodging houses within the Borough, sent by the London County Council to the Cleansing Station, free of charge, and any inmates of common lodging houses sent from adjoining Boroughs at a charge of Is. per head.

One patient in Bromley was re-notified as suffering from enteric fever. Five patients died—two Poplar, one Bromley and two Bow. One of the Poplar deaths occurred on the 9th September in Dartford Heath Asylum, patient having been admitted on the 7th July. This case was not notified. The cause of death was septicaemia following child-birth (four days), very advanced aortic and mitral disease, chronic Bright's disease. SMALLPOX. A case of smallpox occurred in Bromley, a male aged 56 years. The patient was removed to South Wharf (M.A.B.) on 3rd January and thence to Joyce Green Hospital, Dartford. He was a casual labourer in the docks and was reported to have been working in Millwall Docks on 17 th December on the "Albertus," ex Kaonigsberg, and on 18th and 20th December on the "Roma," ex Libau, Russia. The Port Medical' Officer was informed of this. He replied, "There is no history of smallpox on either of the vessels mentioned, but smallpox is prevalent in Russia at more than one Baltic Port and at Odessa." * See page 55 as to what diseases are included under Puerperal Fever. 122 The members of the patient's family (wife and three children) were admitted into the Council's shelter, where they were bathed and their clothes disinfected. They remained in the shelter until the afternoon of 6th January whilst the premises where the case occurred were being disinfected. The wife refused to remain any longer at the shelter, although an endeavour was made to persuade her to stop with her children and be fed for fourteen days (the incubation period of smallpox), but she refused, electing to return home. Upon being questioned she stated she was without means and would have to apply to the Board of Guardians for relief. She refused to stay in the shelter even if her arrears in rent and if her concurrent rent were paid by the Council. A sailor (coloured man), who slept for ten days up to and including Sunday, 2nd January, in the same part of the house as the patient, was traced to an address in Canning Town, West Ham, having moved there from the Borough of Poplar on 3rd January.

"Dee," and came to lodge with patient ; the Port Medical Officer of Health for London was duly informed of this and also of the sailor's new address in West Ham. On account of a child belonging to the family occupying the lower part of the house having gone to stay with relatives in Bethnal Green, the Medical Officer of Health for that Borough was informed of the case. A man living in Poplar, who had also been in contact with the patient, was reported to be well in health and working in the Millwall Docks. All the inmates of the premises, with the exception of the coloured sailor, were reported to have been vaccinated in infancy, and all the members of the patient's family were re-vaccinated on 4th January whilst in the Council's shelter. In order to keep the inmates of the house under observation, daily calls were made. 123 VACCINATION. Vaccination Act, 1907. The Vaccination Officer, Mr. G. W.

Bacteriological Examinations. 81 swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria were forwarded for bacteriological examination to the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine.* The Bacillus Diphtherias was isolated in 29 instances (35.8 per cent.), and the Pseudo Diphtheritic Bacillus in 8 cases. On 9th December, 1909, a letter was received from the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine with reference to the transmission of reports on the results of bacteriological examinations for the Bacillus of Diphtheria and therein it was stated as follows:— "All specimens from suspected cases of Diphtheria in your district received before 10 am on week-days (Saturdays excepted), will be reported on if Positive the same evening between 5.30 and 6 p.m. by telegram, telephone or post, either to you, or to the sender of the specimen, as you may prefer. If the result is Negative no report will be sent until confirmed by the next morning's examination. "All specimens received at any time on Saturdays up to 10 p.m. will be reported upon by telegram or telephone to the senders of the specimens on Sunday forenoons if required, and the results will be confirmed by post to you on Mondays, but it is requested that the Institute may be informed whether your Council desire reports on Sundays and will authorise the cost of telegrams when it is not possible to telephone." The caretaker at the Public Health Offices understands the transmission of the reports to the medical practitioners, so that the arrangement will hasten the removal to hospital or isolation at home of patients suffering from diphtheria.

The 66 cases in Poplar were notified from 55 premises, the 70 cases in Bromley from 65 premises, and the 39 cases in Bow from 35 houses, and of these premises the drains were found to be defective in 11 instances —6 Poplar, 3 Bromley, and 2 Bow. Isolation. 46 cases in Poplar (sub-district), 59 in Bromley, and 34 in Bow were removed to hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Four patients from Poplar (sub-district) were treated in the East London Hospital for Children and one in the Middlesex Hospital, two patients from Bromley were treated in the East London Hospital for Children and two in the Sick Asylum, and one patient from Bow was treated in the East London Hospital for Children. So that 149 patients out of 175 notified cases in the Borough were isolated. The Diphtheria Anti-Toxin (London) Order, 1910. The following is a copy of a circular letter which was received from the Local Government Board :— PROVISION OF DIPHTHERIA ANTI-TOXIN. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 15th August, 1910. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that they have had under consideration the question of facilitating the prompt use of diphtheria anti-toxin in the case of persons who may be attacked by diphtheria or exposed to the infection of the disease, and with that object they have made an Order, under Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sanctioning the provision by the Councils of Metropolitan Boroughs of a temporary supply of diphtheria anti-toxin and of medical attendance in connection therewith. Copies of the Order are forwarded herewith. 137 The arrangements with respect to the keeping, distribution and use of the diphtheria anti-toxin are to be made in accordance with the advice of the medical officer of health, and having regard to the importance of the matter, I am to suggest that, at an early date) the Council should consider, with their medical officer of health, what arrangements should be made for the provision of anti-toxin, and for its use both as a prophylactic and a curative agency. In cases in which a patient is under the care of a medical practitioner, the latter should, in ordinary circumstances, be the person to administer the anti-toxin. In considering the matter the Council should take into special account the possible requirements of the poor law medical officers, as it appears to the Board to be desirable, where the Council avail themselves of the powers now given them, that the poor law medical officers should be able to obtain from the store of the Council the anti-toxin which they may require from time to time for use in connection with patients under their care. To prevent misapprehension it should be observed that the free provision of diphtheria anti-toxin which is authorised by the Order must not be regarded as a substitute for removal to hospital of a patient suffering from diphtheria, nor as implying that the patient to whom the anti-toxin has been administered may properly be retained for treatment at home, unless means are available for his efficient isolation to the satisfaction of the medical officer of health. The prompt administration of anti-toxin before the patient is removed to hospital may, especially if delay in removal is inevitable, go far towards preventing the attack of diphtheria from being fatal. By Article II. of the Order the duties of the medical officer of health are to be deemed to extend to and include all action by the medical officer of health in the execution of the Order, and Article III. provides for the payment by the Council to the medical officer of health of reasonable compensation for such action taken by him. The arrangements which the Council may make for the supply of diphtheria anti-toxin should be brought to the knowledge of all medical practitioners practising within their jurisdiction ; and in any circular letter which the Council send out to medical 138 tioners it is desirable that emphasis should be laid on the importance of prompt treatment by anti-toxin, and of the saving of life which may thereby be effected. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) H. C. MONRO, Secretary. To the Clerk to the Metropolitan Borough Council. Upon the receipt of this communication and the Diphtheria Antitoxin (London) Order, 1910, the following report was presented to the Committee:— "The Committee will, without doubt, remember that on 23rd September, 1907, a report presented by them to the Council contained the following : — "We have considered the question of the supply of antitoxin to medical practitioners for use in suspected cases of diphtheria pending the reception of reports on the bacteriological examination of swabbings taken from the patients' throats. It has been frequently pointed out to the Committee by the Medical Officer of Health, and also by medical practitioners who have been communicated with in respect of patients removed but afterwards found to be not suffering from diphtheria, that it is very essential that patients should be removed to the hospital as quickly as possible that they may be treated with diphtheria anti-toxin, and to delay removal, without anti-toxin treatment, in order to await the result of the bacteriological examinations, might endanger the lives of patients. The time taken at the Lister Institute for a bacteriological examination averages twelve hours after the delivery of the swabbing, and there is, of course, the further delay in the receipt of the swabbings at the Public Health Offices, and their dispatch to the Lister Institute. Results are telegraphed or telephoned, but if diphtheritic bacilli are found at least a day's delay in removal has probably occurred, and further delay is also caused owing to the fact that no bacteriological examinations are made of Saturday afternoons or Sundays. 139 "\We are advised that it is an important element in the suscessful treatment of diphtheria with anti-toxin that the injection should be made as early as possible, and the Medical Officer of Health considers that, if there is reasonable suspicion that the case is one of diphtheria, an injection of anti-toxin should be at once made. " In view of the loss, inconvenience and suffering occasioned by the erroneous notification and removal of patients not suffering from the disease notified, we are of opinion it is desirable that anti-toxin should be supplied, at the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health, for use pending receipt of results of bacteriological examinations in cases where such provision cannot otherwise be made. We are assured no ill results follow from injections of the anti-toxin in cases which are subsequently, found to be not true cases of diphtheria. "The Committee recommend :— "That the Medical Officer of Health be authorised to supply at his discretion diphtheria anti-toxin, free of charge, to medical practitioners for use in cases of suspected diphtheria in the borough, pending receipt of result of bacteriological examinations, or where patients are too ill to be removed. " To which there was an amendment:— "To omit all words after the words that the in order to insert there these words : ' Council declines to enter into competition on an nnfair basis with purveyors of drugs and related preparations, and emphatically refuses to relieve medical practitioners of their natural responsibilities.' "The amendment was adopted by the Council." 140 Table1 Showing Admissions from Diphtheria to Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals for the Years 1888-1907, with Mortality Rate in these Hospitals and throughout the Country.

The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the above report, and the circular letter and Order of the Local Government Board 143 on the subject of provision of diphtheria anti-toxin by Metropolitan Borough Councils for immediate use in the case of persons attacked by diphtheria or exposed to infection from that disease. The Committee reported to the Council as follows : — "As the Council is aware, swabbings are taken by medical practitioners from the throats of suspected cases of diphtheria by means of outfits provided by the Council, and these are sent to the Lister Institute for bacteriological examination. This is done with a view to prevention of removal of cases to the Metropolitan Asylums Board Infectious Diseases Hospitals of patients not suffering from infectious disease, and necessarily involves some delay in removal. In case of diphtheria, immediate treatment with anti-toxin is essential to reduce the risk of a fatal termination, and the Local Government Board Anti-Toxin Order authorises the provision of a temporary supply of diphtheria anti-toxin, and of medical assistance in connection therewith for the poorer inhabitants of the Borough. We are of opinion such provision should be made." The Committee recommended the Council:— " That diphtheria anti-toxin be supplied in accordance with the diphtheria anti-toxin (London) Order, 1910, and the letter of the Local Government Board of the 15th August, 1910." Medical Practitioners. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road (corner of Fairfield Road), E. October, 1910. Dear Sir, Provision of Diphtheria Anti-toxin. With the view of facilitating the prompt use of diphtheria antitoxin in the cases of persons who may be attacked by, or exposed to, the infection of the disease, the Local Government Board have made an Order under Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sanctioning the provision by the Borough Council of a temporary supply of diphtheria anti-toxin, and I am directed by the Council to forward you the enclosed particulars of the arrangements which have been made for its supply for the use of medical practitioners in the Borough. ♦ 144 In connection with this I would point out that the Local Government Board wish it to be understood that the free provision of diphtheria anti-toxin must not be regarded as a substitute for the removal to hospital of a patient suffering from diphtheria, nor as implying that the patient to whom anti-toxin has been administered may properly be retained for treatment at home unless means are available for his efficient isolation to the satisfaction of the medical officer of health, but they are anxious to emphasise the fact that the prompt administration of anti-toxin before the patient is removed to hospital may, especially if delay in removal is inevitable, go far towards preventing a fatal termination to an attack of diphtheria. Medical practitioners practising in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar can obtain at any time (Sundays and holidays included) by day or night, for its use within the Borough, a supply of diphtheria anti-toxin from the Medical Officer of Health, Public Health Offices, Bow Road (corner of Fairfield Road); and a suitable hypodermic syringe will be supplied on loan if required, which must be returned to me immediately after use ; provided you furnish me with the required number of units, the name, age and address of each patient, information as to whether the material is required for prophylatic purposes (if so similar particulars must be given), and a receipt for the diphtheria anti-toxin and syringe (if the latter is required). No diphtheria anti-toxin will be given out unless the desired information is furnished to me. I am, dear Sir, Your faithfully, (Signed) FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health. To Dr....

They hope at a later date to be able to use a certain number of beds for the treatment of children suffering from whooping cough." In a further communication, under date 6th January, 1911, the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board stated : —"I have to inform you that while my first letter of the 23rd ultimo asked for particulars of cases requiring removal from Poor Law Institutions, it was not thereby intended to imply that cases were to be limited to the inmates of these institutions. As this does not appear to be clearly understood, I think it well to state that the Board are prepared, as far as their accommodation permits, to take direct from their homes cases in which a relief order for the infirmary could properly be given, provided, of course, that the 151 prescribed admission order signed by the relieving officer, with the medical certificate attached, accompanies each case." The provisions of Sections 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73 and 74 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, have been enforced in the Borough since the 1st April, 1903, under the Order of the London County Council made 20th January, 1903. The Committee asked the Guardians to furnish the Medical Officer of Health with daily lists of cases of measles removed by the relieving officers or entered in the medical relief registers of the District Medical Officers so that the provisions of the above sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as to disinfection, exposure and isolation, etc., should be enforced. These provisions have been systematically carried out since April, 1903, in respect of cases of measles notified by the head teachers of the schools. The Public Health and Housing Committee on the 17th January, 1911, had under consideration the desirability of measles being made a notifiable disease under Section 55 of the Public Health Act, 1891. In 1903 an Order was made by the London County Council applying to measles certain sections of the Act of 1891 relating to infectious diseases, with regard to disinfection of bedding and premises, and exposure and isolation of infected persons, but the sections relating to notification and removal were not applied. The Metropolitan Asylums Board now utilising portions of their fever hospitals for treatment of Poor Law cases of measles, the Committee were of opinion it is desirable notification should be required in all cases of measles, in order that adequate precautions may be taken to prevent the spread of the disease, and recommended the Council that the London County Council be requested to make an Order in accordance with their powers under Section 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, applying to measles Section 55 of the Act relating to notification throughout the County of London. Milkshops. No cases of measles occurred in connection with milkshops. Disinfection and Outworkers. 144 rooms (116 houses) were disinfected by the Public Health Department (see page 88), and the remainder were disinfected by the tenants, medical practitioners giving certificates that disinfection had been satisfactorily carried out. Respecting outworkers and the articles disinfected by the Council see pages 80 and 88. 152 SPOTTED FEVER. EPIDEMIC CEREBRO-SPINAL MENINGITIS. The Local Government Board on 1st March, 1910, approved an Order of the London County Council requiring the notification of cases of cerebrospinal fever for a further period of twelve months from and including 13th March, 1910. Three cases occurred within the Borough, 1 Poplar, 1 Bromley, and 1 Bow. Two of the patients died,†shown as follow :— (1) A male, aged four months, of Strattondale Street, Poplar, was notified from the Seamen's Hospital as suffering from Posterior Basic Meningitis (Spotted Fever). The patient was admitted to the hospital on the 18th January, and died on the 27th February, 1910. (2) A case of Cerebro-spinal Meningitis (Spotted Fever) occurred in a female aged 7 months, resident in Bow. Patient was removed to Guy's Hospital on June 17th. This patient died on 2nd July. (3) A case of Epidemic Cerebro-spinal Meningitis (Spotted Fever) was notified on 8th July as occurring in a female aged five months, of Oban Street, Bromley. The patient had been admitted into the East London Hospital for Children, Shadwell, on 6th July. * Posterior basal meningitis is included iD the term " cerebro-spinal fever," but does not include meningitis due to tuberculosis, syphilis, middle ear disease, and injury. The Local Government Board on 1st March, 1911, approved an Order of the London County Council requiring the notification of cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever (Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis) for a further period of twelve calendar months from and including 13th March, 1911. † One death (the Bow case) was certified as meningitis, hydrocephalus, cardiac failure, so that only one death from Spotted Fever appears in the statistical tables. 153 DIARRŒA* AND ENTERITIS.† Deaths.

In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops * and even factories ; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. ' To wit, in Table A, under " Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 18 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were "Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 168 The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,296, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 171, and Tables C and D, pages 174 and 175. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 279 and ,280, and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 236, 238, 244, 254, 257, 268 and 274. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 80. Suggested Appointment of Resident (Bow) Certifying Surgeon. The General Purposes Committee considered a representation from the Public Health and Housing Committee urging that a certifying surgeon, resident in Bow, should be appointed for that district, under thd Factory Acts. The General Purposes Committee were informed the certifying surgeon for Bow is at Bethnal Green, and this involves a journey of two miles by young persons required to be examined. The General Purposes Committee concurred in the view of the Public Health Committee, and recommended the Council—That representations be made to the Home Office urging the appointment of a resident certifying surgeon for the Bow District. The following letter was submitted to the General Purposes Committee :— Whitehall, 22nd August, 1910. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, urging the appointment of a certifying surgeon under the Factory Acts, resident at Bow, I am directed by the Secretary of State to say that the certifying surgeon for Bow has an office at 154, Globe Road, E., to which occupiers of factories and workshops employing less than five young persons are entitled to send young persons for examination on Wednesday afternoons between 4.30 aod 5 p.m. The Secretary of State understands that good facilities exist for 169 reaching this office, and that it is within 1½ miles of practically all points of the occupied area. In the circumstances he does not consider that the appointment of a certifying surgeon resident in the Bow district is necessary. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. P. BYRNE. The Town Clerk, Poplar. Shops Bill. A Bill to amend the Law relating to Shops. Presented by Sir Charles Dilke, supported by Mr. Seddon, Mr. Bowerman, Mr. Arthur Henderson, Mr. Charles Price, Mr. Scott, Mr. Shackleton and Mr. Wedgwood. Ordered, by the House of Commons, to be printed, 24th February, 1910. Memorandum. This Bill is drawn on the same lines as the Bill introduced in the Sessions of 1904 and 1905. The first three clauses have been modified in consequence of the passing of the Shop Hours Act, 1904. It is proposed by this Bill to amend the Shop Hours Act by making it compulsory on local authorities to make closing orders for their araas, while empowering them to refer to the ratepayers the questions whether any order shall come into operation at all, and whether any alteration shall be made in the proposed order. The Bill determines the latest closing hours for each day which may be fixed by the local authority, leaving the local authority free to distribute the particular closing hours over the different days of the week. In order to ensure uniformity as far as is convenient, it is proposed to give control to authorities administering wide areas, viz., the county council in London, the borough or urban district council in a borough or urban district with a population of over five thousand, and elsewhere the jounty council. This Bill repeats the miscellaneous proposals of the Bill ol 1904 with regard to Sunday closing of shops, the prohibition of employment of children under fourteen, hoars of employment in shops, sanitary condition and ventilation, and sanitary conveniences. It is so designed as to give to persons employed in shops some of the protection which the existing law gives to persons employed in factories and workshons. 170 Shops (No. 2) Bill. A Bill to consolidate, amend, and extend the Shops Regulation Acts, 189'2 to 1904. Ordered to be brought in by Mr. Secretary Churchill, Mr. Masterman, Mr. Herbert Samuel, and Mr. Solicitor-General. Ordered, by the House of Commons, to be printed, 4th July, 1910. Factoey and Workshop Bill. A Bill to amend the Law regarding Factories and Workshops. Presented by Sir Charles M'Laren, supported by Mr. Atherley-JoneK, Mr. J. M. Robertson, Mr. Snowden, and Mr. Theodore Taylor. Ordered, by the House of Commons, to be printed, 14th March, 1910. Memorandum. The object of this Bill is to give greater elasticity to statutory regulations and Provisional Orders, which at present restrain women's work, and also to make these applicable to male persons under the age of 21. It provides also for the appointment of women inspectors for women workers, and restricts the power of the Secretary of State, or President of the Board of Trade, to prohibit the employment of women. 171 TABLE A.

Sir, The Council has received from the Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Association of Master Bakers a letter in which they ask that action may be taken to secure the regulation of places at which bread is sold. I enclose a copy of this letter for the information of the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council, as it has occurred to the Council that the object which the Association has in view may possibly be attained through the provisions of Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which relates to the sanitary regulation of premises used for the sale of food for human consumption. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, G. L. GOMME, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Bermondsey and Rotherhithe Association of Master Bakers. Meeting at the "Royal Oak " on Tuesdays at 8.30 p.m. 12th April, 1910. Dear Sir, At a meeting of the above Society this evening I was instructed to write to the London County Council and point out the unreasonableness of such strict regulations being made as to the 181 places where bread is made, and no regulations as to where it is sold. It is, in many cases, sold in the same shop as soap, candles, coke, coal and paraffin oil, and occasionally exposed in egg boxes on the pavement. The members of the above hope that at an early date the London County Council will take action in this matter. I remain, dear Sir, Yours respectfully, (Signed) J. S. HARTLEY. The Clerk, London County Council, Spring Gardens. Alleged Danger to the Public Health arising from the Sale of Bread in Chandlers' Shops, etc. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 6th July, 1910. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to forward to the Borough Council the enclosed copy of a question which was addressed to the President in the House of Commons by Earl Winterton on the 29th ultimo, with reference to allegations as to the danger to the public health arising from the sale of bread in chandlers' shops, and on insanitary and infected premises in London or from the practice of exchanging bread. A copy of the President's reply is also enclosed. I am to state that the Board would be glad to be furnished with any information which the Council may possess in regard to the allegations. They would also be glad to be informed to what extent the Council exercise supervision in regard to the matter. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. J. WILLIS, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk of Poplar. 182 Wednesday, '49th June, 1910. *21. Earl Winterton.—To ask the President of the Local Government Board, whether his attention has been drawn to the statements made by Drs. Michael, of Camberwell, Forbes-Ross, Ryan, and others, citing cases where infection has been carried through bread sold in chandlers' shops and on unsanitary and disease infected premises, or through exchanged bread; and, if so, what action he proposes to take to prevent the continuance of this practice in the future. Mr. Burns—My attention has been drawn to certain newspaper paragraphs in regard to this matter, and I propose to make some inquiry respecting the allegations. 22nd July, 1910. Sir, Re Alleged Danger to the Public Health arising from the Sale of Bread in Chandlers' Shops, etc. Your letter of the 6th instant, addressed to the Town Clerk, has been forwarded to me, and I beg to state that the Sanitary Inspectors have had instructions to enforce in respect of places in which bread is sold the provisions of Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which deals with premises used for the sale, etc., of food for human consumption. I consider that these regulations preclude the deposit of bread in a place where coals are kept, and so far as paraffin is concerned I think that should bread in any way become soiled with it the bread would become unsaleable. So far as infected premises are concerned the usual practice is to endeavour to have the patient removed and the premises disinfected immediately. Removal of the patient is generally adopted, but should an infectious case be treated at home in connection with premises on which food is sold or prepared the medical attendant would be communicated with and removal sought and failing its adoption there would be advised isolation and strictest precautions against the spread of the disease and infection. Of late years there has been very little difficulty in Poplar (with its teeming poor) in obtaining the removal of patients suffering from infectious disease. The inhabitants recognise the 183 convenience of the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the following figures without doubt show this:— Disease. No. of Cases. No. of Removals. Scarlet Fever 727 668 Enteric Fever 54 50 Diphtheria and Membranous Croup 210 170 I have no knowledge of any spread of disease arising from the sale of bread in chandlers' shops and on insanitary and infected premises, or from the practice of exchanging bread. I certainly think that if parents had thought the disease had been in any way caused from the sale of bread I should have heard of cases, as my experience tells me that parents are only too prone to saddle the cause of disease upon anything. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) FRED. WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health. F. J. Willis, Esq., Assistant Secretary, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W.

(See Table A, page 171). * See Tables A and C, pagei 171 and 174. 187 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. 1376 visits were paid to these premises during the year and the Sanitary Regulations under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 8, were enforced. Want of cleanliness was found in 156 instances, and 85 other defects oxisted. 103 intimations were served, which in 13 cases were followed up by Statutory notices and one final notice, but no legal proceedings were taken. A register of these premises is kept. See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 236, 239, 245, 253, 256, 267, 268 and 276. HAIR-DRESSERS' PREMISES.

London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908.—Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Req'Ster Names of Dairymen in certain circumstances; London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1910. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1910. Milk and Dairies Bill. 1910. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 318 registered premises (including 14 cow-houses, 2 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 7 Bow) where milk is sold, 106 Poplar, 141 Bromley and 71 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspectors' reports pages, 235, 238, 244, 253, 258, 269 and 276. 188 Cleansing of premises was necessary in five instances. 7 other defects were remedied. 14 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 4 Poplar, 8 Bromley and 2 Bow. 62 Premises were on account of change of occupiers re-registered as milkshops, 16 Poplar, 29 Bromley and 17 Bow. The sale of milk was discontinued on 18 premises—8 Poplar, 6 Bromley and 4 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 80. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. Part II. Sanitary Provisions. Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on register names of dairymen in certain circumstances. No circumstances arose during the year calling for the enforcement of the power given to the Sanitary Authority under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section (5). See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 235, 238, 244, 253, 258, 269 and 276. London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1910. Part VI. Milk Supply. Unwholesome Milk. Tuberculous Milk. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1910. The clauses in the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1910, relating to milk supply, Part VI., were deleted by the Select Committee of the House of Commons. Similar provisions had been contained in the London County Council (General Powers) Bills, 1908 and 1909 which had been approved by the Council, but had not been proceeded with. 189 Milk and Dairies Bill. A Bill to make better provision with respect to the sale of milk and the regulation of dairies. Ordered to be brought in by Mr. Courthope, Mr. Long, Mr. Hayes Fisher, Sir Luke White, Colonel Lockwood, Mr. Courtenay Warner, Mr. Ryland Adkins, Mr. Charles Bathurst, Mr. Dawes, Mr. Guinness, Captain Jessel and Mr. Stanier. Ordered, by the House of Commons, to be printed, 13th April, 1910. Memorandum. The main objects of this Bill are to provide for— 1. The more effective registration of dairies and dairymen. 2. The inspection of dairies and the examination of cows therein. 3. The prohibition of the supply of milk from a dairy where such a supply has caused or would be likely to cause infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. 4. The prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk. 5. The regulation of the importation of milk so as to prevent danger to public health arising therefrom. 6. The issue of regulations for securing the supply of pure and wholesome milk. The provisions as to registration supersede the provisions as to the registration of dairies contained in the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts and the orders made thereunder. The provisions a3 to the inspection of dairies and the prohibition of the supply of milk reproduce with amendment Section 4 of the Infectious Diseases (Prevention) Act, 1890, Section 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the milk clauses incorporated in many local Acts. The clause as to the prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk is taken from the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries have prepared an order under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, dealing with the notification of 190 tuberculosis in cattle and the inspection, examination, detention, isolation and slaughter of tuberculous cattle, and the giving of compensation in appropriate cases. ICE CREAM. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, Section 43; London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1911. About the middle of the year 1910 all the known premises within the Borough where ice-creams are manufactured were inspected. There are 151 such premises within the Borough, 67 Poplar, 52 Bromley and 32 Bow. (See Table A, page 171.) Cleansing of premises was necessary in 35 instances. 26 other nuisances were remedied. See Inspectors' reports, pages 235, 239, 245, 254, 261, 268 and 276. London County Council (General Powers) Act 1902, Section 43. Section 43 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, requires that every ice-cream barrow shall bear the name and address of the maker of the cream. In a prosecution by the Greenwich Borough Council of a vendor for neglecting to exhibit his name and address, the summons was dismissed on the ground that the defendant, having removed the wheels from his barrow and sold the ice-cream from a tub (part of the body of the barrow), was not selling from a barrow. The Greenwich Borough Council asked the London County Council to secure an amendment of the law in order that the provisions of this section may be applied to stalls; and the London County Council Public Health Committee desired to know whether the Poplar Borough Counci was in favour of such amendment. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to inform the London County Council the Council is in favour of the amendment proposed. 191 London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1911. Part V. of the Bill—Ice-cream—Clauses 24-26, are to repeal Part VIII. of the 1902 Act and Section 48 of the 1904 Act. The Bill is to make fresh provisions for the regulation of the manufacture and sale of icecream, procedure for the recovery of penalties and for the application of certain provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Manufacturers or vendors may not make or store ice-cream in sleeping room or any place likely to render it injurious to health. They must take proper precautions to prevent contamination, and notify infectious disease among persons employed. Names and addresses of manufacturer and vendor to appear on any barrow or stand. SMOKE NUISANCES. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1910, Part IV.—Smoke Nuisance. 62 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year:—26 Bow East, 0 Bow West, 10 North Bromley, 4 Bromley Central, 4 East combined, 10 West combined, and 8 Poplar South. 35 intimations and 15 statutory notices were served. No summonses were applied for. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1910, Part IV. The Act provides, inter alia, that the London County Council may enforce the provisions of Sections 23 and 24 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with reference to smoke nuisance, in any special case in which a sanitary authority request them to do so, and they may also enforce these provisions in their application to any building or premises belonging to or used by a sanitary authority. The Act also empowers the London County Council to expend money in connection with experiments for abatement of smoke nuisance. 192 MOTOR VEHICLES. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards; Heavy Motor Vehicles—Noise. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards. In connection with the resolution of the Council urging the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis to require the adoption of a more effective mud guard on motor 'buses, enquiries were received by the General Purposes Committee from the Commissioner and from Borough Councils as to the form of mud guard suggested. Inventors of mud guards claiming to obviate the nuisance complained of, who had communicated with the Council, had been referred to the Commissioner of Police. The General Purposes Committee were of opinion that if the Commissioner would insist upon the provision on motor buses of a mud guard to prevent side splashing on to footways and pedestrians, no practical difficulty would be found in meeting the requirements. The General Purposes Committee recommended the Council that the Commissioner of Police be again urged to compel the provision of effective mud guards on motor buses. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis intimated that no efficient mud guard for motor 'buses had yet been brought to his notice, but that experiments would probably be made in the near future. The General Purposes Committee again considered, on reference back by the Council, the letter from the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis on the subject of the provision of splash guards on motor omnibuses, as follows, viz.:— New Scotland Yard, S.W. 11th August, 1910. Sir, With reference to previous correspondence, I am directed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you, for the information of the Council, that, as a result of the tests recently made of the only splash guard yet submitted to him, he does not feel justified in requiring proprietors of motor omnibuses to incur the heavy expense (probably from £8 to £10 per annum) entailed in fitting guards to their vehicles. 193 I am, however, to add that should any proprietor desire to fit such guards to his vehicles no objection will Be raised by this Department. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, W. H. KENDALL, Acting Chief Clerk. The Town Clerk of Poplar. The General Purposes Committee had before them communications from persons who had submitted splash guards to the Commissioner for testing, or proposed to do so; also letters from towns in which splash guards for motor 'buses are in successful operation. The General Purposes Committee directed that a communication be addressed to the Commissioner, forwarding copy of the correspondence, expressing disappointment at the nature of his communication, and submitting that at least two effective splash guards had been offered which could be adopted at much less cost than stated; also strongly urging that the splashing from motor omnibuses in wet weather had become intolerable, and that the public should not be expected to submit any longer to the nuisance. New Scotland Yard, S.W. 18th August, 1910. Sir, Re Mudguards on Motor Omnibuses. With reference to previous correspondence, I am directed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you, for the information of the Council, that, as a result of the tests recently made of the only splash guard yet submitted to him, he does not feel justified in requiring proprietors of motor omnibuses to incur the heavy expense (probably from £8 to £10 per annum) entailed in fitting guards to their vehicles. I am, however, to add that should any proprietor desire to fit such guards to his vehicles no objection would be raised by this Department. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, W. H. KENDALL, Acting Chief Clerk. 0 194 The General Purposes Committee on 19th January, 1911, reported to the Council that they had considered expert reports on the results of the affixing of splash guards to the near-side wheels of the omnibuses of the Metropolitan Steam Omnibus Company's vehicles plying between Hammersmith and Piccadilly. The Committee were satisfied the provision of these guards had greatly minimised side splashing by the omnibuses. The General Purposes Committee directed a communication be sent to the Chief Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis urging the enforcement of the use of these or equally effective splash guards on all motor omnibuses plying within the Metropolitan Police District. Heavy Motor Vehicles—Noise. The General Purposes Committee reported to the Council that the Stoke Newington Borough Council had urged the London County Council to frame bye-laws for the whole of London providing that the wheels of heavy motor vehicles should be shod with rubber or other noiseless material. The Committee recommended the Council that the action of Stoke Newington Borough Council in the matter be supported.

Three samples (3-9 per cent.) were found to be adulterated, and legal proceedings were instituted in two instances against the itinerant vendor, and a letter of caution was sent in the third case. Twenty-four samples were taken on delivery at institutions within the Borough—viz., 6 Poplar Union, 0 Guardians OutRelief, Upper North Street, 8 Sick Asylum, 5 Blackwall Sick Asylum, and 5 Stepney Union Workhouse. All the samples were genuine. Results of Analyses. Of these 370 samples, legal proceedings were instituted in 8 cases.

The Public Analyst in his report states:— "This result is much the lowest percentage of adulteration recorded since I have held the office of Public Analyst, the nearest being 6.2 last year." The following table shows the percentage of all adulterated samples found in the several years named:— 1890 12.6 1891 14.4 1892 18.9 1893 20.5 1894 206 1895 22.1 1896 12.4 1897 14.2 1898 14.6 1899 9.2 1900 7.6 1901 91 1902 15.4 1903 8.2 1904 7.2 1905 8.8 1906 7.0 1907 7.3 1908 8.6 1909 6.2 1910 3.2 Lkgal Proceedings.

Of the 108 samples of Butter 52 contained percentages of boric acid as follow:— 0.25%; 0.4%; 0.4%; 0 4%; 0 4%; 0.3%; 0.3%; 01%; 0.25%; 0.3%; 0.4%; 0.2%; 0.25%; 0.1%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.4%; 0.5%; 0.25%; 0.25%; 015%; 0.4%; 01%; 0.25%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.3%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.4%.; 0.2°/0; 0.25%; 0.5%; 0.1%; 0 25%; 0 5%; 0 25%; 0.3%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.25%; 0.1%; 0.5%; 0.5%; 0.4%; 0 25%; 0 25%; 0.4%; 0.3% ; 0.1% ; 0 25%. Margarine Act, 1887, Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, and the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907. Under the Margarine Act, 1887, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, and the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907, a certificate of registration was granted during the year in respect of certain premises in Poplar which were proposed to be used as a butter factory. This registration was, however, cancelled upon the requisition of the owner, there being no proper accommodation at the premises for members of each sex, and both 199 males and females would have had to have been employed. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries was duly informed of the action taken. Upon the recommendation of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries the registration of certain premises in Bromley as a margarine factory was cancelled, the said premises not being used for that business. The following is the number of premises in each Sub-District of the Borough registered under the above-mentioned Acts, up to and including 31st December, 1910, viz.: — Margarine. Butter. Sub-District. Wholesale Dealer. Manufacturer. Factory. Wholesale Dealer in Milk-blended. Poplar .. 1 •• .. Bromley 3 1 1 1 Bow 6 .. 1 2 Totals 9 2 2 3 The above table includes premises registered for two purposes, as follows:— In Bromley the premises of one vendor are registered both for the purposes of manufacturing and for the wholesale dealing in margarine, and the premises of another vendor are registered for the purposes of a wholesale dealer in margarine and milk-blended butter. In Bow two premises are each registered as being used for the purposes of a wholesale dealer in margarine and milk-blended butter. Sale of Margarine Bill. A Bill to provide for the further prevention of the fraudulent sale of margarine. Presented by Mr. Kilbride, supported by Captain Donelan, Mr. Courthope, Mr. Charles Duncan, Sir Mark Stewart, and Mr. Hazleton. Ordered, by the House of Commons, to be printed, 6th July, 1910. 200 Memorandum. The object of this Bill is to prevent margarine from being coloured so as to resemble butter and prevent its fraudulent sale as such. The report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Food Products Adulteration, 1896, at page 29 says:— "However, your committee cannot but feel that the adulteration of butter with margarine and the fraudulent sale of margarine for butter are greatly facilitated in many instances by the artificial use of ingredients to colour margarine. While your committee are reluctant to interfere with the manufacture of any edible commodity they cannot in the interests of honest trading arrive at any conclusion other than to recommend the absolute prohibition of the artificial colouring of margarine to resemble or imitate butter." The last report of the Local Government Board, Part 2, page 102, states that:— "The fact that one sample of butter in every sixteen was condemned shows that the practice of selling margarine when butter is demanded has not been put down." The present definition of margarine, as contained in the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907, is "any article of food whether mixed with butter or not which resembles butter and is not milk-blended butter." The purpose of the present Bill is to prevent margarine from resembling butter, and would destroy the existing definition. The definition in this Bill is so framed as to cover the substance now known as margarine, but it is necessary to exclude lard from the definition, and therefore the fat of beef and mutton is specifically mentioned. Percentage of Water in Milk-Blended Butter. Suggested Amendment of the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907. The Battersea Borough Council requested the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to take steps with a view to the amendment of the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907, to secure reduction in the percentage of water allowable in milk-blended butter from 24 per cent. to 16 per cent., which is the maximum permissible in other kinds of butter. The Public Health 201 and Housing Committee recommended the Council to support the action of the Battersea Borough Council in the matter. Suggested Removal of Vendors from Register after repeated Convictions in respect of Adulteration. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Metropolitan Borough of St. Marylelone. Town Hall, Marylebone Lane, W. 3rd August, 1910. Dear Sir, I beg to inform you that the Council of this Borough in carrying out the Sale of Pood and Drugs' Acts have taken proceedings at the Police Court on several occasions against the same vendors, more particularly in the sale of milk, who have been convicted and fined each time. The Council are of opinion that, in the interests of the community, steps should be taken to prevent the repetition of such offences, and at their last meeting they passed the following resolution "That a letter be addressed to the Local Government Board, stating that the Council are of opinion that after three convictions in respect of offences against the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts within the period of two years in the Administrative County of London, the Magistrate should be empowered to order the name of the offender to be struck off the Register of Purveyors of Milk, etc., and that a letter be also sent to the other Metropolitan Borough Councils asking them to concur with this Council in the matter." I am, Yours faithfully, J. WILSON, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, Poplar. The Committee were of opinion it is desirable that vendors of milk repeatedly convicted of adulteration should be removed from the register, and recommended the Council that the action of the St. Marylebone Borough Council in this matter be supported. 202 Suggested Alteration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 and 1899, respecting Warranties. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from the Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington calling attention to recent prosecutions of vendors of adulterated milk dismissed on production of warranties of wholesale vendors, who in turn held warranties from the farmers supplying the milk. In these cases it is practically impossible to obtain convictions against the persons giving the warranties. Similar cases had repeatedly occurred in this Borough and representations had been made to the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture and Fisheries urging the repeal of Section 25 of " The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875," and Section 20 of "The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899," leaving the retailer to his remedy at Common Law against the giver of a false warranty. The Kensington Borough Council had again made representations to the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture and Fisheries urging that steps might be taken by those Boards with a view to securing an amendment of the law which shall have the effect of making the retailer liable for the penalties imposed by the Act in all cases of adulteration, leaving such retailer to his remedy at Common Law against the person from whom he obtained his supply. Other Borough Councils were asked to support this action. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the action of the Kensington Borough Council in the matter be supported. INSPECTION OF FOOD AND EXAMINATION OF UNSOUND FOOD AT WHARVES, Etc. Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc.; Conference to consider the meat supply of the kingdom and the present Restrictions on the Importation of Live Cattle for Slaughter; Immature Meat Prohibition Bill. Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc. With respect to the examination of food stuffs see Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 236, 238, 246, 253, 257, 267 and 276. 203 Also, with respect to the examination of food stuffs at wharves, see Inspectors' reports, pages 246, 257, 270 and 276. Conference to consider the Meat Supply of the Kingdom and the present Restrictions on the Importation of Live Cattle for Slaughter. At a further Conference of Representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils (the first Conference having been held on 12th October, 1909), convened by the Greenwich Borough Council to consider the Meat Supply of the Kingdom and the present Restrictions on the Importation of Live Cattle for Slaughter, held (by the courtesy of the Westminster City Council) at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, on Monday, the 28th February, 1910, at 3 o'clock p.m., the following resolutions were passed:— (a) "That the Mayor of Westminster be asked to approach the Prime Minister and urge him to reconsider his refusal to receive a Deputation as asked at the previous Conference" ; (b) "That a copy of this Resolution be sent to the London Borough Councils asking whether they will support and are prepared to join in this Deputation"; and (c) "That copies of the above Resolution be sent to all Members of Parliament representing Metropolitan Constituencies, to the Corporation of the City of London, the London County Council, and to the Corporations, Cities and Boroughs which have replied to the circular letter sent by this Conference, and asked to use their influence with the Prime Minister to receive a Deputation.'' In October, 1909, the Council approved resolutions adopted at a Conference of Borough Councils, expressing the opinion that the meat supply of London is in an extremely unsatisfactory position, that owing to the failure of the home supply to increase in proportion to the national demand, the decrease in live cattle imported, and the consequent increased necessity of depending upon supplies of chilled and frozen meat, it had become easy for the trade to be controlled by powerful trusts. It was further agreed the time had arrived for the relaxation of the restrictions upon importation of foreign cattle for immediate slaughter, in order that other sources of supply may be available. The Prime Minister was approached with a view to receiving a 204 deputation on the subject, but was unable at that time to receive a deputation. The resolutions of the Conference having received considerable support from many Cities and Boroughs throughout the United Kingdom, a further meeting of the Conference was held, at which it was decided to approach the Prime Minister to urge a reconsideration of his refusal to receive a deputation. The Council was asked to re-affirm its support of the resolutions of the Conference and to bring pressure to bear to secure reception of the deputation by the Prime Minister. A resolution on this subject was also forwarded by the National Federation of Meat Traders' Association, urging upon His Majesty's Government that in view of the continued shortage of fresh killed meat, and the effectual safeguard provided by the precautionary measures available at the Foreign Animals Wharves of the United Kingdom, further facilities should be afforded for importation of live cattle to the United Kingdom. It was also pointed out that the Foreign Animals Wharves possess every facility for effectually safeguarding the herds of this country against disease from imported cattle, which is the ostensible reason for the present restrictions. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to re-affirm its request to His Majesty's Government to relax the restrictions on importation of live cattle for immediate slaughter ; that the Prime Minister be further urged to receive the proposed deputation, and that the Council take part in such deputation, if arranged. Immature Meat Prohibition Bill. A Bill to prohibit Sale of Immature Meat.

Work of the Inspector. At the end of the year there were 1095 houses on the register. For Inspector's report see pages 281 to 284. No legal proceedings were instituted. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Section 78— Water Supply in Tenement Houses. During the year no notices were served under this Act, See page 207 respecting the authorisation of the Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings to take certain proceedings in connection with the houses inspected by him. 206 HOUSING Authorisation of the Public Health and Housing Committee to exercise duties of the Council and the Officers of the Public Health Department to enter Premises ; Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910; Representations under Section 17; Exemption of Lodging-houses for the Working Classes from Inhabited House Duty ; Proposed Regulations as to underground rooms habitually used as sleeping places ; moveable Dwellings Bill (H.L.). Authorisation of the Public Health and Housing Committee to Exercise Duties of the Council and the Officers of the Public Health Department to enter Premises. The Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, provides that in any Contract, made after the passing of the Act, for letting for habitation at a rent not exceeding £40 in London (except under repairing lease of not less than three years) there shall be implied a condition that the house is at the commencement of the holding, and shall be maintained during the holding, in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. Provision is made for inspection by any person authorised by the Council in writing to enter any premises to which this section of the Act applies, for the purpose of viewing the condition thereof; and if the implied undertaking is not complied with in the case of any house, the Borough Council may, if a closing order is not made, give notice requiring the landlord to execute such works as may be specified, to render the house in all respects fit for habitation. If the work is not done within time specified, the Council may do the work and recover the expenses from the landlord summarily or by annual instalments. Provision is also made by the Act for the making of a closing order by the Council in respect of any dwelling house in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and a demolition order may be made in respect of any house where a closing order has remained operative for three months. The Act enables the Council itself 207 to make closing orders, subject to appeal to the Local Government Board, instead of taking proceedings before a Police Magistrate to secure such orders. It is necessary the Sanitary Officers should be authorised to enter premises for the purpose of inspection under the Act, and it will also be convenient for the Committee to be authorised to exercise any of the duties of the Council under the Act, which the Council may have power to depute to them. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council:— (a) That the Medical Officer of Health and the several Sanitary Inspectors be authorised to enter any house, premises or building to which Section 15 of the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act applies, for the purpose of inspecting the state and condition thereof; and that the Seal of the Council be affixed to the necessary warrants. (b) That the Public Health and Housing Committee be authorised to issue notices and take proceedings in respect of all the duties of the Council under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, which the Council has power to delegate. The Public Health and Housing Committee vvere advised it would be convenient that the Inspector of Houses Let in Lodgings should be authorised to take certain proceedings in connection with the houses inspected by him, which he referred to other Inspectors in the absence of such authorisation; the Committee recommended the Council that the Inspector for Houses Let in Lodgings be empowered to take proceedings under the Housing, Town Planning, &c., Act, 1909, in respect of underground rooms, and that, as regards houses let in lodgings, the said Inspector shall also be empowered to enforce the By-laws made by the London County Council under Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in respect of the cleansing of water-closets, earthclosets, privies and receptacles for dung, and also the By-laws made by the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar under Section 39 and Section 50 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with regard to water supplies to water-closets and the cleansing of cisterns, respectively. Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910. A letter, dated 3rd September, 1910, was received from the Secretary of the Local Government Board, as follows:— 208 "I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to Section 17 (l) of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, under which it is the duty of every Local Authority within the meaning of Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, to cause to be made from time to time inspection of their district, with a view to ascertain whether any dwelling-house therein is in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, and for that purpose to comply with such regulations and to keep such records as may be prescribed by the Board. "The Board have accordingly issued an Order making regulations with respect to the manner in which inspection of the district under this Section shall be carried out, and with respect to the records to be kept of such inspection. Copies of this Order are enclosed. "Under Article I. the Local Authority are to determine their procedure, which is to provide for the thorough inspection of. dwelling-houses or localities in the district, and they must also cause to be prepared from time to time a list of dwelling-houses of which early inspection is desirable. "Article II. enumerates the matters in relation to which inspection should be made, and Article III. prescribes the records to be kept of each inspection. "Under Article IV. the Local Authority are to take these records into consideration at each meeting, and to give such directions and to take such action as may be desirable in each case, and a note of such directions is to be added to the records. "By Article V. the Medical Officer of Health is required to include in his Anuual Report certain information and particulars as to the inspection made and the results. "By Article VI. it is made the duty of the officers of the Local Authority to observe and execute all lawful orders and directions of the Local Authority in regard to the inspection of the district under Section 17 of the Act and under the Regulations. "The Board are aware that many Local Authorities have already instituted a system of inspection under which inquiries are made by the Inspector of Nuisances or Sanitary Inspector in 209 respect of the matters referred to in Article II., the results being recorded in a form which contains information on other points besides those mentioned in the Article. The Board do not suggest that this form should be abandoned or altered, provided that it includes all the matters covered by Article II. The provisions of the Order are necessarily limited to matters to be recorded as the result of inspections under and for purposes of Section 17 of the Act. "By Article 19 (3) of the Orders of 23rd March and 8th December, 1891, relating to urban and rural districts and to London respectively, it is the duty of the Inspector of Nuisances or Sanitary Inspector, by inspection of the district both systematically at certain periods, and at intervals as occasion may require, to keep himself informed in respect of nuisances existing therein which require abatement. The Local Authority will no doubt usually designate the Inspector of Nuisances or Sanitary Inspector as he officer who is to act under Article I. (3) of the regulations. "It will be open to the Local Authority, if they think fit, to delegate the duty of considering the records to a Committee, subject to such directions as they consider necessary." The Public Health and Housing Committee had before them the Housing (Inspection of District) Regulations, 1910, made by the Local Government Board under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. The Committee directed that inspections be made in accordance with such Regulations, and approved a list of houses of which early inspection is desirable. The records required to be kept and to be taken into consideration by the local authority at each meeting, are submitted to, and considered by the Committee in accordance with the resolution of the Council delegating to the Committee all the powers under the Housing and Town Planning Act which may be delegated. A list of roads, streets, etc., in which are situated dwelling-houses, the early inspection of which is, in the opinion of the Public Health and Housing Committee, desirable under the Regulations of the Local Government Board made under Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909.

On the 7th July the Seal of the Council was affixed to Closing Orders under Section 17 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, in respect of dwelling houses, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 Oliffe Street, Cubitt Town. These premises, at the time of writing this report, have been demolished by the freeholders. 211 On the 9th November the Seal of the Council was affixed to a Closing Order under Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, in respect of No. 26a, Cuba Street, Millwall. On the 17th November the Seal of the Council was affixed to a Closing Order under Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, in respect of No. 2, Walter Court, Bow. At the time of writing this report No. 26a, Cuba Street, Millwall, and No. 2, Walter Court, Bow, are being made fit for human habitation. The Public Health and Housing Committee had under consideration the question of the necessity for Closing Orders being made under the Housing and Town Planning Act in respect of Nos. 2 to 8, Charles Terrace and 15 to 23, Stewart's Terrace, the Committee interviewed representatives of the leaseholder, under-leaseholder and mortgagee, on the subject of the condition of the houses. Arrangements were completed for assignment of the underlease to a responsible person who gave an undertaking that the premises should be forthwith put into substantial repair. Under these circumstances the Committee deferred consideration of the question of recommending closing orders to be made, in the expectation that such orders would be unnecessary. These premises, at the time of writing this report, are being made fit for human habitation. The owner of Nos. 19 and 21, Galbraith Street was communicated with, informing him that unless these premises were made fit for human habitation, " representations " would be made for closing orders. Exemption of Lodging-houses for the Working Classes from Inhabited House Duty. Applications were received and certificates were granted under Section 35 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, that the following premises were solely constructed and used to afford suitable accommodation for the lodgers, and that due provision had been made for their sanitary requirements, viz.:— Date of Certificate. Premises. 28th February Bow Chambers, 193-197, Bow Road, E. 1st March St. James' Chambers, High Street, Poplar. 212 Application was also received for a certificate to be granted for the premises, Nos. 215-217, Bow Eoad. The premises were inspected and certain sanitary defects found. Under these circumstances a certificate was not granted. An intimation notice was served upon the owner and the London County Council was also communicated with on the matter. After the repairs had been executed at Nos. 215-217, Bow Road, a common lodging-house, a further application was made under Section 35 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, for exemption from inhabited house duty. The premises were inspected and no nuisance found to exist thereon. A certificate was granted on the 3rd May that the common lodging-house mentioned above was solely constructed and used to afford suitable accommodation for the lodgers, and that due provision was made for their sanitary requirements. Proposed Regulations as to Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. On the 8th December, 1910, the Council approved draft Regulations under the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, with reference to Underground Sleeping Rooms, for submission to the Local Government Board for approval. The Local Government Board suggested certain amendments in the Regulations to bring them into conformity with approved models. The amendments were chiefly in the form of expression and make the Regulations more definite. The Public Health and Housing Committee approved, on the 14th February, 1911, the Regulations, as amended, viz.:— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR. Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. Propos'd Regulations us to Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. Whereas by Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, it is enacted as follows:— Sub-section 7. A room habitually used as a sleeping-place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the 213 surface of the part of the street adjoining, or nearest to the room, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be a dwellinghouse so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either a) Is not on an average at least seven feet in height rom floor to ceiling ; or (b) Does not comply with such Regulations as the Local Authority, with the consent of the Local Government Board may prescribe for securing the proper ventilation and lighting of such rooms, and the protection thereof against dampness, effluvia or exhalation. Provided that if the Local Authority, after being required to do so by the Local Government Board, fail to make such Eegulations or such Regulations as the Board approve, the Board may themselves make them, and the Regulations so made shall have effect as if they had been made by the Local Authority with the consent of the Board. Provided that a closing order made in respect of a room to which this sub-section applies shall not prevent the room being used for purposes other than those of a sleeping place; and that, if the occupier of the room after notice of an order has been served upon him fails to comply with the order, an order to comply therewith may, on summary conviction, be made against him. Now, therefore, We, the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, being the Local Authority for the said Metropolitan Borough, hereby prescribe the following Regulations with which a room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room shall comply, namely:— (a) Such room shall in every part thereof have at least , three feet of its height above the level of the surface of the street or ground adjoining or nearest to such room ; Provided that, if the width of the area hereinafter mentioned is not less than the height of the room from the floor to the said surface of the street or ground is not less than six feet, the height of the room above such surface may be less than three feet, but not in any case less than one foot; (b) Every wall of such room shall be constructed with a 214 proper damp-proof course, and, if in contact with the soil, shall be effectually protected against dampness from that soil, by means of a vertical damp-proof course or otherwise ; (c) There shall be outside of and adjoining such room and extending along the entire frontage thereof and open upwards from six inches below the level of the floor thereof an area properly paved and effectually drained and at least three feet wide in every part, and of a mean width not less than four feet; provided that in the area there may be placed steps necessary for access to the room, and over and across such area there may be steps necessary for access to any buildings above the room if the steps are so placed in such case as not to be over or across any external window of the room ; (d) The sub-soil of the site of such room shall be effectually drained by means of a sub-soil drain properly trapped and ventilated wherever the dampness of the site renders such a precaution necessary; (e) The space, if any, beneath the floor of such room shall be provided with adequate means of ventilation; (f) Every drain passing under any such room other than a drain for the drainage of the sub-soil of the site of such room 3hall be properly constructed of a gas-tight pipe; (g) Such room shall be effectually protected against the rising of any effluvia or exhalation, by means of a layer of asphalte or of good concrete at least six inches thick, or four inches thick if properly grouted, laid upon the soil of the site of the entire room or in some equally effectual manner; (h) Every such room which is without a fire-place and a flue properly constructed and properly connected with such fire-place, shall be provided with special and adequate means of ventilation by a sufficient aperture or air-shaft which shall provide an unobstructed sectional area of one hundred square inches at the least. (I) Such room shall be sufficiently lighted by one or more windows opening directly into the external air; Provided that such window or windows shall have a total area 215 clear of the sash frame equal to at least one-tenth of the floor area of the room; Every such window shall he so constructed that one-half at least can be opened and tbat the opening may in every case extend to the top of the window. The Public Health and Housing Committee on the 2nd March, 1911, recommended the Council that the foregoing Regulations be approved and adopted, and the Seal of the Council affixed thereto ; and that application be made to the Local Government Board for their consent to such Eegulations, after one calendar month's notice in a local newspaper of the intention to make such application.

The Metropolitan Water Board was taking steps to enforce the substitution of two-gallon for three-gallon water waste preventers where in use and abolition of valve closets. The Wandsworth Borough Council resolved" That the Water Board be informed that this Council is of opinion that in the interests of public health the substitution of two-gallon for three-gallon waste preventers and the removal of valve closets should not be insisted upon, and is further of opinion that the alteration would not conduce to the economic use of water," and asks for the support of this Council to its action. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to concur in the resolution of the Wandsworth Borough Council and the Metropolitan Water Board be so informed. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Metropoltian Sewers and Drains Bill.

The object of this Bill is to amend the state of the law relating to combined drainage. There are two kinds of combined drains, the "combined drain," which in law is a "drain," and the "combined drain," which in law is a "sewer," The former is repairable by the private owner; the latter by the public authority. In the opinion of builders, owners and local authorities combined drains were originally constructed as drains, and were mutually regarded as such until the retro- 217 was not brought forward in the last Parliament owing to the affairs in the House. spective case of Travis v. Uttley (1398), tbe effect of which has been to convert thousands of drains, which had been privately owned and privately maintained, into sewers vested in the local authorities and maintainable at the expense of the ratepayers, The state of the law has been described by the Lord Chief Justice, who said in a recent decision, "It seems to me, as I have before pointed out, to be essential that there should be some amendment of the law upon this subject. The state of the authorities is such that it appears to be impossible either to reconcile the various decisions or to deduce from thom any logical rule." Several provincial authorities, notably West Ham, Croydon, Carlisle, Leyton, Wood Green, Sheffield, etc., have been successful in obtaining the powers which the Metropolitan local authorities ask for by this Bill. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains. [8 Edw. VII.] A Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Sewers and Drains. Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, ;md Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows :— 1. In and for the purposes of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act or Acts amending the same, the word "drain" shall be deemed to include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, with which two or more houses, buildings or premises are, at the date of the passing of this Act, or may at any time thereafter be connected, or which is used or capable of being or intended to be used for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses, buildings or premises directly or indirectly to any sewer which has been approved as such by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the London County Council, but shall not include any sewer so approved as aforesaid. 2. This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1908, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same. On the back of the Bill appear the following names:—Mr. Dickinson, Sir William Bull, Mr. Bowles, Sir William Collins, Mr. Crooks, Mr. Timothy Davies, Sir George Fardell, Mr. Claude Hay, Sir Henry Kimber, Earl Percy. Sir Albert Spicer and Mr. Waterlow. The Boroughs represented are St. Pancras, Hammersmith, Lambeth, Woolwich, Fulham, Paddington, Shoreditch, Wandsworth, Kensington, Hackney and Islington. 218 This Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on the 5th March, 1908, by Mr. Dickinson and was read a first time. It is a Private Member's Bill and appears to be very questionable whether it will become law without the co-operation of the Government for the time being. From March, 1908, to July, 1909, the Bill was tabled over 100 occasions without being read a second time.* CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1.* Cap. 8, Sect. 26 (2.) REVENUE ACT, 1903.* 3 Edw. 7, Cap. 46. Rothbury Mansions, Bow—Regranting Certificate. In 1908 Rothbury Buildings, Bow, were found to be in a most insanitary condition; there was also no proper and sufficient supply of water‡ ith no adequate washing accommodation. The Public Health and Housing Committee directed that the Board of Inland Revenue be informed of the facts and that exemption under the Acts should no longer exist. The Board of Inland Revenue thereupon treated the certificate as cancelled. Certificates, for exemption under the Customs and Inland Revenue Acts, 1890-1, and the Revenue Act, 1903, were regranted in respect of Tenements, Nos. 1 to 6 (Block A), and Tenements 7 to 12 (Block B), Rothbury Mansions, Rothbury Road, Bow. A large amount of work had been executed by the owner in order to comply with the aforementioned Acts. * For exemption of lodging-houses for the working classes from Inhabited House Duty under the Housing Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, see page 211. † Now called Rothbury Mansions. ‡ London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907.

Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the "Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. Ten certificates had to be given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 216 rooms have been cleansed of vermin: — Poplar South Division 7 West Combined Division 25 Bast Combined Division 27 Bromley Central Division 20 Bromley North Division 40 Bow West Division 5 Bow East Division 19 Houses let in lodgings 73 No summonses were applied for. \ * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons see page 102 and 103. 220 Licensed Premises' Urinals. Two notices were served under Section 22 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, calling upon the owners to provide proper doors to the urinals attached to their licensed premises. SCHOOLS. Inspection of Schools. The Schools of the Borough were inspected and the sanitary conveniences and water supplies were found in a satisfactory condition. SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, ETC. Fixing of W.C. Pans and Traps without Notice; List of Sanitary Works; Overcrowding; General; Closure of Duffs Fields; Playground for Cubitt Town; Marsh Wall Public Footway; and Legal Proceedings. Fixing of W.C. Pans and Traps without Notice. In two cases where w.c. pans and traps were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders were written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings, which had been authorised by the Committee, would be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work.

Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,606 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 30 5 per cent, of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 490 written intimations, 205 statutory, and 21 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precede the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in no case was it found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings to ensure enforcement. House-to-House Visitation. The house-to-house inspection comprised the undermentioned roads and places— Jodrell Road.

The 36 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food-stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Unsound Food. The market places have been regularly inspected. In no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure.

Factory and Workshop Acts. The workshops, workplaces and outworkers' premises on the Register have been visited, and the terms of the Acts relating to them have been required by notice, where necessary, to be complied with.

Under the Public Health (London) Acts the owner of 20, Whitethorn Street was summoned for neglecting to comply with the Council's orders. An order was made against the owner and 25s.'costs was allowed. The work was done forthwith. Pood and Drugs Acts. Under your instructions 51 samples of food stuffs have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst. The undermentioned articles were bought, viz.:— Milk, 23; butter, 20; coffee, 1; cocoa, 4; margarine, 2; lard, 1. The result of the analyses of above samples showed that some of the articles were found to be adulterated. Result of Summonses under Food and Drugs Act. Name. Article. Complaint. Pined. Costs. M. M.

Factories, Workshops, Workplaces and Outworkers. During the year the premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected, and where necessary, for sanitary purposes, notices have been duly served upon the responsible persons, and the nuisances were abated thereon Milk Shops. There are 53 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. 245 Coiohoases and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation ; I find that in some of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. Canal Boats. These boats are visited whenever lying alongside a wharf. 26 have been visited during the year without cause of complaint. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed slaughter houses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Ofttimes a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are seven fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public, Bake-Houses. There are 16 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 18 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean. Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small scale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period frequent visits are made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored over night is particularly investigated. 246 Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing Ihe sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. Unsound Food. During the year the undermentioned food stuffs have been surrendered by the owners as being unfit for food, viz. :— 1 case of herrings. 1 box of hake. 1 box of codlings. 1 trunk of haddock. 1 box of plaice. 8 trunks of tomatoes. Large quantities of unsound food are received from outlying wharves and sent into the Bromley North Division for destruction; such food stuff is not allowed to be destroyed until the District Inspector has verified the amount and weight of each load sent from the wharf to his district, The goods are then destroyed under his supervision. The following quantities have been destroyed so as to prevent its reappearance on the market as a cheap food for the working class. The residue is used only for cattle food and manure. Total destroyed :— 260 tons of grain. 96 cwt. 1 qr. of beef. 7,528 6-lb. tins of various meats. Smoke Nuisances. A few smoke nuisances have been notified, but on the service of an intimation the nuisance has been abated. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive 247 material is conveyed through the district. Only on two occasions were carriers cautioned, but the nuisances were very slight. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Cert. Sanitary Inspector Exam. Board (Lond.) and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and Canal Boats Act, Bromley North Division. 248 Report of Inspector, Bromley Central Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1910. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my twenty-first Annual Report of the Sanitary Works executed for the remedying of defects and abatement of nuisances, which have existed in the Central Division of the Sub-District of Bromley under the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Council for the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1909. Inspection of District. I have inspected 1,470 premises, 1,034 in response to complaints of nuisances, and notices received under the London County Council Bylaws and the Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908, 142 on account of cases of infectious diseases notified, and 294 were house-tohouse visitations. Of the 1,470 premises so dealt with 555 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the 915 premises (the remainder) defects and nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated statement page 221). In the supervision of same 4,133 re-inspections were made. Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908. Of the pulmonary tuberculosis cases and for which notices were received the great majority of patients were removed to various institutions for treatment. Inspections were made of the premises, as above stated, the necessary precautions (disinfection, etc.) adopted, and where required the work of cleansing was readily carried out by the responsible person. Measles. In accordance with your instructions, visits were made and precautions adopted similar to the other infectious cases during the year. 249 Drains newly Constructed and Reconstructed on the old lines of Drainage. The drains of the under-mentioned premises were newly constructed or reconstructed on the old lines, and also (where possible) intercepted, ventilated and furnished with means of access for cleansing purposes, in accordance with the London County Council's drainage bye-laws:— Abbott Road Nos. 85, 87, 89. Bromley Hall Road, Nos. 50, 52, 54, 56, 58. Brunswick Road, Nos. 186, 188, 235, 237, London County Council's (new) Fire Station. Cobden Street, Nos. 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21.

Of the above the following were combined drainage systems ("Sewers") reconstructed by Council:— Cobden Street, 17, 19, 21. St. Leonard's Road, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 113, 115, 163, 165, 289, 291, 293, 295. Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act 1891, Metropolis Local Management Acts, London County Council General Powers Act, also Bye-laws, and Council's own Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it was. only found necessary in one case to institute legal proceedings, the "intimations'' and notices served for the abatement of nuisances, remedying of defects and infringements of bye-laws respectively were complied with regarding the others. 250 Public Health (London) Act, 1891.

The drains of 220 premises were tested by means of the "rocket" smoke test. Thirty were proved defective, not gastight, whilst in 190 cases (the remainder) the result was negative. The water test has been applied to all new drainage work, and also where practicable to drains partially reconstructed or repaired. 252 Food and Drugs Acts, etc. I have, as directed by you, procured 55 samples of food, etc., which were submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of that number 6 (being samples of butter) contained boric acid preservatives ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 per cent. One of sweet spirits of nitre contained 0.71 per cent. less ethyl nitrite than required by the British Pharmacopœia. Notice having been given to purchaser that the drug was not guaranteed and a second sample taken, which proved to be genuine, the same vendors were duly cautioned. The remainder of samples were certified genuine. Public Schools. Oban Street Council Schools. Bromley Hall Road Council Schools. Hay Currie Council Schools. St. Leonard's Road Council Schools. Marner Street Council Schools. The above schools were visited and sanitary conveniences found to be in fair condition; the drinking water supplies were drawn direct from Metropolitan Water Board's mains. The storage tanks were furnished with covers and periodically cleansed; these tanks are only used for supplies to lavatories and closets, etc. Inspection of Bakehouses, etc. I have, as instructed, made the periodical inspections of these (13) premises (three not in use), and, where required, served Extracts of Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, "intimations" and statutory notices for the necessary work of cleansing and repairs, which were respectively complied with. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops in the division were inspected, attention being given to the cleanliness of the utensils used in the business as well as to the sanitary conditions of the premises. Where defects existed, "intimations" and statutory notices were served and nuisances abated. Public-House Urinals, etc. Attention has been given to the urinals to ascertain whether they were kept clean and furnished with the necessary fittings in compliance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. 253 Verminous Rooms. During the course of year 21 rooms were cleansed; it was not necessary to enforce the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Eating Houses, Coffee Shops, Pork Butchers, Sausage and Brawn Makers' Premises, Fried Fish Shops. Inspections were several times made of the whole of the abovedescribed business premises and all necessary works of cleansing and repairs carried out, in some cases without the service of "Intimations," etc. In no instance upon such visits was there cause for complaint so far as the condition of food was concerned. Cowsheds, Milk Sellers and Purveyors. The above (51) premises were frequently visited, the Public Health, etc., Office Registers corrected in the cases of those found non-registered through change of occupancy. The new proprietors were supplied with forms which were duly signed for the required alteration. Constant attention was given to the enforcement of regulations relating to cleanliness of utensils, more particularly in compliance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, relating to the sanitary conditions and surroundings under which milk was sold. Upon notice received for renewal of the licence of a cowshed at 27, Abbott Road, the premises were again inspected and found to be in sanitary order; no opposition to the application of the licensee to the London County Council was made. Unsound Food. I have, upon application made by tradesmen and itinerant vendors, examined articles of food (mostly fish) purchased by them at the markets, and when found "unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food" recommended them to make application to the salesmen for recompense. At other times I have not found any article of food "exposed for sale, deposited for sale, or in preparation for sale" at any premises in such condition as to justify seizure. 254 Ice-Cream Makers and Vendors. All the premises where ice-creams were made were visited, with the object of detecting nuisances and infringements of the London County Council General Powers Act, 1902. The barrows were found to be legibly marked with names and addresses, etc., of vendors; and the utensils and the premises were found to be clean and the ice-creams were wholesome. Factory and Workshops Inspections. Nuisances arising within the several factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., were dealt with. The whole of the ascertained above business premises were inspected and found, in the majority of cases, to be in fair sanitary condition. In the remainder the work of repairs, cleansing, etc., was carried out in compliance with "intimations," notices, etc. Smoke Nuisances. Smoke emitted so as to be a nuisance from chimneys other than those belonging to private dwelling-houses, viz., factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., was abated on the service of the usual documents. In no instance was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings. Canal Boats, I have inspected 30 barges, 29 non-registered and one registered sailing barge; I found the cabins fairly clean, and no infringement of the regulations. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Cert. San. Inst. Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of food and Drugs Acts and Canal Boats Act, Bromley Central Division. 255 Report of Inspector, West Combined Division.

Sir— I beg to lay before you my tenth Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith in the West Combined District during the past year, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. Inspection of Division. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds 1271 houses or other premises have been visited, 206 of these visits being on account of notifications of infectious diseases. In addition to these, 99 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have been notified, and where possible, visited and dealt with as required under the regulations. This number shows a decrease of 43 upon those of the previous year. Of the 206 cases 3 were notified from the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, 2 from Langley House Receiving Home and 6 from the Poplar Union. House to House Inspections. These visits to the number of 186 were carried out in the undermentioned localities, many of the drains one way or another proving unsound on being tested:— Annabel Street. Ellerthorpe Street. Barchester Street. Giraud Street. Bath Cottages. Goodliffe Street. Bickmore Street. Goodliffe Place. Broomfield Street. Guildford Road. Bygrove Street. Milton Place. Dolphin Lane. Morris Road.

Vesey Street. and also at odd houses as occasion required. Drain Reconstructions. The drains of 40 premises were taken out and reconstructed, and where practicable, in order to comply with the bye-laws of the London County Council and Borough Council, were intercepted, ventilated and provided with proper means of access for clearing in times of stoppages, the whole work being thoroughly tested before being passed as sound:— Augusta Street, Emery Hall (part). Alton Street, 21, 23, 25. Canton Street, Nos. 51, 19. Duff Street, No. 22. Ellerthorpe Street, Nos. 18, 19. Ellesmere Street, No. 6. Elizabeth Place, No. 5. Flint Street, Nos. 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36.

Upper North Street (major portion of Allen's Chemical Works.) Wade Street, No. 4. West India Road, No. 47, 49. (Factory premises.) The drains of 25 premises were also partially reconstructed and amended as found necessary. Coffee and Eating Houses. These premises have been periodically inspected during the year, 257 alterations in tenancy and new shops have been registered and the registers brought up to date. While inspecting these places, so far as possible attention has been paid to the food in preparation for cooking. The premises have been cleansed when found necessary. Food Inspection at Wharves, etc. At Aberdeen Wharf, where food, skins, and potted meats are landed for transit, inspections have been made from time to time and everything found in good condition. At "River Plate Wharf," where tinned food is stored, periodical inspections have been made as required. Everything has been found satisfactory. The butchers' premises and stalls in Chrisp Street Market were inspected at night times, at week ends and at times on Sunday mornings. In each place where sausages and brawn and such like are made special attention has been given. These places are registered and the businesses are conducted in a clean and careful manner, and the premises are regularly cleansed. Odd consignments of damaged wheat, rice and barley have been received into the district from the "docks" to be made up into poultry food. These consignments have been watched through the processes. The following foodstuffs have been surrendered and destroyed during the year:— 24 boxes of tomatoes, 1 box of plaice, 2 barrels of herrings, 2 boxes of skate, and several lots of damaged fruit in small quantities. Factories and Workshops. These places have been visited periodically, and when necessary cleansing "notices" have been served and complied with. New workshops opened have been placed on the register and duly inspected. 258 No case of overcrowding or infectious disease in any workshop has been found to exist, but some cases of infectious diseases notified as residing in the district, but engaged outside the district, have been dealt with by notifying the authorities in whose district they worked. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited at intervals. Changes of address have been noted and registered, and where necessary " notices " for cleansing have been served and complied with. Bakehouses. The occupied bakehouses now number 21 and these have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily and the places kept in very good order. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops and Slaughterhouses. These places are regularly visited during the year. All dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness and have, generally speaking, been kept in a good condition. All changes of tenancy (which are many) have been dealt with and the registers brought up to date. The number of these on the register at present is as follows:— Milkshops 65 Cowshed 1 Slaughterhouse 1 Canal Boats Acts. Canal boats that are "registered" as such under the Acts are visited as opportunities offer. They have been found, as regards the living quarters, in a clean and bright condition, and full advantage taken of the means of ventilation provided. The "certificates" have been produced for inspection when asked for, and examined and compared with the number o occupants, and no overcrowding has been found to exist. No cases of illness have been discovered on the boats. 259 Smoke Nuisances. Complaints from the London County Council (which have been very few this year) have been attended to, also my own observations of shafts. No legal proceedings were necessary, all "notices" being attended to. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. During the year 51 samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis, 3 of which proved to be so adulterated that legal proceedings were instituted as under, and also a "letter of caution" was sent to another vendor by order of the Committee after advice that this would be sufficient. Milk.—Deficient in fat to extent of 3.3 per cent. and solids not fat 2.3 per cent., purchased from itinerant vendor on Sunday morning. Letter of caution sent to vendor. Lard.—Consisting entirely of vegetable fat. Defendant fined £2 and £1 3s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat 15.9 per cent., showing 15.9 per cent. of added water. Defendant fined £3 and £1 3s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to extent of 7.8 per cent. This deficiency indicates the presence of at least 7.8 per cent. of added water. Defendant fined £1 and 12s. 6d. costs. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. All cases of infectious diseases notified during the year have received attention with a view to tracing their origin if possible. Very many visits to premises have been paid respecting notifications of tuberculosis, and where possible, precautions taken upon advice given to the patients and household generally. A summons was taken out against the owner of a house in Ellerthorpe Street, for not complying with a "sanitary notice" from the Council to do certain works under the above Act. The defendant said he 260 could not comply with the "notice," and the magistrate made a closing "order," granting 25s. costs. The premises have since changed hands, been thoroughly put in order and re-occupied after the rescinding of the "order." A summons was taken out against a firm of glue makers for causing offensive matter to be conveyed through the district in improper vessels and in a van improperly covered. The firm was fined 44s. costs. The carman was also summoned for conveying the matter through the district within prohibited hours after being several times cautioned of the offence. He was fined 40s. and 44s. costs. A summons was taken out against the owner of a house in Guildford Road for not complying with a "notice" from the Council. The defendant did not appear in Court, and a "closing order" was made against the premises by the Magistrate, who granted 27s. costs. On a further summons against the owner for disobeying the Magistrate's order, viz., not getting the tenants out and allowing the premises to be occupied—the defendant, who this time appeared, was cautioned and fined 20s. and 23s. costs, whereupon the premises were emptied and remain empty, the "order" not having as yet been rescinded. A summons was taken out against the agent of a house in Brabazon Street for not complying with a "notice" from the Council to do some "urgent" work. The Magistrate passed severe comments on the agents' neglect and inflicted a fine of 16s. and 44s. costs. The work was at once done. A summons was taken out against the agent of a house in Ellesmere Street for not complying with a "notice'' from the Council to do some work under the Act. The defendant was fined 10s. and 44s. costs. The work was at once done. A summons was taken out against the owner of a house in Harrow Lane for not complying with a "notice" from the Council to do some work under the Act. Defendant was fined 10s. and 23s. costs, and the work was completed. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Under this Act some 25 rooms have been successfully freed from vermin. No legal proceedings were necessary to ensure this result. 261 The public-house urinals, as far as possible, have been kept in a cleanly state. Ice-Cream, Regulations. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice-cream is made have been inspected and attention given to all the utensils used. They have been kept in a most satisfactory and clean condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH JOHNSON, R.P.C., Cert. San. Insp. Exam. Board (London); Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs and Canal Boats Acts West Combined Division. 262 Report of Inspector, East Combined Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1910. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my fifteenth Annual Report of the sanitary work carried out in my district (East Combined Division) during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1910. Inspection of Division. 1702 premises have been inspected, 1441 in response to complaints of nuisances, 114 on account of notifications of infectious diseases, and the remainder (147) being house-to-house visitations. Of the 1702 premises so dealt with 1067 were found to be in a fair sanitary condition, whilst in the remainder (635 premises) nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following sanitary works being executed (see tabulated list, page 221). House-to-House Inspections. House-to-house inspections have been carried out in the following streets:— Collins Place Commodore Court Creekside Duke Street Dunkeld Street, south side Surrey Place West West Street House-to-House Inspections have been carried out in sections of the following Streets:— Ashton Street Gaselee Street Brunswick Street Grundy Street Cold Harbour Harrap Street Cotton Street Orchard Place Dee Street Lindale Street East India Dock Road Wells Street Follett Street Wright's Place 263 Names of the Roads, Streets and Places, East Combined Division.

The drains of 149 premises have been tested either with smoke or chemical tests, and in 62 premises found to be defective. During the year the drains of the undermentioned premises were 264 constructed or reconstructed, and in almost every case (where there was sufficient fall in the drain) intercepted, ventilated and furnished with means of access front and back of the premises, in accordance with the requirements of the London County Council's bye-laws and the regulations of the Borough Council, plans of each having been submitted to and approved by the Council:— Cold Harbour, Patent Tread Company. Dee Street, Lichen's Yard. Dunkeld Street, All Hallows' Church. Duff's Fields, The Cottage. St. Leonards Road, 18, 20. Drainage Reconstruction on Old Lines. The drains of the undermentioned premises have been relaid on the old lines, and where practicable intercepted and provided with access chambers, or inlets, at each end for cleansing purposes should stoppage occur, also where necessary proper means of ventilation:— Abbott Road, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80.

Verminous Booms. 27 verminous rooms have been cleansed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Bakehouses. I have, as instructed, made periodical inspections of the bakehouses (numbering seventeen) throughout the district. Three of the bakehouses are underground. The bi-annual cleansing in each case was carried out satisfactorily. The conditions in some cases necessitated service of "Intimations" with respect to the removal of sweepings from under the troughs and the cleansing of the utensils, etc. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. Five notices were received for renewal of licences. The premises were duly inspected in respect of the necessary cleansing and limewashing, which was done in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds Order; any defects found were remedied before the renewals of the licences were granted. The slaughterhouses have been frequently visited, and at times when killing was in progress, and everything found satisfactory. The number of these premises now on the register is—cowsheds, 2; slaughterhouses, 3. 266 Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Pood and Drugs Acts 53 varied samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. On analysis one only was found to be adulterated. A summons was issued against the vendor. Particulars of adulterated sample and result of proceedings are appended:— Butter.—Containing 3 per cent. excess of water. Defendant fined 20s. and 12s. 6d. costs. Ten samples of butter were mixed with a foreign substance, i.e., boric acid (preservative) in varying small proportions. Number of samples of butter obtained 17 „ containing boric acid in butter 10 „ „ foreign fat in butter — „ „ excess of water in butter 1 Particulars of samples containing preservatives:— Butter containing boric acid, 0.25 per cent. „ „ 0.5 „ „ „ 0.25 „ „ „ 0.4 „ „ „ 0.5 „ „ „ 0.1 „ „ „ 0.5 ,, „ „ 0.4 „ „ „ 0.30 „ 0.4 „ Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act 1891 and Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it was not found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with the London County Council's and Poplar Borough Council's own bye-laws, as the nuisances were satisfactorily abated. 267 Smoke Nuisances. During the year the shafts throughout the district have been under careful observation, and in only two instances nuisances were detected. In these cases intimations and statutory notices have been served, which has had the desired effect of abating the nuisances. No recurrence of the nuisances took place, and therefore there was no neoessity to institute legal proceedings. Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected in respect of unsound and unwholesome food, and during the past year there was no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. During the year I have on several occasions, upon application made by tradesmen, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found "unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food," witnessed the same destroyed by the owners and certificates were given to that effect. Unsound Food—Legal Proceedings. On the 2nd June, at the request of an itinerant vendor, I examined 5 boxes of kippers which had been purchased from Billingsgate Market the same day and found them unfit for human food. A note was given to the purchaser to take to the wholesale vendors to that effect, who refused to refund the purchase money. In consequence I seized the said kippers and had them taken to the Thames Police Court and condemned by the presiding Magistrate. Two summonses were applied for against the vendors. At the hearing of the summonses, which took place on the 1st July at the Mansion House Police Court, it was contended, on behalf of the Council, that the kippers which were bought at 11 a.m. and attempted to be sold at mid-day in Poplar the same day must have been unfit for food at the time of the purchase—9d. for 30 pairs—and that the vendors must have known from the price that they were not sound. On behalf of the vendors it was pleaded that the weather was very hot and the kippers were sound and wholesome at the time of sale. The presiding Magistrate gave the defendants, a Limited Company, and the defendants' manager the benefit of the doubt and dismissed the summonses, with no costs against the Council. 268 Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection has been given to these premises during the past year; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register. At each inspection particular attention was paid to the food under preparation, and in no instance was there cause for complaint; in some cases it was necessary to serve intimations and statutory notices respecting cleansing of the kitchens and dining rooms, etc. Hairdressers' Shops. The hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected, the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of the utensils used in the business being carefully noted. In some cases intimations were required to be served. Factory and Workshops Acts. The workshops, domestic workshops, workplaces and domestic workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been frequently inspected during the past year, the number of persons employed in each case being noted, particularly in respect to overcrowding; the terms of the Acts relating thereto have been met with in response to intimations and statutory notices when required, and in no instance was there occasion to take legal proceedings. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without any particular incident during the year. No contravention of the Acts was discovered on any of the non-registered barges. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. The premises where ice creams are made have been frequently inspected with the view of detecting nuisances, also any infringement of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, Part viii. Itinerant vendors' barrows and utensils have been inspected. In each case the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto; in each case the ice cream and utensils were found to be clean and satisfactory. No cause for action to be taken. 269 Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-law under Public Health (London) Act. Section 50). The cisterns of the undermentioned buildings have been inspected during the year, and duly reported upon. Where covers were found to be defective, they have since been amended, and made as far as practicable dustproof. Each cistern is so situated as to be free from pollution:— Adelaide Buildings 2, Baffin Buildings 2, Grosvenor Buildings 55, Hudson Buildings 2, Melbourne Buildings 4, Montreal Buildings 4, Ontario Buildings 4, Ottawa Buildings 4, Prestage Buildings 6, Quebec Buildings 4, Council Buildings 5, St. Lawrence Cottages, Norfolk Street 14, Sydney Buildings 4, Toronto Buildings 2, Winnipeg Buildings 4. Public House Urinals. The public house urinals in the district have been frequently inspected, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, strictly enforced (see tabulated list page 221). Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is stored and sold in the district with the object of enforcing the regulations of the "Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885," as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, particularly in respect to other articles kept for sale in the same premises. Number of Milk Sellers registered 39 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 7 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 1 Number of Milk Sellers added to Register 3 Overcrowding. During the year nine cases of overcrowding were dealt with; in each case the nuisance was abated after the service of an intimation followed by a statutory notice, without recourse to legal proceedings. 270 Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, and notices to cleanse the premises have been served where required. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, etc. There is only one wharf in my district, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramornie Meat Co.), where food (all tinned) is landed, some of which is warehoused for other firms; the remainder, which is all examined by the consignee is for sale for both home consumption and export. A large amount goes into the Mercantile Service, all of which is examined and labelled by the Board of Trade officials before being sent away. The following tinned foods (as set out below) on examination were rejected by the consignee as unfit for human food; the rejected portion was set apart by the consignee in a separate building for the purpose of being sent to a fat boiler to be rendered down for fat; proper precautions are taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose. 815-61bs. beef, 572-21bs. beef, 1—41b. beef, 10-1lb. beef, 461061bs. mutton, 424-21bs. mutton, 20-21bs. steak, 9-21bs. brawn, 2-21bs. sausages, 142-21bs. soup, 10-31bs. tongues, l-2¾lbs. tongues, 31-2½lbs. tongues, 5-21bs. tongues, 4-1¼lbs. tongues, 126-l½lbs. chickens, 735—1lb. salmon, 2065-2½lbs. fruits. The "Regulations under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907," give more power to inspect food imported into this country, and will facilitate a more rigid examination, also supervision of the disposal of unsound food. Public Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Public Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supplies and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main, and the storage cisterns (which are used for supplying the sanitary conveniences only) are cleansed periodically. The sanitary conveniences and offices were found to be in a clean and satisfactory condition. In cases where drinking cups were found to be missing they were afterwards reinstated. 271 Places where Bread is Sold. With reference to a communication received from the London County Council all the shops where bread is sold in my district have been nspected so as to secure the regulation of places at which bread is sold under the provisions of Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which relates to the sanitary regulations of premises used for the sale of food for human consumption. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats, East Combined Division. 272 Report of Inspector, South Division of Poplar.

Improved and sufficient sanitary accommodation for workmen has been provided at the following factories :— Cuba Street (factory for wood-chopping). Phoenix Wharf, West Ferry Road. Ovex Works, Stewart Street. 275 Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were visited and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations. Workshops, etc. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 36—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Booms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms (20 in all) were inspected and dealt with where necessary. Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division (Poplar South) number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. In one instance only was it necessary to serve the authorities with a written intimation. At this School (St. John's, Roserton Street) the ranges of boys' and girls' and infants' w.c.'s, when automatically flushed, over-flowed, saturating the floors, ete. The nuisance was abated on the service of the written intimation. Public Health London Act, 1891. Prosecutions. Complaint. Premises. Costs. Drain obstructed 5, Charles Terrace 25s. and magistrate's order to abate in 7 days. 276 Drain obstructed 8, Charles Terrace 25s. and 7 days' abatement order. In the above cases a difficulty arose as to ownership, the property was changing hands at the date of the proceedings. The nuisance was eventually abated by the Council, who were at the time receiving the rents in lieu of rates. Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises, and notices served as under:— No. of Intimations and Notices. Now Unoccupied.

Riverside Wharves and Food Manufacturing and Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the undermentioned wharves for the purpose of detecting the landing or storage of unsound food intended for sale for human consumption, with the results indicated:— St. Andrew's Wharf and Cattle Food Manufactory, West Ferry Road. The undermentioned food stuffs were brought to the above premises (from without the district) and converted into cattle food:— 277 90 tons copra (cocoa nut kernel). 130 bags ground pea nuts. 16 cwt. damaged lentils. 11 cases rotten dates. 17 bags loose dates and sweepings. 1 qr. 21 lbs. bean meal. 9 cwt. locust bean. 4 casks caramel paste. Sufferance Wharf and Food Preserving and Manufacturing Premises (for export only), West Ferry Road, Millwall. Summary of food stuffs examined and destroyed by the consignee:— 140 cases tinned fish, principally lobster, salmon and sardines, about 50 tins per case. 8 cases tinned fruit and tomatoes, 40 tins per case. Maconochie's Wharf and Food Manufacturing and Preserving Factory West Ferry Road. The total amount of food stuffs destroyed (in my presence after being sorted out by the firm) during the year at this factory which consisted of meat, poultry, fish, soups, fruit and vegetables was 1919 tins, all of which was contained in tins varying from ½lb. to 14lb. in weight. Frequent exportations from the above factories of consignments of hams or tinned meat to the Argentine or Philippines (where a certificate is required from the Sanitary Authority of the district whence the goods are despatched to accompany each consignment) had occurred. In every instance the factory was visited and the foodstuffs (meat) examined prior to tinning before the certificates were signed. The additional powers conferred by the Regulations under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, facilitate a more rigid inspection of food stuffs landed at the above-mentioned wharves, and a more effectual means of dealing with and disposing of unsound food is defined in that statute. One notice under these regulations was received during the past year from the Officer of Customs relating to food-stuff imported into this division, viz.:— Millwall Wharf and Bonded Warehouses, Manchester Road. 278 One cask of guts (casings) intended for use as sausage skins, imported from Morocco. The same were sound and allowed to pass. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Foodstuffs Surrendered from Itinerant Vendors, Stalls and Small Dealers Premises. During the year, at the request of the owner, one trunk of whiting was examined at the Public Health Offices; the same was unfit for human food and was destroyed by the owner. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-two samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of that number 6 (being butters) contained boric acid preservatives ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 per cent. Of the remaining samples taken 2 were certified to be so adulterated that summonses were issued against the respective vendors. The nature of samples and extent of adulteration, with result of prosecutions, are indicated below:— 24F Milk—Deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 23.3 and 1.1 per cent. respectively. Vendor fined £2 and £1 3s. costs. 41F Milk—Deficient in fat 15.3 per cent. Vendor fined 7s. and £1 3s. costs. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 279 Report of Lady Inspector (Miss Tatters all).

Sir,— I beg to present my eleventh Annual Report which deals with the work done in factories, workshops, among outworkers, and other miscellaneous inspections during the year 1910. During the year one notice was served where the sanitary accommodation was unsatisfactory. Scabies (Itch) and Verminous Children. I have visited a number of houses from which children were excluded from school when suffering from scabies, or on account of their verminous condition, and have had bedding disinfected and cleansing carried out. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation in the whole of the elementary schools in the Borough has been inspected and various defects remedied. Outworkers.

The whole of the work done under this Act was under the intimations served, and in no cases were certification and subsequent notices necessary. There were 49 intimations served, referring to 73 rooms. Legal Proceedings. In the month of January, at Thames Police Court, the landlord of Nos. 14 and 15, Bakers Alley, Bow Road, was summoned for not supplying true and proper information, in order that the premises could be registered under the Bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings. In several cases the number of lodgers was more than stated by defendant. The magistrate inflicted a penalty of £2 and £2 6s. costs. (After notice in writing signed by Town Clerk and dated 12th November, 283 1909, the landlord did not within period of 14 days sign and furnish to the Council a true statement of particulars required by the sard notice, and the said offence still continued after written notice from the Council dated 11th December, 1909.) Registration. There are 1095 houses at present on the register. During the year 58 houses were newly registered. Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. During the year the houses in Oliffe Street, Cubitt Town, were inspected under the above Act and reported to be unfit for human habitation. Notices to quit were subsequently served on all the lodgers and the houses were eventually closed, since when two of them have been demolished by the London County Council.

Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. January 2nd, 1911. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir — I beg to present the third Annual Report of my work. The personnel of the Poplar Health Visiting Association remains practically unchanged, the number of helpers on the books being fiftyeight, which includes five doctors, five secretaries, and forty-eight visitors, a loss of two compared with 1909, but the number of infants visited shews an increase of 136. Two new "Consultation Days" have been opened during the year, one at Pern Street School Settlement, and one at St. John's Schoolroom, Manchester Road, making a total of seven in the Borough, all in a flourishing condition, as the figures appended show. The Executive Committee of the Association met six times during the year, deciding, at their last meeting, on an important change—the introduction of paid help. A sub-committee elected to deal with the matter, appointed Miss Dorothy Guest, who at the time of writing has started work. No new work will be undertaken, but the infants which I have been visiting at more or less long intervals, will be visited regularly. The salary for the first six months has been guaranteed by some friends of Miss Wintour. It is hoped that a concert, which is to be held early in the new year, will yield a substantial sum towards the next six months. Once more I should like to take this opportunity of expressing, first, my thanks to all who have so loyally worked together and made the Association a power for good (which it undoubtedly is) in the Borough; second, the hope that their efforts will show no signs of diminution during the coming year, but rather that the increased success attending their work will serve to increase their ardour. 286 POPLAR HEALTH VISITING ASSOCIATION.

VARIOUS ACTS RELATING TO VERMINOUS PERSONS AND PREMISES, ETC.* Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897. Power to local authorities to provide cleansing, etc., for persons infested with vermin. 1. On and after the passing of this Act any local authority shall have the power, when in their discretion they shall see fit, to permit any person who shall apply to the said authority, on the ground that he is infested with vermin, to have the use, free of charge, of the apparatus (if any) which the authority possess for cleansing the person and his clothing from vermin. The use of such apparatus shall not be considered to be parochial relief or charitable allowance to the person using the same, or to the parent of such person, and no such person or parent shall by reason thereof be deprived of any right or privilege or be subject to any disqualification or disability. Local authorities may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances, and attendants that may be required for the carrying out of this Act, and any expenses for these purposes may be defrayed out of any rate or fund applicable by the authority for general sanitary purposes or for the relief of the poor. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904 Part IV. Sanitary. Filthy, dangerous or unwholesome articles to be purified. 19.—(1) Where on the certificate of the medical officer of health of any sanitary district it appears to the sanitary authority of that district * See pages 102 to 115. 292 that any articles in any house or part thereof in that district are in such a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition that health is affected or endangered thereby or that the cleansing or purifying or destroying of any such articles is requisite to prevent risk of or to check infectious disease the sanitary authority may cause any such articles to be at their own expense cleansed or purified or they may destroy the same. (2) If any owner suffer any unnecessary damage the sanitary authority shall compensate him for the same and the sanitary authority shall also reasonably compensate the owner for any articles destroyed. Houses infested with vermin to be cleansed. 20.—(1) Where on the certificate of the medical officer of health of any sanitary district it appears to the sanitary authority of that district that any house or part thereof in that district is infested with vermin such sanitary authority shall give notice in writing to the owner or occupier of such house or part thereof requiring him within a period to be specified in such notice to cleanse such house or the portion thereof specified in the notice and if so required in the notice to remove the wall paper from the walls of such house or the part thereof specified in the notice and to take such other steps for the purpose of destroying and removing vermin as the case may require. (2) If the person to whom such notice is given fails to comply therewith within the time therein specified he shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding ten shillings for every day during which he makes default in complying with the requirements of such notice and the sanitary authority may if they think fit at any time after the expiration of the period specified in the notice themselves do any work required by the notice to be done and all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the sanitary authority in so doing shall (subject as herein-after provided) be recoverable summarily as a civil debt from the person making the default. (3) Upon any proceedings under this section the court may inquire as to whether any requirement contained in any notice given or any work done by the sanitary authority was reasonable and as to whether the costs and expenses incurred by the sanitary authority in doing such work or any part thereof ought to be borne wholly or in part by the person to whom the notice was given and the court may make such order concerning such costs and expenses or their apportionment as appears to the court to be just and equitable under the circumstances of the case. 293 Provision of means for cleansing, etc., filthy articles and houses. 21. Section 59 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891 shall for the purposes of the two last preceding sections of this Act extend and be applicable to the provision of means for cleansing purifying and destroving filthy dangerous or unwholesome articles and for the removal thereof and for the cleansing of houses infested with vermin as if the said section 59 were re-enacted herein and in terms made applicable thereto.

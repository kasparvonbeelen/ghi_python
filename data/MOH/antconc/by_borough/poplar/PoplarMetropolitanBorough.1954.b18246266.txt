A. -5- TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1954. The health of the people as judged from the reduced death rates and the smaller number of cases of notifiable infectious disease has been satisfactory and it is thought that the number of cases of diseases which are not notifiable was also less although no figures are available. It is difficult to produce a measure of actual health as distinct from death and disease, but the general well being of the population can be judged to some extent by general living conditions, housing, clothing, feeding, etc. and there is no doubt that there was an improvement during 1954. Housing, which has a considerable effect on the health of the people remains one of the most important matters with which the Council is concerned. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act was passed during the year and came into effect at the end of August 1954. The intention of the Act was to ensure as far as possible the rapid demolition of houses which could not be made fit and the preservation of houses which could be made fit but which owing to the high cost of repairs were not being adequately maintained. -6- So far as the preservation and maintenance of houses is concerned the Act has not met with any conspicuous success in Poplar. Many owners appear to think that the procedure for claiming the increased rent is unduly complicated and there have been fewer applications for certificates of disrepair than was anticipated. A slum clearance programme was agreed with the London County Council following the survey which was carried out in 1949 and further proposals for the next five year programme had been requested by the County Council prior to the passing of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act 1954. Towards the end of 1954 the survey was extended to cover all those houses which were suitable for immediate representation. Although it is usual to talk of "slums" and "slum clearance" the word "slum" does not appear in any of the housing legislation and the question to be answered concerning any unfit house is whether it can or cannot be made fit at "reasonable cost" together with consideration of the arrangement of the houses and streets. "Reasonable cost" is not defined and what may be "reasonable" for a house where the owner has vacant possession may very easily be entirely uneconomic for a house which is subject to a controlled tenancy. On the usually accepted standards there are comparatively few "slums" in Poplar but very many of the houses fall far short of a desirable standard. Apart from the houses and flats which have been built by the Borough Council or the County Council the great majority of houses in the Borough are upwards of 70 years -7- old. These houses did not attain a very high standard of either materials or workmanship, the arrangements were poorly planned in that in almost every case there is no access to the rear of the house with the result that everything going into the house and everything coming out, including household refuse, must pass through the front door. The amenities are poor; the W. C. is generally situated out in the back yard and the 1951 census showed that 72% of all the dwellings in the Borough were without a bath. Consequently, although there are comparatively few houses which are suitable for immediate representation there are many more which are coming to the end of their useful life and which will have to be dealt with in say 10-15 years. In the meantime very many families will be condemned to live in houses which are becoming increasingly decrepit and without those amenities which must surely be regarded as necessary in this period of our civilisation. A bath and a hot water supply cannot nowadays be regarded as a luxury but the provisions of the housing legislation to encourage the supply of these amenities has so far had very little effect. In many instances tenants have done a great deal by way of redecoration and minor repairs to improve the houses in which they live but major works are usually beyond their means apart from being normally the responsibility of the owner of the house. The owner cannot be compelled to provide amenities such as a bath even though he can obtain financial assistance through an improvement grant and it is -8- unfortunate that a tenant who is willing to do so cannot be assisted in a similar manner. Health in many ways and especially in the avoidance of mental disturbance leading to anxieties, anti-social behaviour and delinquency, depends largely on a harmonious and affectionate family life and happy families are found more frequently in good houses than in bad ones. Unless therefore something can be done to improve the amenities and standards of housing of those families who will have to live in the old houses of Poplar for many years to come the standard of health of the people of the Borough is likely to lag behind that of those more fortunate areas where housing is of a higher quality. It is gratifying to note that in the new housing development in Poplar carried out by the Borough Council and by the County Council it has been possible to include at least some houses as well as the more general flat development. Although there are some exceptions, in my opinion, a flat is not the best place in which to bring up a family. In the report which follows a summary is given of the work relating to those health duties of the Council which are dealt with by the Public Health Department. A very brief mention is also made of baths, wash-houses and of public cleansing which are not dealt with by the Public Health Department. It is sometimes forgotten or not appreciated that nearly all the duties of the Council are concerned with -9- the health and welfare of the people of the Borough although only a limited number are referred to the Public Health Department. If for instance the sewers were not adequately maintained or the system of collection of house refuse broke down, the health of the people would very rapidly be affected. To this extent my report is limited but I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the work of all the other departments which has done so much to maintain the standards and assist in improving the health of the people of Poplar. I am again indebted to the Divisional Medical Officer, Dr. G.o. Mitchell,for the information concerning the personal health services which are administered by the London County Council which is given at the end of this report. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health and Baths Committee for their help and encouragement throughout the year; to the Chief Officers of the Council and their staffs for their assistance and advice and particularly to my own staff for their very loyal help on all occasions. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. DUNCAN DEWAR Medical Officer of Health June, 1955. -10- SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS The Registrar General estimated that at the middle of 1954 the home population numbered 71,690 which was 780 less than in 1953. This decrease was due to the movement of some 1,330 residents to dwellings outside the Borough because the number of births exceeded the number of deaths by 554 during 1954. The birth rate at 17.7 per 1,000 of the population is slightly less than the rate for the previous year (18.0). In order to compare the rate with other areas and with the country as a whole the Registrar General provides a Comparability Factor which takes into account the proportions of old or young people and the proportions of male and female in the area so that a fair comparison can be made. Using this factor the adjusted birth rate would be 15.9 as compared with 15.2 for England and Wales. The death rate in Poplar was 9.98 per 1,000 of the population. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted rate would be 11.4 as compared with a rate of 11.3 for England and Wales. This shows a reduction from the figures for 1953 which were 12.0 and 11.4 respectively. The infant mortality rate being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births was 25.1. This compares with the figure of 25.5 for -11- England and Wales which is the lowest figure ever recorded for the country. The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. There is a reduction of deaths from tuberculosis of the lungs from 25 in 1953 to 13 in 1954, a reduction in deaths from all forms of diseases of the heart and circulation from 306 in the previous year to 284 and a reduction in deaths from Bronchitis from 77 to 58. Deaths from other diseases show no significant change from the numbers recorded in 1953.

The domestic water supply for every dwelling in the Borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board' s laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The results were uniformly satisfactory throughout the year. Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 in 389 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The District Sanitary Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows. -16- TABLE II INSPECTIONS, INSANITARY CONDITIONS FOUND EXISTING, AND RE-INSPECTIONS DURING THE YEAR 1954 Number of Complaints received 2,515 Number of Inspections Dwelling Houses House-to-House â On complaint 2,493 After Infectious Disease 103 Factories Where power is used 398 No power used 15 Others 49 Outworkers 15 Stables 15 Smoke observations 43 Miscellaneous visits and inspections (including visits to infectious disease contacts, school inspections, etc.) 3,851 Re-inspections 8,275 Premises requiring amendment (Dwelling Houses 2,048 (Others 46 Service of Intimations, etc., Intimations served 1,920 Intimations complied with 1,556 Notices served 742 Notices complied with 651 Pinal Notices served 98 Final Notices complied with 95 Summonses applied for 53 Work done (number of instances not included above): (a) After legal proceedings 52 (b) Voluntarily 218 Defects, etc., found in Dwelling Houses: Nuisances, etc., found Works completed Drainage: Drains defective 91 53 Drains obstructed 184 172 Waste pipes defective, etc. 117 111 Rainwater pipes not disconnected 3 3 W.

There were three licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187, 45 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 35. Personal Cleansing. Owing to the very small number of cases requiring personal cleansing an arrangement was made with the Stepney Borough Council to carry out cleansing where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. -19- The number of persons cleansed during 1954 was as follows: - Verminous Scabies Total Adults 22 17 39 Children 3 6 9 25 23 48 Disinfection and Disinfestation. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below: - (a) Disinfection: - Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 331 5,945 Tuberculosis 37 912 Verminous 2 34 Miscellaneous 405 5,361 Disinfection for manufacturing firms - 75,583 TOTALS 775 87,835 (b) Disinfestation:- Inspections:- Number of visits 1,692 Premises requiring treatment 742 Furniture requiring treatment 197 Re-inspections after disinfestation 266 Miscellaneous visits and revisits 104 Disinfestation carried out: - Rooms (in 709 premises) 1,712 Beds, bedding, etc. articles 608 Furniture articles 3,579 -20- Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949.

No exemption certificates under the Act were issued during the year. Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. A list of persons who sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List is maintained under the provisions of the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. The number of persons on the list at the end of 1954 was 94. Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act requires the registration of premises upon which a business is carried on involving the use of filling materials. The number of premises registered is 9. The Act also requires the licensing of premises for the storage of rag flock, and 2 licences have been issued. Pet Animals Act, 1951. Licences have been issued in respect of nine premises within the Borough. 25 National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47. A number of cases of aged people came to the notice of the Public Health Department, but with the co-operation of the Home Help Service of the London County Council and with the assistance of the District Nurses, the Voluntary Services and friends and neighbours it was possible to provide proper care at home for a large proportion. The remainder were persuaded voluntarily to enter a hospital or home and it was possible to avoid taking action under Section 47. Care of the Aged. Help, advice and assistance for old people through the statutory authorities and voluntary organisations associated in welfare work continued throughout the year and the old people have benefited greatly from the services provided. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50. Burials carried out under the provisions of this Act totalled 4 (2 adults and 2 stillborn). The total cost was Â£24 12s. 0d. and the amount recovered was Â£17 11s. 6d. Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court. It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped postmortem room. In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the pathologists and clerks. 26. Arrangements were made for the joint use of Poplar Mortuary by the three boroughs of Bethnal Green, Poplar and Shoreditch, whereby the Poplar Mortuary situated in Poplar High Street was to be used as the main mortuary for the three boroughs, the Bethnal Green Mortuary being maintained as a reserve in case of emergency. The cost of the service is shared between the three boroughs. The arrangements, which were approved by the London County Council, came into operation on 11th August, 1954. The total number of bodies received during 1954 was 884. (Residents 308, non-residents 576). Post-mortem examinations were made in all cases and inquests were held in 117 cases. Swimming Baths and Wash-houses. The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent:- Poplar Baths Vapour, Foam, and Slipper Baths, Swimming Pools. Bow Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Island Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Wick Lane Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Watts Grove Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Sophia Street Baths Laundry only. 27 Public Cleansing. The arrangements for collection, removal and disposal of refuse are under the control of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who has supplied the following information:- Refuse. During the year 24,479 tons of house, trade, street, gully, market and kitchen refuse were collected and disposed of at the controlled tip. In addition 17,485 tons of refuse from a neighbouring borough were also dealt with at the Council's Refuse Disposal Depot. Street Cleansing. Two mechanical sweeper-collector machines work in conjunction with the manual sweepers, and as required 3 watering machines are used for street watering. Gully cleansing. Four gully emptying machines have carried out 9,806 cleansings of the gullies during the year. 28 SECTION C HOUSING Details of new housing accommodation completed in the Borough during 1954 are as follows:- Poplar Borough Council 243 dwellings London County Council- Coventry Cross Estate 53 dwellings Devons Estate 23 dwellings The number of families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 31st December, 1954, was as follows:- Type of dwelling No. of Lettings Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,072 Post-war Council houses and flats 953 Temporary bungalows 530 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 26 1,219 37 TOTAL PROPERTIES 3,837 29 30 Certificates of Disrepair Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920 Certificates of Disrepair issued between 1st January and 28th August, 1954 No. of applications for certificates Number granted Number refused No. of applications for revocation of certificates Number granted Number refused 23 23 - 20 20 - Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954 Certificates of Disrepair issued between 30th August and 31st December, 1954 No. of applications for certificates Number granted Number refused No. of applications for revocation of certificates * Number granted Number refused (a) Dwelling houses which have been the subject of a notice of repairs increase of rent under Part II of the 1954 Act 107 107 9 6 (b) Dwelling houses which have not been the subject of a notice of repairs increase of rent under the 1954 Act but in respect of which permitted increases of rent are recoverable under Section 2(1) (c) and (d) of the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act, 1920 7 7 12 8 4 * Including applications for revocation of sanitary certificates issued under the pre-1954 Act procedure but still in force at 30th August, 1954. Overcrowding (Housing Act, 1936). Particulars of overcrowding and abatement of cases of overcrowding in the Borough during the year are as follows:- Number of cases reported during the year 40 Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year: Rehoused by London County Council 9 Rehoused by Poplar Borough Council 23 Number of persons concerned in cases rehoused 150 Closing Orders (Public Health (London) Act, 1936). No Closing Orders were made under this Act during the year. Two Closing Orders which had been made previously were revoked, the necessary works having beer carried out. Closing Orders (Housing Act, 1936). Considerable difficulty is encountered in dealing with underground rooms which do not in all respects comply with the underground room regulations made the Council. In the great majority of cases the rooms are defective in one or more respects such as the absence of site concrete and yet in many cases the rooms provide pleasant living accommodation which is often preferred by the occupants to rooms in the same house on the floor above. Almost invariably there is a certain amount 31 of dampness but whilst the rooms are in use this may be confined to a mere discolouration of a portion of the wallpaper and it does not have in itself any appreciable effect on the health of the tenants. Once the rooms are closed the ventilation is reduced and the dampness becomes much more serious, dirt and rubbish accumulates, the areas adjoining the underground rooms are neglected and the gullies become choked with leaves and rubbish; the general condition of the house is often far worse from a health point of view than when the underground rooms were in occupation. It has therefore been the practice to recommend that the Council should make closing orders in respect of underground rooms only when there are serious defects which cannot be remedied at reasonable cost and to disregard technical breaches of the underground rooms regulations so long as the health and welfare of the occupants is unlikely to be affected unless and until the house can be dealt with as a whole. Consequently the small number of cases in which closing orders have been made in respect of underground rooms as shown in the summary which follows does not give any real indication of the problem in the Borough. 32 Housing Statistics. 1.

Miscellaneous visits and inspections (not included above) made by the Housing Inspector during the year 129 34 SECTION D INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD The promotion of improved standards of food hygiene continues to engage the attention of the department. In addition to discussions on the subject in shops, factories, etc., addresses have been given at meetings of local trade and other organisations. Improvements have been made in many directions but without doubt one of the greatest problems lies in the retail market areas where street trading is permitted. Without discussing, in a general sense, the merits or demerits of street trading the sale of food from stalls in the open air is extremely undesirable, particularly so in street markets which are invariably dusty and untidy places as the result of the processes carried on by stall holders, such as the sifting of potatoes, trimming of greenstuffs, and the gutting of fish, together with the practice of depositing refuse in the roadway. Many of the stalls occupied by street traders are hired and are generally of the most primitive type. Even in those cases where canvas screens are fitted the temptation to raise them for the purpose of display frequently proves irresistible. Competition with the stallholder induces adjacent shopkeepers to extend the display of foods by opening shopfronts, a procedure which is followed by proffering 35 foods for sale on the footway and, in face of the challenge from the roadway, it becomes difficult to dissuade the shopkeepers from such practices. The practice of many shopkeepers renting the stall position outside their shops appears to arise more from a desire to protect themselves from outside competition than any other reason, since most of them agree that street trading in food is basically wrong and many have expressed their willingness to withdraw their stalls if their competitors would do likewise. It is difficult to see what hardship could be caused to anyone if the trading in foodstuffs from streets was either prohibited or strictly limited; the Saturday afternoon search along the stalls for a bargain in nylons or calceolarias may provide a certain amount of enjoyment but the hawking of foodstuffs is dangerous, vulgar and unnecessary. Food Premises. The number of food premises in the area by type of business is as follows:Manufacturing premises 41. (Confectionery 7: Flour millers 3; Edible oils 2; Ice cream 2; Wine blenders 2; Nut roasters 2; Grocery 3; Pickles 3; Spice grinders 1; Milk pasteurising 1; Pood dehydration 1; Meat products 6; Mineral waters 1; Sugar refiners 2; Bakers 3; Essences 1; Sausage Rusk 1).

A total of 681 samples of food were procured during the year by the Council's Pood Inspector. Of these, 563 were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination, the remaining 118 being sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service for biochemical or bacteriological report. Samples examined by the Public Analyst included a comprehensive variety of food. 79 samples were acquired formally and 484 informally. A total of 24 samples (4.3 per cent) were found to be adulterated. Details of the unsatisfactory samples and the action taken are shown in Table VI, on pages 40 and 41. During the year twenty-eight samples of sausages were purchased from different manufacturers, the makers in most cases being butchers. The meat content of pork sausages varied from 57.1 to 73.9 per cent, with an average of 66 per cent. Prices varied from 1/lOd.to 2/8d. per lb. with an average of 2/5d. per lb. In the case of beef sausages the meat content varied from 43.8 to 75.1 per cent with an average of 60 per cent. Prices were from l/6d.to 2/0d.per lb. with an average of 1/lld.per lb. One sample of Kosher beef sausage was charged at 4/- per lb. The Ministry of Pood drew attention to the possible use by certain orange growers of thioureaasa fungicide and stated that its useisopen to objection on the grounds of toxicity. Appropriate action was taken at the wharves and factories in the Borough and in addition samples were purchased of fresh oranges and products containing oranges such as essences and marmalade. No thiourea was found. 39 40 41 TABLE VI Sample No. ARTICLE RESULT OF ANALYSIS ACTION 20 * Coconut Ice Coconut rancid. Free fatty acid 10.6%.

The Council's Pood Inspector is called upon to pass judgment of fitness on great quantities of food. Frequently large and valuable stocks are involved. Among special lots of food examined during the year were the following:- Corned Beef . (Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations). ( 54,600 lbs.) All condemned. 5,654 lbs. destroyed. Remainder released for animal feeding. Glucose (Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations). (100,602 lbs.) 22,200 lbs. condemned and released for refining. Tamarinos. Wharf stock. (112,000 lbs.)

This summary differentiates only between canned food and others; foods preserved by salt, sugar, dehydration, etc., being included under the heading "Fresh Foods". Disposal of Unsound Food. The bulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned by the Borough Engineer's refuse disposal service. When suitable for animal feeding the food is collected and included with kitchen waste. Unsuitably packed and totally unfit foods are removed as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned, arrangements are made under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch, or manure making. -43- Milk Supply. All domestic supplies of milk are sold in sealed bottles or cartons bearing a designation. Except for very small quantities of raw Tuberculin Tested milk from Attested herds, all milk is heat treated. The Minister of Pood appointed the 1st October, 1954, as the date from which it was to be compulsory to use caps and covers overlapping the lips of containers of pasteurised milk. Prom the same date milk pasteurisers were required to put milk which was pasteurised into the containers in which it is to be delivered to the consumer at the premises at which it is pasteurised. Thus the practice carried out by some dairymen of purchasing pasteurised milk in bulk and bottling it on their own premises is now prohibited. Local dairymen had prepared themselves for the operation of this regulation and the change was made without inconvenience. Although a large number of shop keepers are registered to sell milk, the greater proportion of milk supplied to domestic consumers is delivered to the door through seventeen of the registered distributors. Two dairies in the Borough pasteurise over 189,000 gallons of milk per week; in the same period over three-quarters of a million bottles are filled. Milk produced from these dairies is distributed over some thirty to forty districts in the Greater London area. One of the dairies was sold during the year and the -44- purchasers have discontinued pasteurising milk at the Poplar premises, using them instead as a distribution centre for milk received in bottles and sealed churns. The Council is responsible for licensing and supervising the pasteurising process. Samples of milk have been taken from dairies, shops and deliverymen for the purpose of checking quality, purity and bacteriological cleanliness. Samples were also taken on delivery from supplies to schools. During the year 266 inspections were made of dairies and other premises from which milk is distributed. Conditions on the whole were found to be satisfactory. Registration and Licensing. For details of registration of dairies and distributors see page 38. Licenses issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949:- Sterilised Pasteurised Tuberculin tested Dealers 139 64 23 Supplementary 26 21 20 Pasteurisers - 2 - Milk sampling. A total of 73 samples of milk (70 formal, 3 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination. Two samples were unsatisfactory. -45- Satisfactory reports were received on 74 samples of designated milk (54 pasteurised; 11 tuberculin tested pasteurised; 2 tuberculin tested; and 7 sterilised) submitted to the Phosphatase, Methylene Blue and Turbidity tests as appropriate. Milk delivered to Schools and other London County Council Establishments. Of the 49 samples of milk taken on delivery at London County Council Establishments, 24 were submitted for chemical and 25 for bacteriological examination. All samples were reported to be satisfactory. Oxidising Agents. The Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, provide for the use of certain cleansing agents for milk containers and plant. All these products are required to contain a small percentage of sodium chlorate to act as a detector of the efficiency of subsequent rinsing. Ice cream. Close supervision is exercised in connection with the manufacture, sale and storage of ice cream. Premises, plant and refrigerators were kept under constant observation. Pull and free consultation has taken place between manufacturers and the Council's Pood Inspector on problems of production. Inspections are made of the vehicles used by itinerant vendors; vehicles have been stopped, stocks inspected, temperature of containers checked and samples taken. -46- A total of 68 samples were taken during the year. Of these 35 were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination by the Methylene Blue test. The samples were graded as follows:- Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 24 6 4 1 Samples falling into the lower grades were in each case isolated. The remaining 33 samples were examined by the Public Analyst under the Pood Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951. All samples were reported to be satisfactory and in most cases the quality was found to be far higher than the standards prescribed in the regulations. Imported Food. The Council is a specially appointed Authority under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations, 1937. Inspections are made of direct landings of imported foodstuffs at the Sufferance Wharves in the Borough. No prohibited meat may be imported into the country for sale for human consumption and no meat or meat products may be imported without an official certificate of inspection issued by the Country of Origin, and approved by the British Government. Detention notices were served under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations on 5 occasions, 4 in respect of food found to be unfit for human con sumption and 1 in connection with a meat product without an official certificate. -47- Foods for Export. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 39 inspections were made of foods exported from the district; 140 certificates of purity were issued. Inspection of Meat in Slaughterhouses. With the end of meat rationing in July the Minister of Pood ceased to be responsible for the slaughter of animals and private slaughtering was permitted to recommence. Slaughtering has taken place in one only of the three slaughterhouses licensed in the Borough and this was of the nature of an experiment. A number of problems, chiefly economic, appear to be hampering the small butcher who wishes to kill solely for the purpose of his own trade. Carcasses inspected: 6 sheep. Condemnations: 2 pairs lungs. Food Poisoning. Nineteen cases of food poisoning were notified during the year. Investigations failed to establish a specific cause in any of these cases. -48- SECTION E INFECTIOUS DISEASES The total number of corrected notifications of infectious disease during 1954 was 494 which was considerably less than the figure for the previous year and mainly due to the reduction in the number of cases of measles which were notified. Diphtheria. One case of diphtheria was notified during the year. The diagnosis was confirmed clinically but not bacteriologically and on investigation it was not possible to trace the source of infection. This was the only case of diphtheria confirmed in the Borough for three years and there is no doubt that this result has been achieved by the success of the immunisation campaign. There is however a tendency amongst members of the public to regard immunisation as of less importance now that cases of diphtheria are rare and it cannot be too strongly stressed that if a new generation grows up which has not been protected either by immunisation or as in the bad old days by actually contracting the disease there is a real danger of an epidemic of the proportions experienced in May 1934 when there were 650 cases in the Borough which caused 22 deaths and a very considerable amount of pain and suffering. -49- Immunisation is regularly carried out by the London County Council at Welfare Centres and at the schools and some immunisation is done by general practitioners but this cannot be successful without the co-operation of the public. Smallpox. No cases of smallpox occurred in the Borough during 1954 but there was one incident which may be of interest. On 10th February 1954 apatient was removed by ambulance to a general hospital in another Borough. On the 12th February the patient was diagnosed as suffering from smallpox and was removed to a smallpox hospital. Information was received that another patient had been transferred in the same ambulance on 10th February to a hospital in this Borough andhad been admitted to a general ward. The hospital was visited immediately and the patient who had been carried in the ambulance, members of the medical and nursing staff and other patients who might have been in contact with infectious material were vaccinated. After some days it was found that the diagnosis of smallpox in the original case was not correct and as a consequence no other cases arose but the very full co-operation of the hospital staff and of the officers of other authorities and bodies in checking what might well have been a serious outbreak is very much appreciated. -50- Poliomyelitis. Two cases of non-paralytic poliomyelitis were notified during the year but neither of these cases was confirmed. There were no deaths from this disease. Measles. During 1954 the number of cases of measles notified was 40 as compared with 780 in 1953 and 808 in 1952. Whooping Cough. There were 101 cases of whooping cough notified and of these 66% occurred in children below 5 years of age and 9% in children below 1 year. Tuberculosis. The following table shows the age and sex incidence of the cases notified.

During the first part of the year all bacteriological examinations for the Public Health Department were carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service at the Laboratories at the County Hall, S. E. 1. The service is also utilised by the general practitioners in the borough. Ambulance Facilities The provision of ambulance transport within the administrative County of London is the responsibility of the London County Council. Hospitals. There are three hospitals in the Borough - St. Andrew* s, St. Clement's and Poplar Hospital. These hospitals, together with the Poplar Chest Clinic, Wellington Way, E. 3., which continued to operate during the year, are under the control of the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. -54- Personal Health Services.

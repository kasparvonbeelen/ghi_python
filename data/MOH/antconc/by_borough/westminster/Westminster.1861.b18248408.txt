WES 9 The Board of Works for the Westminster District. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of ST. MARGARET AND ST.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes op St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, For the QUARTER ending 25tii MARCH, 1861, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to inform you, the Returns of the United Parishes continue to exhibit a fair average health; for although there is an increase in Deaths arising from Suicide, Accident, and Hooping Cough, no cases of either Fever or Small Pox have been recorded. The number of Births registered during the present Quarter has been 301 Males, and 315 Females, or a total of G16 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 295 Males, and 226 Females, or a total of 521 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 43 as arising from accident and as having occurred in persons belonging to other parishes, thus reducing the actual number to 478. The number of Deaths registered in 1860 was 485; and for the 10 years' average 480-6; thus showing a decrease of 7 in reference to 1860, and 2 in reference to the 10 years' average. 4 The following is a Tabular Statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex :— MONTHLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS.

The premises in Carpenter Street that were reported upon some time since, have been sufficiently repaired; and in those instances where overcrowding existed, the tenants have been removed: this is a source of considerable satisfaction, as it may induce other landlords, in similar cases, to adopt the same plan. A complaint having emanated from the authorities of the Guards' Hospital, respecting an accumulation of dust, I directed it should be immediately removed, and that any complaint that might arise from such a cause in future, should be immediately dealt with by the Nuisances Removal Committee. 5 An effluvium of an exceedingly offensive kind having been again detected arising from the gullies in Wood Street, Millbank Street, and Horseferry Road, similar to that which existed some time since, and which arose from a leakage in the liquor main belonging to the Chartered Gas Company, I immediately communicated with Mr. Evans, the Manager, and I have forwarded you Mr. Evans' reply, evincing the same desire, as heretofore, to use every endeavour to ascertain the cause, and remedy the defect, if any is found to exist. In order the more effectually to guard against any future accident, a new liquor main is to be substituted for the old. My attention has been specially directed to George Place, Vincent Street; where, upon examination, I found the majority of the inhabitants suffering from Low Fever—unquestionably dependent upon overcrowding and insufficient ventilation, but as the rooms were generally occupied by one family, I could not interfere farther than by having the houses thoroughly cleansed and whitewashed, and the ventilation as much improved as the circumstances of the cases would admit of. I am happy in being enabled to add, that these measures were sufficient to greatly improve the condition of the occupants, and that they have been gradually getting better; but in order to still further improve this Court, I would strongly advise that notice should be immediately given to the Owner of the Slaughter-house abutting upon the East side of the Court, that his license will be opposed upon the next occasion, in order that proper ventilation may be afforded to the houses on that side; and I would also further recommend that a railing should be substituted for the wall at the South end. Upon examining the houses in Vincent Street abutting upon this Court, I found underground dwellings were being occupied as sleeping apartments, contrary to the Act of Parliament, and directions were 6 therefore immediately given for the removal of the occupants : this has been done. I have likewise visited several houses in Cottage Place, Vauxhall Road, and found they required to be thoroughly cleansed and whitewashed: this has also been attended to. In Cottage Place, Ship Court, the houses are in a most dilapidated and filthy state, and the water supply is utterly insufficient, and from being contained in an open tub placed upon the ground, is in a condition not fit for human beings to drink. If it be possible in this instance to compel a continuous service of water, it would add materially to the health and comfort of the inhabitants, and the arrangement would be simple and inexpensive, by having a pipe placed against the back wall of each house, with a tap in either the yard or ground passage; a proper supply would thus be maintained at a less cost to the Water Company, and greater comfort to the inhabitants. During the past month, great confusion has existed in consequence of an accident to the Water Main ; this, however, is now remedied, and the supply is as usual. The houses in Leg Court, which are in a very dilapidated state, require thoroughly cleansing and whitewashing; and I would suggest that Mr. Rogers, the Solicitor, be consulted as to whether the disgusting nuisances that are nightly committed by depraved persons, cannot, by the interference of the police, be abated. Many other inspections have taken place, the particulars of which are to be found in the Inspectors' Books. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, BARNARD HOLT. 7 Ages and Causes of Death during the Quarter ending 25th March 1861. ST. MARGARET'S. Diseases.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 24TH JUNE, 1861, BY BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, For the QUARTER ending 24th JUNE, 1861, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to inform you, that the number of Births registered during the present Quarter has been 293 Males, and 279 Females, or a total of 572 Births; the Deaths for a similar period have numbered 255 Males, and 204 Females, or a total of 459 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 21 as arising from accident and as belonging to other parishes, which rcduccs the actual number to 438. The Deaths for 1860 amounted to 436; and for the 10 years' average to 417: if, however, 10 per cent, be added to the 10 years' average, as equivalent to increase of population, the numbers will be 458. The present Return, therefore, shows an increase of 2 in reference to 1860, and 21 in reference to the 10 years' average, without allowing for increase of population, but a decrease of 20 if population is accounted for. Thi3, however, cannot be considered as a satisfactory Return, and it therefore remains to be shown to what the present very large mortality is attributable. An examination of the Table appended to this Report, at once shows that this increase is mainly to be attributed to 4 Deaths arising as a consequence of the late prevalence of Measles and Hooping Cough; for whilst during the Quarter ending June 1860, the Deaths from Measles were 5, and from Hooping Cough 21, in 1861 they were from Measles 40, and from Hooping Cough 49; thns showing an increase as dependent upon these diseases alone of 63 Deaths. Taken as an isolated instance, no special provision is apparently necessary, beyond a caution to parents not to neglect the primary stages of either disease, but at once seek that professional assistance which, so far as these parishes are concerned, is amply afforded. The following is a Tabular Statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— QUARTERLY RETURN OF BIRTIIS AND DEATHS. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Corrected Deaths. Deaths in 1860.

Hospitals. Prisons. Bakracks. 36 Westminster 30 House of Correction 3 Wellington 2 Grenadier Gds. 4 Hyde Park 2 Scott's Fusileers 4 Coldstreams 3 The following Deaths occurred at the undermentioned ages: AboveSixty, 35—above Seventy, 15—above Eighty, 7—above Ninety-two 2. Since the last Report, a very great improvement has been effected in George Place, Vincent Street, by thoroughly 5 cleansing the houses and improving their ventilation; indeed no stronger proof can be afforded of such benefit than the immediate diminution in the amount of sickness which, at the time of my visit, prevailed among the inhabitants. In order, however, still further to improve this court, I would strongly advise that notice should be immediately given to the owner of the slaughter-house abutting upon the East side of the court, that his license will be opposed upon the next occasion, in order to secure proper ventilation to the houses on that side. I would also further recommend, that a railing should be substituted for the wall at the South end. By an examination of houses in Vincent Street, I found underground dwellings were being occupied as sleeping apartments, contrary to the Act of Parliament: there were also others in the immediate vicinity to which the same objection applied. The occupants are now removed. In Cottage Place, Vauxhall Road, the houses require thoroughly cleansing and whitewashing. In Cottage Place, Ship Court, the houses are in a most filthy and dilapidated state, and the water supply is utterly insufficient, and from being contained in an open tub placed upon the ground, is in a condition not proper for persons to drink. If it be possible to compel a continuous service of water, in this instance it would add materially to the comfort as well as to the health of the inhabitants; and by simply having a pipe running along the back of each house, with a tap in the yard of each, and in those instances where there are no yards, in the ground passage, a proper supply would be maintained with less cost to the Water Companies and greater comfort to the inhabitants. G Great confusion has been occasioned during the last week of the Quarter, in consequence of some accident to the Main; this, however, is now remedied, and the houses are supplied as usual. The houses in Leg Court, Peter Street, require cleansing and whitewashing, and as nightly nuisances are committed in this court, the police have been requested to interfere for the protection of the inhabitants. In consequence of the offensive escape from the several gully holes connected with the sewers, I have requested that the attention of the Sewers' Commissioners should be directed to the nuisance, and that they should be requested to use lime in the same manner as acted so beneficially upon a former occasion. All the houses in which Deaths have occurred from causes to a certain extent within control have been examined, and directions have been issued in those instances where it has appeared improvements could be effected, for whitewashing, cleansing, improving the ventilation, and strict attention to the sewerage. Much however must depend upon the habits of the people, which I am sorry to add are, in a great many instances, so thoroughly opposed to improvement and health, as to render it a matter of extreme difficulty to effectually carry out those measures which would otherwise be attended with the best results. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, BARNARD HOLT. 7 Ages and Causes of Death during the Quarter ending 24th June 1861. ST. MARGARET'S. Diseases.

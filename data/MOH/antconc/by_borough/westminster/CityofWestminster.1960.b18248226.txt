To the Right Worshipful The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the City of Westminster. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I have the honour to present for your consideration a report on the health of the City of Westminster during the year 1960. This is the first report which I have been privileged to submit to you; and as I did not take up my duties until 17th June, 1960, it is right that I should acknowledge that much of the work of the Public Health Department during the year was carried out under the direction of my predecessor, Dr. J. A. Struthers, or had been initiated by him before his retirement. The report follows again this year the general pattern established many years ago by former Medical Officers of Health of Westminster. An examination of the vital statistics on page 14 reveals little change from last year. The population has again declined by almost two thousand. The Preliminary Report of the 1961 Census reveals that since 1951, in spite of an increase of more than five thousand private dwellings (5,723 = +23.4 per cent.), the population of Westminster has decreased by over thirteen thousand persons (13,825 = -14 per cent.). This is, indeed, the largest decrease of any of the metropolitan boroughs; and is equal to the population of a small town. Whether this decline will continue remains to be seen, but it is pleasing to note that during 1960 there were again more births than deaths, reversing the trend of the two previous years. I have included in the report this year the adjusted Birth and Death Rates. These are arrived at by applying area comparability factors, supplied by the Registrar General, to compensate for variations in the age and sex composition of the population from district to district. The adjusted rates can therefore be compared directly with similarly adjusted rates for other districts and with those for England and Wales as a whole. (23747) A 3 8 There was, unfortunately, one maternal death during the year due to sepsis following an abortion. It is, however, some consolation to realise that such an event is now sufficiently rare to merit individual comment. There were no serious outbreaks of infectious disease in the City during 1960. Notifications of dysentery were higher than in 1959, but it was a year when measles cases were few and only one case of poliomyelitis occurred. There were no deaths from any notified case of infectious disease. Every year numbers of travellers arrive in Westminster from countries where smallpox is endemic. It is a tribute to the international arrangements for notification and the vigilance of the Port Health Authorities that, whenever exposure to infection by a known case of the disease has been established, the Public Health Department is informed, so that the contacts may be vaccinated and kept under surveillance during the incubation period. Unfortunately, however, it can happen that the infecting case is not recognised or that the exposure occurs in such a way that the contacts cannot be traced. Under these circumstances, it is possible at any time for a person who has been unwittingly infected to arrive in this country and move about quite freely until increasing illness causes him to seek medical advice. On page 22 details are given of such a case which was discovered in the Casualty Department of a local hospital in October. Although no other case of smallpox has been notified in Westminster since 1942, the fact that the disease has again appeared serves to emphasise the continued need for vaccination as a protective measure in these days of high speed travel between the Far Eastern Countries and the United Kingdom. The shortage of Public Health Inspectors continued throughout the year; at no time were there less than five vacancies, and for a short period, there were only fourteen posts filled out of an establishment of twenty inspectors. This is reflected here and there in the statistics where the number of inspections has decreased compared with the previous year. In order to overcome some of the difficulties caused by the shortage of Public Health Inspectors, the Council, in April 1960, authorised the employment of three assistants, holding suitable qualifications in building, plumbing, food or allied trades, to help with certain aspects of the work of the inspectors. This has proved very successful and has enabled many of the routine duties, which would otherwise have had to be neglected, to be kept up to date. As a long term remedy, the Council had, in 1958, authorised the engagement of three suitable candidates for training as Public Health Inspectors, and, at the beginning of 1960, one such student was employed. He qualified in the Summer and is now working in the department. Fortunately it was possible immediately to fill his post in the student establishment and to appoint two other students, so that a full trainmg programme could be continued during the rest of the year. 9 The opportunity has been taken this year of including in the report a map (facing page 65) showing parts of the City where Smoke Control Orders are already in force, and the Council's proposals for the future. Good progress has already been made and it is hoped that the whole of Westminster will be smokeless by the autumn of 1965. To enter a new appointment and take over the administration of a department can be a difficult task. For me, it has been made easy by the willing help I have received not only from my colleagues in the service of the Council, but also from those working in general practice, hospitals and voluntary organisations. My thanks are especially due to the staff of the Public Health Department for their conscientious and loyal support. To you Mr. Mayor, to the Chairman and members of the Public Health Committee and to the members of the Council generally, may I express my gratitude for the kindness and consideration shown to me during these early months of my appointment.

It will be seen that the numbers vary greatly, and it is not yet possible to attribute the paucity of cases during the past few years to the effects of immunisation:— 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 1959 1960 21 16 29 13 1 10 9 4 15 7 5 1 1 1 (23747) A 6 22 Smallpox A Dutch businessman arrived in this country by air from the Far East on Monday, 3rd October, 1960, and proceeded to his flat in Westminster. In the afternoon of Wednesday, 5th October, 1960, as he was feeling unwell, and had a slight rash, he attended a local hospital. Here, in view of his symptoms and his recent journey abroad, it was considered that he might be suffering from smallpox. Your Medical Officer of Health was immediately called to see the patient, who was also examined subsequently by a consultant from the panel of experts designated by, the Minister of Health. As the possibility of smallpox could still not be excluded, the duty officer at the Ministry of Health was informed and arrangements were made for the special isolation hospital to be opened and for the patient to be admitted for observation. Next morning, a message was received from the Medical Superintendent of the hospital that in spite of the scanty nature of the rash, the diagnosis of smallpox had been confirmed on clinical grounds. Immediately a diagnosis was made, the Ministry of Health, the London County Council, the Medical Officers of Health of all the metropolitan boroughs, local medical practitioners and local hospitals were notified. From his arrival on Monday, 3rd October, until his admission to hospital on Wednesday, 5th October, the patient continued his normal business and social activities, coming into close contact with a very large number of persons, all of whom were considered to be at risk. An exhaustive search for contacts was put in hand at once, and 281 known contacts of the patient were traced by the staff of the Public Health Department; the majority of these contacts were vaccinated within the course of a few days at the Public Health Department, or at a special clinic opened by the London County Council at No. 1, Bessborough Street, S.W.1. In 12 of these cases, where the person had been in very close contact with the patient, injections of immune gamma globulin were given at a local hospital as an additional precaution. Out of the 281 contacts found, 164 resided at addresses outside Westminster and appropriate notifications were sent to the Medical Officers of Health of the areas in which the contacts lived. The remaining 117 persons were kept under daily surveillance for 16 days by the staff of the Public Health Department, which remained open throughout the weekends of 8th-9th and 15th-16th October, for this purpose. On Sunday, 9th October, it was necessary for the City Council's telephonists to be recalled to duty in order to man the main switchboards and deal with the large number of telephone enquiries being received in the Health Department. I am pleased to report that all members of the staff responded magnificently to the great burden of work which was suddenly thrown upon them. 23 Fortunately the infection was of a mild character and the patient made an uneventful recovery; no secondary cases occurred. No other case of smallpox has been notified in Westminster since 1942. Typhoid Fever One case of typhoid fever was notified during the year. The patient was a Turkish national, on a visit to London, and it was established that the infection had been contracted abroad. International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation Arrangements continued during the year for the authentication by the Medical Officer of Health of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation completed by medical practitioners in Westminster. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad from this country and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. 4,635 certificates were authenticated during the year. The Medical Officer of Health also issues, on request and in appropriate circumstances, certificates to the effect that no cases of smallpox have occurred in the district during the preceding two weeks. These certificates are sought by persons proceeding to the United States of America who do not wish to submit to vaccination. It is understood that the United States immigration authorities reserve the right to place such persons under surveillance notwithstanding the production of such a certificate. Infectious Diseases—Compensation for Stopping Employment Insured persons who are excluded from work by reason of having been in contact with an infectious disease, can obtain benefit under the National Insurance Act, 1946. This benefit in most cases is less than the normal earnings of the person excluded from work, so that some hardship has been occasioned in the past. Section 26 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, provides that if a Medical Officer of Health requests a person to discontinue his employment with a view to preventing the spread of an infectious disease, a Borough Council may, if they think fit, compensate such person for any loss occasioned by complying with the request. During 1960, compensation amounting to £9 8s. Was paid in respect of one person who was excluded from work.

In 1960 the mobile Units of the South West London Mass X-Ray Service carried out 79 visits in the City of Westminster, to x-ray employees of firms, organisations and Ministries, and the staff and students of Colleges and educational establishments. The total number x-rayed during these visits was 22,904, as a result of which 49 people were referred to Chest Clinics for further investigation. During the three months of April, May and June a Mass X-Ray Centre was open at The New Gallery, 123, Regent Street, and was attended by 13,518 examinees drawn from firms and organisations in the W.l. district. The number referred from this Centre, for further investigation, was 27. A Mass X-Ray Unit was also installed at the Board of Trade, Horse Guards Avenue, S.W.I, for three weeks, where 5,709 civil servants were examined, of whom only five were referred. The regular monthly evening visits to Bruce House, the London County Council Lodging House in Kemble Street, W.C.2, which began in 1958, were continued throughout 1960; 579 men there were x-rayed and 64 of them were referred to the Westminster Hospital Chest Clinic. Evening visits were also made to the Salvation Army Hostel and the Church Army Hostel in S.W.I. At the request of the Westminster Hospital Chest Clinic 13 visits were made to the Soho Ward to x-ray employees at hotels, restaurants, and cafes. In all, 3,000 men and women of many nationalities were examined during the survey, and a number were referred to the Westminster Hospital Chest Clinic who are preparing a detailed report of this special investigation, into tuberculosis amongst workers in the catering industry. Fifty-four firms and organisations in Westminster are co-operating in the attempt to afford soni" protection against the hazards of lung cancer by making it possible for their male employees to use the sixmonthly chest x-ray service for men over 45. Forty-nine visits to Westminster have been made in connection with this special service, in which are included visits to the Gatliff Road and Monck Street Public Cleansing Depots to x-ray members of the City Council's staff. Welfare of Old Persons Westminster Old People's Welfare Association This voluntary Association, whose members include representatives of various bodies interested in the welfare of old people, continued its activities in the City during the year. These activities include the organisation in various parts of the City of 14 Darby and Joan Clubs, 26 where light refreshments and recreation are provided; arranging holidays at seaside resorts, summer outings, Christmas parties, and other entertainments. Special outings and parties were organised during the year for handicapped old people, many of whom by reason of their infirmities, had not been outside their homes for long periods. The distribution of gift parcels at Christmas time was arranged; and also friendly visiting by voluntary helpers. The City Council, under powers conferred by the National Assistance Act, 1948, makes an annual contribution to the funds of the Association, to be used for work which comes within the scope of "Meals and Recreation." A chiropody service for old people has been in existence in Westminster for several years. During 1960, the service was considerably extended and is now grant-aided by the London County Council. Treatment is available at two clinics in Westminster or in the homes of housebound old people. The charge is 3s. per treatment but the County Council's scheme usually enables pensioners to obtain treatment free of charge. In 1957 the Association agreed to a proposal by the City Council to recruit on their staff a welfare worker with the appropriate qualifications, whose duties would include case-work with individual old people and the co-ordination of services provided by the various statutory authorities for the welfare of old people; duties which were formerly carried out by a Public Health Inspector on the City Council's staff. The welfare worker commenced duty in February, 1958, and the Council reimburses the Association annually the salary and expenses of the appointment, with the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, under Section 136 of the Local Government Act, 1948. During the year under review this side of the Association's work increased steadily. During 1959, the Association published a handbook setting out details of the services available in the City for old people, and other information likely to be of interest to pensioners. This handbook has proved to be of great assistance to all concerned and a second edition will be published shortly. Day Club for Handicapped Old People In February, 1960, the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association drew the Council's attention to the need for a Short Stay Home and a Day Club for handicapped old people in Westminster, preferably in the Pimlico area. It was felt that consideration might be given to the proposal to provide both these amenities during the development of the Lillington Street area but, as this would defer the matter for some years, and in view of the present need for a day club, it was decided that accommodation in one of the Council's blocks of flats should be adapted and allocated to the Association for that purpose. 27 The Association welcomed this proposal although it was stressed that there still remained the need for a Short Stay Home. Accordingly, the Council at its meeting on 15th December, 1960, agreed that the basement of Sherborne House, Abbots Manor, should be adapted for use as a Day Club and Luncheon Club for old people at an estimated cost of £4,000, and that a grant of £600 should be made to the Association for the provision of essential furniture and equipment for the Club on condition that this should be returned to the Council if it ceases to be used for this purpose. The Association proposes to use the premises as a Day Club for handicapped old people on three days per week (including the service of lunches which will be cooked on the premises) and as a Luncheon Club on two days per week. This latter proposal will necessitate the transfer from the British Red Cross Society to the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association of responsibility for the Luncheon Club at present run at Tintem House. The proposed Day Club will provide a club room, a warden's office, kitchen, bathroom, hairdressing and chiropody cubicles, together with lavatory accommodation, and the total estimated net cost of running the Club will be in the region of £2,000 per annum. The Association have stated that they could not contemplate an annual expenditure of the order of that indicated above, unless an assurance could be given by the Council of financial help. The City Council, therefore, informed the Association that favourable consideration would be given to annual applications for financial assistance towards the running cost of the Club. A Club for handicapped old people, of the character proposed, will cater for the recreational needs of a section of Westminster's elderly population for whom no provision has formerly been made. It is hoped that the Club will open in June, 1961. British Red Cross Society Mobile Meals Service During I960, the Westminster Division of the British Red Cross Society continued the service which it established in the City in December, 1946, for the delivery of hot mid-day meals to the homes of old people who are themselves unable to prepare meals at home. In June, 1959, in an endeavour to provide more balanced and nourishing meals for old people, the price paid to the caterers was increased from Is. 6d. to 1s. 10d. per meal and as a result the menus improved considerably. The price charged to the old people remained unchanged at 8d. per meal; in February, 1960, the London County Council's contribution was increased to 11d. per meal and the balance of 3d. per meal is borne by the City Council. 28 For the majority of the year the service was operated with two vans provided by the City Council and loaned to the Society on the understanding that they will be returned to the Council if they cease to be used for the service. The City Council also makes an annual grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the running costs of the vans. In July, 1960, at the Society's request, the City Council agreed that a third van should be purchased and loaned to the Society on the same conditions. The provision of the third van enabled meals to be delivered more frequently, particularly in the Soho area, and also extended the service to certain areas of the City not then adequately covered and in which there was a need for meals. The third van was inaugurated on 3rd October, 1960, and the number of meals rose steadily until at the end of the year an average of 440 per week were being delivered. It is pleasing to note that the provision of the third van has enabled this service to be brought to many more old people in Westminster. The number of meals delivered during the year reached a total of 16,558, the highest total since the meals service commenced in Westminster in 1946. The Mobile Meals Service is dependent upon the help of a small band of willing volunteers who turn out regularly, whatever the weather, to assist in delivering the meals to old people in their homes. The invaluable service rendered by the Society and the voluntary helpers is much appreciated by all concerned. Luncheon Clubs The British Red Cross Society, in March, 1957, opened a luncheon club for the elderly in accommodation on one of the Council's Housing Estates, a second luncheon club being opened in October, 1958, in City Council premises in Monck Street. Both clubs operate on two days each week, and have proved convenient centres where aged persons who are not housebound can have a hot meal at a modest price, and enjoy the company of others. The meals are purchased by the Society from the caterers who supply the meals for the mobile service, and are conveyed in insulated containers to the clubs, where they are served out by voluntary workers. As in the case of the " Meals on Wheels " Service, the price of the meals was increased in June, 1959, from Is. 6d. to Is. \0d. per meal; the old people pay 8d., the London County Council pays llrf., and the City Council bears the balance of 3d. per meal. The City Council also makes a grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the costs of running the Clubs, as well as bearing the cost of equipment. During 1960, 4,924 meals were served at the two Luncheon Clubs. 29 Aged Persons in Need of Care and Attention Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, a Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply to the Courts for an order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place, of persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from others, proper care and attention. Although several cases were investigated during 1960, it was not found necessary to use these compulsory powers. Aged and Infirm Persons Most of the visiting of the aged and infirm is done by the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association social worker. There are occasions, however, when a visit by the Public Health Inspector is required, either because he has specialist knowledge or because of his statutory powers. Forty-three such visits were made during the year. Mobile Library (Personal Delivery Service) Anyone unable through age or infirmity to get to one of the City Council's Libraries can apply to the Librarian at any branch of the Westminster Public Libraries to be placed on the list for the Personal Delivery Service. Each person using this Service receives a fortnightly home-visit from a qualified member of the Libraries Department. Books are also available at the Darby and Joan Clubs. Bathing Facilities The City Council has made available to old age pensioners facilities whereby they can have hot baths at the Council's public baths at reduced charges. Cleansing of Bed Linen of Elderly and Infirm Persons Facilities have also been made available by the Council for the cleansing of bed linen of elderly and infirm people when it has become fouled and unwholesome. Home Nursing and Midwifery Services In October, 1959, the London County Council submitted to the Minister of Health for approval amended proposals for carrying out its duties under Section 25 (Home Nursing) and Section 23 (Midwifery Service) of the National Health Service Act, 1946, whereby the County Council would assume direct responsibility for these services and no longer employ the staff of district nursing associations. (23747) a8 30 On the 17th December, 1959, the City Council expressed its disagreement with the proposals on the ground, inter alia, that any decision by the Minister on this matter should be deferred until the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London had made its report, and the Minister was informed accordingly. Subsequently a letter, dated 25th March, 1960, was received from the London County Council stating that the Minister had notified the County Council that he will defer making any decision on the proposals until the report of the Royal Commission has been received and considered. Health Education Section 298 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, provides that " a sanitary authority may arrange for the publication of information on questions relating to health or disease, and for the delivery of lectures, and the display of pictures (including cinematography displays) in which such questions are dealt with." In his Report for the year 1953, the Chief Medical Officer of the Ministry of Health stated.... " Progress (in health education) has now so far developed that there must be few public health departments in the country where health education receives indifferent attention Health education has come to mean something more than a subsidiary function and responsibility; it is now regarded as a primary activity of local authorities, which demands sound understanding and wise planning if it is to attain any reasonable measure of achievement " It is impossible for a local authority Department with a modest budget to compete with the high power advertising campaigns which are undertaken in the West End. It was, however, felt that some success in health education might be achieved by circularising posters and leaflets to all old people's clubs, youth clubs, Boy Scout and Girl Guide troops, and to various voluntary organisations in Westminster, for exhibition at their meeting places. The topic chosen in 1960 was a "Kill That Fly" Campaign, and the success of this small venture indicates that scope exists for further health education activities in the future, notwithstanding the competition which exists. The secretaries of the local Tenant's Associations, the local Chamber of Commerce and of the seven Street Associations, were informed of the Council's campaign and their co-operation sought. Whilst the majority of posters and leaflets were obtained from the Central Council for Health Education, it was found that no bookmark existed dealing with nuisance from flies. A specially designed bookmark was, therefore, produced by the Public Health Department and 20,000 copies were distributed through the City Council's libraries. 31 A letter was also sent to all food traders in the City, seeking their co-operation in the campaign. It was suggested that this could best be accomplished by making the public aware of the precautions which were undoubtedly already being taken at their premises to prevent the contamination of food by flies. Posters and leaflets were offered to the food traders, for display at their premises, and a large response was received, not only from national organisations, but also from small, local traders, requesting considerable numbers. As a result, the initial stock of posters and leaflets was quickly exhausted, and further supplies had to be obtained. A suggestion was made to the proprietors of all household goods and ironmongers shops in Westminster that the public demand for fly-killing insecticides, aerosols, and other goods used for protecting food against flies, was likely to increase as a result of the Council's campaign, and that consideration should be given to the arranging of special window displays, incorporating the Council's publicity material. Several dealers co-operated in the manner suggested, and a special display was also arranged at the Dry Rot and Woodworm Centre in Dover Street, W.l. With the kind co-operation of other Committees, posters were displayed wherever possible at the Council's establishments—public conveniences, baths, housing estates, offices, and at the Citizens' Advice Bureaux. So far as direct advertising was concerned, small advertisements drawing attention to the campaign were inserted in six consecutive weekly issues of the West London Press, and the Westminster and Pimlico News. An endeavour was also made to obtain a poster site at one of the London Transport Executive's Underground Stations in Westminster, but unfortunately the rental required for a site was prohibitive. Altogether, 200 double-crown posters (size 20 in. by 30 in.), 2,500 leaflets, and 20,000 bookmarks, were distributed in connection with the campaign. In addition, the City Council co-operated with the London County Council in regard to health education and during November, 1960, distributed publicity material relating to Home Safety throughout Westminster.

Progress is as follows:— Houses 1. As a result of statutory action by Council— (a) Houses demolished 50 (b) Houses subject to orders prohibiting their use for any purpose other than a purpose approved by the Council 2 2. Houses included in compulsory purchase order submitted by Council for confirmation and Minister's decision awaited before demolition can proceed 13* 3. Houses rendered fit for human habitation by owners since date of preliminary survey 3 Total 68 (Note.—* As a result of further inspections, another four houses not shown in this Table were included in the order as unfit for human habitation, although they were not in the programme as approved by the Council.) 37 Although not included in the original programme, clearance area procedure was also initiated in respect of 128 houses, all in one area in Pimlico, which have now been demolished. In the aggregate, therefore, the demolition or closing of 180 houses has been secured since 1st January, 1956. As regards the delay in dealing with the remaining 53 houses and flats included in the current programme, which are in two areas in the northern part of the City, it was considered, as a result of experience, that the demolition of these groups of houses should, if practicable, be avoided until such time as arrangements can be made either for the owners themselves to redevelop, or for the City Council, through its Housing Committee, to erect new flats on the site. The Council is, therefore, exploring with the London County Council, as planning authority, the manner in which and the purpose for which these two areas, when cleared, might best be redeveloped and as soon as these discussions have been concluded it is proposed to make appropriate recommendations for dealing with the unfit houses and flats. Programme for 1961-1965. (a) Introduction—The Minister of Housing and Local Government requested in his Circular No. '2/60 (27th January) the submission, in pursuance of the Housing Act, 1957 (Section 2), of a further programme for dealing with houses which are unfit for human habitation within the meaning of the Housing Act, 1957 (Section 4), and which are suitable for clearance under Section 17 (demolition of individual houses) or Section 42 (clearance area procedure). In London, these proposals are required to be submitted jointly by the London County Council and the appropriate Borough Council. (b) Division of duties between London County Council and Borough Councils.—The City Council is solely responsible for the enforcement of the provisions of Part II of the Housing Act, 1957, relating to individual unfit houses. Whilst the Council is under no statutory obligation to rehouse families displaced from unfit houses as the result of action taken by it under Part II of the Act, it is the practice of the Council so to do in cases where the occupier has attempted but been unable to obtain other accommodation. The County Council and the Borough Councils possess concurrent powers under Part III of the Act for dealing with groups of unfit houses as clearance areas, i.e., areas to be cleared of all buildings. The local authority declaring an area to be a clearance area must accept responsibility for rehousing the families living therein. (c) Further Survey of Housing Conditions in Westminster.—A further survey of housing conditions throughout Westminster was carried out. As required by the Act, discussions were held with the London County Council upon the results of the survey and, with that Council's concurrence, 38 it was decided to submit to the Minister the further proposals set out in the Schedule below. The Schedule (which is in the prescribed form) indicates that during the five-year period commencing on the 1st January, 1961, it is proposed to deal with 87 houses and flats which are unfit for human habitation. This figure is made up of the 53 houses and flats carried forward from the current programme and referred to above and 34 houses and flats included in a programme for the first time. With the exception of two houses, all the premises are in the northern part of the City. (d) Rehousing of Families to be displaced.—The Housing Committee agreed to provide such alternative accommodation as may be nccessary for families who will be displaced, where the London County Council is unable to help with rehousing. Period 1961-1965. Housing Act, 1957—Section 2 Further Joint Proposals by the London County Council and Westminster City Council. Part I—The total problem:— (a) Estimated number of houses remaining unfit for human habitation 87* (b) Period in years which the Councils think necessary for securing the demolition of all houses in (a) 5 Demolition as result of action to be taken by L.C.C. by W.C.C. Part II—Action already taken:— Number of houses demolished or closed f ince 1st January, 1956, including unfit houses owned by local authorities and those in unfitness orders Nil 180 Part III—Further proposals for action in the next five years:— (a) Number of houses to be demolished in clearance areas Nil 86* (b) Number of houses to be demolished elsewhere Nil 1 (c) Number of houses to be patched and retained for temporary accommodation Nil Nil (Note.—*Includes 53 houses and flats carried forward from 1956/1960 programme). 39 Westminster (Dufour's Place, Broadwick Street and Marshall Street) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1959. Official representations were made in 1958 for dealing with 17 unfit houses within a site bounded by Dufour's Place, Broadwick Street and Marshall Street, in pursuance of the City Council's slum clearance programme, 1956-60. The houses were contained in two areas which were declared to be clearance areas; and on 13th March, 1959, the City Council made a Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of the properties Nos. 1-6 (consecutive and inclusive) Dufour's Place, 60-74 (even), Broadwick Street, and 7-13 (consecutive and inclusive), Marshall Street (including factory premises at the rear of 9-13, Marshall Street). The Order was cited as the Westminster (Dufour's Place, Broadwick Street and Marshall Street) Compulsory Purchase Order, 1959, and was submitted- to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. In September, 1959, the City Council was informed that three objections had been received by the Minister to the confirmation by him of the above Compulsory Purchase Order, and that a public local Inquiry into these objections would be held by the Ministry's Inspector at the City Hall on the 5th October, 1959, at 10.30 a.m. Further, the London County Council raised no objection under Section 30 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, to the demolition of No. 74, Broadwick Street, the birthplace of William Blake, painter, poet and mystic. The County Council requested, however, that the City Council should examine the possibility of preserving some of the features of architectural interest such as original doors, staircases and panelling in other properties included in the clearance area. Following the public local Inquiry, the Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on the 20th June, 1960. The Minister did, however, modify the Order in one respect, viz.: five buildings which it was proposed should be acquired, although originally erected as houses, were excluded from the clearance areas because, in the opinion of the Minister, the present user in each case is predominantly business and not residential. Rent Act, 1957—Certificates of Disrepair One application for a certificate of disrepair was received during the year. The conditions at the premises did not justify the issue of a certificate and the application was accordingly not granted. 40 Land Charges Act, 1925 The number of enquiries dealt with and reported upon was 3,149 relating to 4,590 properties. Whilst these figures indicate an increase of 139 on the number of enquiries dealt with in 1959, the number of properties to which these enquiries related was 844 fewer than in 1959. As in previous years, the enquiries related to outstanding statutory or informal notices, combined drainage orders, smoke control orders, applications for decontrol under the Rent Restrictions Acts, and certificates of disrepair. Additional questions appeared on many of the search forms, mainly in regard to any proposals for dealing with properties by means of clearance or re-development under the Housing Acts, restrictions on the use of underground rooms, and the suitability of premises for specific purposes such as catering establishments and workrooms. Assessment of Housing Priorities on Medical Grounds During the year, 78 applications for rehousing on medical grounds were examined, and recommendations were made for the guidance of the Housing Committee. In each case the precise medical condition and resultant disability were determined (frequently necessitating communication with the family doctor or with the hospital attended). Investigations concerning the present housing circumstances of the applicants were made by the Public Health Inspectors. Their detailed reports included a reference to the extent and nature of existing premises, and its adequacy for the number of persons accommodated; the sanitary and structural conditions; the risk of infection, and the existence of inconveniences, such as stairs, which might be prejudicial to the patient. On this information, an assessment was made of the degree of priority merited on medical grounds. Common Lodging Houses There are two common lodging houses for men in the City, licensed by the City Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. These common lodging houses have accommodation for 716 and 565 men lodgers respectively. Nine visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors to the lodging houses during the year. 41 Inspection of Factories, Workplaces, Shops, Offices and Other Premises (other than food premises) [####] Total Number of Visits[/####] Factories—Power 579 Factories—Non-power 143 Workplaces, etc 2,629 Offices 3,357 Shops (other than food) 767 7,475 Analysis of Inspections:— Complaints 411 Routine 1,581 Infectious Disease 23 Drainage 509 Outworkers Premises 93 Rodent Control 476 Sanitary Defects 5 Other Reasons 35 3,133 4,342 re-inspections were made following the above inspections.

Of this number 66 were reported upon adversely, representing a percentage of 4.28:— Ale, lager and stout 13 Baking powder 4 Bread and buttered rolls 8 Butter and peanut butter 41 Cakes, pudding and pudding mixture 79 Cereals 48 Cheese 6 Cocoa 6 Coffee, extracts and essences 27 Condiments and spices 34 Confectionery48 47 Cooking fats and oils 21 Cream 11 Custard powders, blancmange and jellies 26 Drugs 42 Fish and fish products 36 Flavourings and colourings 21 Flour 18 Fruit, canned etc., 29 Herbs and stuffing 13 Ice cream 93 Ice lollie 45 Jams, marmalades and preserves 41 Malt and Chocolate drinks 5 Margarine 9 Meat and meat products 30 Milk 400 Milk, condensed and evaporated 7 Nuts 3 Pickles and sauces 39 Pies and pie filling 11 Poultry 4 Saccharin 3 Salad cream and mayonnaise 10 Sausages 4 Soft drinks, cider, perry, fruit juices etc., 94 Soup and soup powders 12 Spirits 113 Spreads, various 10 Suet 5 Sugar 3 Tea 27 Vegetables, tinned etc., 15 Vinegar 5 Yoghourt 5 Wine 3 Miscellaneous 13 48 Samples submitted for chemical analysis on which the Public Analysts reported adversely, included the following:— Consignments of imported apples affected with oil taint. Some 3,000 cases were involved. Ozonation treatment was carried out for a week, and the taint disappeared. A consignment of imported plastic-wrapped Bar-B-Cue chickens were affected with mould growth and had a very objectionable odour. The chickens had not been kept deeply frozen. A total of 116 chickens were voluntarily surrendered and destroyed. A bottle of cream soda was found to be contaminated with sulphuretted hydrogen due to the acid in the soda attacking the screw stopper, which was porous. The bottlers reported that some 10 million bottles were used annually, only three of which had been the subject of complaint. The use of cork crown closures was stated to be under consideration. Rolls spread with margarine, instead of butter, resulted in legal proceedings being taken against a restaurant company. A fine of 40s. and £5 5s. costs were imposed. A chocolate gateau purchased by a member of the public had a peculiar taste, and on analysis, the cake was found to contain an excessive amount of salt. It was not possible to determine how this occurred. Imported smoked salmon mayonnaise in tubes was found to contain a prohibited preservative. Arrangements were made by the wholesaler for the consignment to be re-exported. Glace cherries on sale during the Christmas period were found on analysis to contain benzoic acid, a prohibited preservative. On bringing the matter to the notice of the retail company concerned, all stocks were withdrawn from sale. Various other samples were reported on adversely due to deterioration in stock, faulty processing or packing, or for labelling offer ees. In addition, some of these included contraventions under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, and the Public Health (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations, 1925. Appropriate action was taken in each case. During the year a number of complaints were received from members of the public alleging that foodstuffs purchased by them were unfit for consumption or contained foreign matter. Investigations were carried out in each case and appropriate action was taken where necessary. The following cases are of interest, the latter two resulting in legal proceedings:— (1) A member of the public consumed ham and tongue sandwiches purchased from a large food store in Westminster. The complainant stated that the meat had a peculiar tang, and that afterwards his mouth seemed dry and hot; later he suffered abdominal pain. 49 An uneaten portion of one of the sandwiches was submitted to the Public Analyst who reported that the ham in the sandwich contained 30 parts per million of nickel. The manufacturers of the sandwiches, a firm of considerable repute, conducted a very thorough investigation into this complaint at their laboratories. They were unable to find evidence of nickel in the meat, but did confirm the presence of a small quantity, less than 0.2 parts per million, in the bread and butter. No likely explanation could be made as to the cause of the contamination of the ham. The opinion was later expressed that the nickel may have been derived from the pickling injection needle and would be localised, and it was therefore unlikely that nickel would be found in other sandwiches from the same delivery. Some 1,000 ham sandwiches and 600 tongue sandwiches were served on the day in question, and no other complaint was received. (2) A small quantity of whisky remaining in a bottle was found to contain pieces of wood, wool and cotton fibres. The complainant was using the spirit for medicinal purposes; he noticed the "foreign matter" after he had consumed some of the whisky, and felt nauseated. The Public Analyst was unable to express an opinion as to how the extraneous material came to be present. The bottlers were cautioned. (3) Cold roast beef purchased from premises in Westminster was found later the same day to contain maggots. The purchaser complained to the Public Health Department and legal proceedings were taken against the retailer who was fined £20 and 7 guineas costs in respect of this offence. A further fine of £5 was imposed for failing to register premises used for the cooking of meat. (4) Foreign matter removed from a quantity of sugar was found on analysis to be mouse faeces. On receipt of the complaint an inspection was immediately made at the retail shop, where conditions were found to be unsatisfactory. Mouse droppings were found in close proximity to food. Legal proceedings were instituted against the Company responsible, and a fine of £25, with 10 guineas costs, was imposed in respect of the offence. Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960 These regulations amend and consolidate the regulations of 1955/1957 and became effective on the 1st October, 1960. From the 1st November, 1961, they will apply equally to food businesses carried on from homegoing ships and moored vessels. The principal changes include provisions relating to persons engaged "in the handling of foodNow included are those persons who undertake the cleaning of articles of equipment with which food comes into contact, as well as those who actually handle the food. 50 Apart from certain specified exceptions all food consisting of meat, fish, gravy or imitation cream or prepared from or containing any of these substances, or any egg or milk, when brought into any food premises, must without any avoidable delay, be raised to a temperature of not less than 145° F. or cooled to below 50° F. The new regulations relax the temperature control for the above foods brought to premises for almost immediate use, and extend the list of exempted foods in which the danger of rapid multiplication of bacteria is small. Vehicles used for food transport and delivery have been included in the provisions relating to cleanliness and condition; in addition, lighting is now required in the vehicle whilst it is being cleaned. The use of the driving compartment of a vehicle or stall for sleeping, is now permitted, provided that it is effectively separated by a division from the food compartment. The provisions regarding the "person responsible" have been widened. Action may now be taken not only against the person carrying on the food business, but also a manager or foreman who has control of food handlers. The person carrying on a food business is now made responsible for informing the Medical Officer of Health if he or any of the food handlers under his control is suffering from certain infectious conditions. Previous Regulations placed this responsibility on the occupier of the food premises or the owner of the food business. A "catering business" has now been clearly defined as a food business consisting wholly or partly for the supply of food for immediate consumption. Food Poisoning Twenty-three persons were notified as suffering from food poisoning during the year. Of this number, two were husband and wife who suffered a Salmonella typhimurium infection of unknown origin. A further twelve persons were patients and staff at a hospital. Investigations were conducted by the hospital authorities in co-operation with the Public Health Department, and it was concluded that the organism responsible was Salmonella Heidelberg, though the origin of the outbreak was not conclusively determined. Of the nine single cases notified, five were due to salmonella infection. In addition to the above, two outbreaks, involving 132 persons, were investigated, in which the causative organism was CI. welchii. During the enquiries it was established that, in both cases, the chopping boards at the individual restaurant premises had previously become infected with the organism, and these had contaminated meat later chopped on the boards. Even though contaminated, multiplication of the organisms to an extent likely to cause food poisoning would not have occured if the 51 meat, when in the process of cooking or re-heating, had been kept at a sufficiently high temperature. Both managements were advised of the vital importance of temperature control during food preparation, as laid down by the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, and of the necessity for frequent swabbing of cutting boards with a sodium hypochlorite solution. Three further outbreaks involving 11 persons were investigated. In no case was it possible to reach a positive conclusion. Prompt notification of an outbreak of food poisoning is essential if the cause is to be found. Delay may result in failure to obtain the specimens and food remnants from which the causative organisms can often be identified by bacteriological examination. It is for this reason that the Food and Drugs Act, 1955, imposes a duty on all registered medical practitioners to inform the local medical officer of health of any cases in which there is even a suspicion that food poisoning has occurred. Further, as previously mentioned, the Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1960, require a person carrying on a food business similarly to notify the medical officer of health in respect of any food handler who is suffering from, or is a carrier of, certain infectious diseases. Arsenic in Food (Amendment) Regulations, 1960 These regulations came into effect on 14th December, 1960, and increased from 2.0 to 5.0 parts per million the maximum amount of arsenic permitted in brewers' yeast intended for use by manufacturers in the production of yeast products. The limit for all other yeast and yeast products remains at 2.0 parts per million. The proportions of arsenic permitted in manufactured foods are set out in the Arsenic in Food Regulations, 1959. Codes of Practice—Fish Two Food Hygiene Codes of Practice were published during the year and were issued jointly by the Minister of Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Codes were entitled " Hygiene in the retail fish trade " and " The hygienic transport and handling of fish." Copies were sent by the City Council to all fishmongers in Westminster, with a request that the contents of the publications should be brought to the attention of those concerned with the handling of fish and its transport. This follows the practice introduced last year when Codes of Practice were issued in respect of butchers' shops, and copies were sent to each butcher in Westminster. 62 Meat (Staining and Sterilisation) Regulations, 1960 These regulations came into effect on the 1st November, 1960, and require all butcher's meat and imported meat which is unfit for human consumption to be sterilised, and knacker's meat to be stained or sterilised before entering the chain of distribution. Zoos, menageries and other similar organisations may obtain meat untreated provided it is transported in locked containers and vehicles. The regulations do not apply to supplies of meat to establishments such as hospitals, veterinary schools, etc., where instructional or diagnostic work is performed, or manufacturing chemists where the manufacture of pharmaceutical products is undertaken. There is no slaughterhouse or knacker's yard in Westminster. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment Etc.,) Regulations, 1959 During the year, 108 samples of ice cream were submitted for examination by the methylene blue test, and were classified in the following provisional grades as recommended by the Minister of Health:— Grade No. of Samples 1 60 2 27 3 10 4 11 Of the samples placed in Grades 3 and 4, which collectively number 21, eight were from the same manufacturer. Four shewed a plate count of more than 10,000 cols/ml. which indicated a degree of contamination. The premises of this manufacturer are not in Westminster; the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough concerned was informed of these unsatisfactory samples, and appropriate action was taken by him. The products of this manufacturer will be kept under close review in 1961. The total number of Grade 1 and 2 samples obtained, namely 87, can be considered an indication of the general satisfactory standard maintained in the manufacture of ice cream. In all, various products of 16 different manufacturers were examined. Ice Lollies Thirty six samples of ice lollie were taken during the year and submitted for bacteriological examination. All were reported to be of satisfactory standard. These lollies are made in two varieties: (i) those which contain only fruit flavouring, sweetening, colouring and water, and (ii) those w hich contain ice cream in addition to the flavouring, sweetening, colouring and water. 53 Those in category (i) have had in all samples so far examined a degree of acidity in which germs of disease will not grow, whereas those in (ii) are not so acid, and in consequence are more likely to be a potential vehicle for infection. All samples were also submitted for chemical analysis, and in every case the quality was reported to be satisfactory. There is only one manufacturer of ice lollies in AVestminster. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations, 1960 These Regulations came into force on the 1st October, 1960, and consolidated and re-enacted with amendments the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1954, and the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949 to 1953. The principal changes so far as the City Council is concerned relate to the simplified licensing procedure, which, from 1st January, 1961 authorises in a single form of licence the sale of "designated" milks obtained by dealers in the container in which it is supplied to the consumer. The licence is for five years from the 1st January, and permits the sale of milk both inside as well as outside the area of a licensing authority. Other forms of licence are specified where pasteurisation and sterilisation of milk is carried out at the distributor's premises, and where raw tuberculin tested milk is obtained for re-sale. Conditions laid down under previous regulations for the Methylene Blue test for tuberculin tested milk and pasteurised milk have been modified and a new phosphatase test for pasteurised milk is prescribed. A revision of the sampling procedure now requires containers to be resealed after sampling has been carried out. There are no milk pasteurisation or sterilisation plants in Westminster. Milk (Special Designation) Regulations The following licences authorising the sale of designated milks were issued during 1960:— Dealers' Licences Dealers' Supplementary Licences Pasteurised 123 43 Sterilised 95 44 Tuberculin Tested 92 42 Milk and Dairies (General) Regulations, 1959 At the 31st December 1960, the following were entered in the City Council's Register of Dairies and Distributors of Milk:— Distributors of milk with premises registered as dairies 31 Distributors of milk with premises not registered as dairies 90 54 Bacteriological Examination of Milk During the year 34 samples of milk were submitted for methylene blue and phosphatase test. The results shewed that the milk had been efficiently pasteurised. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 8 The following table shews the amount of food surrendered as unfit for human consumption during the year:— Amount surrendered Tons Cwts. Lbs. Canned food 12 17 64 Meat 1 16 71 Fruit and vegetables 267 17 57 Fish 2 0 101 Cereals — 6 73 Confectionery — — 11 Fats — 3 37 Miscellaneous — 6 60 285 9 26 55 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 Persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List numbered 139 at 31st December, 1960. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Five licences were issued by the Council during the year in relation to premises subject to the provisions of this Act. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933—Slaughterman's Licences The Council during the year granted Slaughterman's licences to 21 men who had been accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to act as their inspectors in different parts of the country. These licences are required to be held by the pupils while undergoing training in humane slaughtering as part of the course for appointment as inspectors of the R.S.P.C.A. Sanitary Conveniences—Provision at Inns, Refreshment Houses, Etc. Under Section 25 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1959, a Borough Council may require the owner or occupier of any Inn, Refreshment House or place of public entertainment (not coming within certain exempted classes of premises listed below), to provide and maintain in a suitable position a reasonable number of sanitary conveniences for use of persons frequenting the premises. If necessary the Borough Council may, by agreement, execute at the expense of the owner or occupier, such works as are necessary and recover the costs, in the manner laid down in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1951. The classes of premises which are exempted are as follows: — (a) those in respect of which a licence is in force under the Disorderly Houses Act, 1751, or the Cinematograph Acts, 1909 and 1952 ; (b) premises licensed for the consumption of intoxicating liquor on the premises; (c) premises licensed for the public performance of stage plays; (d) premises forming part of railway stations. It was not necessary for any notices to be served under this Section during 1960. 56 Public Health (London) Act, 1936 London County Council (Drainage) Byelaws, 1934 Drainage Drainage plans submitted 513 Combined drainage orders made 34 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 Rats and Mice Repression Complaints received 776 Treatments undertaken 812 Inspections by Public Health Inspectors and Rodent Officer 2,892 Notices served - Rodents destroyed Black Rats 1,158 Brown rats 2,893 Mice 5,314 9,365 Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951 Under the provisions of this Act, various types of premises concerned with the upholstery trade or with the provision of materials for that trade must be registered or licensed with the local authority. At the end of the year, seven premises were on the register; one licence was issued for the use of premises for storage purposes. Noise Nuisance Complaints received 37 Investigations made 72 During 1960 complaints were received of noise caused by the following: Pneumatic drills and compressors, building works, power machines (printing works, electric transformers, etc.) refrigeration and airconditioning plant, hammering and banging, motor-powered hoist, cranes, milk floats and carts in the early hours of morning, dustmen, cars and motor cycles, radios, jazz bands rehearsing, night school, church hall, club members, and chickens. 57 Complaints relating to noise and vibration (except that caused byaircraft) may now be dealt with under the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, which has extended the powers previously conferred on London local authorities by section 66 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1937. For many years, under common law, householders have been able to take action against a maker of a noise if at least ten householders were affected. The new Act reduces this number to three. Section 2 of the Act deals with the operation of loudspeakers on the highway. With certain exceptions, loudspeakers shall not be used between the hours of nine in the evening and eight the following morning for any purpose, and at any time for the purpose of advertising any entertainment, trade or business. The exceptions listed relate to loudspeakers used for police, fire brigade or ambulance purposes, communicating with a vessel, announcements in connection with a transport undertaking, etc. The use of musical " chimes " or similar noise to advertise the sale of " a perishable commodity " (such as ice cream) is restricted to between noon and seven o'clock in the evening. Dust Nuisances London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1960. Under Section 14 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1960, the provisions of Section 82 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 (which prescribes nuisances which may be dealt with summarily) are extended to include "any dust or other airborne particles caused by any trade business process or manufacture and being a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health." It is a defence in any proceedings that having regard to cost and to local conditions and circumstances, the best practicable means have been taken for preventing or for counteracting the effect of such dust or airborne particles. A sanitary authority may not institute proceedings under the above Act without the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government if proceedings coidd be taken under the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Act, 1906. During the year it was not necessary for any notices to be served under Section 14 of the above Act. In Westminster, the London County Council Byelaw, No. 2671, relating to dust nuisance from the demolition of buildings, is administered by the City Engineer. During the year notifications concerning this type of nuisance were forwarded to him on several occasions and the necessary action was taken by his department. 58 Battersea'Power Station Further emissions from the chimneys of Battersea Power Station were observed from time to time during the summer months which indicated that gas washing was not being carried out in accordance with the condition imposed upon the operation of the Station, namely, that the Central Electricity Generating Board should " use continuously the most efficient methods which might for the time being be reasonably practicable for the elimination of smoke and grit and the prevention of the discharge of sulphur and its compounds into the atmosphere." There are four separate gas washing plants at the Station and it is understood that the Board's programme is for one plant to be overhauled each year, the work being scheduled to be carried out as far as possible during the summer months when the load on the Station is at a minimum and the atmospheric conditions are more favourable for the rapid dispersal of chimney gases; but it would appear that on occasion when a gas washing plant is out of action for overhaul, smoke is emitted unwashed. It was apparent, therefore, that the Board was not carrying out its obligation to wash the gases before emission at all times, and the Council at its meeting on 10th November, 1960, agreed that representations should be made to the Minister of Power seeking his assistance in obtaining a stricter adherence by the Board to its obligation. Accordingly, a communication was addressed to the Minister of Power: (i) pointing out that when periodical maintenance works were carried out at either "A" or "B" section of Battersea Power Station, it was evident that the Central Electricity Generating Board was failing to comply with the conditions imposed by the Minister upon the operat ion of the Station due to the fact that the Board has not installed stand-by gas washing plant; and (ii) requesting the Minister to consider requiring the Board to take that, when maintenance works are in progress at either section of the Station which could result in the emission of any unwashed gases, the power output of the Station is kept at such a level as will be within the limit of effective operation of the usable gas washing plant. The London County Council and the Battersea, Chelsea and Kensington Borough Councils, who had joined with the Council on previous occasions in making representations about the operation of Battersea Power Station, were also invited to support the request in (ii) above. 59 Fulham Power Station From the time of its erection until the outbreak of war, washing of flue gases was carried out at this station, but was not recommenced afterwards. On the 28th April, 1960, the Council was informed that the Central Electricity Generating Board had applied to the Minister of Power to be relieved of the condition imposed by the Electricity Commissioners in 1931 that its predecessors should use at the Fulham Power Station continuously the most efficient methods which might for the time being be reasonably practicable for the prevention of the discharge of sulphur and its compounds into the atmosphere. The Council decided to inform the Minister that, although it raised no objection to the grant ing of the Board's application that it should not be required to resume gas washing at the Station, it hoped that the Minister would take all possible steps to obtain the closing down of the Station in a shorter period than that at present envisaged by the Board. Subsequently a letter, dated 21st September, 1960, was received from the Minister of Power stating that he had decided to grant the application made by the Board. After consulting the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Minister of Works he had reached the conclusion that, in view of the fairly rapid decrease which is expected in the Station's coal consumption and consequent sulphur emission, he would not be justified in re-imposing a requirement which had been in abeyance for nearly twenty years and would involve a very heavy expenditure. He further stated, however, that as a result of special representations by the London County Council, he would, in consultation with the Minister of Housing and Local Government, keep under review the extent to which Electricity Generating Stations may contribute to air pollution in the County of London with a view to taking such action as may appear to be practicable and desirable. 60 Atmospheric Pollution Investigation into the atmospheric pollution in the City was continued during the year at three sites, Mayfair, Pimlico and Charing Cross, where deposit gauges, which measure the deposited pollution, and lead peroxide cylinders, which measure the sulphur activity, are sited.

Accordingly, in 1930, an atmospheric pollution measuring apparatus was installed in Westminster, and the results obtained have been regularly reported to the Public Health Committee since that date. In 1960 the City Council felt that it would be useful if additional information were obtained concerning the pollution of the atmosphere, particluarly in the Pimlico area. A further atmospheric pollution measuring apparatus was, therefore, purchased and installed in April, 1960, on the top of a block of flats in Churchill Gardens. 61 62 The results obtained from the two sites are as follows:— Month S02 parts per million Daily Average Monck Street Churchill Gardens January .140 — February .122 — March .128 — April .082 .053 May .093 .080 June .061 .063 July .039 .039 August .045 .050 September .067 .069 October .092 .098 November .097 .078 December .144 .147 Smoke.

In January, 1959, the Minister of Housing and Local Government issued a Circular drawing attention to the fact that about half the smoke in the atmosphere comes from domestic fireplaces burning coal. The Minister expressed the hope that, although an encouraging start had been made by local authorities in using their powers to make smoke control orders, faster progress would be made, especially in "black areas". The Minister requested that Councils in "black areas" should consider their domestic smoke problem as a whole; decide on the smoke control orders that would be required, and the order in which they should be made; and assess how many years it would take to complete the work. Local authorities were also asked to prepare a phased programme for establishing smoke control areas over the ensuing five years. Accordingly, the City Council at its meeting on 30th April, 1959, approved a programme which provides for the whole of Westminster to be covered by operative smoke control orders by 1st October, 1965. Three Smoke Control Orders are now in operation in Westminster, covering some 350 acres of the City; two further Orders covering 409 acres, have been made and confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government, and will come into operation on 1st October, 1961. Details of the approved programme, and a map of the proposed Areas are set out on page 65 of this report. In order to implement this programme, two Technical Assistants were appointed to the staff of the Public Health Department, to assist in the routine survey of premises. The success of the programme will depend on the ability of local builders to undertake in a relatively short time the necessary conversions of fireplaces and ancillary works; and subsequently on the availability of 64 suitable smokeless fuels. An assurance has been given on behalf of the Government that all possible steps will be taken to increase the output of smokeless fuels to meet the increased demands for them. Grants towards adaptations or alterations Owners or occupiers of domestic premises in a Smoke Control Area may apply for a grant towards the cost of any necessary alterations or adaptations to their existing equipment, to enable them to use an authorised fuel. The work must have the approval of the City Council and the expense must be incurred after the confirmation of the order but before it comes into operation. The amount of grant which can be claimed is 70 per cent, of the total cost incurred; forty per cent, of this total is subsequently recoverable by the local authority from the Central Government. Smoke Control (Exempted Fireplaces) Order, 1959 This Order came into operation in July, 1959, and exempts from the provisions of Section 11 of the Clean Air Act (the Section which provides for the designation of Smoke Control Areas) those furnaces installed after 31st December, 1956, which are equipped with mechanical stoking apparatus but do not burn pulverised fuel, as long as they are operated and maintained so as to minimise the emission of smoke and burn the fuel for which they were designed. Two proprietary types of appliances are granted similar exemption under the Order, namely the solid fuel "Ductair " unit, and the" Fulgora " slow combustion stove (used for burning wood shavings, etc.). It was recommended that mechanically stoked furnaces capable of working as smokelessly as those exempted by the Order but which were installed before 31st December, 1956, should be exempted individually on similar conditions. Accordingly on 15th October, 1959, the Council made Orders varying the Temple Bar and Adelphi/Whitehall Smoke Control Orders, so as to exempt three mechanically stoked furnaces. Two such furnaces were exempted from the Covent Garden Order. During 1960, exemption was granted in respect of five furnaces at premises in the St. James's Area, and two in the Soho Area. London Building (Constructional) Amending Byelaw, 1960 During the year the London County Council byelaw under the London Building Act (Amendment) Act, 1935, and the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation and requires that every new building shall be provided with either such appliances for heating or cooking as are suitably designed for burning gas, electricity, coke, or anthracite, or appliances of a description exempted by an Order in force under the Clean Air Act. 65 Pollution from Oil-Fired Furnaces. One aspect of the atmospheric pollution problem which is causing concern in Westminster and elsewhere is the emission from certain oilfired furnaces of very fine soot and smuts which are produced when oil is burned in an atomised or mist form. Investigations are being made into this new form of pollution of the atmosphere. Smoke Control Areas The following information should be read in conjunction with the map on the opposite page.

At 31st December, 1960, eighty-five deep wells were in use. From eighty-two of these wells, the water is used for domestic purposes. Of the remainder, one supply is used for cooling purposes, one for stand-by in case of fire, and one for supplying boilers. During the year, 160 samples 'of water from wells in the City were submitted for examination; satisfactory reports were received of 96 bacteriological examinations and 64 chemical analyses. Public Swimming Baths (I am indebted to the Director of Public Cleansing for the following information) The City Council has three public baths establishments, at Buckingham Palace Road, and Marshall Street (each having two swimming pools), and at Great Smith Street, where there is one pool. The water for each of the swimming pools is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board and is continuously filtered and chlorinated (with modern equipment) at a rate of 25,000—40,000 gallons per hour, the whole of the water of any one pool being filtered and chemically treated in four hours. 67 Automatic chlorine residual controllers and recorders, which automatically adjust the chlorine content of the water to the requirements of the bathing load, have been installed at both the Buckingham Palace Road and Marshall Street Baths, and are the first of this kind to be used in any public baths in Great Britain. An independent firm of analytical chemists take samples (without notice) of water from the swimming pools each fortnight, and the bacteriological examinations show that the water is maintained in a high standard of bacterial purity and is in every respect suitable for swimming purposes. A further swimming pool of 70,000 gallons, which is available to the public but owned by a private company, is sited under a large block of flats within the City. The water is drawn from deep wells; continuous filtration through sand and chlorination is maintained during the time that the bath is in use, with a turn-over of four hours. Ozone treatment plant is also available. An independent firm of analytical chemists and bacteriologists take samples every week (without notice) and a high bacterial and chemical standard is maintained. There is also the Lido in Hyde Park, which is under the control of H.M. Minister of Works. Disinfection, Disinfestation and Cleansing of Persons— Arrangements with the Holborn Borough Council The arrangement between the City Council and the Holborn Borough Council whereby the latter undertook to carry out, on agreed terms, the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing of persons, and the provision of the necessary transport therefor, continued. The arrangement came into operation on the 3rd September, 1956, and is working satisfactorily with resulting economies to both Councils. The following is a summary of the work carried out for Westminster during the year:— Disinfection and Disinfestation Rooms Articles Articles Washed Books Disinfection 234 22,037 385 157 Disinfestation 611 2,501 — — 68 Cleansing of Persons Treatments Scabies Head Lice Body Lice Men 19 — 293 Women — 4 1 Children — 9 — Burial or Cremation of the Dead Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the duty of the City Council as a Sanitary Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or is found dead in the area, where no other arrangements have been made for the disposal of the body. The Council is empowered to recover the cost of burial from the estate of the deceased, and is eligible to receive payments in respect of the cost of such burial from death grants payable under the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946. Where persons without known relatives die in the City, it is frequently necessary not only to arrange for their burial, but to dispose of the contents of their homes. This is done in consultation with the Treasury Solicitor. Such action is necessary to enable the proceeds to be applied towards the cost of burial and also to avoid rent accruing and to release the accommodation for housing purposes as early as possible. During the year 41 burials were undertaken by the City Council in its Cemetery at Hanwell. The requests for the burials were received from the following sources:— H.M. Coroner 16 Relatives of the deceased 10 Hospitals in the City 12 Friends 2 Police 1 41 69 Coroner's Court and Mortuary During 1960, 279 bodies were received in the Mortuary on Coroner's Warrants, etc. Two bodies were admitted to await burial.

Coroner, were accommodated at the City Council's Mortuary in Horseferry Road whilst awaiting burial. The arrangement came into operation on the 3rd September, 1956; no bodies were received in the mortuary during 1960. 70 APPENDIX I FACTORIES ACTS, 1937 to 1959 Prescribed Particulars on the Administration of the Factories Act, 1937 Part I of the Act 1.

Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Herewith I beg to present a report upon the health and sanitary conditions of the City for the year 1957. I have the honour to be Your obedient Servant, J. A. Struthers, Medical Officer of Health. June, 1958. 10 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS.

Perinatal Mortality (stillbirths plus deaths in first week of life per 1,000 total births) 39.74 This figure is given for the first time in this report although it has been in use by the Registrar General for many years. The majority of infant deaths now occur in the first week of life and most of these deaths are due to factors operating during pregnancy and birth. These are also the factors which tend to cause still-birth. The Perinatal Mortality, which is the number of still-births plus the number of deaths in the first week ol life per 1,000 total births, is therefore an index of the total mortality due to factors arising before and during birth. Infant Mortality. Cause of Death. Total. Legitimate. Illegitimate. Pneumonia 1 1 — Gastritis, Enteritis and Diarrhoea 3 2 1 Congenital Malformations 1 1 — *Other Defined and Ill-Defined Diseases 16 10 6 Accidents (other than motor vehicles) 2 2 — 23 16 7 * This is the Registrar-General's classification; but such conditions as prematurity, birth injuries and other fatal conditions relating to the process of birth are included under this heading. The figures given above show that the infant mortality rate is composed of a rate of 16.8 for legitimate infants and 65.4 for illegitimate infants. The latter is unusually high and a further analysis has been made as below:— Up to 1 week Over 1 week up to 1 mth. Over 1 mth. up to 1 yr. Total No. Rate No. Rate No. Rate No. Rate Illegitimate 6 56.07 1 9.3 — — 7 65.4 Legitimate 11 11.5 2 2.1 3 3.2 16 16.8 12 It will be seen that the excess mortality among illegitimate infants occurred mostly in the first week of life. In two cases the absence of professional attendance at delivery probably contributed towards death, but exclusion of these from the figures does not materially alter the result. The deaths in the first week of life were due partly, or entirely, to prematurity or birth injuries, except for one legitimate infant who died as a result of an umbilical infection. This suggests that the high infant mortality rate for illegitimate infants was due largely to ante-natal influences. Infectious Disease.

No case of smallpox occurred in the City during 1957. There were as usual numerous cases of persons who had been in contact with smallpox— in most cases outside this country. The necessary preventive measures were taken. Influenza. Influenza was epidemic during September and October. The illness is not notifiable, but from conversations with general practitioners and other medical officers in the City it is apparent that the infection began among school children, spreading to the adult population after about two weeks. About 30 per cent, of the population appear to have been affected. In most cases the illness was mild; only 5 cases of confirmed influenzal pneumonia were notified. Seven deaths were registered as being caused by influenza. One was that of a young woman, aged 20 years, who died suddenly of influenzal pneumonia after an illness of four days. The other deaths were of persons aged more than 45 years. 15 Paratyphoid Fever. Two cases of paratyphoid fever were notified. Both were hospital nurses, but were not connected with each other. In neither case was the origin of the infection satisfactorily determined but in one case it was thought that the illness was caused by a recrudescence of a chronic infection acquired many years previously. As a result of information from the Ministry of Health it was discovered that eleven cases of paratyphoid fever notified in other parts of the country could be traced to a restaurant within the City. During the investigation a paratyphoid carrier was discovered among the kitchen staff. International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Arrangements continued during the year for the authentication by the Medical Officer of Health of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation completed by medical practitioners in Westminster. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad from this country and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. 4,084 certificates were authenticated during the year. The Medical Officer of Health also issues, on request and in appropriate circumstances, certificates to the effect that no cases of smallpox have occurred in the district during the preceding two weeks. These certificates are sought by persons proceeding to the United States of America who do not wish to submit to vaccination. It is understood that the United States immigration authorities reserve the right to place such persons under surveillance notwithstanding the production of such a certificate.

During 1957 mobile units of the South West London Mass X-Ray Service made 20 visits to the City of Westminster to provide chest X-ray facilities for the staffs of firms, and the staffs and students of four University Colleges and Training Colleges. The total numbers X-rayed were 15,277, and as a result of these visits 35 cases were referred to chest clinics with radiologically significant lesions requiring further investigation. From 4th March to 17th April a Mass X-Ray Unit was installed in the New Gallery Centre, 123, Regent Street, W.l, where 10,576 people, from firms and organisations in the W. 1 area, were X-rayed; and 33 of these were referred to chest clinics. From 26th April to 10th May a Unit was installed in Shell-Mex House; and employees of Shell-Mex and B.P. Ltd. and other firms in the W.C.2 area were X-rayed. From a total of 2,877 X-rayed 17 were referred to chest clinic. From 3rd June to 5th July a Unit was installed at the Board of Trade; and 7,851 employees of Ministries and Government Departments were X-rayed, as a result of which 27 were referred to chest clinics. A mobile Mass X-Ray Unit has continued to visit the Westminster Chest Clinic at 1, Ebury Bridge Road every Friday to pro vide, a service for doctors' patients, contacts, special groups, employees of firms in the S.W.I area and members of the public. 9,466 were examined, of whom 3,422 were doctors' patients. This has resulted in 93 cases being referred to chest clinics. Welfare of Old Persons. Westminster Old People's Welfare Association. This voluntary Association, whose members include representatives of various bodies interested in the welfare of old people, continued its activities in the City during the year. These activities include the organisation in various parts of the City of Darby and Joan Clubs, where light refreshments and recreation are provided; arranging holidays at seaside resorts, summer outings, Christmas parties, and other entertainments. Special outings and parties were organised during the year for handicapped old people, who by reason of their infirmities had not been outside their homes for long periods. The distribution of gift parcels at Christmas time was arranged; and also the visiting by voluntary helpers of the ailing and lonely in their homes. The Association also provides a chiropody service for the elderly. Treatment can be obtained at two clinics in the City, or at home. The charge is 2s. 6d. per tfeatment; the balance of cost, which varies from 3s. 6d. to 6s. per treatment, is borne by the Association. The City Council, under powers conferred by the National Assistance Act,: 1948, make an annual contribution to the funds of the Association. The Association during the year agreed to a proposal by the Council to recruit on their staff a welfare worker with the appropriate 20 tions, whose duties would include case-work with individual old people and the co-ordination of services provided by the various statutory authorities for the welfare of old people; duties which were formerly carried out by a Public Health Inspector on the City Council's staff. The Council reimburses the Association annually the salary and expenses of the appointment, with the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, under Section 136 of the Local Government Act, 1948. British Red Cross Society—Mobile Meals Service. The Westminster Division of the British Red Cross Society has continued the service which it established in the City in 1945 for the delivery to their homes of hot mid-day meals to aged people who are unable themselves to prepare meals at home. The service is operated with two vans provided by the City Council and loaned to the Society. The Council also makes an annual grant to the Society of 75 per cent. of the running costs of the vans. The meals are obtained from a firm of caterers, and are placed in individual containers and kept in heated chambers on the vans until delivered at the homes of the old people. The meals cost Is. 6d. each, and consist of meat, two vegetables and a sweet, or lighter diets for those requiring them. The old people pay 8d. for the meal and the London County Council bear the difference of 10d. Some 14,311 meals were delivered by this service during the year, with the assistance of the Society's voluntary workers. This invaluable help is very much appreciated by all concerned. Luncheon Club for Aged Persons. The Society, in March, 1957, opened a luncheon club for the elderly in accommodation on one of the Council's Housing Estates. The Club, which operates on two days each week, has proved a convenient centre where aged persons who are not housebound can have a hot meal at a modest price, and enjoy the company of others. The meals are purchased by the Society from the caterers who supply the meals for the mobile service, and are conveyed in insulated containers to the club, where they are served out by voluntary workers. The meals cost Is. 6d. each and the old people pay 8d. and the London County Council pay the balance of lOrf. per meal. The Club attracts between 30 and 40 people each day. The City Council make a grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the cost of running the club as well as bearing the cost of equipment. Aged Persons in Need of Care and Attention. Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, a Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply to the Courts for an order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place, of persons 21 who are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from others, proper care and attention. It was not found necessary to use these powers during the year. Aged and Infirm Persons. Number of aged and infirm persons visited by the Council's officers during the year 149 Total number of inspections made with regard to these 604 Primary 107 Re-inspections 497 Cases of aged and infirm persons brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health during 1957 107 In dealing with these cases, the co-operation of the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association, the London County Council's Home Help Service, both of which are accommodated in the Public Health Department, and the "Meals on Wheels" Service of the British Red Cross Society has been of great value. Mobile Library Service. The City Council provides a library service for the aged, and books are issued to them at Darby and Joan Clubs. For those who are unable to leave their homes, delivery is made there. Bathing Facilities. The City Council has made available to old age pensioners facilities whereby they can have hot baths at the Council's public baths at reduced charges. Cleansing of Bed Linen of Elderly and Infirm. Facilities have also been made available by the Council for the cleansing of bed linen of elderly and infirm people when it has become fouled and unwholesome. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933—Slaughterman's Licences. The Council during the year granted Slaughterman's licences to 13 men who had been accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to act as their inspectors in different parts of the country. These licences are required to be held by the pupils while undergoing training in humane slaughtering as part of the course for appointment as inspectors of the R.S.P.C.A. 22 Sanitary Circumstances.

(1) Number of new cases of overcrowding reported during the year 8 (2) Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year 14 26 Housing Act, 1957. This Act, which came into operation on the 1st September, 1957, repeals and re-enacts in consolidated form the provisions of the earlier Housing Acts, with the exception of certain financial provisions. The Housing Act, 1957, is divided into eight parts which follow generally the arrangement of the Act of 1936 with the necessary modification and expansion. Those of principal concern to the Public Health Department are Parts II, III and IV dealing with the provisions for securing the repair, maintenance and sanitary condition of houses, clearance and redevelopment, and abatement of overcrowding respectively. Section 4 of Part II re-enacts the definition of the standard of fitness introduced by the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, which listed the several matters to be taken into account in determining whether a house is unfit, and replaced the somewhat uncertain definition contained in the principal Act of 1936, now largely repealed. This definition is of prime importance in relation to all proceedings under Parts II and III mentioned above and, therefore, in relation to the repair, demolition and closure of unfit properties, as well as activities directed towards clearance and redevelopment of areas of unfit properties. In view of the very considerable number of closing orders that have been made in respect of basement rooms in the City, under the provisions of the Housing Acts 1930 and 1936, attention should perhaps be drawn to the comprehensive saving provision of Section 191 of the 1957 Act, which secures continuity of action by enacting, inter alia, that anything done under a repealed enactment shall have effect as if done under the corresponding provision of the new Act.. Rent Act, 1957—Certificates of Disrepair. The first application for a certificate of disrepair was made on the 14th September, by which time the Rent Act, 1957, had been operating for two months. This Act repealed the provisions of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, regarding these certificates. It enacted a new procedure for a tenant under a controlled tenancy who desires to resist an increase in rent on the grounds of the existence of defects. These he must specify, in a notice served by him on the landlord. If, after the expiration of six weeks from the date of service of such notice, any of the defects remain unremedied, and the landlord has not given an undertaking to remedy those defects, the tenant may apply to the local authority for a certificate of disrepair. 27 By the end of the year the position was as follows:— Part I—Applications for Certificates of Disrepair. (1) Number of applications for certificates 6 (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates 1* (3) Number of decisions to issue certificates:— (a) in respect of some but not all defects 2** (b) in respect of all defects — (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords — (5) Number of certificates issued 2 Part 11—Applications for Cancellation of Certificates on completion of work required. (6) Applications by landlords for cancellation of certificates 1 (7) Objection by tenants to cancellation of certificates — (8) Number of certificates cancelled *** * Work completed by landlord before expiry of time limit. ** Three further applications under examination at the end of the year. *** Notice of proposal to cancel certificate served by City Council on tenant. Time limit (three weeks) not expired at end of the year. Land Charges Act, 1925. The number of enquiries dealt with and reported upon during the year was 2,368 relating to 3,813 properties. These figures indicate an increase of approximately 22 per cent. on the enquiries dealt with in 1956. As in previous years, the search forms concerned outstanding notices under the Public Health and Housing Acts, combined drainage orders, and applications for decontrol under the Rent Restrictions Acts; and during the year an additional question regarding smoke control area Orders became a routine enquiry. Many of the search forms requested supplementary information regarding restrictions on the use of underground rooms, and the suitability of premises for specific purposes such as catering establishments and workrooms. 28 Inspection of Factories, Workplaces, Shops, Offices and Other Premises (other than Food Premises).

During the year, the following 1,540 samples were submitted to the City Council's Public Analysts for chemical analysis. Of this number 88 were reported upon adversely, representing a percentage of 5.71:— Ales and stouts 9 Biscuits 9 Baby food 16 Butter and peanut butter 19 Bread 4 Buttered bread, rolls, buns 15 Cake, puddings and cake and pudding mixtures 31 Cereals 17 Cheese and cheese spreads 13 Chicken, tinned, etc. 3 Cocoa 3 Coffee and coffee preparations 30 Condiments and spices 36 Confectionery. 76 Cooking fats and oils 23 Cream 12 Custard powders and jellies 51 Drugs 54 Fish and fish products 51 Flavourings and colourings 20 Flour 10 Fruit, canned, etc. 23 Herbs ... 7 Ice cream 79 Jams, marmalades and preserves 68 Malt and chocolate drinks 11 Margarine 16 Meat and meat products 48 Milk 401 Milk, condensed and evaporated 12 Milk powder 6 Nuts—walnuts, almonds, etc. 13 Pickles and sauces 36 Pie filling, pies and pastry mix 16 Saccharin 6 Salad dressing 14 Sausages 3 Soft drinks, fruit juice, etc. 84 Soup and soup powders 21 Spreads, various 10 Spirits 62 Suet 3 34 Sugar 4 Tea 26 Vegetables, tinned, etc. 36 Vinegar 8 Wines 2 Yeast extract 5 Yogurt 15 Miscellaneous 3 Thirteen of the adverse reports from the Public Analysts related to improper labelling of a minor nature, for which no prosecutions were undertaken. Fourteen samples were of food which had deteriorated as a result either of prolonged storage or of inefficient preservation. Two of these were meat products packed in transparent plastic containers. Many such packs are seen in this department and it would seem that although the method has many advantages, the technique has yet to be perfected. Four unsatisfactory milk samples were taken during the year. This is most unusual nowadays. Three samples were of hot milk which had been heated, and consequently diluted, by the passage through them of steam. The other sample was taken from a churn outside a restaurant. By mistake the wholesaler had delivered a churn of "Pasteurised Milk" instead of "Homogenised Pasteurised Milk." Shortly before the sample was taken, the cook had taken some milk from the churn and, not noticing the wholesaler's mistake, had failed to plunge the churn. Thus the cook skimmed much of the cream off the milk so that the sample taken by the Inspector (after plunging) contained only 2.22 per cent. fat. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 16. Registration of Premises used in connection with the Manufacture, Sale or Storage of Ice Cream. Two hundred and fifty-three premises were registered for the manufacture and/or sale and/or storage of ice cream. Registration of Premises used for the Preparation or Manufacture of Preserved Foods. Seventy-nine premises were registered for the preparation or manufacture of preserved foods. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947. Methylene Blue Tests on Samples of Ice Cream. Fifty-three samples of ice cream were submitted for methylene blue test. The samples were classified in provisional grades based upon the 35 method of examination as recommended by the Ministry of Health These were as follows:— Grade 1 36 Grade 2 11 Grade 3 4 Grade 4 2 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. The following licences authorising the sale of designated milks were issued during 1957 to Distributors of Milk registered with the Council:—- Dealers' Licences. Dealers' Supplementary Licences. Pasteurised 117 44 Sterilised 98 43 Tuberculin Tested 90 41 Milk. During the year 46 samples of milk were submitted for methylene blue and phosphatase test. The results received showed that the milk had been efficiently pasteurised. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949. At the 31st December, 1957, the following were entered in the City Council's Register of Dairies and Distributors of Milk:— Distributors of milk with premises registered as dairies 34 Distributors of milk with premises not registered as dairies 86 Distributors of milk with premises situate outside Westminster 49 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. Persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List numbered 157 at 31st December, 1957. 36 Food and Drugs Act, 1955, Section 8. The following table shows the amount of food condemned as unfit for human consumption during the year:— Amount destroyed. Tons. Cwts. Lbs.

Food condemned or voluntarily surrendered to the Public Health Inspectors is disposed of by depositing in the Council's refuse barges at the Central Depot at Gatliff Road, S.W.1. Foodstuffs disposed of at this depot are removed by barge for land reclamation by controlled tipping at Pitsea. No recovery or diversion of any goods whatsoever takes place at the central tipping site. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 26. The following return was made to the Ministry of Health in accordance with the requirements of Appendix D (I) of the revised Memo. 188/Med/49 giving details of food poisoning notifications received during the year and returned to the Registrar General. First quarter. Second quarter. Third quarter. Fourth quarter. Total. 2 9 11 2 24 Of those notified, 18 were individual notifications. Of the remainder two were children who were taken ill whilst on holiday and in consequence returned home. The notifications were received after their recovery. The other four persons, who were visitors to this country were taken severely ill following a meal of poached egg on rice with lobster sauce at a West End restaurant. The causative organism was believed by the bacteriologist to have gained access to the food from a milk product. Other instances of persons affected with food poisoning came to the notice of this department during the year. Eleven of such outbreaks were investigated and notified to the Ministry of Health. A total of 214 persons were concerned. These were generally employees of firms having premises in Westminster, or casual visitors to the City. 37 Each such outbreak usually involves much enquiry by officers of my department in an effort to trace the cause. Even should this prove unsuccessful, suggestions and recommendations can often be made to those engaged in the handling and preparation of food, or to those responsible for the maintenance of the premises, which may obviate or help to minimise the possibility of further outbreaks. As a result of these investigations, it was possible to give an indication of the probable causative organism in three of these cases, and confirm it in a further two.

The provisions of the Clean Air Act (Appointed Day) Order, 1956, brought into force on the 31st December, 1956, a number of sections of the Clean Air Act relating, inter alia, to the installation of new furnaces, the height of chimneys, smoke control areas, pollution from colliery spoilbanks, research and publicity and the making of building byelaws. Smoke Control Areas. The City Council during the year gave consideration to the implication of the powers conferred on it by the Act with regard to smoke control areas, and decided without committing itself to any financial obligations 41 to agree in principle that its long-term policy should be to transform the whole of the City of Westminster into a smoke control area. It was realised, however, that this objective could only be attained by careful planning over a number of years in co-operation with business interests and residents. Further, that, for the Council's policy to be fully effective, close touch must be kept with other local authorities. The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee also considered that the ultimate aim of all the London Borough Councils should be for the whole of the County of London to be a smokeless zone; and that the most effective way of achieving that object would be to commence with the central smokeless zone already established by the City of London and extend it as rapidly as practicable until the boundaries of the County are reached. The Standing Joint Committee requested those Borough Councils having a common boundary with the City of London to confer and produce a co-ordinated scheme for the creation of smoke control areas spreading out in all directions. Preliminary meetings of officers of the Councils concerned have since taken place. Temple Bar Smoke Control Order. The City Council in pursuance of this policy, and with the consent of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, gave instructions for a detailed survey to be undertaken of the Temple Bar area of the City, which adjoins the boundaries of the City of London and the Borough of Holborn, to the east of Kingsway, Aldwych and Lancaster Place; approximately 60 acres in extent. On completion of the survey the City Council made a Smoke Control Order for the area. This was submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government, towards the end of the year, for confirmation. Proposed Smoke Control Area—Adelphi and Whitehall Area. As a result of a preliminary survey of an area, westwards of the Temple Bar area, bounded by the River Thames, the south side of the Strand and both sides of Whitehall, including Government Offices and the Houses of Parliament, the Council decided to forward particulars of the survey to the Minister of Housing and Local Government and to seek his consent to a detailed survey of the area being undertaken as a preliminary to the declaration of the area as a smoke control area, to be known as the Adelphi and Whitehall Smoke Control Area.

The resident population of 95,930 in some 27,000 dwellings received water from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains or from deep wells. Eighty-seven deep wells were in use at 31st December, 1957. In 84 of these wells, the water is used for domestic purposes. In the remainder, one supply is used for cooling purposes, one for supplying boilers and one as a stand by in case of fire. Satisfactory reports were received of 56 bacteriological examinations and 28 chemical analyses of water from these wells. Disinfection, Disinfestation and Cleansing of Persons— Arrangements with the Holborn Borough Council. The arrangement between the City Council and the Holborn Borough Council whereby the latter undertook to carry out, on agreed terms, the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing of persons, and the provision of the necessary transport therefor, continued. The arrangement came into operation on the 3rd September, 1956, and is working satisfactorily with resulting economies to both Councils. The following is a summary of the work carried out for Westminster during the year:— Disinfection and Disinfestation. Rooms. Articles. Articles Washed. Books.

Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the duty of the City Council as a Sanitary Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or is found dead in the area, where no other arrangements have been made for the disposal of the body. The Council is empowered to recover the cost of burial from the estate of the deceased, and is eligible to receive payments in respect of the cost of such burial from death grants payable under the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946. Where persons without known relatives die in the City, it is frequently necessary not only to arrange for their burial, but to dispose of the contents of their homes. This is done in consultation with the Treasury Solicitor. Such action is necessary to enable the proceeds to be applied towards the cost of burial and also to avoid rent accruing and to release the accommodation for housing purposes as early as possible. During the year 48 burials were undertaken by the City Council in its cemetery at Hanwell, the requests for such burials being received from the following sources:— H.M. Coroner 15 Relatives of the deceased 10 Friends of the deceased 3 Hospitals in the City 20 48 44 Coroner's Court and Mortuary. During 1957, 246 bodies were received in the Mortuary on Coroner's Warrants, etc. Three bodies were admitted to await burial. Number of Cases.

The City Council and the Holborn Borough Council, with the approval of the London County Council, made arrangements whereby bodies from Holborn, which were not the concern of H.M. Coroner, were accommodated at the City Council's Mortuary in Horseferry Road whilst awaiting burial. The arrangement came into operation on the 3rd September, 1956, and two bodies were received in the mortuary during 1957.

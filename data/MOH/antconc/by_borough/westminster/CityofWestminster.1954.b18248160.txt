This is the fourth year in succession in which the City has been free from this disease. It must be emphasised, however, that this freedom must not give rise to complacency or lessening of vigilance. The need for protecting their infants by immunization cannot be too strongly impressed on the parents. Diphtheria was until recently a terrible scourge in this country, and it may reappear. Facilities for immunization are available at all the child welfare clinics in the City. Smallpox. The Medical Officer of Health on two occasions during the year investigated cases of suspected smallpox at the request of the medical staff concerned. One case was at a hospital and the other at an hotel in the City. Fortunately, in both cases, smallpox was excluded. Eight persons who had arrived in the City and who had been in contact with a case of smallpox on a steamship were kept under surveillance by officers of the department during the period of incubation. None developed the disease. International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Arrangements continued during the year for the authentication by the Medical Officer of Health of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation completed by medical practitioners in Westminster. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad irom this country and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Some 3,296 certificates were authenticated during the year. 13 Deaths, 1954. Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life in the City. Causes of Deaths. Sex. All Ages.

In the course of the year, the Mass X-Ray Service of the SouthWest Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board operated in Westminster, when 10,449 residents and people working in the City were examined. Of these, 60 persons were referred for further investigation to Chest Clinics. Welfare of Old Persons. Hospital and Other Services for Old People. The City Council during the year gave careful consideration to the increasing difficulties in securing the admission to hospital at short notice of old people in Westminster who are in immediate need of hospital treatment. The Council was of opinion that many old people were suffering because they could not be sufficiently cared for either in their (7602) A 5 16 homes or in old people's homes, and yet could not be taken into hospital. It considered that if the voluntary organisations, which were doing such excellent work, could be encouraged and helped to expand their services, many old people could be enabled to look after themselves more satisfactorily in their own homes. Even so, the lack of hospital beds would still remain a serious problem and it considered that every effort should be made to reduce the shortage. The Council resolved that the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee be asked to consider the whole problem, with a view to the submission to the Minister of Health of representations on the following lines:— (i) That the powers of the Borough Councils under the National Assistance Act, 1948, to give financial assistance to voluntary organisations providing meals or recreation for old people, be extended to enable them to assist other work of such organisations for the benefit of old people; (ii) That the present arrangements be reviewed with a view to requiring the Regional Hospital Boards and the Teaching Hospitals to make adequate provision for old people in need of hospital care; and (iii) That greater provision should be made by the Welfare Authorities in homes for old people for such as are unable to look after themselves but do not need the attention and care provided in hospitals. At the end of the year these representations were still under consideration by the Ministry. Westminster Old People's Welfare Association. This voluntary Association, whose members are persons and representatives of various bodies interested in the welfare of old people, continued its activities in the City during the year. These activities include the organisation in various parts of the City of Darby and Joan Clubs, where light refreshments and recreation are provided; arranging holidays at seaside resorts, summer outings, Christmas parties, and other entertainments. Special outings and parties were organised during the year for handicapped old people, who by reason of their infirmities had not been outside their homes for long periods. The distribution of gift food parcels • was arranged; and also the visiting by voluntary helpers of the ailing and lonely in their homes. The Association also provides a chiropody service for the elderly. Treatment can be obtained at two clinics in the City, or at home. The charge is Is. per foot per treatment; the balance of cost, which varies from 3s. to 6s. per treatment, is borne by the Association. Recently arrangements have been made by the Association whereby paid work which can be done at home has been made available to the elderly in the City. 17 The City Council, under powers conferred by the National Assistance Act, 1948, make an annual contribution to the funds of the Association. British Red Cross Society—Mobile Meals Service. The Westminster Division of the British Red Cross Society has continued the service which it established in the City in 1945 for the delivery to their homes of hot mid-day meals to aged people who are unable themselves to prepare meals at home. The service is operated with two vans provided by the City Council and loaned to the Society. The Council also makes an annual grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the running costs of the vans. The meals were obtained from the London County Council's Civic Restaurants. With the closing down of the latter at the end of the year arrangements were made by the Society to obtain the meals from other sources. The meals are placed in individual containers and kept in heated containers on the vans until delivered at the homes of the old people. The meals cost Is. 6d. each, and consist of meat, two vegetables and a sweet, or lighter diets for those requiring them. The old people pay 10(2. for the meal and the London County Council bear the difference of 8d. Some 9,229 meals were delivered by this service during the year, with the assistance of the Society's voluntary workers. This invaluable help is very much appreciated by all concerned. Aged Persons in Need of Care and Attention. Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, a Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply to the Courts for an order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place, of persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from others, proper care and attention. Fortunately it has not been found necessary to invoke these powers during the year. Aged and Infirm Persons. Number of aged and infirm persons visited by the Council's officers during the year 262 Total number of inspections made with regard to these 1,163 Primary 186 Re-inspections 977 Cases of aged and infirm persons brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health during 1954 186 In dealing with these cases, the co-operation of the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association, the London County Council's Home Help Service, both of which are accommodated in the Public Health 18 ment, and the "Meals on Wheels" Service of the British Red Cross Society, has proved of inestimable value in bringing succour to many of these elderly people. Mobile Library Service. The City Council provides a library service for the aged, and books are issued to them at Darby and Joan Clubs. For those who are unable to leave their homes, delivery is made at their place of residence. Bathing Facilities. The City Council has made available to old age pensioners facilities whereby they can have hot baths at the Council's public baths at reduced charges. Cleansing of Aged and Feeble Persons in their Homes. The Council as a sanitary authority is enabled under powers conferred by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1953, to cause to be cleansed free of charge at the place where he resides, or at any other suitable place, any aged person within its district who is verminous, or is for any other reason in need of cleansing in order to prevent injury, or the danger of injury, to health; and who is so enfeebled that he is unable to cleanse himself properly. Such action can only be undertaken on the application, or with the consent, of that person, but not otherwise. The City Council has provided facilities for carrying out this work should it become necessary at any time. No cases requiring the exercise of these powers came to light during the year. Cleansing of Bed Linen of Elderly and Infirm. Facilities have also been made available by the Council for the cleansing of bed linen of elderly and infirm people which has become fouled and unwholesome. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933—Slaughterman's Licences. The Council during the year granted Slaughterman's licences to 40 men who had been accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to act as their inspectors in different parts of the country. These licences are required to be held by the pupils while undergoing training in humane slaughtering as inspectors of the R.S.P.C.A. 19 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

The Act provides that the repairs increase applies only if and so long as the conditions justifying an increase of rent are fulfilled, viz.:— (i) that the dwelling-house is in good repair; and (ii) that it is reasonably suitable for occupation. (A standard of fitness for human habitation is laid down in Part I of the Act). On the service of a notice of increase, the tenant of the dwelling-house may apply to the local authority for a certificate that either or both of the conditions justifying an increase of rent are not fulfilled. In cases where a certificate has been granted, the local authority must revoke the certificate on the application of the landlord, when he has satisfactorily carried out the works required to render the house reasonably suitable for occupation and in good repair. Provision is also made in the Act for a landlord to elect not to be responsible for internal decorative repairs, in which case there is a reduction in the permitted repairs increase. By the end of the year two applications had been made under the new Act for Ceitificates of Disrepair and in both instances certificates were granted. Three applications were received during the year for certificates under the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, and a certificate was granted in each case. Houses let in Lodgings. The Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, repeals Section 6, Housing Act, 1936, and Section 155, Public Health (London) Act, 1936, under which byelaws were made in respect of houses let in lodgings. Section 11 of the new Act provides that local authorities may serve notices for securing that houses let in lodgings are fit for occupation by the number of families accommodated. The standards of fitness are specified in the Act. To secure compliance with a Notice, the person upon whom it is served may either carry out the required work or take such steps as are reasonably open to him to limit in any maimer specified the number of families accommodated on the premises. During the year, 381 primary inspections were made of this type of house. 24 Land Charges Act, 1925. The number of enquiries dealt with and reported upon during the year was 1920, relating to some 3,300 properties. These enquiries concerned outstanding notices under the Public Health and Housing Acts, combined drainage orders, and applications for decontrol under the Rent Restrictions Acts. Many of the search forms have requested supplementary information regarding restrictions on the use of underground rooms, and the suitability of premises for specific purposes such as catering establishments, hairdressers and workrooms. Common Lodging Houses. There are three common lodging houses in the City, two for men and one for women, licensed by the City Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. During the year, fifty-six visits were made to these lodging houses, including those of a routine character, or following the notification of infectious disease or other illness arising amongst the occupants.

Some years ago the Council installed at its Monck Street Depot an instrument designed for measuring the volume of sulphur dioxide in the air. Samples, which are taken from the instrument three times a week, are analysed by one of the Council's Public Analysts, to whom a special fee is payable for this work. The information so obtained is recorded by the Council and is also transmitted to the Fuel Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In April the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research sought the co.operation of the City Council in a survey it was undertaking of the distribution of Sulphur Dioxide in the air of South-West London. The Council agreed to set up two new daily recording plants, one at Bessborough Street Maternity and Child Welfare Centre and another at its Farm Street Depot, and to increase the readings to daily ones at the existing station at Monck Street. The arrangements were made to extend for a period not exceeding eighteen months. Later in the year the Council also agreed to co-operate with the Department for the analysis of special samples of the air over the City if periods of SMOG should occur. Fortunately it was unnecessary to operate this scheme. 36 Average Daily Concentrations of S02. Month. Monck Street. Farm Street. Bessborough Street.

The resident population of 98,870 in some 27,400 dwellings received water from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains or from deep wells. Eighty-eight deep wells were in use at 31st December, 1954, compared with eight-nine at the same time in 1953, the use of one well having been discontinued, the machinery removed and the top sealed off. In eighty-five of these wells, the water is used for domestic purposes. In the remainder, one supply is used for cooling purposes, one for supplying boilers and one as a stand-by in case of fire. Satisfactory reports were received of 49 bacteriological examinations and 21 chemical analyses of water from these wells. In June, 1954, routine samples from one of the deep wells showed a total count in 72 hours at 20 deg. C. of 3055 with 90 faecal coli per 100 ml. The pumping equipment was immediately shut down, the storage tanks and supply pipes treated with chlorine, and supplies drawn from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples for chemical and bacteriological examination were taken from a number of the wells in the immediate vicinity, and one in adjacent premises showed a probable number of coliform bacilli in 2 days at 37 deg. C. of 18 per 100 ml. Here the deep well supply was discontinued and supplies obtained from the Metropolitan Water Board. Disinfection and Disinfestation. • Rooms. Articles.

Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act. 1948, it is the duty of the City Council as a Sanitary Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or is found dead in the area, where no other arrangements have been made for the disposal of the body. The Council is empowered to recover the cost of burial from the estate of the deceased, and is eligible to rcceive payments in respect of the cost of such burial from death grants payable under the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946. Where persons without known relatives die in the City, it is frequently necessary not only to arrange for their burial, but to dispose of the contents of their homes. This course is necessary to enable the proceeds to be applied towards the cost of burial and also to avoid rent accruing and to release the accommodation for housing purposes as early as possible. During the year 28 burials were undertaken by the City Council in its cemetery at Hanwell, the requests for such burials being received from the following sources :— H.M. Coroner's Officer 8 Relatives of the deceased 12 Friends of the deceased 2 Hospitals in the City 5 Home help 1 28 Coroner's Court and Mortuary. During 1954, 274 bodies were received in the Mortuary on Coroner' Warrants, etc. Four bodies were admitted to await burial. Number of Cases.

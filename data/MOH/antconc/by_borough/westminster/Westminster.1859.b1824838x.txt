WES 7 27 The Board of Works for the Westminister District. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 25th MARCH, 1859, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES OF St. Margaret and St. John, Westminister, FOR THE QUARTER ending 25th MARCH 1859, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I am happy in being enabled to inform you that the present quarter exhibits an increased healthy return, and although the late very mild weather has doubtless contributed to this return, yet the great sanitary improvements that have been effected in these parishes must have materially influenced the general health. Scarlet Fever has almost entirely subsided in Saint Margaret's, and the Deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs are considerably diminished. The number of Births registered during the present quarter has been 281 Males and 283 Females, or a total of 564 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 197 Males and 220 Females, or a total of 417 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 31 as arising from accident and as belonging to other parishes, thus reducing the actual number to 386. The Deaths 4 for a similar period in 1858 amounted to 506, and the average of the previous 10 years to 489; if, however, this average be raised with a view to increase of population, the number will be 537-9; thus showing a decrease in reference to 1858 of 120, and in reference to the 10 years' average, of 151-7. The following is a Tabular statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— QUARTERLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS & DEATHS ENDING MARCH 1859. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Corrected Deaths.

During the quarter your Inspectors have visited 200 houses in various parts of the Parishes, the particulars of which will be found in their Report Books. 5 The subject of overcrowding (to which I have previously frequently alluded) having engaged the attention of other parishes, and one of them having issued a circular informing landlords that summary proceedings will be taken in all instances were overcrowding is detected, induces me again to bring this subject prominently before you. Great and most successful efforts have been made to secure an efficient system of drainage by abolishing all cesspools, substituting pipe for brick drainage, and, as far as possible, preventing the egress of foul air by the general adaption of traps, and this has had its attendant benefits, but much more is required. In these Parishes overcrowding exists to a fearful extent, and it therefore becomes a matter of the most serious moment to determine whether the Board can interfere in those instances where rooms are dangerously overcrowded. The required amount of air for each person is 400 cubic feet, and I feel assured in many instances the Poor do not have 100; it consequently requires no force of argument to prove how pernicious that system must be which renders both the young and the old, whose blood is poisoned by breathing such vitiated air, especially susceptible and equally incapable of resisting the influence of disease. The subject of overcrowding is therefore one of the most serious import, and will require great vigilance on the part of the Sanitary Inspectors in detecting those localities where such evils exist. It will become necessary to revisit the greater portion of the Parishes, and without favour report all instances where the required capacity is deficient. The appended examples of overcrowding and indiscriminate intermingling of the sexes, are a fair example of many others—the cases have been casually met with, and afford a tolerably clear elucidation of the mysteries which have hitherto enshrouded the causes of the large infantile mortality existing in these Parishes. 6 The following are examples of Overcrowded Rooms in Saint Margaret and Saint John's:— ST.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, FOR THE QUARTER ending 24th JUNE 1859, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honor to inform you that the number of Births registered during the present quarter has been 285 Males and 286 Females, or a total of 571 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 184 Males and 179 Females, or a total of 363 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 36 as arising from accident and as belonging to other parishes, which reduces the actual number to 327. The Deaths for a similar period in 1858 amounted to 447, and the average of the previous 10 years to 427-3; if, however, this average is raised with a view to comparison for an increased population, the numbers will be 469-3; thus showing a decrease of 120 Deaths as compared with a similar period in 1858, and 142 as compared with the average of the previous 10 years. 4 Scarlet Fever, Small Pox, Measles, and other diseases of a similar character are much diminished, and altogether the Parishes exhibit a very satisfactory condition of health. The following is a Tabular statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— QUARTERLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS & DEATHS ENDING JUNE 1859. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Corrected Deaths.

As the subject is one of such magnitude, I must request you will come to some decision as to what should bo done in these cases, and whether it is your desire these examinations should be continued. The houses in Saint Anne's Place have been inspected to ascertain the cause of an existing illness to which my attention has been particularly directed by Mr. Hunt, the Medical Officer for Saint John's, and I have no question that the overcrowding is quite sufficient to account for the present prevalence of disease. The premises are generally tolerably clean, and the drainage and paving have been previously remedied, partly by the owner and partly by the parish at considerable expense. The subject of Underground Dwellings also continues to engage my attention; and I have to report the following instances where the requirements of the Act of Parliament are not complied with:— Arthur Street, 16 houses examined—Nos. 4, 11, 13, 14 and 15, defective. Montpelier Row, 18 houses examined—Nos. 6, 15 and 25, defective. Parker Street—Nos. 4, 6, 17, 19, 21 and 22, defective. Market Street—Nos. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20 and 23, ditto. Vine Street—Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 22, 23, 24, 36, 37, 44, 49, 52 and 53, ditto. New Tothill Street—No. 4, ditto. In addition to the above, 105 houses have been examined in St. Margaret's, and 69 in St. John's, the various requirements of which will be found in the Sanitary Inspector's Reports. In many instances the drainage was out of order, and in others it became necessary to have the premises thoroughly cleansed and whitewashed, while in one it became necessary to apply to the Magistrate, who issued a prohibitory order until the premises were sufficiently and satisfactorily repaired.

The Deaths for a similar period in 1858 amounted to 353, and the average of the previous 10 years to 478-1; if, however, this average is raised in accordance with the increase of population, the numbers will be 525-1; thus showing that although there is an increase of 34, as compared with 1858, there is a decrease of 138-1 as compared with the average of the previous 10 years. 4 The increase in the Death Rate, as compared with 1858, is mainly attributable to the large number of Deaths arising from Diarrhœa occurring in children under 1 year of age; there has also been a considerable mortality in persons advanced in years: 68 Deaths having occurred in those above 60 years of age. The Deaths from Scarlet Fever, Hooping Cough, Measles and Small Pox have been comparatively small. The following is a Tabular statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— QUARTERLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS & DEATHS ENDING SEPTEMBER 1859. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Corrected Deaths.

Hospitals. Prisons. Barracks. 53 Westminster 20 Millbank 2 Hyde Park 3 Grenadier Gds. 1 House of Correction 4 Wellington 1 Coldstream Gds. 6 Emanuel 1 A complaint emanating from a lodger at No. 5, Dean-street, having been made to the Nuisances Removal Committee, and referred by them to me, respecting, 1st, the overcrowding of the house; and 2ndly, a nuisance arising from the fumes of 5 charcoal used in the process of dying. I beg to report that having visited the premises in question, I found them generally clean—not overcrowded; and that the fumes arising from the charcoal was very trifling, and not detrimental to health; the complaint, in my opinion, being of a frivolous and vexatious character. My attention has been again directed to the nuisance arising from the escape of offensive vapour from Mrs. Woodford's and Mr. Bowley's premises in Tothill-street. Upon a former occasion I suggested the erection of a shaft, so that all offence might be carried to a height which was not likely to offend the immediate inhabitants. As, however, this would be very costly, in a further Report, I suggested that the apparatus now in use should be repaired under the inspection of a competent engineer, who should certify to your Board as to its efficiency, so that should there be any future escape from the neglect of Mrs. Woodford's servants, the responsibility of such nuisance should rest with Mrs. Woodford, who might then be dealt with according to the terms of the Nuisances Removal Act. With regard to Mr. Bowley's premises, I have very maturely considered every thing relating to the manufacture of candles and greaves; and I conclude that so long as greaves are manufactured, so long will there be that occasional nuisance which is attributable to the making of that article. Mr. Bowley uses, in my opinion, all the means he can use for the prevention of a nuisance. Pigs continue to be kept in the various yards in the united parishes, in defiance of the Regulations issued by your Board. They were detected in Earney's, Goddard's, Beadle's and Lucas' yards, as well as at No. 3, Cobourg-row. The majority have been removed, but there is no question they will be speedily replaced by others. During the quarter, various seizures of fish and other articles have taken place; and in one instance occurring in Great 6 Chapel-street, the Magistrate committed the vender to the House of Correction for seven days. Twenty-one instances of underground dwellings have been detected in Rochester-street and Grey Coat-place, and the parlies have been removed. In one case, No. 21, New Peterstreet, it was necessary to apply to the Sitting Magistrate, who made the required Order of Removal. The subject of overcrowding is in abeyance until the decision of your Board is obtained as to what steps shall be taken to remove so great an evil.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, For the QUARTER ending 25th DECEMBER, 1859, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honor to inform you that the number of Births registered during the present quarter has been 263 Males and 276 Females, or a total of 539 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 240 Males and 203 Females, or a total of 443 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 32 as arising from accident and belonging to other parishes, thus reducing the actual number to 411. The Deaths for the corresponding quarter last year amounted to 452, while those for the 10 years' average numbered 403-7; if, however, this average is raised with a view to increase of population, the numbers will be 464; showing a decrease in reference to the corresponding quarter of last year of 42; and in reference to the 10 years' average, of 53. In the above Return, 30 Deaths are recorded as occurring above 60 years of age, 16 above 70, and 8 above 80. 4 The following is a Tabular Statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— QUARTERLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS & DEATHS ENDING 25th DECEMBER 1859.

Hospitals. Prisons. Barracks. 20 Westminster 41 Millbank 1 Emanuel 1 House of Correction 6 Coldstream Gds. 3 During the quarter 20 Deaths have arisen from Small Pox and its consequences—precisely twice as many as have occurred during the previous nine months of the present year; and as there were only 3 Deaths from the same disease during the whole of last year, the increase is something fearful. Out of the 20 Deaths, 13 occurred in Children who had not been protected by Vaccination. Nothing can show more forcibly than a reference to the present numbers, the necessity that exists for all persons to be re-vaccinated, and that an example should be made of some of those cases where the terms of the Vaccination Act have uot been complied with. Placards have been already issued, and the numerous Schools in both parishes 5 are being visited by the Public Vaccinators, accompanied by myself, that a fair estimate may be formed of the instances where Vaccination has been neglected, or where it has been imperfectly performed. In addition to the above, the appointed Officer of the Government has communicated with the Vaccinators for the purpose of ensuring a house to-house Visitation, to further secure the known advantages of Vaccination, and, if possible, prevent the continued prevalence of the disease. A complaint having been made to Inspector Wood respecting the overcrowding of houses in Johnson's Court, I have visited the premises, and found that in 14 rooms there are 37 Adults and 28 Children, or a total of 65 persons: the general area of the rooms is 8 ft by 9, and 8 ft high, and the deficiency of required air at the lowest possible computation is 8412 cubic feet, or that which should be sufficient for 21 persons; the yards of the houses are in a most disreputable state, and the closets filthy to a degree; the drains are untrapped, and the offence great. I consider it highly necessary the present pans should be removed and be replaced by new ones; the pavement must be repaired, the yards lime-whitened, and the overcrowding be prevented, the drains must, likewise, be effectually trapped. Complaints having been occasionally made respecting the purity of the meat sold in Great Chapel Street, Inspector Wood visited the shop of a butcher, named Knight, in the Horseferry Road, and seized eighteen pounds of beef, which the Magistrate immediately condemned. At a subsequent hearing of the case, the Magistrate was so satisfied of the culpability of the butcher, that he fined him in the penalty of five pounds and costs. The decision has already had its attendant good, inasmuch, as the meat since offered for sale is of a better quality and in a more wholesome condition. 6 With the exception of the prevailing Small Pox epidemic, the Parishes exhibit a favourable Return—Diarrhœa has entirely ceased, and Scarlet Fever and Measles are gradually on the decline, and the Deaths from Bronchitis and Pneumonia are considerably less than the corresponding quarter of the previous year. A large number of houses have been inspected in the two Parishes, and the majority of the requirements have been completed; the visitations have been mainly in those districts where disease has been most prevalent. In five instances, underground dwellings were detected contrary to the Act of Parliament, and the necessary notices have been issued. I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, BARNARD HOLT. 5, Parliament Street, January, 1860. 7 Ages and Causes of Death during the Quarter ending December 1859. ST. MARGARET'S.

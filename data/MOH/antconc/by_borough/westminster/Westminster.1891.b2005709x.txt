WHEN Sir Benjamin Hall's masterly Act received the Royal Assent thirty-six years ago, the legislature undoubtedly saw good reasons for imposing upon the Metropolitan Vestries and District Boards the obligation to publish an annual report of their proceedings at the close of every financial year, Up to that time it had been the custom for the different local boards and commissions (whose name was legion) to meet and deliberate with closed doors. The local newspapers which now report more or less completely the principal matters of interest coming before the various local authorities, did not exist; and the enquiring ratepayer bad not within his reach at the free public libraries the printed minutes of the Vestry's proceedings, as he now has. To these causes may be attributed the fact that but thirty reports have been sold to ratepayers during the last four years, although householders are informed by a memorandum on the rate demand-notes that such can be obtained for the sum of twopence per copy. The 198th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act remains, however, upon the statute book, and with it the duty of making an annual report to the ratepayers. The Vestry have therefore ordered, for the sake of economy, that the different matters which have engaged their attention during the past year be touched upon as succinctly as possible, leaving their work to be judged, without further explanation, from the usual financial and statistical statements and tables, B 2 and from the annual reports of their surveyor and medical officer, which are incorporated with the report as appendices. THE WARD ELECTIONS. The annual elections in the six Wards into which the parishes are divided, took place on Wednesdaay, 27th May, 1801. Besides the thirty-two vacancies caused hy mem. hers retiring hy effluxion of time, there were four vacancies occasioned hy resignations, and one hy death during the preceding year. A poll took place in Ward No. 3, St. John, on Thursday, 28th May. In consequence of Mr. C. C. Piper having been returned for three Wards (No. 1 St. Margaret, and Nos. 1 and 3 St. John), and Mr. Thomas Horn for two Wards (Nos. 1 and 3 St. John), Bye-elections were held on Tuesday, .'10th June, for the purpose of tilling the additional vacancy in each of the Wards, No. 1 St. Margaret, and No. 3 St. John, Mr. Piper and Mr. Horn having previously intimated, in accordance with the statute, their preference to represent Ward No. 3 St. John and Ward No. 1 St. John respectively. One vacancy in Ward No. 1 St. John was not filled in consequence of the ratepayers being unable to find four of their number present at the meeting willing to act as inspectors of votes. Twenty retiring members were re-elected, three former members o ' came on the Vestry again after an interval, and the following thirteen gentlemen became vestrymen of Westminster for the first time:— Maj.-Gen. J. Gibbons Smyth Mr. G. F. Danielli „ J. 11. Cleave „ J. E. Hendre „ A. H. Safford „ W. Warren „ J. Pierce Mr. W. Smith „ F. C. Ludeman „ R. Tunstall „ C. Voyce ,, J. S. West D. Newton 3 THE VESTRY. Twenty-three meetings of the Vestry were held during the year, of which two were convened for special purposes. The Chair. Mr. Churchwarden Zephaniah King, F.R.I.B.A., was the "customary chairman" of the Vestry during the year. The Venerable Archdeacon Farrar, D.D., the Rector of St. Margaret's, twice took the chair, and Mr. ' ' Churchwarden Hunt, Mr. Churchwarden Lough, Sir Walter de Souza, L.C.C., Mr. Thomas Horn, Mr. Frederick Rose, and Mr. C. Spencer Smith were also occasional chairmen. Votes of Condolence. At the meeting of the Vestry on the 27th January, 1892, the Venerable Archdeacon Farrar beino- in the chair, the following vote of condolence with o ' o the Royal Family upon the occasion oi the death of H. R. H. the Duke of Clarence and Avondale (Prince Albert Victor of Wales) was unanimously passed upon the motion of the Reverend Canon Furse, M.A., Rector of St. John's, seconded by Mr. Churchwarden Henry A. Hunt:— That this Vestry, representing the ancient City of Westminster, desire to express to Her Majesty the Queen, to their Royal Hignesses the Prince and Princess of Wales, to Her Highness the Princess Victoria May of Teck, Her Royal Highness the Duchess and His Serene Highness the Dake of Teck, and the other members of the Royal Family, their heartfelt sympathy under the heavy bereavement with which it has pleased God to afflict them in the death of His Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence and Avondale. Copies of this resolution were transmitted to the Comptrollers of the several Royal Households therein referred to, and the following acknowledgments were subsequently ordered by the Vestry to be entered upon the Minutes:— B Whitehall, 18th February, 1892. Sir, I have had the honour to lay before the Queen the loyal and dutiful Resolution which has been adopted by the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. Jolm, Westminster, on the occasion of the 4 death of TIis Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, K.G.; and I have to inform you that Her Majesty was pleased to eceive the Resolution very graciously. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) HENRY MATTHEWS. The Vestry Clerk of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, Vestry Offices, Town Hall, Westminster, S.W. "Sandhungham, February 2nd, 1892. "General Sir Dighton Probyn, Comptroller of the Household, is desired by the Prince and Princess of Wales to offer their sincere thanks to the Vestry and Inhabitants of the City of Westminster for their kind address of condolence with their Royal Highnesses in their sad bereavement. P." "White Lodge, Richmond Park, 1st February, 1892. "Sir, "1 am desired by His Highness the Duke of Teck to acknowledge the receipt of a Resolution from the Westminster Vestry, containing a message of condolence with the Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, in the great sorrow which has befallen the Royal Family and the Nation, and beg the members to accept the very grateful thanks of the Princess Victoria Mary for the expression of their kind personal sympathy with H.S.H. in her most sad bereavement. "I have the honour to be, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, "J. E. Smith, Esq., (Signed) F. DE WINTON." "Vestry Offices, Westminster.'' The Vestry have had to regret the death of Mr. James Lane, a much respected member of the Vestry, who had only recently been appointed one of the Overseers for St. John's parish; and of Mr. William Brindley, a representative of Ward No. 2, of St. Margaret's parish. The Vestry learnt with unfeigned regret early \oteor Regret. *n yCar jy|,. Charles Palmer, an old and valued member of the Vestry and its Finance Committee, Vote of Regret. The Vestry learnt with unfeigned regret early in the year that Mr. Charles Palmer, an old and valued member of the Vestry and its Finance Committee, 5 had been stricken by paralysis. The Vestry were rejoiced some few months afterwards to welcome Mr. Palmer in their midst again. Votes of Thanks. An interesting ceremony—albeit its raison d' etre was in itself a matter of great regret to the Vestry—took place on the 24th June, 1891, when an inscribed copy of the subjoined resolution, under the Common Seal of the Vestry, was presented by the Ven. Archdeacon Farrar in an eloquent and sympathetic speech, to Mr. Churchwarden George James Lough, upon his ceasing to be a member of the Vestry in consequence of removal from the parish:— That this being the expiration of the term of office of Mr. Churchwarden Lough, this Vestry do place on record their high esteem of the conspicuous ability and success with which he has conducted the proceedings on the many occasions on which he has; acted as Chairman of the Vestry, and their appreciation of the eminent qualities he has brought to bear in the numerous administrative offices he has held in the selfgovernment of the parish during the past ten years. Votes of Thanks, where they are not indiscriminately given, may be regarded in some sort as an indication that the work of a local authority is being conducted smoothly and with satisfaction to the great majority of the body passing them. It is pleasing to record, therefore, that during the past year, nine such votes in addition to the above were unanimously accorded To the Elected Auditors for their annual report upon the accounts, and for an important and informatory report on the accounts of the Burial Board. To the Members of the Horse Sub-Committee of the Joint Committee (Messrs. T. W. Davies, F. W. C. Lambert, T. Rintoul, H. Smith, W. Swingler, and C. Wright of St. John's), for their services in selecting a stud of really useful animals for the Vestry's purposes at a moderate price. To a Sub-Committee of the Finance Committee (Messrs. G. W. Tallents and C. Spencer Smith) for a commentative report on certain proposals by a Committee of the London County 6 Council upon the subject of proposed amendments to the Valuation (Metropolis) Act, 1869. To the Medical Officer of Health for an important and suggestive report on the Public Health (London) Act. To Dr. Thomas Bond, for his services voluntarily rendered as honorary medical officer during Dr. Holt's indisposition. To the Elected Auditors, for their conduct in re action of the School Board with regard to a circular issued by the Vestry prior to the School Board election. This matter is more particularly dealt with hereafter. To Sir Walter de Souza, L.C.C.. for information communicated by him to the Vestry. To the Police, for their] offer to report when roads are in a slippery or dangerous condition, and otherwise to co-operate with the Vestry. Only one resignation was received during the Resignation. year.—that of Mr. E H. Smith, a representative of Ward No. 2, St. John. THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. The Finance Committee met twenty-four times, Mr. C. C. Piper and Mr. W. M. Scudamore being re-appointed Chairman and Vice-Chairman respectively at the first meeting. Although this Committee is rightly regarded, by reason of the extreme importance of the work coming within its purview, as the first Committee of the Vestry, its proceedings have consisted for the most part of detail checking and supervision, and no question calling for special remark here has arisen during the past year. The matters treated in this report under the heads of"' School Board for London," " Executive," " Rates and Rateable Value," and " Loans," afford some instance of the great consequence to the parish which the business of this Committee involves. THE WORKS AND GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE. This Committee have held twenty-eight meetings during the year, at the first of which the Hon. Ashley G. J. 7 Ponsonby, J.P., L.C.C., was again chosen to be Chairman, and Mr. Thomas Horn, Vice-Chairman. The work of this Committee has been unusnally heavy, and any attempt to treat, however meagrely, with the multitudinous and diverse matters considered by the Committee, would defeat in itself the brevity insisted upon in the first sentences of this report. The Committee have presented at every meeting of the Vestry, full and explanatory reports upon questions of wood and asphalte paving, drainage, lighting, projections and other obstructions, street nomenclature, street refuges, sewer ventilation, vaults, hoardings, urinals, electric lighting, new roads, flooding of basements St. John's-garden, subways, and other matters, which will be found entered in full on the Vestry's Minutes of Proceedings, and need not therefore be further referred to. The several street improvements which have been prominently before the Committee during the year, are briefly dealt with under the heading of "Street Improvements," at page 19. THE STREET CLEANSING AND SANITARY COMMITTEE. Unhealthy dwellings. Mr. H. N. B. Spink, M.L.S.B., was re-elected Chairman and Mr. J. Fergusson, Vice Chairman at the first meeting of the Street Cleansing and Sanitary Committee, which met twentythree times. The past year has been an important and busy one with this Committee. The beneficent provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, were actively but temperately exercised by the Committee, whose recommendations led to twenty-nine houses beinsr closed as unhealthy and unfit for human O ° habitation. The Committee had also to lay a complaint against the Peabody-buildings in James-street, the Vestry's surveyor and medical officer having reported that the dustshafts were so constructed as to be a positive danger to the inmates of the dwellings ; and the latter-named officer 8 refused to give his certificate under the Customs and Inland Revenue Act of 1890, until the defect was satisfactorily remedied. A correspondence ensued between the Committee and the Trustees, in which an alternative proposal was submitted by the Trustees to the structural alterations required by the Vestry; but no arrangement had been arrived at Lady-day. Public Health Act. The passing in August of the Public Health (London) Act—" London's Code of Health "— has been the most important feature of the year in so far as this Committee's duties are affected. In the succeeding month a comprehensive and suggestive report was made to the Vestry by the medical officer of health, in which Dr. Holt pointed out clearly and pertinently that a much higher standard of efficiency in sanitary matters would be expected under the new Act than that which had obtained hitherto; and that the sanitary department of the Vestry would require thorough re-organisation in order to render it equal to the new or more onerous duties devolving upon it, especially in regard to lodging-houses, underground rooms disinfection, smoke abatement, workshops, bye-laws for prevention of various nuisances, mortuary, etc. The report was referred to the Committee, who, after giving it a careful consideration, presented certain recommendations for the increase of the sanitary staff; but the Vestry saw fit to adjourn the adoption of the report until after the Act had come into operation on the 1st January of 1892. The status of inspectors Dee and Lightfoot was revised, their salaries being increased to £150 per annum with £10 annual increments to a maximum of £200; and an additional inspector—Mr. A. McNair—was appointed, principally for the supervision of houses let in lodgings, at a salary of £130, rising by £10 annual increments to £150. A clerk was also appointed for the purely clerical work of the 9 department, so that the inspectors might have more time for out-door work, at £ CO with £10 annual increments to £100; and a temporary inspector was engaged for the measurement and registration of the underground rooms. Bye-laws for the regulation of houses let in lodgings, which had been drafted so long ago as in 1884, were adapted to the new statute and forwarded to the Local Government Board for approval, and other bye-laws for the prevention of nuisances, based on draft models provided by the Local Government Board, were also prepared. An attempt was made to obtain the classification of measles as a "dangerous infectious disease" under the Act, but was not encouraged ' by the Government Department at Whitehall; the question of mortuary and disinfection accommodation was fully gone into, and suggestions were made to the County Council and St. George's Union with a view to co-operation in carrying out the provisions of this most important and valuable statute. Analysis of Food and Drugs Under the direction of the Committee eighty- four samples of food and drugs were analysed during the year, with the results as shown in the following summary:— Articles purchased. No. of Samples. Genuine. Adulterated. Convictions. Arrowroot 3 3 Butter 24 18 6 5 Coffee 12 8 4 3 Gin 5 4 1 1 Milk 25 23 2 - Mustard 3 3 - - Seidlitz powders. 7 5 2 1 Whiskey 5 4 1 — Total 84 68 16 10 10 Public Mortuary. Seventy-eight bodies were received at the mortuary in Millbank street, of which one was a child under one year of age, and 18 were of persons 60 years of age and upwards. Seven were found drowned— five in the Thames, one in the ornamental water in St. James's Park, and one in the Serpentine. Nine were sent in by order of the sanitary inspectors as having died of infectious disease, or as being improperly detained in living rooms to the danger of occupants. THE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE. The Parliamentary Committee met four times in the year under the chairmanship of Mr. J. Brend Batten, Mr. Thomas Horn being vice-chairman, and considered and reported upon Bills and Parliamentary schemes affecting the parish directly or indirectly, including the several Water Bills, and the London County Council (Tramways) Bill, THE JOINT WORKS AND SANITARY COMMITTEE. The determined action which the Yestry took in the year 1890, when they resolved (notwithstanding the pessimistic prognostications of failure) to carry out the work of cleansing, watering, and dusting the parish with their own staff, horses, and plant, has been more than justified by the experience of the past year. The purchase of the necessary plant and stock and stud of horses has been completed at a cost of £4,220 (including provision for snow-falls), and the new system has been placed upon a permanent and satisfactory footing. In acknowledgment of the praiseworthy efforts made to overcome the difficulties experienced at the commencement of the work, and to organise the system on a sound basis, the Committee awarded the surveyor a gratuity of 50 guineas, and to the staff in his department twenty-five guineas. The Committee found it necessary, in 11 order to avoid disorganisation and destruction of discipline, to entrust the surveyor with full authority for the engagement and discharge of workmen, and the assignment of their duties. The annual report of the surveyor at page 46 will give particulars of the cost of the new system during the past twelvemonths ; it is only necessary here to state that the total cost of executing the services has been £10,584 14s. 10d., which includes £1,325 8s. 4d. for rents and the payment of instalments and interest on loans. This result is perhaps somewhat more expensive than if the contract system had remained in vogue, but, even supposing that the 'ring' had not managed to increase the contract price, a comparison with the present condition of the streets and dust-bins in the parish, with what they were under the old regime more than compensates for the increased outlay. The Vestry were so satisfied with the manner in which the Joint Committee had carried out their trust, that they resolved to create the Joint Committee as a Standing Committee, to be responsible for, and to exercise all the powers of the Vestry in relation to the cleansing and watering of the streets and the 'dusting' of the parish. The underground convenience in Whitehall, constructed by Messrs. B. Finch & Co., at a cost of £1,192, was opened on the 3rd March and placed in charge of two caretakers in uniform, at 25s. per week. The receipts of the year have amounted to £142 9s. 10d., or an average of £2 14s. 10d. per week. TOWN HALL MANAGEMENT. The Churchwardens and Overseers, assisted by four members of the Vestry who had previously served one or both of the offices, have continued, during the past year, the management of the parochial buildings, which are vested in them by statutory authority. The amount paid to the credit of the Poor Rate was £29 10s. 6d., representing 12 the balance of receipts from lettings over cost of maintenance and certain structural alterations and repairs to the building. The accounts are audited by the Local Government Board Auditor, and a copy statement of the receipts and expenditure for the year 1891-2 is incorporated herewith as an Appendix, No. 13. EXECUTIVE. Very few changes have taken place in the office staff during the year. Upon the resignation of J. T. W. Clarke, junior clerk, E. G. Waldock, (boy messenger) was promoted to the vacancy; and a change was made in the status of Mr. Pratten. RATES AND RATEABLE VALUE. The gross amount in the pound upon a rateable value of £766,355, which the Yestry as the "rating authority" had to levy upon the parish, was 4s. 10½d., made up as follows, the strictly local requirements of the parish being distinguished from the general Metropolitan charges:— s. d. s. d. For the strictly local purposes of the Vestry—maintenance, lighting and cleansing of the roadways, footways, etc., and construction of sewers 1 0½ For the expenses of the Free Public Libraries (now included in the Poor Rate) 0 0¾ For the expenses of the Baths Commissioners (also included in the Poor Rate) 0 01 Total under Vestry's control 1 1¾ 13  s. d. s. d. For the relief of the poor, including expenses of the London County Council, Police, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board 2 8¼ For the purposes of the School Board for London 1 0½ Total for central purposes 3 8¾ 4 10½ It will thus be seen that more than three-fourths (76.5) of the rates levied in the parish were for the purposes of the School Board, the County Council, the Police, the Asylums Board, and the Guardians of the Poor, over whose expenditure the Vestry have no manner of control whatsoever; and it is to be remarked that the Vestry's control over the Baths and Library expenses is only partial, in the fact that the Commissioners have sources independent of the rates. The Vestry are entitled to claim, therefore, that the interests of the ratepayers are studied by them in every way in so far as the Vestry have jurisdiction. The School Board required 1s. 0½d. in the £. for the single purpose of elementary education, and for exactly the same sum the Vestry were able to maintain, light and cleanse the footways and roadways, remove the dust and refuse from the 8,800 inhabited houses in the parish, to cleanse and maintain the local sewerage system, to carry out the expensive work of rating and collecting for the other spending bodies as well as for themselves, to administer the important machinery of sanitary legislation, and to carry out important street improvements. 14 SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. The School Board rate "went up" a penny in the £. in the year, the rate being increased from ll½d. to 1s. 0½d. in order to meet the Board's precept of £33,549 2s. 6d., exclusive of £1,334 12s. 3d. in respect of Government property. The following statement of the amounts contributed by this parish to the School Board since 1871 is again published, for although it does not furnish the pleasantest of reading to ratepayers, it has been found to be useful in past years:— Precept. Rate. £ s. d. d. 1871 983 9 10 ... 1872 1,857 5 11 1½ 1873 1,535 7 3 1 1874 3,689 1 9 1¾ 1875 6,440 4 9 3½ 1876 9,597 18 4 4 1877 11,363 9 11 5½ 1878 11,224 4 9 5 1879 12,556 4 11 4½ 1880 14,458 9 11 5½ 1881 14,799 13 4 5½ 1882 14,797 2 8 6½ 1883 17,316 16 0 7 1884 20,474 2 0 8 1885 22,613 12 11 9 1886 25,134 1 10 9 1887 24,010 19 9 9 1888 22,899 8 11 9 1889 25,531 10 3 8 1890 30,959 15 9 11½ 1891 33,549 2 6 12½ (The above figures are exclusive of sums levied in respect of Government property and election expenses). 15 The triennial election of the School Board took place on the 26th November, when the ratepayers, roused by the prospects of a still increasing rate, languidly took some little interest in the event, with the result that a majority pledged to economy was returned to the Board on the Victoria-embankment. In order to bring home to the ratepayers of the parish that the election afforded the only opportunity for three years of expressing a decided opinion upon the proceedings of the Board in past years, the Vestry posted the following circular to every householder in the parish rated above £20:— "ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER. Vestry Offices:—Town Hall, Westminster, S.W., 1891. This Vestry, as the rating authority required by law to levy and collect in this parish the sums demanded by the School Board for London, deem it their duty to impress upon the ratepayers the importance of making a special effort to record their votes at the ensuing election (which is appointed to take place on the 26th November), in favour of those candidates who will pledge themselves, not merely to the advocacy of " economy " in general and indefinite terms, but to specific reforms in the interests of the ratepayers. The sum to be raised in this parish for School Board purposes during the current year is £'37,113, or Is. O^d. in the £; and, inasmuch as the spending powers of the Board are unlimited, further increases may be expected year by year, unless the ratepayers of the metropolis apply an effectual check by the judicious exercise of their voting power on the day of election. 'The following extract from the Financial Statement made in June last by Sir Richard Temple, Chairman of the Finance Committee of the School Board, shews the necessity for greater practical interest in the election of Members:— " Nor does there appear to be any security whatever that the rate will not go on rising. Whether the coming triennial election at the end of this year may cause any difference is quite uncertain. If it does not, then no financial estimator reckoning future figures on the known figures of the past and present could say anything else than this—that the rate will go on rising. For the three years since the 25th March, 1889, it has risen from 7-97d. to ll'Old. in the pound, which, as I have shown, means a 16 shilling in the pound to the parish ratepayer, and a triennial increase of nearly 3d. in the pound. What is there to prevent its rising in the same way for the following three years from the spring of 1892, which would bring the incidence of the rate up to nearly 1s. 3d. in the £ Nothing whatever, so far as I can see, in the present constitution of the Board. Whether the coming Board shall introduce any change in this respect is a question which may partly depend on the mandate of the ratepayers." In the three years 1886-9 the ratepayers of this parish contributed £'76.544, or £25,514 per annum, for the School Board elected in 1885; in the three years 1889-92 the sums levied amount to £93,040, or £31,013 per annum, for the Board elected in 1888, and now retiring from office, being an increase of £5,499 per annum. Occupiers of tenements or "dwelling houses," whose rates are included in their weekly rents and paid by their landlords, have equal voting power with householders, so that if the latter do not attend at the polling stations and record their votes, the choice is in danger of being left in the hands of a small section of the electors, who bear but little share of the burthen, and have, therefore, less interest in limiting the expense. It is observable, also, that complaints of "heavy rates" are frequently made by occupiers who omit to avail themselves of those opportunities of improving matters which the periodical elections afford. Of the rates for the current year, which are 4s. l0½d. in the £, only 1s. 3¼d. in the £ is for local purposes, over which the Yestry have control. The remainder, 3s. 7¼d., is for the purposes of the Board of Guardians, the Police, the County Council, and the School Board. * The Polling Station for Ward No. , in which your premises are situate, will be at the Ladies who are rated occupiers are entitled to vote. By Order of the Yestry, J. E. SMITH, Vestry Clerk." * Adapted to each Ward. 17 This circular, whatever other result it might have had, gave rise to the following interesting correspondence between the Elected Auditors and the School Board, which may be allowed to speak for itself:— School Board for London, Victoria Embankment, W.C., llth December, 1891. Sir, I am directed by the School Board for London to forward you a copy of a circular issued by the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster. I am further directed to request that you will take the necessary steps to prevent the expenditure of money by the Vestry in agitation in reference to the election of another public body. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, {Signed) G. H. CROAD, R. E. H. Goffin, Esq., Cleric of the Board. Auditor, Ward No. 2, St. Margaret's, Palace Street, S.W. The Town Hall, Caxton Street, The Cleric to the Westminster, S.W., School Board for London, 15th December, 1891. Sir, We are duly in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant. Without admitting your authority to address us upon the subject of the Vestry's expenditure in relation to the issue of a circular, or commenting on the needlessly peremptory tone of your letter, we have agreed, being actuated by a sense of public duty, to transmit the following observations thereon. Under ordinary circumstances we should not have met until the month of May, but we feel that to have held this matter over until then might have been construed into indifference or unwillingness on our part to look into the matter at once. We have therefore held a special meeting. We are quite unable to find anything tending to bias for or against any person or party, or that the circular was used for the purpose of "agitation," as your letter suggests. On the contrary, it is satisfactorily established by the minutes of the Vestry and its Finance Committee, which have been produced to us, q 18 that the circular in question was agreed upon on 24th September, before any Candidate had publicly announced himself, and more than six weeks before it could definitely have been known whether or not a contest would take place. Every member of the Vestry had a copy of the circular sent to him on 10th October, and it was unanimously agreed to on 14th idem, at a thoroughly representative meeting of the Vestry, in public, at which fifty-five members were present. Your letter implies either a want of knowledge of the Metropolis Local Management Acts, or that a School Rate of a Shilling in the £ is not a "public concern," to the remedying of which the Vestry, as the rating authority, have a full legal right to call the attention of the ratepayers. The object of the circular is so transparent on the face of it, that it is difficult to understand how any unbiassed person could interpret it otherwise than as a reminder to the ratepayers that the then coming election would afford them an opportunity of improving that of which they had so frequently complained—the inexcusably excessive rate necessary for School Board purposes. It is a matter of surprise to us that so important a body as the School Board for London should have acted with so much precipitancy, and with so little apparent appreciation of the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts as their letter discloses ; and we fear that it is but an additional proof that resolutions of the Board are too often passed hastily and without due consideration. You will not therefore expect us to take any steps to prevent an expenditure of which we, as the duly elected representatives of the ratepayers, entirely approve. We are, Sir, Your obedient Servants, (Signed) ROBERT E. II. GOFFIN, Chairman, * ( „ ) R. MORGAN, ( „ ) T. BULL, ( „ ) THOMAS HENRY HOBBS, ( ,, ) C. T. COWLEY, The Auditor/ elected, under the Metropolii Local Management Acti. The Yestry accorded the elected auditors their best thanks for their public-spirited and prompt conduct in the matter. 19 STREET IMPROVEMENTS. After negotiations extending over more than two years, the vestry were successful in carrying out the improvement at the corner of Caxton-street and Great Chapel-street, 1,067 feet super, in Caxton-street, and 615 feet in Great Chapel-street being added to the public way. The cost of the land was £3,000 (raised by a loan), and of making up the new footway and roadway £500, which, with an instalment in repayment of the loan, was provided for in the current rates. An improvement in Greencoat-row and Cobourg-row was secured by an arrangement with Messrs. Tyrrell Lewis and Co. on behalf of the Army and Navy Co-operative and Auxiliary Societies, whereby the Vestry consented to the closing of St. Margaret's-passage in consideration of certain land in Cobourg-row being surrendered to the public use. A very desirable improvement at the north-east end of Great Peter-street engaged the attention of the Vestry's Works Committee, and although the matter had not been brought to a completion at the close of the year, it may be stated here that there is every likelihood of Great Peterstreet being widened by the setting back of Messrs. Burroughes and Watts' premises on the north side of the street; and that St. Ann's-street will in connection therewith, be widened. The improvement will be effected by the exchange of certain land in St. Ann's-court and of other land in St. Ann's-street, acquired for the purpose of the exchange, and the cost is estimated to be £4,220, exclusive of the works. The Vestry were also occupied in the consideration of a proposed roadway across the site of the late Artillery brewery, so as to connect Victoria-street with Rochester 20 Row, and thus open up direct communication with Pimlico and Belgravia; but the proposal had not assumed a definite shape at the close of the year. Three new roads were created in the parish by private enterprise:—(a) from Howick-place to Francis-street, named "Thirleby Gardens"; (b) between Whitehall and Victoria Embankment, named "Horse Guards Avenue"; (c) and the Imperial Institute Road at Kensington-gore; but neither had been opened at the date of this report. Small street improvements were also carried out in Lancelot-place, Howick-place, and Wood-street. . LOANS. The Vestry obtained in the beginning of the year a loan of £4,100 from the London County Council, for constructing stabling and other works at the Vestry's new wharf at No. 167, Grosvenor-road, and for purchasing plant and horses, and another loan of £1,000 for the construction of the underground convenience in Whitehall. Two loans of £8,000 and £2,300 in respect of wood and asphalte paving works respectively were also taken up, and one of £3,000 (repayable in 49 years) for defraying the cost of the improvement in Caxton street and Great Chapel-street. The last instalment of a loan of £7,000, negotiated in 1885, was paid during the year. The total indebtedness of the parish at the close of the year (see Table on page 67) was £31,808.

ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, Ending March, 1892, BY BARNARD HOLT, E.R.C.S., Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the United Vestry. Gentlemen, As is my usual custom, I shall commence with recording the number of births and deaths that have been returned during the year, and shall afterwards place before you, in detail, the several interesting sanitary improvements that have been effected during the year. The number of births registered during the present year has been 732 males and 717 females, or a total of 1,449 births, while the deaths have numbered 599 males and 549 females, or a total of 1,148 deaths; from these, however, have to be deducted 46 as having been due to accidents, which reduces the actual number to 1,102. The deaths during the year 1891 were 1,099, thus showing an increase of 3 as compared with the previous year. The following is a tabular statement of births and deaths arranged as to sex :— 25 BIRTHS AND DEATHS FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1892. Month. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Corrected.

The increase in diarrhœa is 11, and in fever 4, but in whooping cough there is a marked decrease, having 22 deaths this year whilst there wore 34 in 1891. The death-rate has boon as nearly as possible 18. Compulsory notification of disease— This continues to bo of the greatest assistance. The inspectors are enabled to take immediate steps to improve the sanitary conditions of the dwellings, and in the majority of cases with the very best results, and this has boon much helped in many instances by the kind promptitude of the medical gentlemen reporting cases. 27 Public Health Act (Clauses re Underground Dwellings):— In accordance with the instructions of this Act which has lately come into force, a strict and continued investigation is now being carried out, and the result reported to me weekly. The inspectors' books furnish the most minute particulars on the subject, and can be referred to at any moment. As a detailed report of all the sanitary improvements that have been effected has been placed before you at each monthly meeting, and as such report has been already published, I do not consider it necessary to refer further to the matter in the present annual report. An accurate record is kept in each inspector's book and can always be referred to. Places where the greatest number of cases have occurred:— Measles—Peabody-buildings, 80; Tufton-street, 44; Horseferry-road, 21; Cobourg-row, 16 ; Vauxhall-bridge-road, 15. Scarlet Fever—Peabody-buildings, 21; Spencer-buildings, 9 ; Douglas-gardens, 7. Diphtheria did not in any case reach higher than 3 in a street, and that only in Eutland-yard. The following is a table of cases notified each month during the past year, and also the deaths that occurred of the undermentioned diseases:— Measles. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Erysipelas.

Total Deaths—58. 28 Measles have been most prevalent since December, each succeeding month this year having increased, 39 of the 612 cases having proved fatal. Scarlet Fever was most prevalent in July, when there were 20 cases, but it is very satisfactory to notice that out of 125 cases reported there has not been a single death. Diphtheria has averaged 4 cases a month, the highest number (8) was in January, and out of the 48 cases there have been 9 deaths. Erysipelas.—The highest number of cases was in May, when there were 10, otherwise it has been about the rate of 5 a month, and no death has been reported as actually arising from this disorder. Enteric Fever.—There have been 18 cases and 6 deaths. During the last three months, out of the 156 deaths that occurred from bronchitis or pneumonia, only 21 were the result of attacks that had followed upon Influenza, and these were in a decreasing rate, viz :—11 in January, 9 in February, and 1 in March. The reports of the inspectors of St. Margaret's and St. John's are appended to this report, and show that in St. Margaret's 1,651 houses have been visited, and in St. John's 1643, making a total of 3,294. The details of the work done is also shown. In September a practical synopsis of the new Public Health Act was laid before the Vestry to apprise them of the important enlargement of their duties which Parliament had entrusted to them. This report appears to have been of some service in having led to a much needed re-organization of the sanitary department, the requirements of which were set out in the following manner:— Extracts from Report, 23rd September, 1891. This imperfect synopsis would be valueless without some practical suggestions as to the organisation of a sanitary department, which shall be equal to the duties henceforth to be expected of it. It will be mere folly to attempt to meet these obligations with the two inspectors now employed. The 94th section alone will give more than sufficient work for one properly qualified man if the hundreds of lodging-houses are to be systematically inspected at regular intervals, not to speak of the heavy initial labour and constant supervision afterwards in connection with the underground rooms. Nor need I recapitulate the duties in relation to smoke, or to workshops, or to disinfection, all of which are increased by this Act. 29 Besides these matters there is the vast addition to the clerical work, by way of notices, registration, and reports to reduce the time available for out-door work. To expect more from the present inspectors is a mistake. They are already engaged early and late in order to keep their work under control. I am not ambitious that Westminster should excel the other parishes in its sanitary administration. I shall be content if it reaches an average standard of efficiency, and is able to give a good account of the new and important duties now placed in the hands of the Yestry. I have thought over the matter very carefully during the past month, and should be false to the responsibility reposed in me if I did not submit the following as a minimum addition to the executive staff:— (a.) A properly qualified sanitary inspector for lodging-house work, but to be interchanged with the other inspectors if required, at .£120 per annum, with the same scale of increase as the others. (b.) A clerk for the sanitary department at £'60 or £70 per annum, with a sufficient increment to make it worth his while to stay for a few years at least. I would recommend that the third inspector be engaged before the end of the present year so that he would be as absolutely under the Vestry's control as the present officers are. Notwithstanding that an appointment of an officer after the 1st January next might enable the Yestry to obtain reimbursement of half the salary (sec. 108) such appointment would be subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, and, in my opinion, the independence of central control in so simple a matter is worth half the salary. I am not asking for a clerk for the inspectors, but for the general clerical work for the department. This is now done by the inspectors at the cost of much of the outdoor work. There are numbers of forms to fill up, returns and reports to write out, and registers to keep at present; what there will be in January under all these bye-laws and new regulations, it is impossible to predict. Personally, I shall be relieved by such help, if a young fellow of sufficient intelligence, and capable of taking down dictation at shorthand, be chosen, although I should continue the £30 a year I now pay for help of this kind. There would be the advantage, in such an appointment, of having someone acquainted with the work always in attendance at the office to answer enquiries and generally to attend to the business of the department. The salaries of these two persons would be less than £200 a year, and if the Vestry are able to discharge all their new duties for this outlay, they will, in my opinion, make an economical arrangement. To enable me to obtain all the details and measurements of the underground rooms, a temporary man will be required for that special work which may occupy a couple of months or more. When once the register is compiled, the duty of periodical inspection will devolve upon the lodging-house officer. I fully expect, however, that the making out of the register of lodging-houses which will necessitate ascertaining the exact cubical capacity of every room, will occupy at least six months, 30 Extract from Minutes of Vestry, 23rd September, 1891. Submitted a report by the medical officer of health upon the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Copies of the report referred to had been forwarded to members. It was moved by H. Bowman Spink, seconded by Mr. Overseer Spencer Smith, and Resolved—That the thanks of the Yestry be given to the medical officer of health for his valuable synopsis of the new Act, and that the report be referred to the Sanitary Committee with instructions to bring up such recommendations as in their opinion will be necessary to give effect thereto. Extract from Minutes of Vestry, 11 th November, 1891. 12. The Committee have given careful consideration to the suggestions of the medical officer of health, as to the necessity for an increase to the staff in his department in order to cope, as far as possible, with the multifarious duties henceforth to be performed. Dealing with the permanent staff, the Committee have to recommend— (a.) That an additional inspector, properly qualified, between 33 and 45 years of age, be appointed for lodging-house work, but to be interchanged with the other inspectors if required, at a commencing salary of £120 per annum, rising by annual increments of £5 to a maximum of £150; that such appointment be made before 1st January next; and that it be referred back to the Committee to issue advertisements and to select and send up for the choice of the Vestry not less than four candidates. (b) That a clerk between 18 and 21 years of; age, be appointed for the sanitary department at a commencing salary of £60, rising by annual increment of £10, to a maximum of £100; that it be referred to the Finance Committee to proceed in accordance with the 31st Bye-law with reference to the issue of advertisements and the sending up of candidates for the choice of the Vestry. 13. For the first twelve months, probably, the time of the additional inspector would be wholly occupied in taking the dimensions and other particulars essential to the compilation of a register of the tenement houses, after which it would be his duty to see that the regulations applicable thereto were observed. If he were transferred from either of these duties to deal with the underground work, it is obvious that his work would fall into arrear. To avoid this, and to avoid the underground rooms being left without attention during the progress of the work in the tenement houses, The Committee recommend that a temporary inspector be engaged week by week for a period not exceeding six months, at wages not exceeding two guineas, to obtain and register the details and measurements of the underground rooms as required by section 96 ; and that it be referred back to the Committee to make such engagement. 31 14. The Committee feel that they cannot conclude their report and recommendations on this important measure without alluding to the valuable assistance rendered to the Vestry by the exhaustive resume of the new Act supplied by the medical officer of health; and they recommend that the Vestry mark their appreciation thereof by according him their thanks. Resolved—That the appointment of an additional inspector be postponed until the Act shall have come into operation. 6m&n. It was moved by Mr. H. N. B. Spink, seconded by Mr. J. Fergusson, and Resolved—That the recommendations contained in paragraphs 12 (b) and 13, be also adjourned until after the Act shall have come into operation. 5o. Resolved unanimously—That the acts, proceedings, and recommendation of the Street Cleansing and Sanitary Committee, as novr submitted in paragraph No. 14 of their report be and they are hereby approved and adopted; and that the thanks of the Vestry be accorded to the medical officer of health for the exhaustive and valuable resume of the Public Health (London) Act. Extract f rom Vestry Minutes, 23rd December, 1891. 17. Read a letter from Inspector Ashdown, dated 17th December, resigning his position in consequence of having obtained a better appointment under the Board of Works for St. Olave's District, and asking for a testimonial from the Vestry in respect of his service. It was moved by Mr. J. Fergusson, seconded by Mr. H. O. Hamborg, and Resolved unanimously—That Mr. Ashdown be granted a testimonial under the common seal of the Vestry. Extract from Vestry Minutes, 13th January, 1892. Report of Medical Officer. Gentlemen, The resignation of Inspector Ashdown compels me to bring under your notice the impossibility of my being enabled to conduct the sanitary supervision of the united parishes without efficient aid, and I very much regret that you have considered it necessary to receive Inspector Ashdown's resignation when the matter in question was simply a difference of £30 in his salary. He was a very zealous inspector who thoroughly understood his work, who was not to be bribed, and who performed the duties of his office to my entire satisfaction, and, if it is determined that he is to leave, I feel he can hardly be replaced; I am of opinion, too, that if any other officer is to be appointed, none but a thoroughly experienced person who has gone through a sanitary training should be elected. The evil, however, does not terminate here, as the other inspector, Dee, also a most valuable officer, will retire as soon as be can get another appointment at an increased salary. If the matter of expense 32 were the only thing to be considered I would advise you to dismiss both the inspectors and re-elect them, by which half their salary would be paid by the County Council. At the present time it is impossible to do the work as thoroughly as I should like, and it would be utterly useless to appoint anyone who has not the qualifications I require. I exceedingly regret that the report you presented to the vestry in November should have been postponed, but, such being the case, the time has now arrived when it should be again put before them. The Act is now in operation and I cannot for one moment believe that, as a sanitary authority, you will forego the advantages you will derive from duly carrying out the intentions of the Act. I will with pleasure attend the next meeting of the Vestry and confirm your desire to strenuously enforce the recommendations your report contained; but the Committee ought to know that at the present time nothing whatever is being done towards putting into operation any of the important and extended powers which the new Act places in the Vestry's hands. If this is the desire of individual members in the interests of the owners of small property, I cannot for a moment imagine it to be the desire of the Vestry. Nothing more than has hitherto been in practice is attempted, nor can it be attempted so long as the appointment of additional help is refused; in fact, when Inspector Ashdown leaves (on 20th inst.) the work of the sanitary department will be almost at a deadlock, instead of advancing according to the spirit of the times. If there is no way of retaining Inspector Ashdown, I would suggest that when you advertise for a man to fill his place you should also advertise for the additional man proposed in my report last September. The question of a temporary man for the under-ground rooms for a couple of months is so small a matter that its being refused is the more surprising, while the appointment of a clerk to keep some of the many books and forms, and thus avoid employing out-door officers on in-door work is not only economical but absolutely necessary, if the sanitary work of the parish is to be organised in a creditable manner. Report of Sanitary Committee. Having regard to the superior qualifications now expected of inspectors, and to the higher salaries men possessing such qualifications are able to command, and after giving the whole question their most careful consideration, the Committee feel called upon to submit the following recommendations, which are, for the most part, and with the addition of the changes consequent upon Inspector Ashdown's resignation, those which were made in their report to the Vestry 011 11th November, £.and which were then adjourned until after the new Public Health Act had come into operation:— a. That the necessary steps be taken at a special meeting to revise the terms of Inspector Dee's engagement by fixing his salary as from 1st February, at £150, rising by conditional annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £"200. b. That advertisements be issued inviting candidates for the vacant inspectorship, between 30 and 45 years of age, to possess the certificate of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, at a salary of £150, rising by conditional annual 33 increments of £10 to a maximum of £200, and that it be referred back to the committee to select and send up for the choice of the Vestry not less than four candidates. c. That an additional inspector, possessing the certificate of the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, and to be between 30 and 45 years of age, be appointed for lodging-house work, but to be interchanged with the other inspectors if required, at a salary of £130, rising by conditional annual increments of £10 to £150, and that the same course be pursued as to advertising and selecting candidates, as is proposed with reference to the foregoing vacancy. d. That a clerk between 18 and 21 years of age be appointed for the sanitary department at a commencing salary of £00, rising by annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £100 ; that it be referred to the Finance Committee to proceed in accordance with the 31st Bye-law with reference to the issue of advertisements and the sending up of candidates for the choice of the Vestry. c. For the first twelve months, probably, the time of the additional inspector would be wholly occupied in taking the dimensions and other particulars essential to the compilation of a register for the tenement houses, after which it would be his duty to see that the regulations applicable thereto were observed. If he were transferred from either of these duties to deal with the underground rooms, it is obvious that his work would fall into arrear. To avoid this, and to avoid the underground rooms being left without attention during the progress of the work in the tenement houses, The Committee recommend that a temporary inspector be engaged week by week for a period not exceeding two months, at wages not exceeding two guineas, to obtain and register the details and measurements of the underground rooms as required by section 96 of the Public Health Act; and that it be referred back to the Committee to make such engagement. Extract from Vestry Minutes, 21tli January, 1892. In view of the strong opinions expressed at the last Vestry, when the recommendation of the Committee with regard to the appointment of a successor to inspector Ashdown was before them, the Committee have considered the subject further, before incurring the expense and causing the inconvenience to applicants incidental to the issue of advertisements. The Committee have borne in mind the qualifications possessed by Inspector Lightfoot, and have received strong testimony from the medical officer of health as to the inspector's character and capabilities. The surveyor has also stated that in consequence of the satisfactory arrangements under which the removal of refuse is now carried out, he can, without impairing the efficiency of the service, easily arrange for the transfer of Inspector Lightfoot from his department to the medical officer of health, without needing to employ any other help in his place. Mr. Lightfoot's other appointment (as revised on 13th March, 1889) is in the following terms :— "That the salary of Inspector Lightfoot be raised to £120 as from 1st April proximo, and be further increased by conditional annual increments of £5 to a maximum of £150." D 34 Under the altered circumstances the Committee have instructed the clerk to withhold for the present the advertisement ordered by the Vestry, and have agreed upon the following recommendation for altering the terms of Inspector Lightfoot's present appointment, in order to avoid a re-appointment and the consequent part control of the London County Council and the Local Government Board :— That the necessary steps be taken at a special meeting of the Vestry to alter the terms of Inspector Lightfoot's appointment by substituting the words, "£150 as from the 1st February proximo, to be increased by conditional annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £200," in place of the words, " £120 as from 1st April proximo, and be further increased by conditional annual increments of £5 to a maximum of £150." The Committee have engaged Mr. John Foster as temporary inspector for the measurement and registration of underground rooms, at weekly wages of £2 2s. 0d., subject to a week's notice on either side, the engagement to terminate at the expiration of eight weeks. Extract from Vestry "Minutes, 10th February, 1892. (1) That the following resolution of the Yestry on the 13th March, 1889 (5b):— "That Thomas George Dee be and he is hereby appointed Inspector of Nuisances, Pavements, &c., during the pleasure of the vestry, at a salary of £120, rising by annual increments of £5 to a maximum of £150, he to reside in the parish, to devote the whole of his time to the duties of his office, and to carry out the various duties specified in the existing regulations, and such as may be hereafter added by the Vestry, the engagement to be subject to one month's notice on either side," be altered so as to read as follows:— "That Thomas George Dee be and he is hereby appointed Inspector of Nuisances, Pavements, &c., during the pleasure of the Vestry, at a salary of £150, rising by conditional annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £200, he to reside in the Parish, to devote the whole of his time to the duties of bis office, and to carry out the various duties specified in the existing regulations, and such as may be hereafter added by the Vestry, the engagement to be subject to one month's notice on either side." (2) That the following resolution of the Vestry on the 13th March, 1889 : — "That the salary of Inspector Lightfoot be raised to £120 as from 1st April proximo, and be further increased by conditional annual increments of £5 to a maximum of £150," be altered so as to read as follows :— "That the salary of Inspector Lightfoot be raised to £150 as from 1st February instant, to be increased by conditional annual increments of £10 to a maximum of £200." 35 Extract from Vestry Minutes, 9th March, 1892.

STREET CLEANSING, STREET WATERING, AND REMOVAL OF HOUSE REFUSE, The remarks upon these services assume a new feature in the report which I annually present, inasmuch as the services have only been under the direct control of the department since March, 1891. Without endeavouring to laud the department, the following statement is put forward as a resume of the work which has actually been performed during the 12 months ended 25th March, and as the work had previously been performed under the contract system, no real comparison can be set out in this report. The Vestry have, however, only to remember the condition of the streets when in the hands of the contractor, and to notice their condition under the existing circumstances, to be convinced of the advantage to the public comfort, which has taken place in consequence of the change. In the removal of house refuse, which is a matter the Vestry have not so many opportunities of observing, the endeavour, at all times, has been to fall in with the wishes of every occupier; and ns an evidence that the effort has met with success, I would state that the number of requests for removal, made at my office, has fallen to ten per cent, of that received during the contract system. In this service a fall of snow is now not such a grave matter as it was in previous years, inasmuch as during the storms in January on inconvenience whatever was experienced by any inhabitant in consequence of non-removal of dust. The difficulty of cleansing the street after a snow storm has always been great, but the extra duty imposed upon the Vestry in the passing of the Public Health Act, 1891, has enormously increased the responsibility, and added to the amount which 45 ratepayers have to contribute to local rates. Although there has been no failure in performing all the duties which the Vestry are now bound to carry out, I feel that should a succession of heavy snow falls occur the resources of the Vestry will be considerably taxed, and it will then be apparent to every one that great care ought to be taken in ascertaining that a radical change in legislation is really required. The evils of the contract system were apparent Avhen I commenced operations, for I found that a large quantity of dust had not been removed. This dust, which I style a "legacy," was a great hindrance, and, in addition to necessitating the employment of extra horses and carts, it was not until the end of April that I could settle down to a proper system. The only fluctuations which have since occurred have been in consequence of the changes in the weather and in the continual extension of building operations. The plant has during the year been increased to the extent to which I estimated in November, 1889, and as the public requirements extend by the growing demand for a more frequent removal, so must the plant be increased. Should a daily collection be insisted upon twice the existing plant will be necessary to perform the service. I am confident, however, that on sanitary grounds the public would be benefited. The accommodation for shooting house refuse is daily becoming scarcer, and I anticipate that in a very short time the Vestry must seriously entertain the question of disposal by other means than the present one. The erection of destructors is a matter which deserves carefnl consideration, as power is thereby obtained to generate electricity, and to produce steam for other purposes besides which the Vestry rids itself of the refuse without paying the heavy cost of freightage. During the year 32,002 yards of dust were collected, of which 30,604 yards were barged away at a cost of £1,487 18s. 10d., and 1,398 yards were taken at a cost of £54 7s. 4d. by the Refuse Disposal Company. The cost of barging the 15,241 yards of slop, which was removed from the roads, amounted to £1,270 1s. 8d. The horses which were purchased at an average of £62 14s. Od. each, were, at the close of the year, valued at an average of £64 11s 6d.; and the cost of keeping, including veterinary attendance, shoeing, etc., has been 17s. 2½d per week. 46 The total expenditure, as shown in the following account, amounts to ,£10,584 14s. l0d. £ s. d. £ s. d. Wages 4,382 3 11 Gas 45 12 0 Water 24 17 6 Horse hire 397 2 3 Barging and disposal of dust and slop 2,812 7 10 Fodder 1,008 0 5 Veterinary attendance, shoeing, &c. 185 3 8 Sundries 403 18 11 9,259 6 6 Rents, interest, and repayment of loans 1,325 8 4 £10,584 14 10 The increase in expenditure for these services is not confined to this parish, for in Holborn, with 16 miles of streets, the cost under the contract system has increased £1,500, while in Chelsea the tenders submitted for collection of dust alone went up from 2. 9d. to 4s. per load It is satisfactory to note that the latter Vestry have decided to execute the work with their own staff. LIGHTING. The 1,382 lamps in the parish have been properly lighted and maintained by the Gas Light and Coke Company and Her Majesty's Office of Works. MAINTENANCE OF SEWERS AND GULLIES. All the brick and pipe sewers have been flushed, cleansed, and disinfected, and the gullies have been regularly emptied, disinfected, and flushed with water. The drainage of the following streets has been improved by the construction of new gullies or by the re-construction of old gullies.

The old surface ventilations have been closed, and an iron pipe fixed to the building and carried above the roof at a cost of £17. In consequence of the difficulty of obtaining access to the sewer in Grey Coat-place a side entrance was constructed, and at the same time the ventilation of the sewer was improved at a cost of £80. There being indications that that portion of Tufton-street between Wood street and College-street would undergo a great change through building operations, and as a sewer did not exist under the whole of that part of the street and the old sewer being very defective, a sewer about 320 feet in length was constructed with invert blocks at a cost of £445. Portions of the sewer inverts were re-constructed in Cobourgrow at a cost of £97, and in Old Pye-street at a cost of £75. About 220 feet of invert blocks were laid in the Dacre-street sewer at a cost of £157. whitehall convenience. This convenience continues to be used very much by the public and I am confident that the Vestry would, by constructing conveniences in suitable situations, be conferring a great boon, especially to the female portion of the public. To prevent the flooding of this convenience in times of high tide and storms a special valve and syphon has been fixed at a cost of £11 and is working very satisfactorily. urinals. The whole of the urinals have received daily attention and the automatic flushing tanks which have been fixed are working well and effect a great saving of the expenditure upon water. 48 The brick urinal which had stood for some years outside the St. John's-gardens, Horseferry-road, has been demolished on account of its dilapidated condition, and a 3-stall iron urinal erected at a cost of £22 3s. 0d. In conclusion, I would say that every credit is clue to the superintendent and horsekceper, who have worked together with a view to carry out their duties efficiently and economically; and although the estimates have been slightly exceeded I feel that the parish has reaped a benefit through the Vestry's decision to annihilate the system of cleansing and watering the streets, and removing house refuse by contract. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, G. R. W. WHEELER, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor. APPENDIX No. 4.

Vestry Offices, Town Hall, Westminster, S. W. Gentlemen, Pursuant to the instructions of your Committee we have examined the Books and Accounts of the United Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, in relation to the General, School Board, Sewers and Montpelier-square Rates, for the year ended 25th March last, in accordance with the Specification. We find the Summary Statements and Balance Sheet prepared for the Elected Auditors to be duly vouched and true Abstracts of the several Accounts from the books of the Vestry. In connection with the examination of the Collectors' Accounts, the present practice of detaching receipts from the current receipt books on the issue of warrants is, in our opinion, unsatisfactory and inconvenient for the purposes of Audit. We would recommend that this practice should be discontinued, and that instead each collector should be supplied with a separate receipt book (printed, if thought desirable, in blank so as to be available from one year to another) solely for the issue of warrant receipts. We are, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, (Signed) EDWARD MOORE & SONS. 51 APPENDIX No. 6. REPORT OF THE ELECTED AUDITORS, upon their examination of the vestry's accounts, for the year ended at lady-day, 1892. To the United Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster. Gentlemen, Having been elected by the ratepayers to enquire into the accounts of the Vestry, we have at this, our fourth sitting, completed that duty to the best of our ability, in so far as concerns the financial year ended at Lady-Day last. We have seen that every receipt has been duly credited, and have examined every voucher, and every entry in the Vestry's cash book and the Clerk's cash book; but we have awaited, as in past years, the report of the professional Accountants upon their laborious checking of the thousands of counterfoils, rate-postings, and other details which originate in the cash books. That report, which has been laid before us to-day, so fully confirms the result of our own independent comparison, as to afford us pleasure in stating that we have found everything straightforward and satisfactory, as indeed might have been expected from the evidence we found of a regular system of examination by the Finance Committee. 52 By availing ourselves of access to the poor rate accounts we are enabled to ascertain that the total receipts for the year amounted to £217,878, and the total disbursements to £212,841, of which it appears that only £50,119 is expended by the Vestry upon local purposes. A similar statement to that issued in recent years relating to the rates given in charge but not recovered, has been again approved by us as giving a valuable and, as we think, a highly creditable view of the rate collectors' work. From this statement, which we have appended hereto,* it will be seen that the total amount of the rates given in collection was £191,148 2s. 4¾d., and that £179,336 8s. 10½d. of that sum was actually received. Of the £10,542 5s. 6¼d. which was not recovered no less than £7,066 18s. 8sd. was due to properties being empty. The audit has this year been marked by a refreshing—we had almost said an amusing—novelty in the attendance of the School Board for London by their solicitor, as "a ratepayer," to object to the allowance of certain expenses incurred by the Vestry in the autumn of last year, in view of the then approaching election. The skilful arguments of the solicitor, and his warning of the probable application for a writ of certiorari alike fail to alter the views communicated to the School Board in December last in reply to their peremptory and dictatorial letter; but as we furnished the Vestry with a copy of the correspondence at the time, and as we are now required to state in the books our reasons for allowing such expenses, we need not trouble the Vestry further here with the subject, than to state that the amount in question is £33 10s., of which £25 was for 6,000 stamps, £7 0s. 6d. for printing and envelopes, and £1 9s. 6d. for addressing the latter. We feel it our duty to add, however, that conceiving ourselves to be entrusted by the ratepayers with the impartial oversight in their interests of the Vestry's expenditure—and the * This return is given at pages 70 and 71 53 Vestry would probably have been the first to expect it of us— we should have stood with equal firmness in disallowing the expenditure had it been illegal or against the interests of the parish.

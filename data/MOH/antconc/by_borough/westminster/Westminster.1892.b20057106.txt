EVERY effort to excite the interest of the parishioners in the proceedings of the Vestry by means of their Annual Reports having failed, the Vestry do not feel called upon to present more than the briefest possible summary of their proceedings as the report required by the statute. The considerations which induced them to curtail the cost of printing were recited in the last issue, wherein it was stated that the average sale during each of the last four years had been less than eight copies. In the twelve months ended at Lady-day last only eleven copies were purchased, although the 8,800 ratepayers had been individually informed, as in previous years, by a memorandum od the rate demand-notes, that copies were obtainable on payment of two-pence each. THE WARD ELECTIONS. Besides the thirty-two vacancies caused by the effluxion of time, one remained unfilled from the preceding election, one was caused by death, and two by resignation. The elections took place on 25th May, 1892, and on the following day, when a poll was taken in Ward No. 3, of St. John's. A seat remained vacant in this ward after the election in consequence of a resignation having been received too late. Twenty-three retiring members were returned to their B 2 seats, two former members were reinstated after an interval, and eleven new members were elected, viz:— Mr. Frederick Barnes „ Henry Alexander Savage „ James Edward Sinclair, L.R.C.P., L.R.C.S. „ Abraham Steer „ Charles Perugia Mr. William Donald Smallpeice, L. R . C . P., M.R.C.S. „ James Ludford „ Richard Morgan Col. Thomas Davies Sewell Mr. Alfred Brown Mr. William Wheeler. The total cost of the election and poll was £20 13s. 6d., being £14 13s. 6d. for the notices and other expenses incidental to the nominations in the six wards, and £6 in respect of the poll. MEETINGS. For the transaction of the parochial business 142 meetings were held during the year. A tabular return, showing the attendances of members individually, is given as an appendix (No. 1) at page 16. THE VESTRY. There were twenty-three meetings of the Vestry held during the year, four of which were "special," one was an ordinary meeting held specially, and one an adjourned meeting. The Chair. The Chairman of the vestry for the greater number of the meetings was Mr. Churchwarden Zephaniah King. Mr. Churchwarden Hunt, Mr. Overseer C. Spencer Smith, Mr. J. Brend Batten and Mr. Thomas Horn presided occasionally. Votes of Condolence. On the death of Mr. John Ash by being announced, the Vestry Unanimously passed a vote of sympathy and condolence with the family; 3 and a similar resolution was passed on the death of Mr. G. Barber. Vote of Regret. The Vestry learnt, with regret, of the resignation of Mr. Charles Palmer, and expressed sympathy with him in the circumstances which deprived them of the co-operation of one whose disinterested services to the parish had always been highly esteemed. Votes of Thanks. The thanks of the Vestry were accorded as under:— To the Trustees of the Parochial Charities for their report upon the Duchess of Somerset's Hospital Charity at Froxfield, Wiltshire, so far as it concerns Westminster. To the Elected Auditors for their examination of the Vestry's accounts and for their report thereon. To Mr. Thomas Horn for his present of the " Transactions of the Seventh International Congress on Hygiene and Demography." To the Vestry Clerk for an essay entitled " St. John the Evangelist, Westminster, Parochial Memorials." Resignations. Resignations were received during the year from Mr. C. Voyce, a representative of Ward No. 3, St. John, Mr. C. Palmer and Mr. Myer Isaacs, both representatives of Ward No. 2, St. John. Time of Meeting. A proposal to alter the hour of meeting from four to six o'clock, introduced by Mr. Tunstall on 22nd June, was not accepted by the Chairman, as being informal under the circumstances. The formalities having been observed, however, the question was debated, and a division taken upon it on 12th October, when there were 7 for and 38 against the motion. THE FINANCE COMMITTEE. Twenty-eight sittings of this Committee were held during the twelve months, at the first of which Mr. C. C. Piper and Mr. W. M. Scudamore were respectively re-appointed Chairman and Vice-Chairman. In addition 4. to the superintendence of the rate collection, the checking of the accounts, the negotiation of loans, and the supervision of the office staff, the committee have considered and reported upon the relative merits of the alternative methods of repaying loans—that of equal annual instalments of principal, with interest on the outstanding balance, and . that of principal and interest combined, by way of terminable annuity. The committee also conducted a prolonged correspondence with the Charity Commission and the Corporation of London with reference to the Duchess of Somerset's Hospital charity at Froxfield, Wiltshire. WORKS AND GENERAL PURPOSES COMMITTEE. This Committee have held twenty-four meetings during the year, at the first of which they appointed Mr. Thomas Horn, their Chairman, and Mr. Joseph BrowneMartin, their Vice-Chairman. No attempt can here be made to give even the briefest sketch of the multiplicity and diversity of the matters which come under the consideration of this Committee. Nor does this appear to be necessary when it is remembered that at every meeting of the Vestry the Committee present full and explanatory reports upon questions of wood and asphalte paving, drainage, lighting, obstructions, street nomenclature, street refuges, sewer ventilation, vaults, hoardings, urinals, electric lighting, new roads, and other matters. The question of open spaces, which comes within the purview of this Committee, has been dealt with in several reports, with special reference to the importance of obtaining the reservation of a portion of the Millbank prison site as a recreation ground for Westminster. The matter was pending at the close of the year. In the course of their negotiations upon this scheme, the Committee waited as a deputation upon the Right Hon. G. J. Shaw-Lefevre, 5 First Commissioner of H.M. Works, to commend a proposal for the formation of a new road across the site of the prison in continuation of Earl-street. The decision of the Government was awaited at Lady-day. the sanitary committee. This Committee have assembled twenty times, Mr. H. Bowman Spink having been re-appointed to the Chair and Mr. Fergusson to the Vice-Chair at the first meeting. The enforcement of the Acts affecting the public health devolves upon this Committee, and necessarily gives a routine form to much of their business. This has been varied, however, by the preparation of sets of bye-laws required by the Public Health Act of 1891 ; by the consideration of the steps to be taken upon the retirement of Inspector Lightfoot, through ill-health, and by the discussion of various points of practice occasioned by the new duties imposed by recent legislation. Under the orders of the Committee ninety-three samples of food and drugs have been purchased and submitted to the public analyst. The results are shown by the following statement:— Articles purchased. No, of Samples. Genuine. Adulterated. Convictions. Arrowroot 3 3 - — Butter 20 14 6 5 Coffee 3 2 1 1 Condensed Milk 22 22 — — Flour 3 3 — — Ice Cream 6 6 — — Milk 27 21 6 4 Mustard 3 3 — — Pepper 3 3 — — Vinegar 3 3 - - Total 93 80 13 10 6 the parliamentary committee. The Parliamentary Committee, of which Mr. J. Brend Batten was re-appointed Chairman, and Mr. Thomas Horn, Vice-Chairman, met four times, for the examination of the several Bills and Parliamentary schemes affecting the parish. the joint works and sanitary committee. The business of this Committee has necessitated seventeen meetings, the chairmanship having been voted to Mr. Thomas Horn, and the Vice-chairmanship to Mr. Charles Wright, of St. Margaret's. Being entrusted with all the powers of the Vestry in relation to the street cleansing, watering and dusting service, the Committee have invited tenders and entered into the contracts required by that branch of the Vestry's duties. The other important matters dealt with have been the preparation of the plans for the Coroner's court and the new public mortuary in the Horseferry-road, the purchase of a parcel of land in Monck-street for a store-yard and depot, and the question of constructing a much needed underground convenience at Knightsbridge. town hall management. The Town Hall buildings, together with the freehold site, the fixtures, fittings, and furniture are vested by statute in the Churchwardens and Overseers for the time being. To assist them in the management of the building, these gentlemen annually invite the co-operation of four members of the Vestry who have passed the office of churchwarden or overseer. Under an arrangement entered into in 1883 the Board of Churchwardens and Overseers provide all necessary offices for the Vestry's business, with rooms 7 for the various meetings, and with lighting, warming, cleaning, and attendance, for the annual rent of £300. This sum is insufficient to pay the rates and taxes. After meeting the other disbursements incidental to the Vestry's occupation, defraying the expenses of maintaining the building, and providing for the outlay occasioned by the numerous lettings, the surplus of income over expenditure, which surplus amounted this year to £29 13s 4d.,is paid to the Poor Rate. It may be mentioned that the wages to servants and cleaners amounted to £455 5s. 10d., and the cost of lighting, to £344 17s. 2d. during the twelve months. The other items of expenditure are shown in the abstract of accounts as passed by the District Auditor of the Local Government Board, which abstract is printed as an Appendix (No. 13) at page 62. executive. Changes in the official staff have occurred by the resignation of Mr. John White, Collector for Ward No. 2 St. Margaret, to whom a retiring allowance of £100 was granted. Mr. Heather, one of the office clerks, was appointed to assist in the Ward until the close of the year. Inspector Lightfoot resigned after a prolonged absence from illness, and was voted a superannuation allowance of £60. The vacancy thereby caused, as well as that occasioned by Mr. Heather's promotion, had not been filled at Lady-day. On the dissmissal of H. N. Howlett, clerk in the Sanitary Department, H. F. Butler was promoted to the position, and the vacancy in the office staff so caused was filled by the appointment of Arthur Wise as junior clerk. The salary of the surveyor was increased £100 per annum in consideration of the additional work devolving upon him by the new service of street cleansing, watering, and dusting. 8 bates and rateable value. The rates levied for the year amounted to 4s. 9d. in the £ on a rateable value of £778,600. The purposes for which these rates were laid were as follows:— s. d. s. d. For the strictly local purposes of the Vestry—maintenance, lighting and cleansing of the roadways, footways, etc., and construction and maintenance of sewers 1 3 For salaries, printing and other expenses incidental to the collection of moneys for other boards (proportion of Poor Rate) 0 1¼ For the expenses of the Free Public Libraries (now included in the Poor Rate) 0 0¾ For the expenses of the Baths Commissioners (also included in the Poor Rate) 0 0½ Total under Vestry's control 1 5½ For the relief of the poor, including expenses of the London County Council, Police, and Metropolitan Asylums Board 2 4 For the purposes of the School Board for London 0 11½ Total for central purposes 3 3½ 4 9 The Vestry have no manner of control over the expenditure for the two last named purposes. They are merely the agents for levying and collecting the sums named in the orders or precepts of other bodies. 9 the school board for london. Compared with that of the preceding year the demand of the School Board for London was some £700 less, the amount being £32,972. To raise this, a rate of ll½d. in the £ was made. Including the amount of the above named precept, the total of the sums contributed by the ratepayers of Westminster to the funds of the School Board, is no less than £358,633, irrespective of the payments made in respect of the Government property in the parish, which may be computed at £20,000. The sums demanded and the rate made year by year since the creation of this expensive Board may be seen from the following statement:— Precept. Rate. £ s. d. d. 1871 983 9 10 1872 1,857 5 11 l½ 1873 1,535 7 3 1 1874 3,689 1 9 1¾ 1875 6,440 4 9 3½ 1876 9,597 18 4 4 1877 11,363 9 11 5½ 1878 11,224 4 9 5 1879 12,556 4 11 4½ 1880 14,458 9 11 5½ 1881 14,799 13 4 5½ 1882 14,797 2 8 6½ 1883 17,316 16 0 7 1884 20,474 2 0 8 1885 22,613 12 11 9 1886 25,134 1 10 9 1887 24,010 19 9 9 1888 22,899 8 11 9 1889 25,531 10 3 8 1890 30,959 15 9 11½ 1891 33,549 2 6 12½ 1892 32,972 7 9 11½ (The above figures are exclusive of sums levied in respect of Government property and election expenses). 10 In the last report a reference was made to the steps taken by the Yestry to arouse the interest of the ratepayers in the election of November, 1891, with the object of securing the return of candidates pledged to arrest the constantly increasing expenditure of this Board, and to the steps taken by the Board, as "a ratepayer," to obtain the disallowance of the expense incurred by the Vestry in the matter. This hasty and misguided attempt, which was continued in the present year, was met in such a manner as to leave no doubt as to whether the Yestry or the Board were in the right. In their report upon the accounts the elected auditors stated:— "The audit has this year been marked by a refreshing—we had almost said an amusing—novelty in the attendance of the School Board for London, by their solicitor, as 'a ratepayer,' to object to the allowance of certain expenses incurred by the Vestry in the autumn of last year, in view of the then approaching election. The skilful arguments of the Solicitor, and his warning of the probable application for a writ of certiorari, alike fail to alter the views communicated to the School Board in December last in reply to their peremptory and dictatorial letter; but as we furnished the Yestry with a copy of the correspondence at the time, and as we are now required to state in the books our reasons for allowing such expenses, we need not trouble the Yestry further here with the subject than to state that the amount in question is .£33 10s., of which .£25 was for 6,000 stamps, £7 0s. 6d. for printing and envelopes, and £1 9s. 6d. for addressing the latter. "We feel it our duty to add, however, that conceiving ourselves to be entrusted by the ratepayers with the impartial oversight in their interests of the Vestry's expenditure—and the Vestry would probably have been the first to expect it of us— we should have stood with equal firmness in disallowing the expenditure had it been illegal or against the interests of the parish." Auditors' Allowance referred to in their Report. "We, the undersigned, being the major part of the Auditors elected under the Metropolis Local Management Act for the parish of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, Westminster, have duly examined the books and accounts of the Vestry of the said parish for the year ended at the 25th day of March last. We have also checked and examined the vouchers, papers, 11 instruments and writings prescribed by the Act from which we derive our powers. "We have also heard and considered an objection taken by the School Board for London (through their solicitor) to certain items of expenditure amounting to .£33 10s., incurred by the Vestry in printing and posting to the rated householders in October and November last a circular reminding the said householders of the then approaching School Board Election, and of the opportunity such election afforded the said rated householders of expressing an opinion upon the excessive expenditure of the School Board. After duly deliberating upon such objection, we have allowed the items of expenditure in question; and finding the whole of the accounts to be correct in every particular, we hereby certify the same in token of our allowance thereof. "And we give as our reasons for allowing the aforesaid items amounting to .£33 10s.:— "1. That such expenditure was not contrary to the provisions of secs. 90, 91, and 92 of the Act, 18 & 19 Vict., cap. 120. "2. That the Solicitor to the objectors failed to support the claim for disallowance by any authority in law. " 3. That inasmuch as public notice of the intended issue of the circular was given on the 10th October (the election took place on the 26th November), there was ample time for the School Board to have applied to the High Court for an injunction to restrain the Vestry from an improper application of the parochial rates. "4. That the expenditure was not incurred in promoting any agitation, nor in advancing the success of any person or party ; that it was entirely to the advantage of the ratepayers to be reminded of the approaching opportunity for remedying a grievance which had given rise to repeated complaints." A copy of this allowance was supplied to the School Board, by whom counsel's opinion was shortly afterwards stated to have been taken ; but nothing having been heard of the matter for several months, the auditors addressed the following communication to the Vestry in October:— Town Hall, Westminster, 7th October, 1892. Gentlemen, As you are aware, the elected Auditors, in December last, received a peremptory request from the School Board for London to prevent you from expending money in connexion with a circular which you had issued to the ratepayers on the 14th 12 October previously, in respect to the then pending School Board Election. We at once met and examined into the matter, with the result that we found the expenditure quite regular and justifiable, and accordingly we saw no grounds for interference, and we so informed the School Board. The Board's Solicitor then gave us notice of his intention to attend the next audit, then ensuing, as a "ratepayer," and to object to all the expenses incurred by the Vestry in connexion with the issue of the said circular. In due course he did so, and was afforded every facility for examining the accounts. We afterwards listened carefully and patiently to the ingenious and skilful arguments and citations advanced by him against allowing the items in dispute, and also to his warning as to the legal consequences, and the probable application for a Writ of Certiorari. Those arguments, however, being entirely unsupported by any authority in law, failed to convince us, and we allowed all the accounts, stating our reasons for so doing, as the law requires. We also gave the Solicitor notice of such allowance, and furnished him with a printed copy of our reasons. We have since then been expecting to be served with the Writ, so eloquently foreshadowed in June. Instead of this, however, we have just discovered from the Minutes of the School Board, dated September 29th last, that after consulting their solicitor, the Committee to whom the matter was referred report that they— "Do not consider it desirable to take any further steps in the matter," and ask that the reference may "be discharged," and it has been discharged accordingly. Thus the arrogance of December, 1891, becomes a humiliation in September, 1892. How a Board of such magnitude and importance, with more than half-a-dozen eminent counsel among its members, could have permitted such a fiasco almost passes the imagination. In our letter of December last, we said: "It is a matter of surprise to us that so important a body as the School Board for London should have acted with so much precipitancy and with so little apparent appreciation of the provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts as their letter discloses; and we fear that it is but an additional proof that resolutions of the Board are too often passed hastily, and without due consideration." Strong as that language was, we feel to-day that it is fully justified. We consider it our duty to report to you the termination of this matter, and to point out to you that after all the unnecessary trouble they have caused, the School Board has not had the courtesy to inform us of its decision, and we have been left to find it out as best we could. 13 As, however, the action of the School Board appears to have been dictated by a mistaken notion of the Vestry's powers, and of their own powers in assuming, all too hastily, to exercise authority over the Vestry's expenditure, and over the elected Auditors in directing them to prevent such expenditure, we do not suggest that the Vestry should take any steps to obtain the surcharge upon the School Board by the Government Auditors of any expenditure which may have been incurred in connexion with the attempt to enforce the disallowance. Our principal object in addressing the Vestry is, while congratulating them on the test-proof precedent they have established, to suggest that a public service might be rendered if the facts were brought to the knowledge of the other rating authorities of the Metropolis. It is remarkable that while several of the daily journals flippantly exulted in the intended silencing of the Vestries, not one of those journals has thought it worth while to state that so far from taking the proceedings at which they had hinted, the School Board, having taken the best advice they could obtain, have tacitly acknowledged that the Vestry's action was right and legally unassailable. We are, Gentlemen, Your faithful and obedient servants, ROBERT E. H. GOFFIN. Chairman, R. MORGAN, T. BULL, THOS. HY. HOBBS, CHAS. T. COWLEY, The Auditors elected under the Metropolis Local Management Acts. A resolution was passed by the Vestry ordering that a copy of this letter be transmitted for the information of the other "rating authorities;" but this order having, by some means, been brought to the knowledge of the School Board, they shortly afterwards informed the Vestry that it was not proposed to proceed further in the matter. The order of the Vestry was not, therefore, carried into effect. STREET IMPROVEMENTS. The efforts made to effect street improvements during the year may thus be briefly recapitulated:— Albert-gate estate.—Proposal to widen footway at. Promise made by owners, but not fulfilled. 14 Artillery brewery site.—Proposal to form a direct communication between Rochester-row and Victoria-street by the formation of a new road. Owners would not accept Vestry's offer. Caxton-street, fronting Blue Coat School. Suggested widening. In abeyance at close of year. Gobourg-row. Formation of new street to communicate with Rochester-row on the south-east and with Francis-street on the north-west. Freehold given by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Negotiations with lessees in progress at close of year. Earl-street.—Suggested continuation of, by formation of a new road across the site of Millbank-prison. No reply received from H. M. Office of Works at Lady-day. Imperial Institute-road.—New road formed, made up and sewered by Council of Imperial Institute, and taken over by the Vestry. James-street, fronting Emanuel Hospital. Strip of land purchased for widening footway and carriageway. Knightsbridge-road, between South-place and Rutland-gardens. Proposal to widen footway; but suspended owing to owner's indisposition to co-operate. Great Peter-street and St. Ann's-street.—Exchange of land so as to secure widening of both streets. In solicitor's hands at Lady-day Great Smith-street.—Revival of scheme for widening at point between present Library and "Feathers" public-house. Under consideration at end of year. Green Goat-row.—Land surrendered by Army and Navy Cooperative Supply, Limited, for addition to public highway on completion of building operations. Grey Coat-street.—Strip of land, ten feet wide, purchased for widening street, in connection with the demolition of houses. Palmer-strtet.—Contemplated widening of street in front of Nos. 1, 3, 5, and 7, and removal of adjoining projecting bay windows. Offer of Vestry not accepted by owners. 15 Ship-court.—Offer made by Vestry to purchase two cottages projecting into the street, so as to admit of continuing last named improvement into Bell-street. Terms not agreed upon at date of report. loans. Irrespective of £12,300 borrowed by the Commissioners for Public Baths and Wash-houses, with the consent of the Vestry, the rates of the parish have been mortgaged during the year to secure the repayment of £33,200 obtained by way of loans during the year for the undermentioned purposes:— £ For the purchase of land in Great Peter-street and St. Ann's-street, for a street improvement 4,200 For defraying the expenses of further asphalte works 5,000 For defraying the cost of wood paving works 10,000 For the purchase of freehold land in Monck- street for a depot 9,000 For defraying the cost of new sewers in various streets 5,000 £33,200 The table given on p. 56 gives further particulars in relation to these advances, and shows the amounts remaining charged upon the rates at the close of the year (£59,192) after deducting the repayments made during the twelve months.

J. E. SMITH, Vestry Clerk. 18 APPENDIX No. 2. ANNUAL REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISHES OF St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, Ending December, 1892, By BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S., Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the United Vestry. Gentlemen, The Annual Reports of my department have hitherto been made for the year ending at Lady-day ; but in accordance with the Order of the Local Government Board made under the new Public Health Act, the report has now to be made up to 31st December. You will, therefore, kindly bear in mind that the first three months of this year's report have already been reckoned in the one that was laid before you last March. As is my usual custom, I shall commence with recording the number of births and deaths that have been returned during the year, and shall afterwards place before you, in detail, the several interesting sanitary improvements that have been effected during the past twelve months. The number of births registered in the parish during the year have been 708 males and 710 females, or a total of 1,418 births, while the deaths have numbered 576 males and 518 females, or a total of 1,094 deaths; from these, however, must be deducted 38 as the result of accident, which reduces the actual number to 1,056. The deaths during the year 1891 were 1,067, thus showing a decrease of 11, as compared with the previous year. The following deaths occurred at the undermentioned ages, viz.:— Above sixty, 91; above seventy, 71; above eighty, 26; above ninety, 4, 19 The following deaths occurred at the undermentioned places, viz.:— Hospitals. Barracks. Westminster 246 Wellington 1 Station 16 Hyde Park 2 Emanuel 1 Knightsbridge 2 Coldstreams 1 Grosvenor 2 Convent 6 Wellington House 4 Victoria House 3 279 5 The following is the table of deaths occurring in the district, from zymotic causes during the past three years. 1890 1891. 1892. Small Pox 0 0 0 Measles 31 39 73 Scarlet Fever 0 0 2 Whooping Cough 34 22 19 Diarrhoea 32 43 33 Dysentery 0 0 0 Cholera 0 0 0 Fever. 6 10 2 103 114 129 The above table shows an increase, in reference to the previous year, of 15 deaths arising from zymotic causes, but on examination of the table of deaths a decrease of 11 is found, which is satisfactory, considering the severe outbreaks of measles, scarlet fever, and diphtheria, which have taken place during the year. With regard to the threatened epidemic of cholera in July, August, and September, the most vigilant and strict measures were taken, with the encouraging result that not a single case occurred in either of the united parishes. The compulsory notification of disease continues to be of the greatest assistance, owing to the promptitude of the medical gentlemen in reporting cases, and the inspectors in immediately attending to the reports, and, whenever possible, removing the patients to the hospitals, where they are properly nursed, the spread of disease is checked, and cases that might frequently terminate fatally speedily become convalescent. The following table is a copy of the tabular returns of deaths, taking each parish separately, in accordance with the form prescribed by the Local Government Board; but it must be remembered that the entry of "deaths occurring outside the district, among persons belonging thereto," has been entered on St. Margaret's paper for both parishes, it being impossible to separate them, 20 21 (A) TABLE °F DEATHS during the year 1892 in the Metropolitan Sanitary District of St. Margaret's, Westminster, classified according to Diseases, Ages and Localities.

Total. 217 159 376 151 225 376 The foregoing list of deaths, which I include for the first time, calls for some remarks. In the first instance as, under my instructions, the inspectors are obtaining the removal (to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board) of all cases of infectious disease, which cannot be thoroughly isolated at home, it is necessary to include the deaths occurring among those removed in my returns. 25 The total of 104 deaths registered as having previously resided in these parishes, but to whom no address is assigned, is largely made up of the casuals, who obtain orders from the relieving officers, upon which they get admission to the casual ward, some being afterwards transferred to the Union Infirmary; those who die there are only entered as being chargeable to the St. Margaret's parish of St. George's Union. There are also doubtless the deaths of some of the occupants of Common Lodging Houses, whose places of residence have not been kept up in the books of the Union when they have been transferred to the Infirmary from the Workhouse. 26 27 (B) TABLE OF POPULATION, BIRTHS, AND OF NEW CASES OF INFECTIOUS SICKNESS, coming to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, during the year, 1892, in the Metropolitan Sanitary District of St. Margaret's, Westminster, classified according to Diseases, Ages, and Localities.

Measles rose to the highest number in March, and since then has been gradually decreasing; 74, however, out of 790 cases, have proved fatal. Scarlet Fever has been more or less prevalent all through the year, especially since April, when there were 39 cases, but out of the 301 cases that have occurred only 2 deaths are recorded within the district, though 17 occurred in outlying institutions. 29 Diphtheria cases have also been very far above the average, especially in June, July, August and September, and out of the 143, 19 have died in the district and 26 in the hospitals and other institutions outside. The highest number of Erysipelas cases was in July, when there were 12, but all through the year it has been above the average, and out of the 77 cases 3 have died in the parish and 4 in the outlying institutions. Enteric Fever.—There were 24 cases, and out of these 2 deaths. Although the Public Health (London) Act has been in force during the last twelve months, many of its important provisions have not yet been put in operation, owing to its Byelaws not having as yet been sanctioned by the Local Government Board, but I am glad to be able to give a good account of the general working of the Act in these parishes. The appointment of a third sanitary inspector and a clerk to my department, with the fact that your surveyor has been able, in consequence of the satisfactory arrangements by which the removal of dust and the street cleansing is being carried out, to arrange for the transference of Inspector Lightfoot to my department, to fill the post rendered vacant by Inspector Ashdown, I was thereby enabled to direct that a house to house inspection be made, independent of the daily routine work of the department, one effect of which inspection has resulted in no less than 324 houses being provided with entirely new drains in the parish of St. John alone, and I would point out to you the extreme importance of the necessity for the continuance of this work. But the provisions of the new Public Health Act have thrown many new duties into the work of the department. Among many of the new responsibilities is the enforcement of the requirements as to underground rooms being transferred by the Act from district surveyors to officers of the sanitary authority. Early in the year the Sanitary Committee engaged Mr. John Foster as a temporary inspector for the measurement and registration of underground rooms, and I am pleased to say that nearly everyone in the parish of St. John has been examined and the measurements thereof entered in a register, which can be referred to in any case of a room found to be illegally occupied. 173 notices were issued, informing the owners or occupiers of rooms being so illegally occupied as sleeping rooms, and in nearly every case the notices have been complied with. The registration of underground rooms in the parish of St. Margaret's has still to be accomplished. 30 Smoke Consumption— The duties under this section have been transferred from the police to the officers of the sanitary authority. The necessary duties under this section have received the careful attention of the inspectors, and it Avas only found necessary to caution the several owners of furnaces emitting black smoke. Under the section referring to sanitary conveniences for workshops, it was found necessary to call upon the owners in some cases to provide proper water closet accommodation for the persons in their employ. Section 48, Public Health (London) Act, requires that the water companies shall give notice to the sanitary authority, within 24 hours, of the water supply having been cut off or discontinued to any dwelling house. Over 100 such notices were received, and the inspectors made the necessary enquiries in every case; and while on the question of water supply, I would direct your attention to the necessity of a constant service throughout the parishes, as 1 am convinced that the present scanty supply, necessitating storage cisterns, often illplaced, badly covered, and infrequently cleansed, is a fruitful source of disease. Houses let in lodgings, section 94. Bye-laws have been framed by you and submitted, for the sanction of the Local Government Board (but not as yet confirmed). The duties required to be carried out under these bye-laws, will entail an enormous amount of work in compiling a register of such houses, and seeing that the byelaws are not infringed. Your inspectors have, however, been careful in seeking out and seeing that all cases of overcrowding were duly abated. The slaughter-houses, cow-houses and bakehouses have been inspected during the past year, and in only a few instances were cleansing notices necessary. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, the steps enumerated below have been taken during the year— Artillery-square— Following up the order made by the magistrate on the 5th day of March, 1891, for the closing of these premises, as no steps had been taken either to demolish the houses or to render them fit for human habitation since the closing order had been enforced, the Vestry on the 13th day of January, 1892, after hearing the owners, passed a resolution that "it was expedient to order the demolition of the eleven houses in this square," 31 The owners of Nos. 1, 11 & 12, thereupon demolished their houses, hut the remaining eight houses, at the expiration of the period prescribed by law, were demolished by the Vestry, thus putting an end to a court which had, for many years, been a source of trouble to the sanitary authority. It is interesting in connection with this case to note that Mr. De Rutzen's decision upon the definition of the word "owner," has been held, in the Court of Appeal, to be the correct interpretation of the law. Mill' s-buildings, Greycoat-place— The houses, Nos. 1, 2, 3 & 4, in this court, which were closed upon a magistrate's order, made on the 5th day of November, 1891, were, early in this year, dealt with by the lessee, Nos. 2, 3 & 4, being demolished, and a tenement house built upon the site thus rendered vacant. No. 1, a much better house, has been very thoroughly repaired and a rescinding order obtained on the 18th day of November, 1892, and the house is now again occupied. 1J/. & 16, Lewisham-street— These two houses, which were closed on a magistrate's order, made on the 30th day of October, 1891, having been rendered fit for habitation, a rescinding order was obtained, but up to the end of the year the premises had not been again occupied. 1, 3, 4, 5 & 6, Blue Anchor-court— The insanitary condition of these premises having been brought under my notice, I, in conjunction with the surveyor, sent in a report to the Vestry, and notices were served on the owners on the 6th day of October, and the premises were thereupon ventilated and further water closet accommodation provided. 1, 2, 3, 4., 5 & 6, Bull's Head-court, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6, Ann's-place— A similar report was sent in to the Vestry, as in the previous cases, and notices were served on the owners on the same date, with the result of through ventilation being provided at Nos. 5 & 6, Bull's Head-court, cleansing and general repairs being also carried out. Up to the end of the year, however, in consequence of the appeal of the owners to appear before the Vestry, no steps had been taken to enforce the notice, although the work had not been done at any of the other houses. 32 13, 15, 17 & 19, Chadwick-street— These houses were closed on an order made by the Police Magistrate on the 7th day of December, the owner having failed to comply with the Vestry's notice, ordered on the 30th day of September, and the houses were unoccupied at the close of the year. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9, York-buildings, Grub-street— These premises being unfit for human habitation, notices were served on October the 6th, and they have since been provided with means of ventilation. 32, 34 & 36, Ship-court— On the 12th day of October the Vestry decided to take the necessary steps, under the direction of their solicitor, to obtain the closing of these houses, but in consequence of certain negotiations which were pending to purchase two of them for the purpose of a street improvement, the notices had not been served before the end of the year.

In January I reported upon the practicability of constructing a convenience at the junction of Brompton-road and High-road, and submitted plans of a scheme at a proposed expenditure of £2,300. After several meetings the Joint Committee approved of a convenience with ample accommodation for men and women, and at the close of the year the working plans were in progress. street cleansing, watering, and removal of dust. The expenditure on these services is set out in the following statement:— £ s. d. £ s. d.

Slop. 1891-2 32,002 yards 15,241 yards 1892-3 33,480 „ 15,321 „ The cost of feeding, shoeing, &c. the horses averaged 17s. per week per horse. The Vestry have, during the past winter, found work for many of the deserving unemployed, and the extra cost of such action amounts to £140 16s. 6d. In August the Queen Anne's-mansions Lighting and Heating Company, who are under contract to supply light and heat to the Queen Anne's-mansions, requested me to remove the refuse of their furnaces, &c., under section 30 of the Public Health Act, 39 1891. As I was of opinion that the refuse was "trade refuse" within the meaning of the Act I objected to remove it, and my action was subsequently confirmed by the Joint Committee. The Company summoned the Vestry, and the magistrate decided in favour of the Company. Upon appeal the Divisional Court reversed the Magistrate's decision. Artillery Brewery Site, Victoria Street. The question of acquiring a part of this site for the purpose of forming a road from Victoria-street to Greycoat-place was referred to the Works Committee in February, 1892. Negotiations were entered into with the Solicitors for the site, and the freeholders of the adjoining properties, and a report of the values was obtained from Messrs. Smith, Son & Oakley. The Vestry ultimately offered £5,000 for so much of the land as would be required for their purposes, provided the owners of the adjoining land would agree to carry the road of a uniform width through into Greycoat-place. In June, the owner of the site asked £15,000 for the strip of land, and the Vestry thereupon discharged the reference to the Committee. In conclusion, I would state that, before the end of the next year I hope that efficient stabling and yard accommodation, workshops, &c., for carrying out various services connected with the Vestry's administrative duties will be completed and in full work.

Vestry Offices, Toivn Hall, Westminster, S.W. Gentlemen, Pursuant to the instructions of your Committee, we have examined the Books and Accounts of the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, in relation to the General, School Board, Sewers, and Montpelier-square Rates, for the year ended 25th March last, in accordance with the Specification. We find the Summary Statements and Balance Sheet prepared for the Elected Auditors to be duly vouched, with the exception of an uncompleted transaction (particulars herewith), and true Abstracts from the books of the Vestry. We have much pleasure in testifying to the clear and accurate manner in which the Books and Accounts of the year have been kept. We are, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, (Signed) EDWARD MOORE & SONS. Particulars of item above referred to. 1892 Dec. 29. J.

REPORT OF THE ELECTED AUDITORS, upon tiieir examination of the vestry's accounts, for the year ended at lady-day, 1893. To the United Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster. Gentlemen, After causing notices to be published throughout the parish, in order to enable any ratepayers interested in the matter to attend, we met on the 12th May to commence the audit of the General Rate Accounts of the Vestry. We then conferred with the Chartered Accountants (Messrs. E. Moore & Sons) engaged by the Vestry, and handed over the books and accounts for the detailed examination on the lines which have been adopted during the past eight years. We have since had an opportunity of seeing the Accountants' report upon this examination, and have had before us all the accounts, vouchers, registers and deeds necessary for us to check the statements in every particular. We have not, however, thought it worth while, for reasons which some of us have fully explained in past years, to review the detail work of the experts, but have directed our efforts more particularly to seeing that the payments have been properly authorised and vouched, and that the deeds correspond with the entries in the registers. In this connection we have enquired into the uncompleted transaction referred to in the Accountants' report, and find that it was satisfactorily completed shortly after Lady-day. We find by adding the figures relating to the Poor Rate, that the total amount received by the parish during the year (including £33,200 loans from the London County Council, and 43 £10,556 transferred from Deposit Account) was £223,223, and that the total expenditure was £229,460. Of this, however, only £82,580 was for the local purposes of the Vestry, including £30,305 expended out of loang received during the year. "We also find that the total of the rates levied, inclusive of "additions," was £189,594, of which £174,862 was collected. The "irrecoverables" amounted to £12,711, or per cent., of which £8,117, or 4¼ per cent., was due to properties being empty. As might have been expected from the evidence borne by the books of the regular and periodical examination by the Finance Committee, we have found all the items duly vouched ; and we have found the accounts and the abstracts thereof correct in every respect. We have, therefore, had no hesitation in giving our certificate of allowance. Everything has been placed before us in a straightforward and satisfactory manner. Signed ROBERT E. H. GOFFIN, CHAS. T.

31 WES 8 The Board of works for the westminister District. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes of ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER, FOR THE QUARTER ENDING 25TH MARCH, 1860, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the parishes op St. Margaret and St. John, westminster For the QUARTER ending 25tii MARCH, 1860, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, The prevalence of Small Pox, and the generally unhealthy state of the atmosphere during the present quarter, prevents my laying before you a very satisfactory Report as to the health of the united parishes; it is, however, some consolation to find that the increase is not confined to these parishes, but has generally prevailed throughout London, and the provinces. The number of Births registered during the present quarter has been 304 Males and 298 Females, or a total of 1312 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 253 Males and 232 Females, or a total of 485 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 35 as arising from accident and belonging to other parishes, thus reducing the actual number to 450. The Deaths for a similar period in 1859 amounted to 408, and the average of the previous 10 years' to 475.2 ; if, however, this average is raised with a view to comparison for increase of population, the numbers will be 522; thus showing, that although there is an increase in reference to the previous year 4 of 42 Deaths, yet, that taking into consideration the increase of population, the Deaths are 70 less than the average of the previous 10 years. Such increase, however, renders a searching examination necessary for the purpose, if possible, of accounting for and probably preventing a repetition of such numbers. An examination of the causes of Death shows, that whereas in 1859 there were 13 Deaths from accident, in 18G0 there were 25: that in 1859 there was 1 Death from Small Pox, in 1860, 19 Deaths: that in 1859 the Deaths above 60 were 51, whereas in 1860 they were 70:—these are sufficient to account for more than the difference between the two years. If the examination is carried still further, we shall find that while there are 26 less Deaths from Scarlet Fever, there are 9 more as attributable to Measles, Hooping Cough, and Fever; wo may hence conclude that the increase is mainly attributable to the Deaths from Small Pox, and the excess of accidents and Deaths above 60 years of age. With such evidence it becomes necessary to adopt active measures to endeavour to stay such an increase in Deaths arising from a preventable cause, and hence all those Schools, in which consent could be obtained for an examination of the pupils, have been visited, and the arms of the different children examined for the purpose of detecting both imperfect vaccination, and those instances where the protective power of vaccination had been neglected. And with the kind co-operation of your several Vaccinators, I am enabled to inform you, that the arms of 1,213 children have been examined, and that of this number, 163 were found to be unprotected; while in many others the marks were so faint as to require a repetition of vaccinaton. Although neglect of vaccination must be considered the main cause of the disease, yet its rapid propagation is mainly due to the serious over-crowding that exists in the habitations of the poor, and 1 again urge upon the members of the Board the necessity (as the Local Management Act is about to be recognized) of their immediately 5 municating with the proper authorities respecting the defect in the present Act, specially relating to this subject. The Act is defective in only applying to the over-crowding of houses. As a general rule it is not the house that is over-crowded, but one or more rooms, and as 1 have shown over and over again, to the serious detriment of the occupants. With such a disease as Small Pox, it is utterly impossible to prevent its increase while over-crowding is permitted to exist; and that it is mainly dependent on such a cause is obvious from the fact, that in almost every instance where I have inspected the premises, such an evil has been found. In some instances the drains were defective, while in others they had been stopped for weeks, 110 intimation having been forwarded to the Inspector of such an occurrence. In Leg Court the rooms were damp from overflowing of the drains. In Wood Street four persons were sleeping in an underground dwelling, and Measles originating among them, was propagated to other portions of the house. In St. Ermin's Hill, the room of No. 3 was stifling from overcrowding and accumulations of different kinds. In all the instances where Small Pox has occurred, notices have been delivered to the effect thpt the premises should be thoroughly cleansed, whitewashed and purified, and that they should not be re-let to families having young children. My attention having been directed by a householder in St. George's, to a supposed nuisance arising from bodies buried beneath Buckingham Chapel, I visited and very carefully examined the Chkpel in question, and found that although a large number of persons are buried beneath the floor of the Chapel, yet there is such a depth of lime and other material covering the coffins as entirely to prevent any nuisance, and I was unable to detect the slightest offensive odour. During the Quarter, 194 houses have been inspected, and in the majority the necessary requirements have been completed. In three instances it has been necessary to summon the parties before the Magistrate. In Clark's yard, Artillery Row, three pigs were detected and removed; in 21, Castle Lane and 2 Wood, Street, the occupants have been removed 6 from underground dwellings. A quantity of Fish, unfit for human food, was seized by Inspector Wood, and destroyed by order of the Magistrate, who fined the owner, John Foley, 2, Great Peter Street, £1. 18s. Thirty-seven Hains were also seized from the shop of Mr. VVillin, 13, Regent's Place, who informed the Inspector of their unsoundness, which, having examined, I directed them to be submitted to the Magistrate, who directed they should be at once destroyed.

REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION op the parishes op St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, For the QUARTER ending 24th JUNE, 1860, by BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S. Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the District Board of Works. Gentlemen, I have the honour to inform you, that the number of Births registered during the present quarter has been 256 Males, and 234 Females, or a total of 490 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 232 Males, and 209 Females, or a total of 441 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 26 as arising from accident and as belonging to other parishes, thus reducing the actual number to 415. The Deaths for a similar period in 1859 amounted to 359, and for the 10 years' average to 408-9; if, however, this average is raised with a view to comparison for increase of population, the numbers will be 443-8; thus showing the large increase of 81 Deaths in reference to 1859, and only a decrease of 1-2 in reference to the 10 years' average. A critical examination of the Death Return compels me to conclude, that this great addition is mainly attributable to the protracted cold and unsettled state of the atmosphere; inasmuch 4 as a very large proportion of the Deaths have arisen from diseases affecting the respiratory organs, in Bronchitis, Pneumonia, and more especially Consumption. Only 2 Deaths are recorded as arising from Smalt Pox, but there are 5 as dependent upon Scarlet Fever, and 10 from Hooping Cough. A perusal of the Reports from other Metropolitan parishes shows me, that this large mortality has been very general. In the second week of April, the Registrar-General's Return showed that in Bronchitis alone the Deaths were 90 in excess, and when compared with a similar Return in 1859, gave 119 in excess. The Deaths from Phthisis were also 30 more than usual. Thus it must be considered that the present very large increase is attributable more to the state of the atmosphere than to any deficiency in sanitary regulations. births. deaths. Corrected Deaths.

I 5 The Authorities of Millbank Prison having complained to Inspector Wood regarding the deposit of rubbish in the immediate vicinity of the prison, which il is alleged gives rise to a deleterious and offensive escape, I inspected the part complained of, and carefully examined the material, without being enabled to detect anything either offensive, or detrimental to health. My attention has also been directed to a serious nuisance arising from boiling putrid stores returned from the Crimea, and utterly unfit for human food. The stench arising from this process was such as to have produced very serious results on the health of the immediate inhabitants, if not immediately discontinued. I therefore directed Inspector Wood to immediately apply to the Sitting Magistrate to stay the proceeding, and the case having been subsequently brought under the notice of the Magistrate by the Solicitor, Mr. Rogers, a small fine was consented to, and a promise given that no such material should be boiled for the future. In a neighbourhood so densely populated, containing at present many trades' nuisances, it would be a great inconvenience, and might prove injurious to health, if any further noxious trade was permitted to be carried on upon the present site. No such trade has been carried on for a considerable period, and if the repetition can be prevented, il would prove a special boon to the adjoining inhabitants. In consequence of the Gas Company being compelled to lay new gas pipes in Laundry Yard, the ground which required to be removed was found to be so saturated with gaseous products as to become a serious nuisance; I therefore directed that all the offensive mould should be removed, and replaced -with dry rubbish, which was immediately consented to by the Clerk of the Works. Three underground dwellings have been detected, and the occupants removed. 6 Six pigs have been removed from Bonner's Yard, and the slaughter-house in Buncher's yard has been cleansed and limewhitened. Several inspections have taken place during the quarter— the particulars of which are contained in the different Inspectors' books.

To the Members of the District Board of Worhs. Gentlemen, I have the honour to inform you, that considering the unprecedented cold that has been experienced during the latter part of the present Quarter, and which has materially increased the general Death Rate, the united Parishes continue to exhibit a fair average state of health. The Deaths from Small Pox, Scarlet Fever, Measles, &c. are somewhat below the average, while those attendant upon advanced age and accident have materially increased. The number of Births registered during the present quarter has been 297 Males, and 294 Females, or a total of 591 Births; while the Deaths have numbered 201 Males, and 217 Females, or a total of 418 Deaths. From these, however, must be deducted 24 as arising from accident and as belonging 4 to other parishes, which reduces the actual number to 394. The Deaths for a similar period in 1859 were 487; and for 10 years' average 431-5; as, however, the present Deaths have occurred in an increased population, 10 per cent, must be added to this average, which would make the numbers 474-5. We are thus enabled to show that there is a decrease in reference to the previous quarter of 93 Deaths, and in reference to the 10 years' average of 80-5 Deaths. The following is a Tabular Statement of the Births and Deaths in each Parish, arranged as to sex:— MONTHLY ACCOUNT OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS. BIRTHS. DEATHS. Corrected Deaths. Deaths in 1859.

The windows of Mr. Williams' house are at some distance from the dung-pit, and could, in my opinion, be only very remotely affected. At the period of my visit, there did not exist any nuisance. In consequence of the late heavy rains, the Water Companies have found it exceedingly difficult to filter the water sufficiently to deprive it of all its organic products. I have, however, satisfied myself, that although the water has been somewhat cloudy, it was not in any manner unhealthy to drink. I All those houses where Deaths have occurred from causes within control have been examined, and in many instances the drainage was out of order, and the premises required cleansing and whitewashing, but the great evil which more than any other tends to increase a communicable disease, arises as a consequence of overcrowding, and this has been again detected in instances where Deaths from Fever, Scarlet Fever, &c. have occurred. In Carpenter Street, most of the houses are dangerously overcrowded, and I have directed the Inspector to take the sense of the Nuisances Removal Committee upon the propriety of immediately giving notice to the landlord to eject the tenants from those rooms where overcrowding exist, G and that he should not again permit the same rooms to be occupied by so large a number of inmates ; and in the event of such notice not being complied with, that the matter should be referred to the Magistrate for his decision. I consider it absolutely and indispensably necessary, that if Deaths from preventable causes are to be decreased, effective measures should be at once adopted to prevent the contamination of the air which must necessarily result from so many persons occupying one apartment. In Birch's cab-yard there is a building appropriated to pigkeeping, but as the distance of the building from the main road is beyond the boundary prescribed by the Act of Parliament, and no nuisance was detected, I refrained from interfering. A large number of houses have been inspected in the united parishes, the particulars of which are in the Inspectors' books ; in the majority of instances the requirements have been carried out.

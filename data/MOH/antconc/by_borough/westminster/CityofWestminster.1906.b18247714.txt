To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the City of Westminster. My Lords and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the City of Westminster during the year 1906. Returns required by the Local Government Board, and particulars relating to Factories and Workshops required by the Home Office, are incorporated therein. The year was somewhat peculiar in the meteorological conditions which obtained, and these had a distant effect upon the health of the people. To most the conditions were beneficial, but as they favoured the development of epidemic diarrhoea, scarlet fever and other complaints of this class, their effect was bad for young children. Notwithstanding some increase in infantile deaths from these causes, the death rate for Westminster was the lowest yet recorded. Considerable interest has been taken in the subject of infant mortality. Perhaps the most interesting circumstance of the year, from a hygienic point of view, was a Conference held at Caxton Hall to consider its causes and the best means to be taken for its diminution. I submit particulars bearing on the question, which seem to show that the presence or absence of care and cleanliness on the part of those in charge of infants, is the most important factor to be considered. The rainfall throughout the whole country in 1906 was an average one, but in the Thames Valley it was only 96 per cent.of the average fall of the previous 30 years; in 1905 the fall (22.3) was only 90 per cent. of the average. The total rainfall in Westminster was 24.27 inches. 2 From the accompanying Table (compiled from the Meteorological Office Reports) it will be seen that the first two and the last three months of the year and the month of June had a rainfall above the average, while the other months, especially April, July and August, were particularly dry. As nearly the whole of the rain in June fell on the 29th, that month may also be reckoned as a dry one throughout its greater part. As nearly the whole of the rain in June fell on the 29th, that month may also be reckoned as a dry one throughout its greater part. RAINFALL. TEMPERATURE. 1906. Amount. Inch. Percentage of average.

The mildness of the winter, 1905.6, came to an end in February, and the spring was colder than usual as well as dry. There was, however, much bright sunshine recorded then and during the rest of the year. The temperature maintained a moderate level until the end of August and beginning of September, when there suddenly occurred five days of great heat, the thermometer at the Victoria Street meteorological station recording a maximum of 91.3 degrees on September 2nd, and in the northern parts of the City it was about three degrees higher. Until December the temperature was several degrees above the average. A comparison of the above table with the charts and tables showing the infectious diseases notified and with the records of deaths, especially of those from diarrhoeal diseases, will be found of interest. I have the honour to be, My Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FRANCIS J. ALLAN, Medical Officer of Health. 26th February, 1907. 3 PART I A. Population. The resident population of the City of Westminster has been calculated by the Registrar.General at 173,905 for the year 1906. At the census, 1901, the number was 183,011. This is arrived at by a calculation based on the assumption that the rate of decrease ascertained at the census taken in 1901 as having taken place since the census taken in 1891 is still continuing. In Westminster, where improvement schemes on a large scale are in progress, it is obvious that the risk of error may be considerable. There are, moreover, a large number of persons resident in Poor Law establishments beyond the boundaries of the City whose deaths are allocated to the City, hence these people should be added in as part of the resident population. To counterbalance this there are many persons in hospitals and hotels in the City who are only temporary residents, and in order to be exact these should be excluded. For the purpose of obtaining approximately exact figures for the Wards, I have added paupers to the various Wards in the proportion in which they were found in the Workhouses and Infirmaries at the time of the census, and deducted a proportion of the persons in hospitals and hotels, with the result that the following figures are arrived at:- Conduit Ward 5,550 St. Anne Ward 10,900 Grosvenor Ward 14,800 Great Marlborough Knightsbridge Ward 6,950 St. George Ward 14,700 Pall Mall Ward 2,960 Victoria Ward 39,300 Eegent Ward 9,340 Hamlet of Knights. Charing Cross Ward 4,210 bridge Ward 7,520 Covent Garden St. Margaret Ward 13,100 Ward 8,430 St. John Ward 29,800 Strand Ward 6,340 4 Without a direct census it is impossible to ascertain the correct figures. The Registrar.General, for the purpose of the Equalisation of Rates Act, estimated the population of the City in another way and makes it to be 172,085, without paupers in outlying workhouses and infirmaries. This he does by calculating the number of persons per inhabited house at the time of the census, and applying such to the number of houses found on the rate books in May of each year. The City Comptroller has been good enough to supply me with a copy of the figures sent to the Local Government Board in 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, and 1906, and I append them so that comparisons may be made:- The City Comptroller has been good enough to supply me with a copy of the figures sent to the Local Government Board in 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, and 1906, and I append them so that comparisons may be made:- 1 2 3 4 5 6 Number of Houses as defined in Local Government Board Schedule.

According to the proportion existing in 1901, there are 80,693 males and 93,212 females in the estimated population. Births. 2,766 births were registered in the City in the 52 weeks ending December 29th, 1906. On examination, 42 births were found to be referable to other districts. Through the courtesy of the Committees of Management of Endell Street, York Eoad, and the Queen Charlotte Lying.in Institutions, of the Master of the Strand Workhouse at Edmonton, and the Steward of St. George's Workhouse, Fulham Eoad, and of other Medical Officers, I have ascertained that 207 children were born in these institutions, the home address of whose mothers was in Westminster. The net number of births was, therefore, 2,931, as compared with 3,120 in 1905; the birth.rate, uncorrected, was 15.9, corrected 16.89per 1,000 persons. The birth.rate for the County of London for 1906 was 26.7, the rate during the ten preceding years averaged 29.0 per 1,000. The birth.rate in England and Wales was 27'0, the average of the preceding ten years being 28.7. 6 Consequent upon differences in sex and age distribution, and the proportion of married and unmarried persons in the various Wards of the City, the rates must vary widely.

Coincidently with this fall there has been a steady decrease in the ages of the persons married, thereby shortening the period of possible child.bearing; in addition to these there can be little doubt that part of the decrease in the birth.rate is due to the deliberate restriction of child.bearing. Registration of Births.-The increased attention which is now being given to infant life has brought out the disability which hampers the work of local authorities in that births need not be registered for six weeks after they have occurred, and before compulsion could be brought to bear a longer period might elapse. More than one.third of the babies who die under one year of age do so before they are a month old, and therefore before any official knowledge of their existence has taken place. It is evident, if instruction or help is to be given to parents as to the rearing of their children, information of the birth must be given at a much earlier period than is at present the case. Efforts to prevent death or injury to health cannot begin too early. In Scotland the period within which registration should take place is three weeks ; in France three days, and, through a recent Act, Parliament has reduced the limit in Huddersfield to two ‚Ä¢days, and a shilling is paid for each notification thereof. The Congress of Infantile Mortality last summer passed a resolution that notification of all births should be given to the Medical Officer of Health of the district within forty.eight hours. The Registrar.General is reported to have come to the conclusion that, whilst it would be unwise at present to disturb the existing organisation of birth registration, a well.devised system of early notification of births-legalised and worked in conjunction with the present registration system on the one hand, and with sanitary administration ‚Ä¢on the other-might, along with other motive forces, serve as a most effective and lasting barrier with which to stem the tide of infant mortality. The City of Westminster Health Society state in their Annual Report that they have made arrangements with the various general and lying.in hospitals in the City and neighbourhood, whereby the Society is supplied from time to time with list of impending maternity cases on their books, they are thus able to visit the houses before the confinement takes place; and subsequently they visit once a month, or oftener if required, during the first three months, later on once a quarter. 8 The conclusions which they have been able to draw from such systematic visiting of 400 cases are set forth in the 2nd Annual Report from which the following extract is taken :- Housing Conditions.-These were bad or indifferent in forty.three instances, the causes usually being inadequate ventilation or overcrowding. Out of thirty.two deaths, five occurred in these dwellings, and in twelve instances the infants were unhealthy or did not thrive. The table below shows the relation of the housing conditions on the death.rate of infants and on their health. Death.rate per cent. Delicate infants per cent. Housing bad 11.6 27.9 Housing good 7.2 10.8 Mothers' Work.-It is stated that 120 of the mothers had some occupation. Of the infants of these working mothers, eleven died and thirty were delicate. The high proportion of deaths and unhealthy infants is due largely to the fact that the infants had in many cases. to be prematurely weaned, either partially or completely, owing to the mother's absence at work. Even when the mothers do their work at home, it is probable that they are unable to give their infants sufficient attention, resulting in their being fed at irregular intervals. The mother's occupation also acts disadvantageously on the child's health in that it prevents her looking after the infant when ill. Of the working mothers forty.five had to prematurely wean their children, but the fact of the mothers having to work was not necessarily the cause of this in all instances. The table below shows the differences in the deaths per cent., and in the numbers of delicate children per cent, between the infants of mothers working and of those non.working. Death.rate per cent. Delicate infants per cent. Working 91 25 Non.working 7.5 8.2 Mode of Feeding.-Of the 400 infants, 282 were fed by the breast alone, sixty.three were fed by the breast for a time, varying from a few weeks to several months, after which they were weaned and fed entirely by the bottle, or else there was supplemental food given from about birth, owing to the breast milk being insufficient, or to the mother's absence during the day. In thirty.seven instances the infants were fed by the bottle only from birth. Thus 100 were fed partly or entirely by the bottle. No mention is made of the mode of feeding in eighteen cases. Kind of Food.-Boiled milk and water was the food usually given. Artificial foods were used in seventeen cases, and they disagreed with 9 the infants in six of these : children not thriving in any case. These foods were given in the early months of the infant's life as a substitute for or supplemental to mother's milk. Tubed bottles were used in fourteen instances, and bad effects are noted in six. Effect of Feeding on Infant's Health.-There were eighteen deaths among the 282 breast.fed babies, as compared with fourteen among the 100 bottle.fed. Five, at least, of these latter deaths were due to diarrhoea or to diseases resulting from unsuitable food. Among the fifty.three infants, who were delicate or did not thrive, in twenty.six (or one.half) the disability is attributable to errors in feeding. Death.rate per cent. of breast.fed infants 6.3 ‚Äû ‚Äû bottle.fed ‚Äû 14.0 (partly or entirely) The mother's absence at work may have been a cause of the premature weaning in many instances. Non.thriving Infants.-Fifty.three of the 400 were delicate or did not thrive. The causes were as follows :- (1) Food not agreeing (26). (2) Unhealthy family (constitutional taint). (3) Bad housing conditions. (4) Insufficient attention, due to mother's absence at work. (5) Infantile diseases (adenoids, cleft.palate, eczema, conjunctivitis, &c.). (6) Debility due to prematurity. In many cases it is difficult to say exactly why the infant did not thrive. There was often a combination of several of the causes mentioned above. Infants whose ill.health was due to acute diseases are not included under this head. A separate cot is not often provided for the child. Unhealthy Mothers.-Of the mothers, sixty suffered more or less from ill.health or general debility. In many instances the strain of pregnancy, labour, or lactation was responsible. Drink or poverty are not frequently stated as causes. Scarcity of nourishment during pregnancy or after does not often appear to have been a cause. The points brought out by the summary of the Visitors' Eecords show that ignorance, lack of cleanliness, irregularity of feeding and of habits are the principal causes of infantile ill.health and death, and these factors tell most strongly in the case of bottle.fed babies, where more, rather than less, care is needed if they are to be successfully reared. The systematic visiting carried out by the Society has shown that the difficulties met with are not to be remedied by any one specific. 10 The supply of sterilised milk during the hot months of the year might assist in the reduction of diarrhoea, but probably any benefit which has resulted from its use is due to the fact that it is supplied in clean bottles, each containing sufficient for one feed only, and thus the chance of contamination of the milk is much reduced rather than to the milk being sterilised. So long as those in charge of the children are dirty and careless, even this method will not prevent contamination of the milk. Unfortunately there are many mothers who are unable to. nourish their children; there are other who do not try, or who decline to do so. In these circumstances, parents have to be taught to modify cow's milk, so that it may become suitable. In the majority of instances this can be done at home, but there are cases in which no simple modification of the milk will enable it to be digested. For these it is desirable that there should be facilities whereby parents may obtain skilled advice, and, if necessary, have a prescription of the food ordered, made up. This is necessary in such cases, as sometimes very minute modifications in the amount of the various constituents have to be made before a food can be obtained upon which the child will thrive. The establishment in Vincent Square of the Infant Hospital will doubtless be of material benefit to parents in Westminster. The objects of the hospital are to carry out systematically the treatment and scientific study of infantile malnutrition, and to afford medical practitioners and students adequate opportunity for becoming practically acquainted with the factors governing infantile nutrition; to train infant nurses; and, generally, to investigate in the fullest possible manner the diseases and disorders of infants arising from primary malnutrition. Further particulars on the subject are given below under the. headings of " Deaths under one year of age " and " Diarrhcea." Deaths. 2,482 deaths were registered in the City in the 52 weeks ending the 29th December, 1906. After deducting 1,055 deaths of non.citizens in public institutions in the City, and adding those of 790 citizens who died in other districts, the corrected total is 2,227, and is equivalent to. an annual rate of 12.8 per 1,000 persons. The London death.rate for the same period was 15.1, and for England and Wales 15.4. The rates were in each instance below the average of the preceding ten years to the following extent: The City 3.1 per 1,000, London 2.2 per 1,000, and England and Wales 1.4 per 1,000. 11 The following comparative statement shows at a glance the death. rates per 1,000 persons estimated to be living at certain age.periods during each of the last five years:- Age.

The difference between this rate and that for England and Wales is, on the above assumption, due to differences in the age and sex constitution on the population of the district, and dividing the latter by the former a factor is obtained for correcting the crude death.rate of the district. Applying such factors (1.05107 for London, 1.13926 for Westminster) to the 1906 rates, the figures are:. Standard death.rate. Recorded death.rate. Corrected death.rate. Comparative mortality figure. England and Wales 18.19 15 4 15 .4 1,000 County of London 17 31 151 15.8 1,025 City of Westminster 16 .22 12 .8 14.5 941 For the five previous years, 1901.05, the comparative mortality figures were for the County 1,065, 1,100, 1,032, 1,042, and 1,039, and for the City 1,100, 1,082, 1,025, 940, and 993. 12 Tables II. to XII. show the vital statistics of the City and five groups of districts from 1891 to 1906. Ages at Death..Of the total deaths, 323 were those of children under 1 year of age, and 664 of persons over 65 years of age; these are referable to the various wards, as follows :. 1906 Wards.

The uncorrected rate for the City was 116 deaths per 1,000 births registered in the City, as compared with 143, the average of the previous ten years. The corrected rate was 110. The London rate for 1906 was 130, the average being 149. The infantile death.rate in England and Wales was 133, being 14 per 1,000 below the average. Table II., required by the Local Government Board, shows in detail the ages and causes of death of children under 1 year of age. An examination of the particulars ascertained on inquiry as to infantile deaths during the last 3 years shows that there had been 1,278 children born in 363 families, and that 639 of them had died. Details are given below:. 13 Infant Mortality Statistics for 1904, 1905 and 1906. Original Number in Family. Number of Families. Total Births in Families.

Thirty.eight deaths in 1906 were those of illegitimate infants. The death.rate of such children is much higher than that of legitimate infants:- Legitimate. Illegitimate. Births. Deaths. Percentage. Births. Deaths. Percentage. 1902 3,275 410 12.5 186 32 17.2 1903 3,035 345 11.3 150 25 16 .6 1904 2,920 320 10.9 134 40 29.8 1905 2,971 305 10.2 149 24 16 .1 1906 2,744 285 10.3 187 38 20 .3 Five years 14,945 1,665 11.1 806 159 19.7 Deaths from whooping cough and measles were fewer in infants under one year of age, but diarrh≈ìal and other stomach complaints caused a considerable increased mortality, there being 88 deaths from such causes, compared with HO in 1905; an analysis of these deaths shows that all the babies except six were bottle.fed. The histories of these six were as follows :- (1) The mother and another child were both ill with diarrhoea before the baby took it. (2) Lived five days, and was apparently injured at birth. (3) Lived ten days, had been given a probably contaminated " comforter " to suck. (4) Had also had occasional " bits of fish and such like." b 14 (5) House very insanitary ; other cases in same house. (6) 16th child, 9 dead, left a good deal with other children to look after. Of the bottle.fed children, 11 were illegitimate, 24 of the mothers were stated to be engaged in work, only three doing it at home, and in three other cases the mother was ill when the baby was seized; nine of the babies were in delicate health before the attack. Improper feeding "was admitted in six instances only. Tube bottles had been in use in more than half the cases. Conyenital Defects and Marasmus.-It is always difficult to know what these terms mean. They seem to cover a number of conditions, such as syphilis, improper and unsuitable feeding, and defective vitality due to the alcoholic condition of the parents, injuries, mental or physical troubles of the mother, &c. Syphilis ought to appear as the cause of death much oftener than it does. From the few deaths recorded, the public are apt to suppose that it is a negligeable quantity, but were still.births registered, it would be discovered that many of these, as well as premature ones were referable to that disease. Medical men are aware of the far.reaching consequences of this disease, as the antecedent of other ailments, as a cause of insanity, and of other defects of the nervous system. Prof. Welander, of Sweden, is quoted in a recent number of the " Lancet" as correctly speaking of syphilis as "the form of disease which during the past four centuries has perhaps of all others occasioned among the peoples of our continent the greatest amount and the highest degree of suffering." As examples of its effects upon the birth.rate of this country, take the following instances (the deaths have not been attributed in the death certificates to syphilis, but a consideration of the circumstances in each case leaves me iu no doubt in the matter):- (a) Mother in wretched health, had 16 children, 11 dead; during the last five years has twice had twins still.born, three other babies (one premature, lived a few hours, one died at four months and one at six months). (b) Mother apparently well, three children healthy, last two dead (one born dead, one lived three weeks). (c) Mother seriously ill, four children, three dead, one ill. Were syphilis to be a notifiable disease, the figures, especially in large towns would be somewhat startling. Of the infantile deaths, other than those due to stomach and bowel affections, in 43 the mothers were stated to be engaged in business in most instances away from home. Deaths from tubercular disease are referred to under the general heading later. 15 Causes of death.-These are set forth in Table X., and also their distribution in the various Wards of the City. There is an increase over 1905 in deaths from diphtheria, erysipelas, diarrhoea, diabetes, alcoholism (including cirrhosis of the liver), meningitis, Bright's disease, and from various forms of violence. Cancer.-During the six years 1901.06 there have been 1,049 deaths from malignant disease in the City; 8 of these were in persons under 25 years of age, 676 between 25 and 65, and 354 in persons over 65. Occupational Mortality.-In Tahle XI. are shown the causes of death among males and females engaged in occupation. For males the list is fairly reliable, but for women it is not so, as the occupation may not be stated in the death certificate, but wherever it has been given it has been recorded. Deaths in Block Dwellings.-These are set out together with the births in Table XII. Deaths in Common Lodging.houses.-93 deaths occurred in 1906 in the common lodging.houses and shelters in the City (91 males and 2 females). As usual, a large proportion (36) of the deaths were due to phthisis; respiratory diseases caused 18 deaths; heart disease, 13; old age, 6; kidney disease, 5; injuries, 3; cancer, 3; insanity, 2; and other complaints, 4. There were 52 deaths in St. John's Ward, 3 in St. Anne's, 2 in Kegent, 22 in Covent Garden, and 14 in Strand. During the year Bruce House has been erected as a common lodging.house at the corner of Kemble Street. The vacant land adjoining Kingsway has again been utilised for shelters, and through the agency of these places a considerable proportion of destitute persons find their way to the poor law infirmaries, and they also add to the death.rate of the district.

Communicable Diseases. (1) Compulsorily Notifiable Diseases. The details respecting the 931 notifications of infectious disease received by me are set out in the Local Government Board's Return (Table XIV), which also shows the number treated in hospital as well as the number of deaths. The number of cases of each disease notified in London since 1890 are shown in Table XIII together with cases notified during the same period in the different divisions which, with some modifications, now form the City. These figures are exclusive of duplicate notifications. The chart below indicates the number of notifications of scarlet fever, diphtheria, enteric fever, and erysipelas in each week. One hundred and eighteen visits were paid in connection with doubtful cases, contacts, children returning from fever hospitals, &c. Small-pox.‚ÄîThere were 31 notifications of this disease in London in 1906; none of these were in Westminster. Twenty-three persons were notified as having been in contact with cases of small-pox elsewhere than in the City, and these were kept under observation. Two persons suspected to be suffering from smallpox were seen by me at the request of their medical attendants. Five chicken-pox contacts were also notified by Port Sanitary Authorities.

The figures for both London and Westminster,. ^ unfortunately, agree with the expectation. So far as scarlet fever is concerned, the number of cases (540) notified in Westminster was higher than any year since 1897 (1899 being the nearest with 534).. From the tables below it will be seen that it was chiefly in St. John's and Victoria Wards that the majority of the cases occurred. In 1905 the northern part of the City was attacked, but towards the end of that year Victoria Ward became affected, and then in 1906 it spread to St. John's, being apparently associated with the group of schools on both sides of Vauxhall Bridge Road, at its lower end. Fortunately, so far as fatality was concerned, the type of the disease was of a mild character, but this mildness also contributed to the spread of the disease, as many cases were not recognised until others had been infected from them ; thus 1 find there were four cases in one house in eleven instances, three cases in seventeen instances, and two cases in forty-three instancesThe symptoms in such cases were often so slight and evanescent that no doctor was called in, or they were of an anomalous character that medical men had difficulty in deciding if it was an infectious complaint. Visits were paid to a number of children found to be absent from schools in which cases had occurred, and in several instances whole families were found who had had symptoms, which in the light of an existing well-marked case must have been due to a mild attack.

This works out at 2.5 per cent. of the notified cases, which is about the same as for all London. Scarlet Fever. 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906.

Forty-one cases occurred in houses, some occupants of which were engaged in public catering, 17 being on the premises. Five hundred and twelve of the 540 persons were removed to hospital, and 12 were eventually reported not to be suffering from scarlet fever. As stated above a considerably larger number were not notified. Five children suffered from both scarlet fever and diphtheria at different times during the year. In several instances cases of diphtheria were notified from the same house, at the same time as the scarlet fever cases; some of them proved eventually to be cases of scarlet fever. Return Cases.‚ÄîIn one or two instances it would appear that patients had been discharged from hospital before they were quite free from infection. For example (1) V. H. was notified on the 1st January and removed to hospital, sent home 19th April; on the 27th April he was notified as having an infectious discharge from the ear, and was 40 re-admitted to hospital and retained until September 27th. On April 27th and May 2nd his mother and two brothers were notified. (2) G. Y. returned home from hospital end of December, and his brother and two others in house were notified on the 5 th and 11th January. (3) E. L. discharged 26th February, mother notified March 10th. (4) L. G. discharged 9th March, brother and sister notified 19th March. It is impossible in every case to be certain that no trace of infection exists in the-nose or throat, but the few cases in which "return" cases have resulted, show that considerable care is exercised in the Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals. It is even possible that some of the four mentioned above were not the cause of the subsequent cases, as in several instances second cases occurred in houses a few days before the return of the first child from hospital, thus F. L. returned from hospital on April 6th, but a child, F. G., in another family in the house was notified on the 3rd April, and F. L.'s two sisters were notified on the 18th and 23rd. Diphtheria.‚ÄîAs with scarlet fever, so with diphtheria, there was also an increase generally, but the notified cases were not so much above the numbers notified in recent years. There were 206 in Westminster (189 went to hospital), and 30 were eventually stated not to be suffering from the complaint (but as to that there is room for some doubt). There were many cases with scarcely any symptoms to attract attention, As an example, the case of a young child might be mentioned who died suddenly, and at the post-mortem examination it was found that the larynx contained a distinct membrane. His brothers and sisters were found playing in the street with others, and one of them was found to have a slightly inflamed throat, which on bacteriological examination yielded pure cultures of the specific organism. There is a further complicating circumstance in connection with diphtheria, in that persons who have been in contact with infected persons may themselves get the organism into their throats, and being insusceptible to the disease may carry it about in their throats without any symptoms or harm resulting to themselves, but may pass it on to other persons not so immune. Again, there is strong evidence that the organism itself may undergo changes, and in some forms (possibly that known as Hoffmann's pseudo diphtheria bacillus, a name which probably covers more than one form) may give rise to an infective form of sore throat, the appearance of which may not be recognised clinically as diphtheria. A further difficulty in dealing with this disease arises from the fact that in a few cases the organism may persist in the cavities of the nose for very long periods, and cases are not unknown where a 41 person has a few months after an attack again become susceptible to the action of the organisms be has been harbouring, and thus apparently has a second attack of diphtheria. In forty instances I have had a bacteriological examination made of the throats of the members of families in which a case has occurred, where no medical man was in attendance, and in five instances the true bacillus was recognised and in six the pseudo-bacillus. In conjunction with the County Education Committee, the Metropolitan Councils have agreed that it is desirable that when children are excluded from school on account of a case of diphtheria, they should not be allowed to return without a certificate of freedom from infection based on a bacteriological examination. The following experience in one of the Westminster Schools during the last year, illustrates some of the points mentioned above:‚Äî The French Protestant School, Noel Street, was visited, by request, on October 19th, to inquire into the causes of a number of cases of sore throat which had occurred among the children. The symptoms noticed were soreness and redness of the throat, with vomiting and swelling of the glands in the neck. In some cases, glairy secretion or points of matter were observed. Not all these symptoms were present in every instance. In no case was any sign of membrane observed. History of the Outbreak.‚ÄîThe School was opened after the holidays on the 27th August, and the first case of sore throat occurred on 17th September. The child attacked remained at home until October 1st. The second case occurred on the 19th September, and the child was away until the 15th October. No association of these cases with previous cases of diphtheria was discovered, but the mother and brother of the second child suffered at the same time from some form of sore throat. The attack must have been of some severity, since the child was absent for four weeks. On September 20th three fresh cases occurred, but the attacks must have been very mild, as in each instance the children were absent for only two days. Two more cases occurred on the 24th, and after this date there were none until October 4th, when another child was taken ill. On the 8th, four more children were attacked; cases occurred also on the 11th, 15th and 19th, and there were two more on the 23rd. There appears to have been two distinct outbreaks, separated by an interval of ten days, one lasting from the 17th to the 24th September (7 cases), and the other from the 4th to the 23rd October (11 cases). It is probable that the second outbreak was started by the return to school, on October 1st, of two of the children attacked during the earlier one, and, as will be seen farther on, one of these children was found 42 when examined three weeks later, to have Hoffmann's bacilli in her throat. It it difficult, however, to be certain as to which were the infecting children, because, as already stated, three of the children of the first group were absent only for two days, and may have returned in an infectious state. Only four of the children were absent from school for a foitnight or longer. Three were known to have been attended by a doctor, but in none of them was the diagnosis of diphtheria made, owing apparently to the mildness of the attacks, and to the absence of visible membrane. The children attacked varied in age from 6 to 13 years. Distribution and Incidence.‚ÄîThe outbreak occurred only in the Girls' Department of the school. There were no cases in the Boys' Department, which immediately adjoins and forms part of the same building. There were two classes in the Girls' Department‚Äîone for the older pupils containing 29 girls, and one for the younger containing 22 girls. There were 11 cases in the former class and 7 in the latter. The two classes mixed at prayers and used the same towels, basins, and drinking cups. The effect of personal contact on the spread of the disease is shown by the fact that 13 out of the 17 children attacked sat next to one another in class. The accompanying diagram shows the places in class occupied by the sick children:‚Äî 43 On the 20th October, with the permission of the parents, swabs were taken from the throats of two of the children. The ones selected were the child who was believed to have been the first attacked, and the child who had been taken ill the 'most recently. The examination proved negative in the case of the former, but Klebs LSffler bacilli were found in the throat of the second child. All children who had been the subjects of a throat attack were then excluded from the school pending the result of a bacteriological examination of their throats. This proved negative in all but two cases. In one of these the specific bacilli were found, and in the other Hoffmann's bacillus was present. The presence of this last named bacillus was thought to point to the possibility of the child having been the subject of an attack of true diphtheria. As already mentioned, the return of this child to school occurred a few days before the second outbreak, and may have been a factor in determining it. In the throat of another child streptococci and staphylococci were found, and it was deemed advisable to exclude her for a few days. From the subjoined table it will be seen that the cases of Diphtheria in Westminster were fairly spread over the twelve months, and Table XIY shows that the southern part of the city suffered chiefly:‚Äî Notification of Diphtheria Cases Received in each Month of the Years 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1905, and 1906.

The rate would be lowered still more if antitoxin was more extensively employed by general practitioners, as it is they who see the cases in the earliest, stages. The mildness of many of the cases may have conduced to the higher mortality this year through the nature of the malady not being recognised in the early stages. In one instance four cases occurred in one house (infected from a baby who died unnotified); in one instance three cases occurred, and in ten instances two cases. Two children were sent back to hospital after discharge:‚Äî (1) P. P. admitted with scarlet fever 25th September, 1905, discharged January 3rd. On January 5th the diphtheria bacilluswas found, and she was re-admitted, but the Metropolitan Asylums Board Bacteriologist was unable to find it after four cultures. She was therefore discharged again on January 12th. (2) S. M. notified with diphtheria 28th January, discharged 19th February; discovered to have rhinitis, culture taken and bacillus reported present. Re-admitted to hospital and kept till 8th June. Typhoid Fever.‚ÄîSince the connection of this disease with certain articles of food liable to be contaminated with infected sewage was recognised, a decided improvement in the number of cases has occurred, especially at sea-side towns. Consequently, persons returning home from a stay at such places do not come back infected with typhoid fever so frequently as formerly. Still a considerable proportion of the cases notified in Westminster have contracted the disease elsewhere frequently abroad, and a certain number of such cases may be expected annually. Forty-seven notifications were received in 1906, but seven persons were eventually stated not to be suffering from this disease. The cases were spread over all Wards as shown in Table XIV. Four deaths occurred. Thirty-two of the notified persons were removed to hospital. Examination for the presence of the Widal re-action was made, at the Council's expense, in sixteen instances; in five it was present, in nine absent, and in two it was doubtful, but both of these were notified; they proved eventually not to be cases of typhoid fever. No history of the source of infection was made out in twenty of the cases; in eighteen the patients were ill on arrival in Westminster; three cases were attributed to infected shell-fish, three to contact with other cases, and several to drinking polluted water (Paris, Naples, New York, &c.). 45 There were two cases of "continued fever" notified. Puerperal Fever.‚ÄîNine notifications were received and five deaths ensued. The cases were all in the south-west part of the City. No evidence of want of care of those in attendance was discovered. In one case the illness was evidently due to tuberculosis. Disinfection was carried out after each, including the clothing, &c., of those in attendance. In two instances there were insanitary conditions, existing. In London as a whole there was a slight increase in the number of cases. Erysipelas.‚ÄîAn enquiry has recently been made among Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health with reference to erysipelas by Sir Shirley Murphy. From the replies it appears that disinfection of rooms and of clothing is not generally practised except in special eases. Opinions vary as to the usefulness of notification. One medical officer considers it is not worth the money paid for it, another considers it essential as tending to maintain the health of the borough, and another points out that in 26.6 per cent. of the cases various insanitary conditions in the homes of the patients have been dealt with. Generally the conclusions are in favour of the retention of notification. The sum payable for the notification of erysipelas in the whole of London probably does not exceed ¬£500 a year. In some boroughs, the majority of the cases are derived from common lodging houses, shelters, and Poor Law Institutions, but in other boroughs the number so derived was only 20 per cent. of the total. In Westminster during the last five years only about 8 per cent. of the cases were from common lodging houses or infirmaries, &c., no home address being given. In Westminster disinfection is not carried out after every case. Each is enquired into, and if it is found that the condition of the premises, bedding and clothing require it, or that the erysipelas was associated with a discharging wound, or if a confinement is expected in the house, then disinfection is carried out. In 20 per cent. of the total eases notified disinfection was carried out, but only in 10 per cent. of those notified from private dwellings. In the summary of the replies to the enquiry, except puerperal fever, no connection with other notifiable infectious diseases appears to have been traced ; but as the question only asked if observations were made, there may have been other diseases such as infantile diarrhoea and other septic infections in houses in which erysipelas has occurred, which were not mentioned in the replies. With the view to discover if any apparent connection existed between erysipelas and other diseases of that class I have examined D 46 the records of 630 cases notified during the last five years, and of the houses in which the cases occurred. These only record deaths and notifiable diseases, and there may, in addition, have been many cases of illness in the houses which did not prove fatal, but which may have had some relation to the erysipelas attack, or have been induced by the presence of the same conditions favourable to the production of erysipelas; such cases would not necessarily come to my knowledge. It appears that in twenty-nine houses in which cases had been notified, thirty-one cases of the same complaint were subsequently notified; seventeen of these were attacks in different persons, twelve were second attacks, and two third attacks in the same person. The following are instances of more than one attack occurring in the same house:‚Äî (1) 1st case 18th June, 1902; 2nd case on same floor 1st December, 1902. (2) 1st case 5th February, 1904; 2nd case 16th December, 1904. (3) 1st case 12th October, 1904; 2nd case in same rooms, 14th November, 1905. The subsequent attacks all occurred in different persons. Puerperal fever occurred in two houses in which there had been erysipelas. In one case the child had erysipelas on the 16th February, and the mother died of puerperal fever on the 19th February; in the second a case of erysipelas occurred on the 27th January, and a woman died of puerperal fever on the 2nd March of the same year. The reverse occurred in one instance, puerperal fever in January, erysipelas in the following May. In 1906, nine women had puerperal fever, in no instance had there been any erysipelas in the house; five infants died from erysipelas, but in no instance was the mother infected therefrom. In 39 houses scarlet fever cases occurred. In 15 houses diphtheria cases occurred. In 10 houses enteric fever cases occurred. In 12 houses chicken pox cases occurred, and In 1 house small pox (2 cases) occurred. Deaths occurred in the erysipelas houses in the five years as follows:‚Äî In two houses deaths from other septic diseases, in fourteen pneumonia, in eight measles, in four whooping cough, in four diarrhoea, and in one rheumatic fever. There is thus not much evidence of relationship between these complaints and erysipelas. Occupation.‚ÄîParticulars as to the occupations, where stated, have been taken out, and the percentage of the total cases (in persons above 10), occurring in each group is given with the percentage of people employed in that occupation. From this table it does not appear that 47 there is any particular incidence on any one group except among labourers, costermongers, &c. The proportion ot cases in the other groups bears a very close relationship to the number of persons in the group. Erysipelas‚ÄîIncidence on Occupations. Occupations.

Females have therefore been attacked in greater proportion than males. Out of 347 cases in which the parts attacked were noted, the face was the site of the complaint in 277, the leg in 53, and the arm in 13. The attacks were most fatal where young children or old persons were concerned. 4.4 per cent. of the cases were fatal, but in Knightsbridge St. George's "Ward, the mortality was as much as 17.6 per cent. due to some extent to the fact that some deaths were due to cellulitis, resulting in some instances from injury. Seasonal Incidence.‚ÄîThe subjoined Table shows the months in which cases occurred. In the five yearly total the distribution of cases seems fairly uniform, except as regards October, which has a large number. The months when the greatest number of notifications occurred were September, 1905, and October, 1906. The maxima did not occur during the period of greatest temperature, but rather at the time when it is on the decline, and when there is an addition of moisture. The maxima of erysipelas seem to coincide with the maxima of scarlet fever. Careful comparison of the numbers notified with meteorological curves would probably show that atmospheric conditions have some influence in determining attacks, since the cases tend to occur in groups about the same dates, followed by intervals of a week or so. d 2 48 Erysipelas‚Äî Cases and No. of Deaths at different age periods.

Although a number of the cases notified as erysipelas are probably not true cases of the disease, the term being somewhat loosely applied to several affections accompanied by redness of the skin varying in severity from slight erythema, arising from gastric disturbances, to fatal cellulitis, yet on the whole it appears desirable that notification should be continued. 49 ERYSIPELAS-No. of cases in the City and the various Wards during last Five Years.

Tubercular Disease.‚ÄîDeaths from tuberculosis have been decreasing in numbers since 1901. The figures for the last five years are set forth below:- The City of Westminster. Year. Pulmonary. Abdominal. Meningeal. Other. Total. Deaths. Rates. Deaths. Rates. Deaths. Rates. Deaths. Rates. Deaths.

For purposes of comparison with the whole of London, differences in the number of males and females, and their relative ages, have to be taken into account. This may be effected by multiplying the rates by a factor (0.89205). The figures are then:‚Äî Year. Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Total Tubercular Kates. County. City. County. City. 1901 165 167 229 202 1902 161 159 223 199 1903 155 154 213 178 1904 162 136 - 171 1905 142 131 - 168 1906 144 121 - 158 Were the 35 deaths of inmates of common lodging-houses excluded, the phthisis rate for the City would be reduced from 136 to 116, St. John's Ward (with 21 deaths) would be reduced to 251, Covent Garden (11 deaths) to 189, and the Sirand Ward (3 deaths) to 78. The death-rate for males from tubercular disease was 255 in 1906 per 100,000 male inhabitants, the average of the previous five years being 277. For females, the 1906 rate was 112, the average being 142, apparently an improvement of about 8 per cent. on the rate for males, and 21 per cent. on that for females. It is evident from the figures given above that while pulmonary tuberculosis is diminishing, no improvement is noticeable in other forms of the disease. Reference to Table X. shows that the persons who died, especially from meningeal tuberculosis, were, as a rule, younger than those who died from consumption of the lungs. A Royal Commission was appointed in 1901 to enquire into the relations between human and bovine tuberculosis, and they have issued two interim reports. 51 The tubercular rates per 100,000 for each ward are:- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Conduit.

He asserted on that occasion, as the result of his experiments and enquiries, that the bacillus of human tuberculosis was unable to give rise to tuberculosis in the ox, and maintained that bovine tuberculosis could not be the cause of tuberculosis in man. The Commission, in their first interim report, were able to show that they had succeeded, where Professor Koch had failed, in communicating human tuberculosis to bovine animals, and that his assumptions, even if they had any foundation, were at least too sweeping to be accepted as guides to conduct or to legislation. The present report carries the matter considerably further, the Commissioners say definitely that the effects produced on animals by the injection of tuberculous matter from human sources, appear to them to be absolutely identical with the effects of the bacillus of bovine tuberculosis. They have wholly failed to discover any essential differences between the one and the other; both are equally virulent‚Äî i.e., equally able to set up tuberculosis in bovine and other animals. The general results so far attained by the enquiry are summed up in the following conclusions:‚Äî "There can be no doubt but that in a certain number of cases the tuberculosis occurring in the human subject, especially in children, is 52 the direct result of the introduction into the human body of the bacillus of bovine tuberculosis; and there also can be no doubt that in the majority at least of these cases the bacillus is introduced through cows milk. Cows milk containing bovine tubercle bacilli is clearly a cause of tuberculosis and of fatal tuberculosis in man. "Of the 60 cases of human tuberculosis investigated by us, 14 of the viruses belonged to group 1‚Äîthat is to say, contained the bovine bacillus. If, instead of taking all these 60 cases, we confine ourselves to cases of tuberculosis in which the bacilli were apparently introduced into the body by way of the alimentary canal, the proportion of group 1 becomes very much larger. Of the total 60 cases investigated by us, 28 possessed clinical histories indicating that in them the bacillus was introduced through the alimentary canal. Of these, 13 belong to group 1. Of the 9 cases in which cervical glands were studied by us, 3, and of the 19 cases in which the lesions of abdominal tuberculosis were studied by us, 10 belong to group 1. "These facts indicate that a very large proportion of tuberculosis contracted by ingestion is due to tubercle bacilli of bovine source. " A very considerable amount of disease and loss of life, especially among the young, must be attributed to the consumption of cows milk containing tubercle bacilli. The presence of tubercle bacilli in cows milk can be detected, though with some difficulty, if the proper means be adopted, and such milk ought never to be used as food. There is far less difficulty in recognising clinically that a cow is distinctly suffering from tuberculosis, in which case she may be yielding tuberculous milk. The milk coming from such a cow ought not to form part of human food, and indeed ought not to be used as food at all. "Our results point clearly to the necessity of measures more stringent than those at present enforced being taken to prevent the sale or the consumption of such milk." The enquiries which are made into the circumstances of each case in Westminster show that in a considerable proportion the infection is undoubtedly of human origin. Typical examples of such in infants are the following:- (a) Father and grandfather died of phthisis; two sisters have it; one other dead from tuberculosis of bowels. (b) Father out-patient at Brompton; one child died in 1905 of meningitis. (c) Father consumptive; previous child died from tubercle. (d) Father consumptive. (e) Mother consumptive. (f) Father consumptive. (g) Mother consumptive; previous baby died from tubercular meningitis. 53 Occupations of Adult Males and of Husbands or Parents of Persons who died from Tubercular Disease in the 6 years 1901-6.

Another point which ought to be considered is the question of the employment in the handling of milk of persons suffering from consumption. In the list of occupations of persons who have died from consumption will be found three persons engaged in this business. It. is difficult to imagine that they would not infect the milk they wereselling. Notification.-Seventy-eight notifications were received in 1906; the numbers in previous years were: 1903, 123; 1904, 148; 1905, 112. The cost was ¬£3 4s. 6d. Ninety-four visits were paid in connection with consumption cases, but in addition thereto 122 cases were visited from time to time by the Health Society's visitors. Seventy-seven rooms in 64 houses and 864 articles were disinfected by the Council's staff, and general cleansing of the premises was carried out after each death, or removal from one house to another. 55 (3) Non.notifiable Diseases.

The certificate of freedom from infection, based on bacteriological examination, will be accepted either from general practitioners or from the medical officer of health. Measles.-Children suffering from measles must be excluded from school for at least one month. Children coming from houses where measles exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease, should be dealt with as follows :A child attending other than an infants' school who lias had measles need not be excluded from attendance at school. 60 A child attending other than an infants' school who has not had measles must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of fourteen days from the occurrence of the first case. A child attending an infants' school, whether or not it has had measles, must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of fourteen days from the occurrence of the last case. Children suffering from the following diseases must be excluded from school for the undermentioned periods :‚Äî- Mumps, for one month. Chicken-pox, for at least two weeks or until every scab has fallen off the scalp or body. Whooping-cougli, for as long as the cough continues, and not less than five weeks from the commencing of the whooping. Children coming from houses in which either mumps, chickenpox, or whooping-cough exists must be dealt with as follows:‚Äî (a) Children in schools other than infants' schools who have not had the disease, and all children in infants' schools must be excluded. (b) Children in schools other than infants' schools who have had the disease need not be excluded. Children living in infected houses and excluded from school under a and b must absent themselves for the undermentioned periods:‚Äî Mumps, for such time as the medical attendant dealing with the case deems necessary, or in cases where there is no medical attendant for three weeks. Chicken-pox, for two weeks. Whooping-cough, for two weeks. The sanitary arrangements of 13 schools were improved or re-constructed during the year, and the use of one building as a school was given up. It is probable that certain schools will be discontinued, as it is impossible to make them comply with modern requirements. 61 Bacteriological Laboratory. During the year 180 examinations have been made at the Lister Institute at a cost of ¬£24 13s.7d., as follows:- Disease. Persons. Examinations. Results. Positive. Negative. Doubtful. Diphtheria- Suspected cases 91 93 30 (H1) 63 (SPyl) - Contacts 40 50 5 45 (H 6) - Returned from hospital with nasal or aural discharges 7 10 2 8(H1) - 138 153 37 116 - Typhoid Fever 16 16 5 9 2 Tuberculosis 10 12 4 8 Contacts.-The value of examining children who have been exposed to diphtheria infection is shown by the fact that five cases were thus detected, in three of which the parents did not think there was anything wrong, and were allowing the children to associate with others. Hoffmann's pseudo-bacillus was reported to be present in eight instances, and the streptococcus pyogenes in one instance, where a bad throat developed after exposure to a case of erysipelas. Seven persons returning from hospital after treatment for scarlet fever or diphtheria, with discharges from nose or ears, were examined, and in two instances the diphtheria organism was reported as present; both were returned to hospital, in one instance further examination in hospital failed to discover the organism, but the other was retained in hospital for 3¬Ω- months. The two cases in which the Widal reaction was doubtful were returned from hospital as not typhoid fever. In addition to those mentioned above, many medical men and hospitals obtain reports on their cases from private or hospital laboratories. Disinfection. During 1906,1,627 rooms in 961 houses were disinfected by the Staff of the Department, 47,805 articles were subjected to disinfection in the City Disinfecting Stations. The premises included 11 schools and 20 sets of offices, 1 cab, 2 private carriages, and 3 undertakers' carriages were also disinfected. In addition, a number of rooms and their contents were disinfected to the satisfaction of medical men by private firms. 195 articles were destroyed by fire at the request of the owners. e 62 Disinfection was carried out after all cases of the notifiable diseases, except as regards erysipelas (in which disinfection was performed in 36 instances, when the circumstances of the case required it), and also after 39 cases of measles, 4 chicken-pox, 8 cancer, 2 influenza, 1 mumps, and 64 phthisis. 363 books were disinfected. Books belonging to the public libraries are, as a rule, treated by the librarians, a copy of each certificate of infectious disease being sent to the Chief Librarian. Shelters.‚ÄîOne person, a nurse, was admitted to the temporary shelter at Horseferry Eoad, while her clothing was being disinfected, after attendance on a case of puerperal fever. The following table gives a comparative statement of the above work during the past six years:- 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906. Premises 834 1,097 709 581 667 96 1 Rooms 1,287 1,836 1,039 935 1,177 1,627 Articles disinfected 32,218 39,965 27,766 29,107 34,703 47,865 Articles destroyed 58 37 126 52 151 195 Books disinfected 95 24 16 10 52 363 Number admitted to shelters.. 13 20 19 39 6 1 Cleansing of Persons.‚Äî Under the provisions of this Act three persons received a free bath and had their verminous clothing disinfected. Since the closing of the Denzell Street premises there has been no proper accommodation for this work, but provision is to be made at the new central station. The Guardians have dealt with freq uenters of their Casual Wards at their own establishments, thus at Bear Yard about ten cases are dealt with daily. Verminous Houses.‚ÄîForty-two rooms in twenty-nine houses were fumigated with burning sulphur by the staff, and 205 articles were passed through the disinfecting apparatus; 28 articles were dealt with as being in such a condition as likely to cause disease. Mortuaries. The number of bodies removed to the Council's mortuaries under order of the Coroner, or to await burial, was 345; in eight instances death was the result of infectious disease. Inquests were held in 283 instances at Horseferry Road, where the Coroner's Court is situated; seven adjourned inquests were held. Postmortem examinations were made in 189 instances. 63 It appears that the total number of dead bodies taken to the mortuaries is steadily declining. The diminution is among the inquest cases. The figures for the last six years are:- Total For Inquest. To await Burial. Total. For Inquest. To await Burial. 1901 438 370 66 1904 388 322 59 1902 389 345 44 1905 370 307 61 1903 393 341 55 1906 345 283 61 During 1906 steps were taken to make more generally known the existence of various places in the City where dead bodies might be taken to await burial. Of the 61 bodies admitted for this reason, 48 were taken to Horseferry Road, 8 to Dufouv's Place, 5 to Drury Lane, and none to either Ebury Bridge or Mount Street resting places. The number of bodies taken in at Horseferry Road since 1897 has, been:‚Äî Year. Bodies. Year. Bodies. Year. Bodies. 1897 131 1901 391 1904 365 1898 165 1902 371 1905 344 1899 273 1903 371 1906 332 1900 309 The total number of bodies received at Horseferry Road to await burial has increased from 22 in 1901 to 48 in 1906. e 2 64 PART II.

Duht from Buildings during Demolition.‚ÄîConsiderable annoyance frequently arises from buildings during demolition, and in old buildings the dust may be a source of danger. The City Engineer lias been in the habit of inserting in licenses for hoardings a clause that in cases where a hoarding projects more than two feet on the public footway the licensee shall undertake to keep all materials well watered to prevent dust arising. The Council, after consideration, have agreed that a condition might, with advantage, be inserted in all licences issued for hoardings erected on the public way irrespective of the extent of the encroachment, requiring that during the demolition of premises, proper and sufficient screens shall be provided, and compelling the use of water for preventing nuisance from dust. 66 Removal of House Refuse.‚ÄîMuch consideration was given to this subject by the Public Health and Highways Committee, and the following streets were added to those in which a daily collection of dust is made, viz., Sackville Street, Carlisle Place, Chadwick Street, and Vauxhall Bridge Road. In each of these streets the fixed dust-bins have been removed, and moveable ones provided. In addition, in a number of instances, fixed bins have been found in bad positions, improperly constructed or defective. The owners have been recommended in each case to do away with them, but except where the position was such that a nuisance existed, the Public Health Act does not give power to the Council to compel such removal. The majority, however, complied with the suggestion, and 142 were abolished (530 fixed brick-bins had been abolished in the previous five years); 36 were repaired and made more accessible for the dustmen. Where there is not a daily collection of dust, householders ought to be advised to burn waste matters liable to decomposition. Removal of Offensive Refuse.‚ÄîComplaints were made of offensive smells in a number of instances occurring during the removal of kitchen refuse from hotels, &c. Ten persons were cautioned and the following were prosecuted for removing refuse during prohibited hours :- Date Name and Address of Defendant Result of Proceedings. 14th June H. Hunt, Bath Road, Harlington, Mid- Fined 3s. and 2s. costs, dlesex 13th July Michael Hanlon, Lonesome, Mitcham .. Fined. 5-9. and 2s. costs. Drainage, &c., Plans.‚ÄîSix hundred and nine sets of plans were examined during 1906. 508 of these resulted from notices served by the Public Health Department, and 101 were plans of new buildings or re-constructions, the drainage of which is under the supervision of the City Engineer, with the exception of such matters as come under the Public Health Act and by-laws made thereunder in respect of water closets, water supply, ventilation, &c. In 140 instances the plans had to be amended, and sanction was refused altogether with regard to two of them. Failure to send in plans as required by law occurred ten times. Infringement of the by-laws in connection with the erection of buildings occurred in four instances, and in each case the persons responsible were cautioned by the Public Health Committee. 67 Testing Drains.‚ÄîOne thousand three hundred and thirty-four drainage systems were tested during the year, of which 339 with smoke or water were carried out under the supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors by the men of the disinfecting staff. The routine is to test a drain first by means of chemicals, and if necessary, subsequently with smoke, air, or water. After re-laying, drains below ground are tested with water, pipes above ground with smoke or air. The numbers of each test employed were:- Chemical 532 Water 567 Smoke 169 Air 147 Drainage By-laws.‚ÄîIn reply to a request from the London County Council to be informed whether any difficulty has arisen in the City in connection with the administration of the London County Council By-laws made under Section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and asking for any suggestions with regard to the amendment of these by-laws, the following report was made to the Public Health Committee by the City Engineer and Medical Officer:‚Äî We have carefully considered these by-laws, and beg to report that very little difficulty has been experienced in connection with their administration. If they are being amended, we think it might be advisable to make some alterations:‚Äî (a) By-Law 3.‚ÄîThe word bath should be added so that it reads " slop or other sink, bath or lavatory." (b) Waste pipes from lavatories, sinks, &c., should not be taken into an open hopper head, but should be connected to the down pipe by proper junctions. (c) A sink, bath or lavatory waste pipe might be allowed to discharge into a rain-water pipe, if head of rain-water pipe is above and sufficiently far away from any window, and the rain-water pipe is sound and constructed of heavy metal with joints of molten lead properly caulked. (cl) By-Lav; 5c.‚ÄîIt is frequently impossible, owing to the whole of the basement of a building being covered in, for gullies to be fixed in the open air to take the discharge from rain-water pipes and waste pipes‚Äîa gully with a sealed cover inside the building has to be used, but this does not appear to be provided for by the by-laws. It is also suggested that the pipes connected therewith, especially rain-water pipes, should be so constructed that the joints are quite air-tight, i.e., the pipes might be lead or heavy iron with caulked lead joints. 68 or joints equally good. There would appear to be adequate sanitary protection if this were done. (e) We are of opinion that iron soil-pipes are safer inside houses than lead ones. (No. 11.) (f) Double sealed covers should be required for inspection chambers inside premises. (No. 6.) (g) The by-laws should specify that joints of soil and other pipes are to be constructed in a sound and efficient manner, and that the soil-pipes themselves should be sound. (h) Anti-syphonage pipes from w.c.'s, urinals or slop sinks must not be taken into any other pipes but a soil-pipe. (i) As a 3¬Ω-inch pipe is accepted as sufficient size for ventilating a 4-inoh drain (by-law No. 8, last paragraph"), we consider by-law No. 8 (iv) should be altered from 4 inches to 35 inches also. (j) We consider 3 inches too large for the minimum size specified for a urinal waste. Intercepting Traps.‚ÄîWe also considered a suggestion by the Lewisham Borough Council that the insertion ol' an intercepting trap between the house drain and the sewer should not be required in future, and recommended the Council not to agree with the suggestion. Water Supply. Applications were received for certificates that the water supply of twenty new buildings was sufficient, and were granted in each instance. 150 notices of withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board, and in 75 instances it was reinstated. Additional sources of water supply were provided to houses in 152 instances ; this includes the provision of water on the upper floors of tenement houses. The Water Board having provided a laboratory and appointed Dr. Houston, director of water examinations, a much more thorough chemical and bacteriological examination of the water supplied to London is now carried out than was the case under the companies. The water is also examined by Dr. Thorpe on behalf of the Local Government Board. Westminster is supplied from the New Biver, Chelsea, Grand Junction, and West Middlesex Divisions, and during 1906 the supply was of good quality, though still capable of improvement. The more extensive use of stored water during times of flood has a beneficial effect in maintaining greater uniformity of quality. Houses Let in Lodgings. The demolition of property which continues, especially in St. John's Ward, continues to reduce the number of houses on the register. At 69 the end of 1905 the number was 1,641, 12 were added in 1906, and 46 removed, leaving 1,602 at the end of the year. 1,905 visits were paid, nearly all by the women Inspectors. Overcrowding was found in 10 instances, and other defects 240. Housing of the Working Classes. Marshall Street Dwellings.‚ÄîThe City Council have added to the dwellings under their control a block of 20 tenements on a site of about 3,255 square feet in their possession in Marshall Street, which was lately occupied by three small houses. The cost of the buildings (exclusive of the value of the site, ¬£2,700) amounted to ¬£4,635. The building is five storeys in height, including half basement and attic storey. There are 10 three room tenements and ten two room tenements; the former being let at 1 1s. to 1 1s. 6d. per week, the latter at 8s. to 8s. 6d. per week. These rents include chimney sweeping and the free use of Venetian blinds. The living rooms are 148 feet super., and the bedrooms vary from 103 feet to 113 feet super. The height being 8 feet 6 inches. All the tenements are self-contained, i.e., each has a separate scullery and w.c. Every tenement is entered from a lobby so as to give absolute privacy to the respective tenants, and from this lobby access is obtained to the scullery and w.c., which are completely cut off from the living room. These lobbies are provided with shelves, hat and coat hooks, &c. Each kitchen is supplied with a self-setting close range fitted with removable oven, a cupboard divided into two parts, the upper part for the storage of food and properly ventilated, the lower part as a receptacle for household utensils. A dresser or rows of shelves has also been provided. All the bedrooms have been fitted with a mantel register and supplied with a good sized cupboard with hooks for hanging clothes. Each scullery is fitted with a copper for boiling linen, a glazed stoneware washing trough, and a gas cooking stove. There is also a large coal bunk next the sink, the top of which serves as a draining board to the sink. Every tenement is lighted by gas on the penny-in-the-slot system. The staircase walls have been faced with marble mosaic to ensure an absolutely smooth and clean surface requiring no annual expense for distempering, and the staircase is made attractive by the use of ornamental panelled balusters instead of plain bars. The floors throughout are of fireproof construction, and the pavings and landings are formed of granolithic materia). The lavatories are paved with mosaic, and the walls thereof have a dado of similar material. The dwellings have been occupied since early in August by 20 families, comprising 72 persons. The terms of letting require that 70 tenants shall be members of the working classes, of British nationality, employed at limited wages in the City of Westminster. St. John's Westminster Improvement.‚ÄîThe London County Council in 1900 began the Millbank Improvement Scheme, and have been since then employed in buying and pulling down the property necessary to give effect thereto. A syndicate (The-Victoria Embankment Contract Syndicate) have now obtained an Act of Parliament (6 Edw. 7, ch. clxxv) whereby in addition to obtaining a lease of the County Council's surplus land, they will be able to acquire additional property, and will thus have control of the square block bounded by Wood Street, Horseferry Road, Millbank and Laundry Yard. The works authorised include a widening of Marsham Street on both sides for the whole length of the street, a widening of Wood Street and Great Peter Street on the southern sides thereof, between St. John Street and the west side of Laundry Yard, and the formation of a new street from Horseferry Road to Wood Street. This will necessitate the closing of a number of small streets and courts, and the demolition of many houses which have required a very considerable amount of sanitary supervision in the past‚Äîto which reference was made in my Annual Eeport for 1905. The area of the improvement includes Nos. 2 and 3 and part of No. 5 Enumeration Districts of the Census Registration District, and at the last Census in 1901 the whole of this area contained 460 houses with a population of about 5,250. Probably about 3,000 of these lived in that part of the area now to be dealt with by the Syndicate; but the numbers have in the meantime been reduced to some extent. The County Council state that the number of persons of the working classes displaced under the Millbank Scheme was 2,242, but that accommodation for them was provided on the Millbank Estate (the total accommodation there being now 4,430). It has been ascertained that the further improvement now authorised by the above-named Act will have the effect of displacing 1,846 persons of the working classes. Nothing is said in the Act as to making provision for these persons, but the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903, requires re-housing accommodation to be provided where as many as 30 persons of the labouring classes are displaced under the provisions of any Act. Vincent Place Buildings.‚ÄîThe Ecclesiastical Commissioners have completed a block of buildings on a site at Regency Street, Chapter Street, Frederick Street, and Hide Place, containing 42 tenements, 15 of two rooms each, 9 of three rooms, and 18 of four rooms. The dwellings are now occupied by 42 families, comprising 148 persons, 51 being children. The site was formerly occupied by 12 small 71 houses of an inferior type to the dwellings now erected. They contained 75 rooms, and acccommodated about 110 persons. A number (39) of cottages in Willow Street have been, or will shortly be, demolished, displacing about 200 persons of the working class; and adjoining is an area for sale which contains 27 houses occupied by 260 persons. The houses will probably be demolished also in the near future. There is, however, much empty or partially unlet property in the adjoining Pimlico district. Many houses there originally intended for one family in each, have been converted into tenement houses without the addition of those conveniences which are obtainable in a modern dwelling of the type described above. It would effect an improvement in this class of property if no owner were allowed in future to convert a one-family house into a tenement house without obtaining the sanction of the sanitary authority, who should see that sufficient and suitable arrangements had been made as regards storage of food, cooking, water supply, w.c. accommodation, &c. Revenue Act. Applications have been received by me in respect of 14 sets of premises, including in them 144 tenements. These have been inspected by me, with the result that the certificate was granted in 79 instances, 62 were deferred pending certain works to be carried out, -and in three instances the certificates were refused. The premises in which the tenements are situated for which application was made are as follows :‚Äî 21, Bourdon Street. Talbot House. 26, Grosvenor Mews. Newport House. Wardour House. Lyric Chambers. Marshall Street Dwellings. Caere Chambers. Charing Cross Mansions. Carey Mansions. Burleigh Mansions. Nos. 2, 15, 16, 30 and 31, G-arden Street. ‚Ä¢64, Cambridge Street.

Workshops. Section 132 of the Factory and Workshops Act directs that "The Medical Officer of Health of every District Council shall in his annual report to them report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State," and forms have been supplied giving a summary of what is required. It is, however, a matter of difficulty to apportion work, ‚Ä¢especially as workshops and dwellings are so intermingled. The following shows the state of the register of workshops at the end of 1906:- Workshops on the Register (s. 131) at the end of the Year. Number. Number of Inspections.

Thus about 600 changes were recorded during the year. The number of inspections of workshops (including factories) and workplaces is shown in the above Table, and also in those following. 117 complaints were received from the Home Office and were duly investigated.

Outworkers are constantly changing their addresses and their employers, so that it is difficult to maintain a correct register. The Order issued by the Home Office applies to the following classes of work:- 75 (a) The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing, and repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto. (b) The making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets. (c) Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work. (d) The making of electro-plate. (e) The making of files. (f) Fur-pulling. (g) The making of iron and steel cables and chains. (h) The making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels. (i) The making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gear buckles, mullin bits, hooks, and attachments of all kinds. (j) The making of locks, latches, and keys. (k) The making of covers for, and the covering, finishing, altering, or repairing of, umbrellas, sunshades, parasols, and articles of a similar character, and any work incidental thereto. (l) The making of paper bags and of paper boxes. (m) Brushmaking, and (n) The making of stuffed toys. A list must be kept in the form and with the particulars specified in the factory or workshop or place from which the work is given out, and must be open to inspection by H.M. Inspectors and the officers of the local authority; and a copy of the list signed and dated and corrected up to that date must be forwarded to the local authority of the district on or before the first day of February and the first day of August in each year. Section 110 of the Factory Act, which prohibits home work in places where there is infectious disease, applies to the above, with the exception of (d), (e), (g), (A), (i), (j). The following table gives particulars of the outworkers whose addresses were received in 1906. Considerable difficulty is experienced in obtaining these returns. Notwithstanding that notices are published in the local and trade newspapers, that notices are sent to employers, and visits of reminder are paid by Inspectors, yet there is repeated failure on the part of employers to send in the lists at the stated times. The Home Secretary recently addressed a letter to Local Authorities to bring specially before them the question of enforcement of the provisions of the Act which deal with home work, that is, work in the manufacture, or repair, &c. of articles of the kind specified above in the worker's own house. 76 OUTWORKERS.

The importance of this with regard to articles of clothing will be readily appreciated. Two hundred and thirty-four notices were sent out to employers reminding them of their duty in the matter, notwithstanding which 20 employers failed to send in lists at the February period and 19 on the 1st August. The Council has given instructions, that if after notice and a visit from the Inspector default continued, that legal proceedings should follow. Seventy-eight visits were paid to ascertain whether outworkers were employed. The system does not appear to be altogether satisfactory, as the persons employed as outworkers are not engaged continuously or regularly, and it may happen that when the lis^s are sent in business is at the moment slack, and few outworkers are being employed. It would probably be better to require employers to send in the names and addresses of new outworkers at the time they are taken on, so that their homes or places of business might be at once inspected, if not already on the Council's Register. Frequently a worker may have been employed during the year by several firms, either at one time or successively, so that the number of names returned does not necessarily coincide with the actual number of workers. In one instance a man was on ten lists. About 1,200 visits were paid to outworkers' premises. The defects found are included under the heading "Workshops," as the terms are synonymous in a great many instances. At one time a man may be doing a little work on his own account, without employing any assistance except perhaps from members of his own family, his place is then a " domestic workshop " ; at another time he may be employing other persons, when it becomes an ordinary " workshop "; and at either period he may be receiving work from other firms, or from a middleman, when he becomes an " outworker." During 1905, cases of notifiable infectious disease occurred in 45 families engaged in clothing trades at home, and in 7 families of other home workers. F 78 The details are:‚Äî Clothing Trades. Scarlet Fever. Diphtheria. Typhoid Fever. Erysipelas. Total. (a) Business in family affected 29 5 3 8 45 (1) Business in other parts of house 30 11 - 2 43 (c) Persons from infected houses employed in clothing business elsewhere 28 9 1 2 40 87 25 4 12 128 Other home workers :‚Äî (a) Business in family 5 2 ‚Äî ‚Äî 7 (S) Business in other part of 3 ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî 3 In addition, in connection with Laundries there were cases of the above three classes:‚Äî (a) (i) (c) In Receiving Shops ‚Äî Diphtheria (1) ‚Äî Mangling only Scarlet Fever (1) ‚Äî ‚Äî -rrr t . x ¬ª f Scarlet Fever (1) Scarlet Fever (3) Diphtheria (2) Washing, Ironing, &c. Erysipelas ft __ Erysipelas (1) In all these cases the patients were removed to hospital and the premises disinfected. In no instance was it found necessary to stop work being given out to workers in premises which were in an insanitary condition, any such defects found were forthwith remedied, and none of them were of a serious character. Sixty visits were paid to Domestic Workrooms, i.e., where no work was being taken in from another business firm, and no one outside the family was ever employed. Factory and Workshops Bill (116).‚ÄîThis Bill was introduced into Parliament last Session to amend and strengthen certain of the sections of the existing. Act. I reported on it as follows:‚Äî " Clause 1 relates to outworkers, and would apply all the provisions of existing Acts to the places to which work is sent to be done, and would treat the giver out of the work as the occupier of the place. Apparently this is intended to bring ' domestic workshops under the Act,' but it would be impracticable to make the giver out of the work responsible for cleansing, &c., of the premises to which he may give out work. " Sub-clause 5 asks for lists of outworkers to be sent in four times a year instead of twice, as at present. There is sufficient trouble now 79 to get the lists, and as the object sought for is to obtain the names of outworkers who may be taken on for short intervals, it would be better to require lists to be sent in once a year, and further require employers to send in the names of any other outworkers they may take on during the year. "Clause 6. Underground Workshops.‚ÄîIt is proposed that such workshops shall not be used unless certified in the same way as bakehouses have been. This would be useful, especially if extended to include ' workplaces,' which would bring in many places where food is prepared; but as no provision is made in this Bill or in the FactoryAct for the withdrawal of such certificate if at any time the premises are found not to comply with the requirements, a clause should be introduced giving a magistrate power to close an underground bakehouse or workshop on being shown that it was unsuitable for use. " Clause 34 prohibits the employment of a woman within two months, and eventually within six months after the birth of a child. The Conference on Infant Mortality recommended that the period be three months, but also goes further in prohibiting the employment of a woman for a similar period before her confinement. " Clause 69 extends the sanitary provisions of the Factory Act to men's workshops. One of the sections of the Act which would be applicable is No. 9, which requires ' proper separate accommodation for persons of each sex.' This is a very useful power for buildings which are wholly occupied as workshops or factories, but it presses very hardly in the case of a single workshop (perhaps only one room) in a house let out in tenements. Were there no workshop one w.c. for twelve persons would be provided irrespective of Sex, but so soon as women are employed separate accommodation must be found for them. If this section is extended to male employees then a workshop in a tenement house will require to have a w.c. set apart for the men. In my opinion, the application of the section in such cases should be left to the discretion of the Local Authority." The Bill was eventually withdrawn. F 2 80 E.‚ÄîFood Supply. The food exposed for sale in shops and on stalls in the street markets has been regularly inspected every day (including Sundays). The following list shows the quantity of food condemned and destroyed during the year. The bulk of it was submitted by the owners or purchasers for the opinion of your officers:‚Äî Articles of Food Submitted. Tons. Cwts. Lbs. Tons. Cwts. Lbs.

Unsound Plums No line, 12s. 6d. costs. Above-ground Bakehouses.‚ÄîDuring 1906 there have been no additions to the above-ground bakehouses, but No. 99, Horseferry Eoad, No. 48, Eomney Street, and No. 72, Vauxhall Bridge Eoad are not at present being used as bakehouses; there are, therefore, 16 now in use. Underground Bakehouses.‚ÄîThere are 81 now being used in the City. Three in use at the passing of the Act have been certified and added to the list, viz.: No. 173, New Bond Street, No. 162, Victoria Street and Hyde Park Hotel. Four which were in use in 1905 have been discontinued, viz.: No. 78, Berwick Street, No. 1, Old Compton Street, No. 76, Wardour Street (demolished), and No. 415, Oxford Street. 81 Five owners failed to carry out the cleansing at the times appointed in Spring and Autumn, but complied on receipt of a warning letter from the Public Health Committee, except in the case of No, 78, Berwick Street, against the owner of which proceedings were taken for not having the necessary cleansing work carried out and also for allowing the premises to get into such a state as to be unfit for use as a bakehouse. A fine of forty shillings was imposed on the summons taken out under Section 98 of the Factory and Workshops Act. The use of the bakehouse was given up. It appears that under the Factory and Workshops Act no power is given to a Magistrate to make a Closing Order with regard to bakers' premises which have been allowed to become unfit for use, unless action, be taken through the nuisance sections of the Public Health Act. As a rule the bakehouses are well conducted. It would be an improvement, which would be appreciated by the public, if bakers generally would follow the example of those who now send out loaves, and rolls for delivery each enclosed in a paper bag. It would prevent; the occurrence of such contamination as is related by a member of a West-End Club in a letter to the Lancet; he " was in the habit of taking a walk before breakfast, and daily passed two well-known bakers' shops, and saw, most mornings, loaves in trays placed on the pavement with dogs prowling round, hand carts with baskets full of bread suspended from the handles and frequently bumping in the mud, and sometimes loaves fell off into the roadway and were replaced unwiped." Two hundred and twenty-two visits were paid in 1906 to the 97 bakehouses. Ice Cream Premises.‚ÄîPlaces (116) where ice-creams are manufactured or sold were visited 180 times during the year. In two instances notices were served that the places were not suitable for the purpose, and steps were taken to make them comply with legal requirements. Street vendors were also looked after, and one was cautioned for not having his name affixed to his barrow. Restaurants, Eating Houses, &c.‚Äî516 visits were paid to premises of this description. Five restaurants received certificates that they complied with the conditions of sanitary fitness specified in the Annual Report for 1905. Other places engaged in the preparation of foods and mineral waters were also frequently inspected. Slaughter-house.‚ÄîThere is only one (14, Regency Street) which is used occasionally. It was visited weekly. Covjsheds.‚ÄîThere are only two cow-keepers (13, Marsham Street, 19 cows; 7, Arthur Street, 12 cows) in the City. Their premises were visited 34 times each during the year. 82 Milkshops.‚ÄîAt the end of 1905 there were 299 on the Register, 34 new names have been added and 1 removed, making 332 at the end of 1906. 397 visits were paid by the District Inspectors to the premises in addition to visits at regular intervals to the milk-shop itself by the Inspectors under the Sale of Food and Drags Acts. No name is placed on the register until the sanitary condition of the premises has been examined. Notices requiring them to register were sent to a number of persons who had been found selling milk. Proceedings were about to be taken against one vendor, but as he was arrested for stealing milk-cans and sentenced to imprisonment, as well as being evicted from the rooms he occupied, no further action was taken. Two cases of enteric fever and one of diphtheria occurred on premises in which were milk-shops ; persons from two houses, in one of which a case of enteric fever, and in the other one of scarlet fever occurred, were employed in milk-shops : in each instance steps were taken to prevent contamination of the milk by disinfection, prompt removal of the cases to hospital, and suspension from work of contacts. Forty notices were served with respect to defects in premises on which milk was sold. Unclean Milk.‚ÄîThe Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth forwarded on the 13th August, 1906, a copy of certain resolutions passed at a conference of the Public Health Committee of that Council and dairymen and keepers of milkshops in that Borough on the 17th July last. The resolutions were:‚Äî "(1) That the Board of Agriculture be urged to bring into force and carry out the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order in the country, with such variations as are applicable in various districts. (2) That the Board of Agriculture be requested to take steps to ensure that the udders of the cows and the hands and arms of the person milking shall be clean at the time of milking, and that the vessel used shall be clean and be kept solely for the purpose of milking. (3) That in the opinion of this Conference all Railway Companies carrying milk should provide proper insulated trucks, as now used by the London and North-Western Railway Company for the purpose. (4) That the Board of Agriculture be urged to take steps to ensure the carriage of milk in sealed churns. (5) That in the opinion of this Conference all dairies should be licensed annually, and only licensed dairies should sell milk for consumption on or off the premises, and that all milk on the 83 counter for sale in open vessels should be covered with muslin or other suitable cover. (6) It was generally admitted that preservatives are not necessary." The City Council concurred with the suggestions contained in the resolutions referred to, and further expressed the opinion that it is desirable that sealed bottles should be substituted for the metal cans now in use for the retail delivery of milk. As some doubt has been expressed as to the powers given by the Regulations for Milkshops, it is interesting to note that in the Borough of Woolwich a prosecution was recently instituted against a General Dealer, who, inter alia, sold milk, for failing to keep his shop in a cleanly condition ; it was proved that the Defendant retailed over the counter small quantities of milk, which he kept in an uncovered receptacle; the shop was in a dirty condition and the milk was therefore liable to contamination; the Defendant was convicted, and, upon his undertaking to stop the further sale of milk in his shop, was let off with a small fine. 84 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.

Of these 119 (14.7 per cent.) were reported by the Analysts to be below the standard of the Board of Agriculture, but 88 samples were just on the border line, making a total of 25.6 per cent, of the samples. The percentage of adulterated is above the average (11.3 per cent.), as compared with 10.7 per cent, in 1905,21.5 percent. in 1904, and 12 per cent, in 1903. The Analysts have graded the samples submitted to them into four groups:‚Äî Good quality, in which the fat was over 3.8 per cent.; fair quality, in which the fat was between 33 and 3.8 per cent.; and poor or inferior quality, in which the fat was between 3 per cent, (the official standard) and 3.3 per cent., or in which the non.fatty solids were between 8.5 and 8.6 (if the fat was also below 3.8). Adulterated are below the standard. The official standard is 3 per cent, for fat and 8"5 for solids not fat. District. Total. Good Quality. Fair Quality. Poor Quality. Adulterated. No. Percent.

Warranties or disclosures were proved in 26 instances. Cautions were given to sellers whose milk contained less than 5 per cent, of added water, or had less than 5 per cent, of fat abstracted. It has been suggested that the dry weather which prevailed had the effect of reducing the quality of the milk, but this does not appear to be correct; there is no doubt, however, that the quantity supplied was less than usual, especially in the autumn. Notwithstanding this, the amount of inferior milk supplied to Westminster was not much above the usual; 64"3 per cent, of the samples were of good or fair quality, well above the official standard, as compared with 70.5 in 1905, Details of the proceedings taken are appended. Sunday Samples‚ÄîOne hundred and thirty.one of the samples of milk were taken on thirteen Sundays during the year; 15 (10.5 per cent.) were found to be adulterated and 4 (3 per cent.) were inferior, an improvement on 1905, when the figures were 14.6 and 39 respectively. Sunday used to show a larger percentage of adulteration than week days. 86 Samples taken in course of Delivery‚Äî (a) At Railway Stations.‚Äî-Sixty-eight samples of milk were taken on arrival at Victoria and Charing Cross Railway Stations; eight of these were found to have been consigned as separated milk, but no label was affixed to the churns. Of the remaining sixty, 44 were reported of good quality, 8 fair, 3 poor, and 5 adulterated (8'3 per cent.). The amount of adulteration was not above 3 per cent, in each instance. (b) On Delivery at Shops.‚ÄîTwenty-nine samples of milk were taken as it was being delivered to retail customers. Of these samples, 14 were good, 9 fair, 1 poor, and 5 adulterated. These samples were taken in consequence of the milk sold by the retailer having been previously Sampled and found below the limit. Warranties.‚ÄîA conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils as to milk warranties, &c., was held at the Town Hall, Southwark, on Wednesday, the 30th May, 1906. The following resolutions were passed:‚Äî (1) That in the opinion of this Conference, the provisions of Section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and Section 20 of the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1899, operate to the prejudice of the purchaser and the public health, and should be repealed, leaving the seller of milk to his remedy at. common law against the person from whom he purchases it. (2) That notices in shops, &o., to the effect that milk sold therein is not warranted as pure shall be no defence. (3) That the act of mixing water or separated milk with whole milk for the purpose of sale should be made a penal offence. Particulars of all cases in which warranties are proved are forwarded by the Council to the Local Government Board. In one instance proceedings were taken unsuccessfully against the giver of a warranty, but the case showed how desirable it would have been had the magistrate been able to deal with the matter as a whole, on one summons. However, a sample taken at Vauxhall Railway Station by the Lambeth Borough Council was found deficient, and the farmer was summoned and fined. Samples in other cases were also taken, by request, by Lambeth and Paddington Borough Councils at railway stations. Separated Milk.‚ÄîA considerable quantity of separated milk is consigned to dealers in the City, and while there are legitimate uses for it, I have a strong suspicion that it is also used to dilute milk of good quality. As this separated milk is sent up in churns, without any label to show the nature of its contents, the Council addressed a communication to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries forwarding particulars of a case in which a sample of milk taken at Victoria Station, whilst in 87 course of delivery, was, upon analysis, found to be separated milk, the Inspector also being informed, subsequent to his taking the sample, that it was separated milk, suggesting that the Board should consider the question of the desirability of issuing a leaflet to farmers and others concerned, pointing out the advisability of churns containing ‚ñ†separated milk being so labelled. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, in reply, pointed out that when a sample of milk is taken on delivery under the Food and Drugs Acts, the material point is not as to the label, if any, on the churn, but as to what is the nature of the contract in pursuance of which the milk is delivered, and suggesting that, in view of this fact, it is doubtful if .the labelling of churns in the manner suggested would, so far as samples thus taken are concerned, assist either the farmer or the Inspector of the Local Authority, and adding that nearly all the separated milk sent into London is received not from farmers but from factories. The City Council informed the Board they are still of opinion that were churns containing separated milk so labelled, it would be a means of saving the sampling officer's time and also the expense incidental to the taking and analysing of such samples. Cream.‚ÄîThirty-nine samples of cream were taken, and in 38 instances it was found to contain boric acid. No proceedings were taken when the amount did not exceed the limit (17 J grains per lb.) laid down in the report of the Departmental Committee on the Use of Preservatives, &c., in Food. Twelve prosecutions were taken for amounts varying from 22 89 grains to 53'053 grains per lb., with the result that in six instances warranties were proved, and in one the summons was dismissed. In this ease one of the City Analysts, Mr. Cassal, reported the presence of 23-548 grains; the portion left with the vendor was analysed by Mr. Stokes, who stated that he found a much smaller amount, and the third portion was sent to Somerset House, who gave a result higher than that of Mr. Stokes, but under the 17^ grains limit. It appears that there are several methods ‚Ä¢employed by analysts for the determination of boric acid, but none of them give the total amount of the acid in milk, although they may do so when the acid is dissolved in pure water. When other substances are present, the actual amount discoverable varies considerably with the method adopted. That usually employed by analysts, and which is understood to be the process adopted by the Government Analysts, does not show the total acid present, but when carefully carried out, gives a fairly constant return. Usually analysts check it by making three estimations. Mr. Cassal has devised a method whereby a larger quantity of boric acid can be recovered than by any other method, but from the published description it appears to involve a considerable number of 88 delicate operations, which require much time and care to accomplish satisfactorily. If the Local Government Board would state the method employed by the chemists at Somerset House, it would tend towards uniformity. Butter and Margarine.‚ÄîTwo hundred samples were bought as butter and 175 were reported to be genuine, although with regard to. eight of them there was some dubiety in the mind of the analyst; 10 prosecutions were undertaken for substituting margarine for butter,, and three for an excess of water (1.48, 3.1 and 8.l per cent. in excess of the legal limit, which is 16 per cent.). A warranty was proved in one case and in another the defendant absconded. The butter, which contained l.48 excess of water, also contained 0.53 per cent. of starch; a warranty was pleaded, but was not proved, the alleged warrantor disputing that the warranty referred to this butter. The presence of starch is unusual, but it is of interest to note that the Belgian Government requires the addition of a small percentage of starch and of sesame oil to each pound of margarine. In one instance a prosecution was taken fur selling margarine in a plain wrapper; the same person was also summoned for exposing margarine for sale without a proper label, but as the actual purchaser was not clear on this point, the magistrates convicted on the first summons only. Potted Meats and Fish.‚ÄîNinety.six samples in all were purchased and 29 of these were found to contain boric acid; no legal proceedings. were taken, as the majority of the samples were taken in compliance with a request from Dr. Buchanan, the Inspector for Food, &c., of the Local Government Board, suggesting that samples of tinned foods might be taken by the Council and submitted without sub.division to the analysts. In accordance with the instruction of the Public Health Committee, forty samples of eighteen kinds of food put up by twenty firms were purchased and examined. The articles and the number of each bought were:‚Äî 6 potted liara and chicken. 3 brawn. 3 potted chicken and tongue. 1 galantine boar.s head. 2 chicken and veal pate. 2 beef loaf. 2 potted turkey and tongue. 2 preserved beef. 2 potted veal and ham. 5 corned beef. 2 potted salmon and shrimp paste. 2 veal loaf. 1 potted ham and tongue, 1 devilled ham. 1 potted game, ham, and tongue. 1 Vienna sausage. 3 tongue. 1 herrings in.tomato sauce. Apparently the ingredients were found to be as stated on labels, but twelve were reported to contain boric acid in quantities varying from. a trace to 163.t> grains per pound. These were:‚Äî 89 3 ham and chicken paste, 5.2 grains, 5.5 grains, and 114.5 grains. 2 chicken and tongue, 4 8 grains and 110 grains. 2 turkey and tongue, 5.5 grains and 163.6 grains. 1 veal and ham pate, 71.5 grains. 2 salmon and shrimp paste, 13 grains and 145-7 grains. 1 ham and tongue, 5.2 grains. 1 brawn, traces. The brawn in one case was bad through a defect in the edge of the ;glass vessel in which it was put up. The attention of the firm was called thereto. Of the seven kinds of preparations, twelve of which contained boric acid, nineteen samples were taken. Assuming that the addition of some preservative is necessary, the large amounts of boric acid found are clearly excessive. But the fact that other firms can put up similar preparations without the addition of chemical preservatives shows that their use is quite unnecessary. In the chicken and ham put up by one of the firms, notwithstanding that 114.5 grains of boric acid were present, there was a fungoid growth under the fat. The attention of the firms concerned was called to the presence of boric acid in their goods, and they have been informed that the Council proposes to take action if large amounts are found in such preparations in the future. Several of the firms that have been communicated with on the ‚Ä¢subject replied to the effect that they were ignorant of the fact that boric acid was present in their respective goods, that they had not added any acid during the process of potting, and that its presence must have been due to the hams, tongues, or other ingredients sold to them which had been cured by means of boric acid instead of salt. In the case of the sample certified as containing 163.6 grains per pound, the vendors have written stating that they are causing the sale of such articles to be withdrawn from all their branches. The above explanation is feasible for the smaller amounts of the acid found, but would not account for the extraordinarily large amounts, viz., 163.6, 145.7, 114-5 and 110 grains per pound, discovered in some of the samples, which could only be accounted for by the wilful addition of the acid, or by gross carelessness in not removing from the surface of the hams the acid which is frequently dusted over them to protect them during transit. The Council directed that further samples of such foods be purchased and analysed, but the manufacturers had evidently profited by the warning and had taken steps to see that excessive quantities of preservative were kept out of their preparations. 90 A copy of the report presented, together with full particulars as to the vessels in which the food was put up, labels, &c., was forwarded to Dr. Buchanan. The Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health passed the following resolutions on the subject, and they were also adopted by the City Council:‚Äî " That it is necessary, in order to secure better protection for the public in regard to tinned and preserved foods, that legislation should be passed embodying the following important reforms ":‚Äî 1. The name and address of the manufacturer and the date of canning shall be impressed on the cans. 2. It shall be unlawful to sell for any purpose canned goods that are unfit for human consumption, and it shall be the duty of any person in possession of unsound canned foods to notify and surrender same to the local authority, who shall destroy such unsound food free of charge. 3. A certain number of tins (say 1 per cent.) from each consignment shall be opened on importation and the contents examined under the supervision or instructions of the Sanitary Authority concerned, prior to such canned foods being placed on the market. 4. Tins which are known in the trade as "doubtfuls" shall be deemed to be unfit for human consumption. 5. Food intended for canning shall be inspected by independent officials prior to being canned, and all foods shall be canned under strictly hygienic conditions. 6. In the opinion of the branch, the use of preservatives in canned foods is unnecessary, and should under no circumstances be permitted. The importance of leaving the date of canning on the tins has been emphasised by a report made by Dr. Buchanan on a large consignment of beef essence returned from South Africa, where it had been for some years. Although sterile, the contents had undergone changes which entirely altered their food value. It has also been found that manufacturers do not always place their names on the cans, and there is, therefore, a difficulty in tracing their source of origin. Tinned Vegetables and Fruit.‚ÄîSixty-three samples were taken as shown on list, and, except peas and spinach, were found free from adulteration. Both peas and spinach show a marked improvement in the amount of copper now added to them; only 2 samples out of 28 of peas, and 8 out of 11 of spinach showing copper above the limit. In a number of instances no copper had been added at all. 91 Drugs.‚ÄîCalcium chloride was included in certain proscriptions which were made up for analysis, and a marked deficiency was found in several samples, varying from 18 to 40 per cent. This drug is of a deliquescent nature, and should be kept in small quantities and in closely-stoppered bottles or in solution, otherwise prescribers finding the doses ordered insufficient for the purpose for which the drug was ordered, may be led to use larger doses, and if these happen to be made up of a full strength drug, there may be unfortunate results. The attention of chemists was called to the matter. Other Infringements of the Food and Drugs Acts.‚ÄîIn addition to the prosecutions for adulteration, proceedings were taken for the following:‚Äî (1) Neglecting to have name on milk can. Fined ¬£2 and 12s. 6d. costs. (2) Refusing to serve. (a) Milk.‚ÄîDismissed. Magistrate refused to convict master as he was not present when his servant refused. (b) Milk.‚ÄîThe vendor refused to serve the inspector from a can out of which he had previously served a customer, and poured into it milk from another can. A sample of the mixture was eventually obtained and found then to have 9 per cent, of added water. Fined ¬£5 and 2s. costs for refusal to sell, ¬£20 and ¬£5 5s. costs for the adulteration. (c) Spinach.‚ÄîTins were exhibited for sale in the shop window, but as a successful prosecution had taken place on account of the copper in the spinach, the then owner refused to sell. Fined ¬£3 and ¬£2 2s. Od. costs. (3) Obstructing Inspector.‚ÄîThe manager of a shop seized a tin of spinach which the Inspector had bought and refused to allow him to have it again. Fined ¬£10 and ¬£3 3s. Od. costs. The net amount of penalties and costs, after deducting the costs paid in cases dismissed, was ¬£231 5s. 6d, Seventy-five per cent, of the samples were purchased by the Inspectors by means of agents.

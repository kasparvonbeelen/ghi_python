Poliomyelitis. Seven cases of Poliomyelitis, six paralytic and one non-paralytic, were notified during the year, compared with 15 in 1955. The only non-paralytic case was a girl aged five years. Of the paralytic cases, two were adults and the rest were children aged 6½ years, 5½ years, 4 years and 20 months respectively. There were no fatalities. One child, aged 6½ years, with paralytic disease was nursed at home. This is an unusual occurrence nowadays because of the difficulty of providing the ancillary services needed for the efficient care of such cases. The unfortunate feature of the notifications is that the non-paralytic cases arc outnumbered by 6 to 1. In 1955 the proportion for Westminster was 2.75 to 1, and for England and Wales as a whole 1.5 to 1. The ratio of paralytic to non-paralytic cases varies greatly. The causes of such variations are not completely understood. (25644) a 4 14 International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Arrangements continued during the year for the authentication by the Medical Officer of Health of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation completed by medical practitioners in Westminster. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad from this country and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. 3,505 certificates were authenticated during the year. The Medical Officer of Health also issues, on request and in appropriate circumstances, certificates to the effect that no cases of smallpox have occurred in the district during the preceding two weeks. These certificates are sought by persons proceeding to the United States of America who do not wish to submit to vaccination. It is understood that the United States immigration authorities reserve the right to place such persons under surveillance notwithstanding the production of such a certificate. 15 Deaths, 1956.

During 1956 the Mobile Unit of the South West London Mass X-Ray Service made 26 visits to the City to provide chest X-ray facilities for the staff of 26 firms, the staff and students of three university colleges and three training colleges, and the staff and residents of a common lodging house. The total numbers X-rayed were 16,915, and as a result of these visits 79 cases were referred to chest clinics with a radiologically significant lesion, probably tuberculous, requiring further investigation. Arrangements were made, in conjunction with the City Council, the Chelsea Group Hospital Management Committee and the Chest Physician, for a Mass X-ray Unit to visit the Westminster Chest Clinic in Ebury Bridge Road every Friday to provide a service for patients referred by general practitioners and employees of firms in the vicinity. These visits have been carried out regularly since the beginning of September, and a total of 2,699 people have been examined, of whom 698 were doctors' patients. This has resulted in 15 cases being referred to chest clinics with a radiologically significant lesion, probably tuberculous, requiring further investigation. Welfare of Old Persons. Westminster Old People's Welfare Association. This voluntary Association, whose members include representatives of various bodies interested in the welfare of old people, continued its activities in the City during the year. These activities include the organisation in various parts of the City of Darby and Joan Clubs, where light refreshments and recreation are provided; arranging holidays at seaside resorts, summer outings, Christmas parties, and other entertainments. Special outings and parties were organised during the year for handicapped old people, who by reason of their infirmities had not been outside their homes for long periods. The distribution of gift parcels at Christmas time was arranged; and also the visiting by voluntary helpers of the ailing and lonely in their homes. The Association also provides a chiropody service for the elderly. Treatment can be obtained at two clinics in the City, or at home. The charge is 2s. 6d. per treatment ; the balance of cost, which varies from 3s. 6d. to 6s. per treatment, is borne by the Association. The Association have also been instrumental in placing a few old people in part-time employment. The City Council, under powers conferred by the National Assistance Act, 1948, make an annual contribution to the funds of the Association. British Red Cross Society—Mobile Meals Service. The Westminster Division of the British Red Cross Society has continued the service which it established in the City in 1945 for the delivery to their homes of hot mid-day meals to aged people who are unable themselves to prepare meals at home. 19 The service is operated with two vans provided by the City Council and loaned to the Society. The Council also makes an annual grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the running costs of the vans. The meals are obtained from a firm of caterers, and are placed in individual containers and kept in heated chambers on the vans until delivered at the homes of the old people. The meals cost Is. 6d. each, and consist of meat, two vegetables and a sweet, or lighter diets for those requiring them. The old people pay 8d. for the meal and the London County Council bear the difference of 10d. Some 12,589 meals were delivered by this service during the year, with the assistance of the Society's voluntary workers. This invaluable help is very much appreciated by all concerned. Aged Persons in Need of Care and Attention. Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, a Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply to the Courts for an order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place, of persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from others, proper care and attention. One aged person was removed to a home under these provisipns during the year. Aged and Infirm Persons. Number of aged and infirm persons visited by the Council's officers during the year 155 Total number of inspections made with regard to these 936 Primary 129 Re-inspections 807 Cases of aged and infirmed persons brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health during 1956 129 In dealing with these cases, the co-operation of the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association, the London County Council's Home Help Service, both of which are accommodated in the Public Health Department, and the " Meals on Wheels " service of the British Red Cross Society has been of great value. Mobile Library Service. The City Council provides a library service for the aged, and books are issued to them at Darby and Joan Clubs. For those who are unable to leave their homes, delivery is made there. Bathing Facilities. The City Council has made available to old age pensioners facilities whereby they can have hot baths at the Council's public baths at reduced charges. 20 Cleansing of Bed Linen of Elderly and Infirm. Facilities have also been made available by the Council for the cleansing of bed linen of elderly and infirm people when it has become fouled and unwholesome. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933—Slaughterman's Licences. The Council during the year granted Slaughterman's licences to 15 men who had been accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to act as their inspectors in different parts of the country. These licences are required to be held by the pupils while undergoing training in humane slaughtering as part of the course for appointment as inspectors of the R.S.P.C.A. 21 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

In March, 1956, the Minister of Housing and Local Government approved the proposals for dealing with houses which are unfit for human habitation submitted by the City Council, jointly with the London County Council, in pursuance of Section 1 of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. The proposals were described in my Report for 1955 and the progress made during 1956 for dealing with them is set out below. Clearance Area Procedure- Progress. (a) Clearance Orders made prior to 1955— Gregory Cottages, S.W.1 The one remaining house was demolished. Livonia Street, W.1 The 12 houses comprising the area were demolished. (b) Clearance Orders made after 1955— Berwick Street (No. 1) Area Order confirmed by the Minister, Berwick Street, Nos. 91, 92, 11th June, 1956. 93, 94 Hopkins Street, Nos. 9, 10, 11 Berwick Street (No. 2) Area Order confirmed by the Minister, Berwick Street, Nos. 100, 31st May, 1956. 101, 102 Hopkins Street, Nos. 1, 2/3 (8 flats) Peter Street, Nos. 7, 8, 9 Fareham Street Area By letter dated 31st January, 1956. Fareham Street, Nos. 6, 7 the Minister stated that, while he considered the houses specified in the Order to be unfit for human habitation, he did not consider that demolition was the most satisfactory way of dealing with them and had, therefore, decided not to confirm the Order. (Note.—The owners commenced to redevelop the property by conversion, but the reconstruction work required proved to be so extensive that the properties were completely demolished in May, 1957.) Conduit Court Area Order confirmed by the Minister, Conduit Court Nos. 1, 2, 3 15th August, 1956. (Note.—The three houses were demolished May, 1957). 26 Langley Court Area (Note.—Demolition commenced in Langley Court Nos. 9, 10, May, 1957.) 11 (c) Clearance Area not included in approved proposals— Antrobus Street/Glasgow Terrace Area 10-42 (consec.) Antrobus Street 1a, 1-51 (odd) and 2-66 (even), Glamorgan Street 1a and 1-22 (consec.) Glasgow Terrace 103-113 (odd), 115-117, 119-123 (odd) and 125a, Lupus Street 4, Caledonia Place In February, 1956, the City Council declared this area, comprising 128 houses, a Clearance Area under Part III of the Housing Act, 1936, and on the 19th July, 1956, the Minister agreed that the houses are unfit and that he will be prepared to accept the displacements for subsidy at Slum Clearance rates. Demolition of Individual Unfit Houses. Nos. 12 and 13, Richmond Buildings, W.1.—In 1955 the City Council, in lieu of making Demolition Orders under Section II of the Housing Act, 1936, accepted an Undertaking from the owner of these two houses that they would not be used for human habitation until the Council, on being satisfied that they had been rendered fit for that purpose, cancelled the Undertaking. During 1956 the two houses were demolished, and a new office building was in course of construction on the site. (Vote.—The Undertaking was cancelled in May, 1957.) Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954. Houses Let in Multiple Occupation. Section 11 of this Act repealed the provisions of the Housing Act, 1936, and of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, dealing with the powers to make byelaws to control houses let in lodgings, or occupied by more than one family. Those provisions have been replaced by a general power for local authorities to require in such houses adequate natural lighting, ventilation, water supply, drainage and sanitary conveniences, and facilities for the storage, preparation and cooking of food, and for the disposal of waste water. The City Council formed the view that in exercising its powers under the 1954 Act it was both undesirable and impracticable for the Council to lay down inflexible rules in view of: (i) the diversity of this type of accommodation, and (ii) the continuing demand for housing accommodation in Westminster, but that it would be helpful, both to owners and occupiers, and would also assist in securing uniformity of procedure, if a Code of Practice were laid down for providing essential amenities in this 27 very large class of premises in Westminster, as and when the housing situation permitted. To this end the Council adopted a Code of Practice to meet such circumstances. Certificates of Disrepair. By the end of the year three applications had been made for Certificates of Disrepair under the provisions of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, and in each case a certificate was granted. Two applications were made during the year for the revocation of a Certificate of Disrepair, and in both instances the certificate was revoked. One of these applications referred to a certificate issued in 1955. Land Charges Act, 1925. The number of enquiries dealt with and reported upon during the year was 1,940, relating to 3,617 properties. These enquiries concerned outstanding notices under the Public Health and Housing Acts, combined drainage orders, and applications for decontrol under the Rent Restrictions Acts. Many of the search forms requested supplementary information regarding restrictions on the use of underground rooms, and the suitability of premises for specific purposes such as catering establishments and workrooms.

This consolidating Act came into operation on the 1st January, 1956. Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955. These regulations came into force on the 1st January, 1956, though certain sections were not operative until the 1st July, 1956. The regulations lay down requirements in respect of the cleanliness of food premises, stalls, etc., and of apparatus and equipment; the hygienic handling of food; the cleanliness of persons engaged in the handling of food and of their clothing, and action to be taken where they suffer from or are carriers of certain infections; the construction, repair and maintenance of food premises, stalls and vehicles and facilities to be provided; and the temperature at which certain foods particularly liable to transmit disease should be kept. The regulations affect different aspects of the sale, preparation and transport of food, e.g., catering establishments and food shops, fixed stalls and street traders and the transport and delivery of the food. Synopses of these regulations were prepared at the commencement of the year for the guidance of persons engaged in the conduct of food premises and stalls, and copies of these have been available, together with the assistance of officers of the department in dealing with any problems arising thereon. Every opportunity is taken in the course of the inspection of premises, and during consultation with owners, architects and builders to draw attention to the relevant provisions of the statutes and regulations in relation to food premises. In practice it is generally found that the persons responsible are cooperative in adopting suggestions and recommendations made to them. Similarly the staff of restaurants, canteens, etc., are informed, as opportunities present themselves, of the special responsibility resting upon them in the maintenance of personal cleanliness.

Registration of Premises used in connection with the Manufacture, Sale or Storage of Ice Cream. Two hundred and forty three premises were registered for the manufacture and/or sale and/or storage of ice cream. Registration of Premises used for the Preparation or Manufacture of Preserved Foods. Eighty premises were registered for the preparation or manufacture of preserved foods. 35 Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947. Methylene Blue Tests on Samples of Ice Cream. Forty-four samples of ice cream were submitted for methylene blue test. The samples were classified in provisional grades based upon the method of examination as recommended by the Ministry of Health. These were as follows:— Grade 1 20 Grade 2 14 Grade 3 4 Grade 4 6 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations. The following licences authorising the sale of designated milks were issued during 1956 to Distributors of Milk registered with the Council:— Dealers' Licences. Dealers' Supplementary Licences. Pasteurised 116 43 Sterilised 98 43 Tuberculin Tested 86 40 Milk. During the year 40 samples of milk were submitted for methylene blue and phosphatase test. The results received showed that the milk had been efficiently pasteurised. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949. At the 31st December, 1956, the following were entered in the City Council's Register of Dairies and Distributors of Milk: Distributors of milk with premises registered as dairies 36 Distributors of milk with premises not registered as dairies 83 Distributors of milk with premises situate outside Westminster 48 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933. Persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List numbered 153 at 31st December, 1956. 36 Food and Drugs Act, 1955, Section 8. The following table shows the amount of food condemned as unfit for human consumption during the year:— Amount destroyed. Tons. Cwts. Lbs. Canned food 20 4 2 Meat – 11 28 Fruit and vegetables 181 13 27 Cereals – 12 95 Fats – – 3 Fish – 11 68 Confectionery – 1 31 Miscellaneous – 17 1 Totals 204 11 31 Examination of foodstuffs. A fire occurred in April at Floral Hall, Covent Garden, which resulted in 75 tons of fruit being totally destroyed. Fortunately it was possible to salvage 148 tons, and local authorities to whose area the salvaged fruit was consigned were informed and it was disposed of under supervision. Method of disposal of condemned food. Food condemned or voluntarily surrendered to the Public Health Inspectors is disposed of by depositing in the Council's refuse barges at the Central Depot at Gatliff Road, S.W.1. Foodstuffs disposed of at this depot are removed by barge for land reclamation by controlled tipping at Pitsea. No recovery or diversion of any goods whatsoever takes place at the central tipping site. Frozen bull sausage meal. Consignments of the above commodity were imported into this country by a firm having its head offices in Westminster. It came to the knowledge of the department that samples from one of these consignments had been examined by the Port Health Authority at the port of entry, and had been found to be seriously contaminated by germs of food poisoning. By the time this report was received the bulk of the meat had been released, and had been distributed to various firms in the United Kingdom. It was discovered in the course of investigation that previous shipments were also affected with similair organisms. The work involved in tracing the total consignments, amounting to some 75 tons of meat, was considerable, but it is satisfactory to relate that only in two instances had sales taken place before preventive action could be taken by the local authority concerned. 37 Consideration was then given to a method of treatment which would render the product safe for human or animal consumption, and in consultation with the Public Health Laboratory Service, the importers were advised on a heat treatment process which would result in the destruction of the organisms. This advice was accepted and the meat was treated under the surveillance of the appropriate local authority and ultimately used for manufacturing purposes. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 26. The following return was made to the Ministry of Health in accordance with the requirements of Appendix D (I) of the revised Memo. 188/Med/49 giving details of food poisoning notifications received during the year and returned to the Registrar General:— First quarter.

Total. 2 33 7 3 45 Of those notified, 32 related to one outbreak; three other outbreaks each involved two persons, though one of those concerned was notified to the local authority for the area in which he resided. A further notification related to a person who was concerned with 12 others, none of whom were notified to Westminster. The remaining seven were individual notifications. In addition to the above, other cases involving persons suffering from symptoms of food poisoning were investigated by officers of the department. In two cases it was possible to trace the causative organism. Public Health (London) Act, 1936. London County Council (Drainage) Byelaws, 1934. Drainage.

The resident population of 96,100 in some 27,000 dwellings received water from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains or from deep wells. Eighty-seven deep wells were in use at 31st December, 1956. In 84 of these wells, the water is used for domestic purposes. In the remainder, one supply is used for cooling purposes, one for supplying boilers and one as a stand by in case of fire. Satisfactory reports were received of 46 bacteriological examinations and 28 chemical analyses of water from these wells. Disinfection, Disinfestation and Cleansing of Persons— Arrangements with the Holborn Borough Council. During the year arrangements were made between the City Council and the Holborn Borough Council whereby the latter undertook to carry out, on agreed terms, the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing of persons, and the provision of the necessary transport therefor, which work was formerly performed by the City Council's staff. The arrangement came into operation on the 3rd September, 1956, and is working satisfactorily with resulting economies to both Councils. 42 The following is a summary of the work carried out both at Westminster and Holborn during the year.

Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the duty of the City Council as a Sanitary Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or is found dead in the area, where no other arrangements have been made for the disposal of the body. The Council is empowered to recover the cost of burial from the estate of the deceased, and is eligible to receive payments in respect of the cost of such burial from death grants payable under the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946. Where persons without known relatives die in the City, it is frequently necessary not only to arrange for their burial, but to dispose of the contents of their homos. This is done in consultation with the Treasury Solicitor. Such action is necessary to enable the proceeds to be applied towards the cost of burial and also to avoid rent accruing and to release the accommodation for housing purposes as early as possible. 43 During the year 41 burials were undertaken by the City Council in its cemetery at Hanwell, the requests for such burials being received from the following sources:— H.M.

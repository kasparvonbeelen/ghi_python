Public Health Department, Town Hall, Bethnal Green, E.2, June, i960. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Mr. Mayor, Ladles and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1959- Statistics. The causes of death in the Borough very well illustrate some of the health problems which the country is facing today. Before we discuss the debit side of this problem perhaps 1 should mention a very striking achievement and that is the reduction in the infant mortality rate which in 1959 was 23.2 per 1,000 total live births, which compares very favourably with the 168 infant death rate per 1,000 sixty years ago. If we examine the deaths in the age group 1-14 we find only four deaths - 1 from bronchitis and 3 from accidents. Two of these fatal accidents occurred in the home which tends to confirm the fact already known that more people are killed as the result of accidents in the home than on the road If we turn to the causes of death in the age group 45-64 we find that carcinoma of the lung killed 11 males against 3 females, a very striking difference between the sexes which is most unlikely to happen by accident. Under the heading of coronary diseases the males are again very much worse off and we find that 21 males died from this disease against only 2 females, and to conclude this list of striking disadvantage shown by males we see that bronchitis killed 20 males against only 4 females. Smoking undoubtedly is one cause of the increased mortality of males in the age group 45-64 and according to recent reports also too 5 much fatty foods of a certain type and lack of exercise. We all know that women smoke less and are less prone to over eating, and it seems to me too that housework keeps them in perpetual physical exercise. In this connection I appeal to all parents to do all they can to discourage their children from acquiring the smoking habit. Atmospheric Pollution. This Council is very anxious to play its part in establishing clean and wholesome air over London and towards the end of the year they made their first Smoke Control Order, covering some 171 acres of the Borough, which is due to become operative from the 1st December, 1960. They also submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government a phased programme to make the whole of the Borough a smokeless zone by 1965 This is a measure which is of major importance today and now that legislation is provided we should advance with all possible speed - as indeed Bethnal Green does towards cleaning our air, which will result in unmeasureable benefit to the health, wellbeing and happiness of the people. Housing. The slum clearance programme of 1955-60 is nearing completion and we shall soom commence with the next 5 year programme which will virtually abolish slums in Bethnal Green although it may be that small numbers of unfit houses will still be found here and there after 1965. Inspection and Supervision of Food. The work of food hygiene is handicapped by the shortage of Public Health Inspectors. With three short in establishment the frequency of inspections of the 800 food premises, plus street stalls selling food, has necessarily been inadequate. To achieve a high standard of food hygiene very frequent visits have to be made and, as it were, continuous contact maintained between the Public Health Department and the food establishments to secure a steady gradual improvement. However, I am looking forward to the time when we shall be able to work with a full establishment and increase such visits to a satisfactory level. The standard of hygiene has improved considerably since the war and we have been helped in this by the people of Bethnal Green who are prepared to complain about unhygienic practices or, which is perhaps more important, will go shopping in food estaboishments where the standards of hygiene are superior. Dr. G.O. Mitchell, the L.C.C. Divisional Medical Officer 6 (Division 5) has again kindly supplied me with some details of personal health services provided in the Borough, which are, of course, the responsibility of the London County Council. I am pleased to have this opportunity of thanking Councillor Mr. A. Stocks, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and Members of the Committee for their help and encouragement during the year. I would also like to thank the other Chief Officers of the Council and their staffs for their willing assistance and my particular thanks are due to Mr, J.E. Pestell, Chief Clerk, Mr. F.C. Sharpe, Senior Public Health Inspector, and. all the other members of the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal assistance and support at all times. . . I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, S.A. BOYD, Medical Officer of Health. 7 SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population, estimated mid-year 48,960 Number of Dwellings 15,632 Rateable Value £747,327 General Rate 20s. Od. Sum represented by a penny rate £2,820 VITAL STATISTICS Live Births: Number 819 Rate per 1,000 population 16.7 Illegitimate Live Births per cent of total live births 8.8 Stillbirths: Number 15 Rate per 1,000 total live and still births 0.30 Total live and still births 17.0 Infant Deaths (deaths under 1 year) 19 Infant Mortality Rates- Total infant deaths per 1,000 total live births 23.2 Legitimate infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 21.4 Illegitimate Infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 41.6 Neo-natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 4 weeks per 1,000 total live births) 17.1 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 total live births) 14.6 Perinatal Mortality Rate (stillbirths and desths under 1 week combined per 1,000 total live and still births) 32.3 Maternal Mortality (including abortion): Number of deaths 1 Rate per 1,000 total live and still births 1.2 Death Rate per 1,000 estimated population 11.6 8 During 1959 the Registrar General estimated the population as 48,960 which is 870 less than in the previous year. The death rate was 11:6 per 1,000 persons as compared with a rate of 11.4 for 1958. Both Births and deaths depend to some extent on the proportions of young and old people and of males and females in the area, and in order to make comparisons between one area and another the Registrar General gives Area Comparability Factors which take into account these variations in age and sex Using this factor the adjusted death rate for Bethnal Green would be 11.5 as compared with 11.6 for England and Wales. The birth rate during 1959 was 16.7 as compared with 17.4 during the previous year. The adjusted rate for comparison with other areas is 15 7 as compared with 16.5 for England and Wales. The infant mortality rate of 23.2 as compared with the rate of 22.0 for England and Wales. It is, in Bethnal Green, however, calculated on a very small number of infant deaths and is consequently subject to large variations from year to year and as an indication of child care the figure should be used with some caution. The causes of death are shown in Table 1, which follows. Notification of Births Arrangements continued in operation during the year whereby the London County Council furnished to the Borough Council a weekly return of births (including stillbirths) notified to them as the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. During the year 828 live births (421 male and 407 female) were notified and in addition there were 16 stillbirths ( 7 male and 9 female). These figures reprerent corrected totals after the addition of inward transfers and the deduction of outward transfers and the difference between these figures and those set out previously is due to the fact that births must be registered within 6 weeks and it is not uncommon for a child to be born and notified in one calendar year but not actually registered until the following year. 9 10 TABLE 1 CAUSES OF DEATHS Causes of Death under 1 year 1 to 4 5 to 14 15 to 24 25 to 44 45 to 64 65 to 74 75 and over Totals M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F All causes 9 10 1 2 1 - 3 2 9 11 100 56 95 74 72 123 290 278 1 Tuberculosis, respiratory 2 1 2 1 2 Tuberculosis, other - - 3 Syphilitic disease - - 4 Diphtheria - - 5 Whooping Cough - . 6 Meningococcal infections - _ 7 Acute Poliomyelitis . - 8 Measles - - 9 Other infective and parasitic diseases 1 1 2 - 10 Malignant neoplasm, stomach l 2 1 4 4 2 4 8 10 11 Malignant neoplasm, lung, bronocus 1 1 11 3 7 1 1 4 20 9 12 Malignant neoplasm, breast 2 5 2 - 9 13 Malignant neoplasm, uterus 3 2 1 6 14 Other malignant and lymphatic neoplasms 1 3 2 12 4 9 9 6 8 30 24 15 Leukaemia, aleukaemia 1 1 1 1 16 Diabetes 1 1 3 2 1 4 4 17 Vascular lesions of nervous system 7 7 13 10 5 18 25 35 18 Coronary disease, angina 1 21 2 18 11 11 18 51 31 19 Hypertension with heart disease • 1 2 3 3 4 5 20 Other heart disease 1 6 3 5 4 12 8 23 21 Other circulatory disease 1 3 1 5 7 8 12 13 22 Influenza 2 3 1 3 1 8 23 Pneumonia 1 1 5 5 9 2 12 8 27 16 24 Bronchitis 1 1 1 20 4 17 7 14 12 52 25 25 Other diseases of respiratory system 1 1 2 l 2 3 26 Ulcer of stomach and duodenum 3 2 2 1 1 4 6 7 ?7 Gastritis, enteritis and diarrhoea 2 1 1 l 3 28 Nephritis snd nephrosis 1 2 1 1 1 2 4 29 Hyperplasia of prostate - - 30 Pregnancy, childbirth abortion 1 1 31 Congenital malformations 6 4 1 6 5 32 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 2 4 3 3 3 5 4 2 14 12 28 33 Motor vehicle accidents 1 2 1 4 - 34 All other accidents 1 1 1 1 2 4 5 5 35 Suicide 1 3 2 1 5 2 36 Homicide and operations of war - - 11 SECTION B SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply Water for domestic purposes in the Borough is obtained in all cases from the Metropolitan Water Board, Bacteriological and chemical examination of the water is carried out at frequent intervals by the Metropolitan Water Board. Notices were sent to the Board in 59 cases where wastage of water due to defective pipes or fittings was observed. During the year 360 new premises were certified as having a proper and sufficient water supply in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. In addition to the supply from the Metropolitan Water Board, there are five wells used for purposes other than drinking. These are:- Attached to Council's Public Baths 1 Attached to a hospital 1 Supplementary supply for industrial purposes 3 Sanitary Inspection of the Borough Following the 2,171 complaints of insanitary conditions, defects were found requiring the service of Intimation Notices in 1,214 cases. Of these Statutory Notices were required in 378 instances and legal proceedings were instituted in 15 cases. In addition, 9 notices in accordance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955. two under Section 26 and seven under Section 27, were served. In four cases the necessary work was carried out by the Council and the expenses incurred recovered from the owners of the properties. In connection with the supervision of drainage works a total of 3,448 inspections were made during the year. 52 notices in accordance with Section 25 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955, were served and in twelve instances the necessary work was carried out by the Council and the expenses incurred recovered from the owners of the properties. 12 TABLE 2 RECORD OF VISITS Bakehouses 44 Bakers Shops 33 Butchers 119 Canteens 13 Confectioners 39 Eel & Pie Shops 6 Fish Curers 6 Fried Fish Shops 40 Fruit and Greengrocery 37 Grocers 138 Ice Cream 219 Licenced Premises 110 Milkshops 189 Restaurants 343 Slaughterhouses (Poultry) 30 Street Stalls 636 Miscellaneous Food Premises 437 Infectious Disease 369 Food Poisoning 4 Complaints investigated 2,171 Aged and/or infirm persons 125 Factories 1,721 Outworkers 265 Housing Enquiries 1,113 Houses let in Lodgings 123 Drainage Works 3,448 Rent Act 106 Smoke Observations 65 Shops Act 470 Miscellaneous 2,387 Re-inspections 8,333 Total 23,139 13 TABLE 3 SANITARY DEFECTS IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH NOTICES WERE SERVED Dirty and/or dilapidated rooms 1,011 Defective drains and choked w.c.'s 158 Defective and dirty w.c.'s 915 Defective water supply 51 Defective paving 73 Defective gutters and rain water pipes 292 Defective roofs 401 Dampness 448 Defective dustbins 64 Smoke Nuisances 9 Accumulations of refuse 117 Other defects 1,744 Total 5,283 Supply of Dustbins In 24 cases during the year notices were served upon the owner in accordance with Section 12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954.

Inspector of Factories of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, in conjunction with the local sanitary authority. Close co-operation is maintained between the two, and defaults found in the course of visits to factories are notified between one and the other according to the body responsible for remedial measures. The principal duties of the sanitary authority are the 16 enforcement of Sections 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7 of the Factories Act,1937. insofar as non-power factories are concerned, and Section 7 only in respect of power factories. Factories and Workplaces in this Borough carrying on a variety of trades number 1,369 and a total of 1,638 inspections and reinspections were made during the year. 119 investigations were made in regard to drainage and applications under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. The following Tables give details of work carried out under the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, during the year:- TABLE 4 INSPECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written notices Occupiers prosecuted 1.

Of the 351 names of outworkers which appeared on the lists received in August, 92 were given as residing within the Borough; in addition 151 names of outworkers residing in Bethnal Green were forwarded from other Councils. The following information of classes of work and numbers of outworkers employed thereon, being Bethnal Green residents, is in respect of the August lists, received from employers in the Borough, and from other Authorities:- Number of Outworkers in August list required by Section 110(1)(c) Wearing apparel (making,etc.) 148 Curtains and Furniture hangings 23 Brushes 3 Boxes 50 Buttons, etc., Carding 6 Artificial Flowers 4 Christmas Crackers, etc 3 Household Linen 1 Umbrellas 3 Stuffed Toys 2 Total 243 Section 110. There was no case of default in sending list to the Council. Section 111. There was no instance of work being carried on in unwholesome premises. 19 Shops Acts. With effect from 1st January, 1959. Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958, transferred to Borough Councils certain functions which had hitherto been the responsibility of the London County Council. These functions gave powers to Borough Councils to require in any shop in which persons are employed, suitable and sufficient lighting, washing facilities and facilities for the taking of meals. These powers are in addition to those already enforced by the Council under Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, i.e. ventilation and temperature of shops and their sanitary conveniences. During the year, 298 visits were made to shops and 24 notices were served in respect of unsatisfactory conditions found to exist. Disinfection and Disinfestation The following is a summary of the routine work carried out by the disinfecting staff during the year:- No. of rooms disinfested 780 Articles of clothing, bedding, etc. submitted to steam disinfection 733 Articles disinfected by formalin 499 Hospital mattresses, pillows, etc. disinfected 5,098 Number of articles destroyed by request. 2,649 In addition, on 33 occasions rubbish which had been dumped on open sites, etc., was sprayed with insecticide prior to removal. The furniture and bedding of 302 families removing to Borough Council flats were disinfested. Personal Cleansing Station During the year, 15 adults and 5 children had baths for verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, simultaneous disinfection of clothing being carried out. In addition, 20 adults and 7 children received treatment for 20 Scabies at the Station. Public Health Inspectors visit and advise in all cases of Scabies and in those cases where verminous conditions persistently recur. During the year the mobile bathing equipment for the cleansing, by consent, of aged persons in their own homes where the persons concerned are so enfeebled as not to be able to attend at the Personal Cleansing Station was used on thirtytwo occasions. Laundry Service for Incontinent Persons. The arrangement with Hackney Borough Council for the laundering of articles of bed linen and personal clothing from incontinent persons continued during the year. This service was provided for ten persons during the year under review. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. During the year,297 complaints of infestation by rats or mice were received and in most cases of rat infestation smoke tests of the drainage of the premises affected were carried out by the rodent operatives under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Thirteen notices under section 4 (1) of the Act were served. Systematic baiting and poisoning was carried out by the Rodent Operatives at 383 domestic premises and at 209 business premises, with satisfactory results. In accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, all sewers under the control of the Council were baited twice during the year, involving a total of 1,291 manholes. Positive results were obtained in 570 instances. National Assistance Act, 1948 Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, provision is made 21 whereby a court of summary jurisdiction may make an order for the removal of ill, infirm or incapacitated persons who are not receiving proper care and attention. During the year under review it was found necessary in four cases to use the powers of the Act:- Three of these cases were in respect of women, aged 76, 79 and 94 years, who were infirm and physically incapacitated and living in insanitary conditions. They were unable to devote to themselves, and were not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. They all refused to enter suitable institutions and, in their own interests, there was no alternative but to apply for removal orders, all of which were granted by the Magistrate. The fourth case was in respect of a woman, aged 87 years, who was infirm and physically incapacitated and living in insanitary conditions. She was also in need of urgent hospital treatment but refused to enter hospital voluntarily and, in her own interests, there was no alternative but to apply for a removal order, which was granted by the Magistrate. During the year 33 other cases were brought to the notice of the Department where aged persons were in need of attention. It was possible in a number of these to provide necessary care for these old people in their own homes and the Home Help service provided by the London County Council was again helpful in this connection. In other cases where it was not possible to make satisfactory provision in their own homes the old people were persuaded to enter a hospital or an institution. The Old People's Welfare Committee, comprising representatives of the Council and the various local organisations and social settlements, continued to provide all possible assistance to old people in the Borough by the provision of clubs, home visitation, meals-on-wheels service, chiropody service, holidays and outings, etc. 22 Offensive Trades There are two premises in the Borough carrying on offensive trades one being the business of a fur skin dresser and the other a poultry slaughterhouse. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act provides for the licensing by the local authority of all premises used for the manufacture and/or storage of filling materials to which the Act applies, and for the registration of certain premises where such materials are used in upholstering, stuffing or lining of bedding, toys, baby carriages, etc. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock or other filling materials are manufactured but 40 premises are registered for the use of such materials in the trades conducted therein. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The operation of this Act is probably of more importance in Bethnal Green than in any other London Borough on account of the Sunday morning dog market which has been held in Bethnal Green for many years and which serves both vendors and purchasers throughout the whole of the County of London and even beyond. During the year 14 licences were granted in respect of shops and 52 licences in respect of stalls. Nine warning letters were sent in connection with various infringements of the Act. Clean Air Act, 1956 During the year the Council has given much attention to the establishment of smoke control areas in the Borough, as they consider that the opportunity of making the atmosphere of the Borough smoke free is one of the biggest and most worthwhile public health measures for a very long time. In November the Council made their first 23 Smoke Control Order covering approximately one-fifth of the Borough stretching from and including Victoria Park on the North and Meath Gardens on the South. When the Minister's confirmation is received there is a statutory period of six months before the Order can come into operation and during this period the Council's main task will be to facilitate the carrying out of adaptations to fireplaces in dwellings within the Area. All householders in Area No. 1 were sent during the summer a circular letter and explanatory leaflet giving them preliminary notice of the Council's proposals and in the majority of cases received a personal visit in course of the detailed survey of all existing domestic heating appliances. Directly confirmation is received it is intended to send these householders a further letter notifying them of the action to take to obtain grant aid towards cost of conversion or adaptation of their fireplaces and enclosing an application form for this purpose. This grant aid will amount to 7/10ths of approved expenditure on conversions and will be payable by the Council immediately the work has been done to their satisfaction, A request was received from the Ministry of Housing and Local Government that the Council should now consider their domestic smoke problem as a whole and decide on the smoke control orders that are needed, in what order of priority they should be made, and how many years it is likely to take to finish the Job; and that they should then prepare a phased programme for establishing smoke control areas over the next five years. This was accordingly done and the Council submitted to the Minister a programme to make the whole of the Borough a smoke control area by 1965. The implementation of the Council's programme of smoke control areas has already resulted in a great deal of additional duties being carried out by the Department. These have so far been absorbed by the existing staff, but this will become increasingly difficult as soon as No. 1 Order is confirmed when applications will start coming in for grant aid in respect of the fitting of approved appliances. The work will also increase with the commencement early next year of 24 the required detailed survey of existing domestic heating appliances in Areas Nos. 2 and 3 (covering nearly 6,000 premises) and will steadily build up as the clean air programme gains momentum. Atmospheric Pollution A station for the monthly measurement of deposited matter and of sulphur dioxide is installed on the roof of a building at one of the Council's Depots, The apparatus used is in two parts, one Instrument being a deposit gauge for the measurement of ash and grit, etc., In the atmosphere and the other a lead peroxide instrument by which the amount of sulphur dioxide is measured. In addition, a second station for recording the daily measurement of pollution by sulphur dioxide and of smoke is installed at the Town Hall. The results obtained from the instruments at the two stations are communicated to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Hairdressers and Barbers Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act,1954. requires the registration of premises and the persons carrying on the business of hairdressers or barbers thereat. At the end of the year, 52 premises were registered and 119 inspections were made to them during the year. 25 SECTION C HOUSING Clearance Areas Areas which were represented or were the subject of Public Inquiry or received confirmation during the year were as follows Grimsby Street 9 houses (Bethnal Green Borough Council) Mansford Street 5 houses „ „ „ „ Warner Place 8 houses „ „ „ „ Bonwell Street 25 houses (London County Council) Mansford Street 5 houses „ „ „ „ Mowlem Street 11 houses „ „ „ Eckersley Street 15 houses „ „ „ Demolition/Closing of Unfit Houses Having regard to the effect of demolition upon adjoining property, Closing Orders were made upon seven premises in accordance with Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957. in lieu of making Demolition Orders. Closing of Unfit parts of Buildings Following official represention 32 Closing Orders were made during the year under Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957. prohibiting the use for human habitation of the rooms concerned. Overcrowding (Housing Act, 1957) Details of overcrowding in the Borough, and of cases where overcrowding was abated, are given below:- No. of cases On register at end of 1958 352 New cases reported during 1959 11 Total 363 Overcrowding abated during 1959 190 On register at end of 1959 173 26  Families Equiv.

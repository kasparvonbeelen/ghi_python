Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my annual report on the vital statistics of Bethnal-Green for the year 1894, which terminated on the 29th of December last. For the purposes of this report I take the population of the Parish at 123,000, which is the same estimate as that for 1893. I usually calculate the population upon the basis of the registered births, as birth-rates are known to vary within very narrow limits. But though the births in 1894 were 120 fewer than in the previous year, I do not think that this fact indicates a relative diminution in our population, as the birth rate all over the United Kingdom was two per thousand below the mean rate of the ten years, 1884 to 1893, and that for London was the lowest in any year on record. In th 6 past the census has been taken only once in ten years, and the estimates in the intercensal years can only be approximately correct. My estimate will be checked next year by the census which will be taken all over London. By the Equalization of Rates (London) Act, the Registrar- General is called upon to furnish annually estimates, of the population of the various parishes of London, and it has been resolved that a census must be taken every five years, the first being in 1896. The numbers of births registered in the three sub-districts, into which the parish is divided for registration purposes, are shewn in the following table, together with the estimated populations; the census enumeration of 1891 and the births registered in that year are also shewn for purposes of comparison. TABLE A. Population and Births in Sub-Districts for the year 1891 and 1894. SUB-DISTRICTS. 1891. 1894. Population enumerated. Registered Births. Population estimated. Registered Births. North 51,520 2063 47,585 1862 South 33,491 32,975 1240 1360 East 1575 42,440 1534 44,123 4636 4998 Total 123,000 129,134 BIRTHS. The Births during the year were 4636 against 4756 in 1893, a decrease of 120, the excess of the births over the deaths however, was 1994. Table "B" shews this and compares the two years. TABLE B. 1894. 1893. Estimated population in the middle of the year 123,000 123,000 Total Births 4,636 4,756 Total Deaths 2,642 3,257 Excess of Births over Deaths, showing the natural increase of the Population 1,994 1,499 DEATH RATE. The number of deaths registered in the parish during the year 1894, was 2,398 against 3,031 in the previous year. This includes 152 non-parishioners who died in Bethnal Green Hospitals, and whose deaths must be excluded from the number. On the other hand I have received information from Somerset House of the deaths of 395 inhabitants of Bethnal Green who died in Hospitals in other parts of London. After adding these deaths and subtracting the non-parishioners there is a net total of 2,642. The deaths in each Sub-district, corrected by distribution in a similar manner, were as under: — North 1018 South 741 East 883 Total 2642 Upon the basis of the estimated population we show a mortality rate for the year 1894 of 21.4. This is a decrease of five per thousand on the rate for the previous year, but it is no less than four per thousand in excess of the general Metropolitan rate which was 17.4. The mortality in the Sub-districts into which the parish is divided was as under: — North 21.4 South 22.4 East 20.8 In the following table the mortality rates for London and for Bethnal Green are compared by quarters:— TABLE C. London. Bethnal Green. March Quarter 21.2 26.0 June Quarter 21.0 17.4 September Quarter 15.9 18.7 December Quarter 16.6 20.1 I am indebted to the British Medical Journal for the following Extract:— THE DEATH-RATES OF LONDON SANITARY AREAS DURING 1894. In the accompanying table will be found summarised the vital statistics of the forty-three sanitary areas of the metropolis, based upon the Registrar-General's returns for the year 1894. The mortality figures in the table relate to the deaths of persons actually belonging to the respective sanitary areas, and are the result of a complete system of distribution of deaths occurring in the public institutions of London among the various sanitary areas in which the patients had previously resided. The 130,553 births registered in London during 1894 were equal to a rate of 301 per 1,000 of the population, estimated at 4,349,166 persons in the middle of that year. In each of the two preceding years 1892 and 1893 the birth-rate was 30-9 per 1,000. In the various sanitary areas the birth-rates showed, as usual, wide variations, owing principally to the differences in the sex and age distributions of their populations. In Kensington, St. George Hanover Square, St. James Westminster, Hampstead, St. Martinin-the-Fields, London City, and Lee, the birth-rates were considerably below the average; while in St. Luke, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, St. George-in-the East, Mile End Old Town, Newington and Bermondsey the birth-rates showed a marked excess. The deaths of persons belonging to London registered during the year under notice were 75,434, equal to an annual rate of 17.4 per 1,000 of the population, against 21-1, 20'3, and 20 9 in the three preceding years. This rate was considerably below any recorded since the establishment of civil registration nearly sixty years ago, the nearest approach to so low a death-rate having been 18'0 in 1889. During the nine preceding years 1885-93 the London death-rate averaged 20 - 1 per 1,000. The lowest death-rates in the forty-three sanitary areas during last year were 9 - 8 in Stoke Newington, 10 6in Hampstead, 12-4 in Wandsworth and in Lee, 12-5 in Plumstead, 138 in Lewisham (excluding Penge), and 14 5 in St. George Hanover Square ; in the other districts the rates ranged upwards to 21-1 in Mile End Old Town. 21-4 in Whitechapel, 22 7 in Strand, 23-1 in St. George Southwark, 23'5 in St. Luke, 24-7 in Limehouse and 26-4 in St. George-in-the East. During the year under notice 11,467 deaths resulted from the principal zymotic diseases in London ; of these, 3,291 were referred to measles, 2,637 to diphtheria, 2,094 to whooping cough, 1,769 to diarrhoea, 961 to scarlet fever, 626 to different forms of " fever " (including 5 to typhus, 608 to enteric fever, and 13 to simple and ill-defined forms of fever), and 89 to small-pox. These 11,467 deaths were equal to an annual rate of 2 6 per 1,000, against 2-3, 2 - 8, and 30 in the three preceding years; during the nine years 1885-93 the zymotic death-rate in London averaged 2.7 per 1,000. In the various sanitary areas the rates ranged from o'9 in Stoke Newington, I*l in the City of London, 1-4 in St. George Hanover Square and in Hampstead, I*7 in Lee, I*B in Wandsworth and I*9 in Lewisham, to 35 in Bethnal Green, 3 - 6 in St. George Southwark, 3"8 in Eulham, 4"1 in Mile End Old Town, 4-3 in Limehouse and 50 in St. George-in-the-East. Compared with the average in the ten preceding years the mortality from measles and from diphtheria showed a marked excess, while that from each of the other principal zymotic diseases showed a decline. The 89 fatal cases of small-pox registered in London during last year showed a marked decline from the number in the preceding year, and were less than half the average; of these 89 cases, 29 belonged to Marylebone, 8 to St. Pancras, 5 to Bethnal Green, 4 to Mile End Old Town, and 10 to Poplar sanitary areas. During the year under notice, 1,234 smallpox patients were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals, and 16 remained"under treatment at the end of the year. Measles showed the highest proportional fatality in Fulham, Limehouse, Mile End Old Town, Poplar, St. Saviour Southwark, St. George Southwark, and St. Olave Southwark ; scarlet fever in Whitechapel,. St-George-in the East, Limehouse, Mile End Old Town, Greenwich,, and Woolwich ; diphtheria in Paddington, Fulham, Bethnal Green,. St. George-in-the-East, Limehouse, Mile End Old Town, St. George Southwark, Bermondsey, and Camberwell; whooping-cough in St. Giles, Strand, Shoreditch, Whitechapel, and St. George-in-the-East " fever " in St. James Westminster and Strand ; and diarrhoea in St. Luke, St. George-in-the-East, Mile End Old Town, St. George Southwark, and Rotherhithe sanitary areas. The number of scarlet fever patients in the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals, which had been 2,872 at the beginning of 1894, was 1,865, at the end of December last; 11,767 new cases were admitted during 1894, equal to a weekly average of 226 throughout the year. There were 4,128 admissions of diphtheria patients into these hospitals during 1894, and 521 remained under treatment at the end of the year ; and there were also 675 admissions of enteric fever patients during the same period, of whom 104 remained at the end of December last. Infant mortality in London during 1894, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year of age to registered births, was equal to 143 per 1,000, and was below the mean proportion in the ten preceding years. While the rate of infant mortality did not exceed 86 in Stoke Newington, 94 in Lee and in Plumstead, 113 in Hampstead, 114 in Wandsworth, and 115 in St. George Hanover Square. It ranged upwards in the other sanitary areas to 174 in Limehouse, 179 in Strand, 180 in Holborn, 185 in St. George-in-the- East, 186 in St. George Southwark, and 210 in St. Martin-in-the- Fields.

The births registered during the year were 4636 This is equal to a rate of 37.7 and is about one per thousand lower than the birth rates of the two preceding years. It is, as usual, nearly eight per thousand in excess of the general Metropolitan rate which was 30.1. In the registration Sub-districts of Bethnal Green the birth rates were as under:— North 39.1 South 37.6 East 36.1 The East Sub-district contains the largest proportion of children and unmarried women, and it shows the lowest birth rate. MARRIAGES. In this parish there are fourteen Churches, fifteen Chapels, and one Registry Office licensed for Marriages: of these there were in the First Quarter 279 Second Quarter 309 Third Quarter 359 Fourth Quarter 443 Total 1390 This total indicates a marriage rate of 11-3 to every thousand persons; or, as in each marriage there are two contracting parties, 22.6 per thousand of our population entered the bonds of matrimony. DEATHS OF INFANTS. Twenty-six per cent, of the deaths from all causes were those of infants aged less than twelve months; for out of 4636 children born alive 709 died before reaching the age of one year. This gives a death rate, calculated upon the births of 152, while the corresponding rate for the whole of London was 143. The diseases most fatal to infants were : — Atrophy and Debility 124 Inflammatory Diseases of Chest 120 Convulsions 95 Premature Birth 66 Suffocation 36 Tabes Mesenterica 36 Diarrhœa 35 Whooping Cough 32 Measles 30 Inflammatory Diseases of Brain 24 DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. Nearly half the deaths (1,244, that is 47 per cent.) were those of children aged less than five years. This gives a rate 68.3 calculated upon the estimated population of young children. OLD PERSONS' DEATH RATE. The deaths of elderly persons, that is to say those over 65 years of age, numbered 396. This gives a rate of 55.0 per thousand, calculated on the estimated population of old persons. SPECIAL CAUSES OF DEATH. Summary of Table III. No. of Deaths. Per Centage on Total Deaths.

The total number of deaths from this group of diseases was 504, a figure which represents about nineteen per cent, of the total deaths from all causes. Of these deaths 385 were amongst young children under five years of age, 119 of whom were infants. THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths referred to the orders Miasmatic and Diarrhœal (exclusive of influenza) were 460, a decrease of 60 compared with 1893. The decennial average of Zymotic deaths for the ten years 1884 to 1893 was 493 (see Table V.) The death rate from these seven Zymotic diseases was 3.6, in 1893 it was 4.l. The corresponding rates for London were 3.0 in 1893, and 26 in 1894. TABLE D. I 1894. 1893.

NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. A total of 1,582 notification certificates have been received during the year. Twenty-four of the certificates were duplicate notifications, that is to say the case was reported by more than one Medical man. Particulars of the number of cases, month by month, together with the Hospital admissions and discharges are shown in the accompanying table. The usual spot maps indicating the distribution of the cases are also submitted. In his Annual Report for 1894, Dr. Goodall, the Medical Superintendent of the Eastern Hospitals, mentions that he has ascertained that during the past year in about 3.7 of the cases certified Scarlet Fever, in 17.5 per cent, of those certified Diphtheria, and in 25.8 of those certified Enterica, the patients were found, upon further observation, not to be suffering from those diseases. These figures are in excess of previous years. In the case of Diphtheria the increased percentage of error is due largely to the fact that during the latter part of the year Bacteriological means of diagnosis were freely used. With respect to Enterica, Dr. Goodall remarks that this disease is, especially in its early stages, most difficult to diagnose with certainty. If a patient is suspected to be suffering from Enteric Fever and requires removal to Hospital, it is very important that this removal should take place as early as possible. It is dangerous to wait till a certain opinion as to the nature of the disease can be given, for in many cases absolutely certain symptoms are only observed at a period of the disease when removal is fraught with the gravest risk to the patient's life.

SMALL POX. (Decennial average 15.5). The total number of Small Pox cases notified during the year was 84. Of these 70 were removed to Hospital, though only 60 were retained, the other ten being sent home again as not being cases of Small Pox; twenty-two of the patients came from the North District, forty-three from the South, and eighteen from the East. There were five deaths, all amongst those removed to Hospital; four were unvaccinated but no information could be obtained as to the fifth. With regard to the Sanitary condition of the houses where these cases occurred, the Inspectors report that 33 were found to be fairly satisfactory, but the internal drainage was defective in two, and the external drains in eight, while other minor insanitary conditions obtained in thirty instances. Eleven cases were amongst families occupying one room only. SCARLET FEVER. (.Decennial average 60.5). The number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year was 514 resulting in 27 deaths, a mortality of 5.3 per cent, on the notifications. In the North District 172 cases were notified, in the South 134, and in the East 198. 219 Scarlet Fever patients were removed to Hospital, nineteen of them died. (The Asylums Board Returns give the number as 238). The Inspectors' reports on the sanitary condition of the houses where these cases occurred give the following particulars : — In 264 instances everything was found to be in a fairly satisfactory state, but in eleven the closets had no water supply; in twenty-three the internal drainage arrangements were defective, and in forty-nine he outside drains were faulty; in four the domestic water supply was drawn from the closet cistern; while in 146 others various minor insanitary conditions were found. Fifty-eight of the cases occurred amongst families occupying one room only. CONTINUED FEVER. (Decennial average 26.8.) The total number of Enteric Fever cases reported during the year was 150. Of these 26 died, a case mortality of 17.3 per cent, on the notifications. The patients removed to Hospital numbered 73, and 11 of them died. Of the removals only 16 were admitted to Asylums Board Hospitals, and the remainder were treated in General Hospitals. Of the cases, 65 were reported from the North District, 40 from the South, and 45 from the East. In 76 instances the residence of the patient was found to be in a satisfactory sanitary condition, but in two the W.C. had no water supply, in 25 the external drainage arrangements were faulty, and in five the drains inside the house were bad, in one the domestic water supply was drawn from the W.C. cistern, and other insanitary conditions were found in 37. Fourteen cases occurred in families occupying one room only. One case of Typhus Fever was notified, and removed to Hospital, but I am informed that this ultimately proved to be Measles. DIPHTHERIA: (Including Membranous Croup.) (Decennial average 23.0.) The number of cases reported to me under these two heads was 58. The number of deaths registered was 133, which is equal to a mortality of 23.3 per cent, on the notifications. The deaths in Hospital numbered 66. On the estimated population at all ages the mortality was 1.08 against 1.00 last year; but of the total deaths 100 were amongst young children aged less than five years. This was 5.49 per 1,000 on the estimated population of young children. Of the total notifications, 186 came from the North District, 155 from the South, and 215 from the East. The removals numbered 164; 141 of these were admitted into the Asylums Board Hospitals, but a few cases (mostly membranous Croup and necessitating operation) were treated in General Hospitals. The deaths amongst the Hospital cases, which include the majority of the serious ones, numbered 66. The Inspectors report that 310 of the houses where these patients resided were found upon examination to be in a fairly satisfactory condition, but 14 had no water supply to the closets; in 25 the internal drainage arrangements were faulty, and in 63 the drains outside the houses were in bad order; in 127, various minor insanitary defects were discovered; 48 cases occurred amongst families occupying one room only. WHOOPING COUGH. (Decennial average 113-4). Whooping Cough caused 70 deaths, all except two being amongst young children, and shewed a mortality of 3.7 per thousand on the estimated population of young children. MEASLES. (Decennial average 115.6) Measles caused 135 deaths, of which all but six were amongst young children aged less than five years, this being a mortality of 7.0 per thousand on the estimated population of young children, under five years of age.

It is therefore only necessary to reproduce here the four cases where the summonses were dismissed. Quinn's Buildings. Notice was served upon the owners of this block of Model Dwellings to remove the dust shoots from the interior of the Buildings as they were a constant source of nuisance. The owners declined to obey the notice, and a summons was in consequence taken out against them. This was heard by Mr. Haden Corser, who, after taking the evidence, adjourned the case for the purpose of making a personal inspection of the premises. The Magistrate was of opinion from what he saw on his visit that the removal of the dust shoots to the exterior of the buildings would bring about a worse condition than the existing one. He therefore declined to make an order and dismissed the summons. J. G. , 9, Pollard Street. Some unreported cases of Small-pox at this address caused quite an epidemic in the neighbourhood, as no attempt was made to isolate the patients. The cases (two in number) were discovered by Inspector Foot, who in several other Small-pox cases traced the source of infection to this house. Nine cases were removed in May from the neighbourhood, and twenty others from within a radius of half a mile during May and June. Presumably most of these originated from the unreported cases at No. 9. When discovered, J. G's children were convalescent after an illness of about five weeks' duration. From statements made by the mother Mr. Foot was of opinion that the father had wilfully concealed the nature of the disease, fearing that his children would be removed to Hospital. The summons against the father for failing to notify was heard by Mr. Haden Corser, who held that any statements made by the mother to Mr. Foot could not be received in evidence as against the husband, and he was not satisfied by any other evidence we were able to produce that Defendant was aware that his children were suffering from Small-pox. He therefore dismissed the summons. 9, Birkbeck Street. Mrs. K , the wife of a baker, was summoned before Mr. Haden Corser for exposing articles of clothing infected with scarlet fever. Mrs. K's child had been certified by a well-known medical practitioner in the neighbourhood to be suffering from scarlet fever; the offer of removal to hospital was declined, and the mother who was nursing the sick child was seen by Inspector Keif serving in the shop. The day before the hearing we were informed that the medical practioner referred to had never personally attended the child, but had sent his unqualified assistant. The notification certificate was therefore valueless as evidence that the child was suffering from scarlet fever, and as I did not examine the patient when I visited the premises, we were unable to prove our case, and so withdrew the summons in court. The Magistrate, however, was of opinion that we should have stopped the case earlier and gave £3 3s. costs against the Vestry. The giving of the illegal certificate of notification under these circumstances appears to come within the meaning of the following resolution passed by the Medical Council on April 21st, 1893:— " That the Council record on its minutes, for the information of those whom it may concern, that charges of gross misconduct in the employment of unqualified practitioners in respect of the signing of medical certificates required for the purposes of any law or lawful contract are, if brought before the Council, regarded by the Council as charges of infamous conduct under the Medical Act." Upon the occasion of my visit to these premises I found the mother (who was attending upon the sick child) in the Bakehouse with an armful of soiled linen. This Bakehouse is situated at the back of the premises and the only means of access to the yard is by passing through the Bakehouse. The owner was accordingly summoned under Section 16, of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1883, and the case was heard immediately after the one just detailed. I contended that under the conditions described, the Bakehouse was " in such a state as to be, on sanitary grounds, unfit for use or occupation as a Bakehouse," until a proper separate entrance from the house to the yard was provided. Mr. Haden Corser did not agree with my reading of the Section, but considered the matter of such great public importance that he adjourned the hearing so that the owner might make the necessary alterations in his premises. The owner, however, declined to do this and at the adjourned hearing Mr. Haden Corser regretted that in his opinion he had no power to make an order under section 16, as he considered that the word " state " referred to some actual sanitary defect in the premises, and not to any temporary condition such as my complaint referred to. He considered that it was most undesirable that such conditions should exist, as bread might easily become contaminated; but under these circumstances as there was nothing to prevent the owner taking his refuse out of the front door instead of through the Bakehouse, he must therefore dismiss the summons. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND TRADE PREMISES. In December, 1893, Mr. C. H. Kelf was appointed an additional Sanitary Inspector. By direction of the Sanitary Committee this Officer's duties were restricted to the inspection and regulation of trade premises all over the Parish, with the understanding that any insanitary conditions coming under his observation in houses which were in connection with workshops should be dealt with by him, so as to avoid as much as possible the over-lapping and duplication of duties. On the appointment of a fifth Inspector in January, 1895, this arrangement was terminated. The Parish was divided into five districts, and one was apportioned to each Officer. Each Inspector now looks after the trade premises in his own district. The following Table gives particulars of the Workshops visited and examined by Mr. Kelf. WORKSHOPS INSPECTED During the year ending December 29th. 1894. Primary Inspections 1332 Re-inspections 3112 Total 444 1 Workshops found in satisfactory condition 475 Overcrowded 78 Dirty 527 „ With insufficient W.C. accomodation 59 With defective internal drainage 206 „ With defective external drainage 511 Number of Notices served 763 Protected persons found employed and notified to H.M.'s Factory Inspector 767 Insanitary Conditions abated 795 Premises under notice 70 It will be noticed that during the year Mr. Kelf inspected 1,332 Workshops; in 857 of them various insanitary defects were found, and though some of the nuisances were abated on a verbal intimation, yet it was found necessary to serve 763 notices and to re-visit each of the defective Workshops three or four times before the notices were obeyed. The summonses taken out against the occupiers of Workshops who had failed to obey the notices within a reasonable time numbered 38, but 21 of these were withdrawn on payment of costs as the necessary works were completed before the day of hearing. Two summonses were dismissed, in one case with costs against the Vestry. Details of these cases will be found under the head of "Legal Proceedings." In nine cases the Magistrates at Worship Street made orders for the necessary work to be executed and for the costs to be paid to the Vestry. In six cases fines were inflicted, in one other the defendant was cautioned and ordered to pay the costs. The following cases require special mention: — A Cooper, the occupier of some workshops in Weaver Street, was summoned for permitting his premises to be in a dirty condition and for neglecting to make proper provision for the ventilation of his workshops so as to render harmless the vapours (smoke, &c.) generated in the course of his handicraft. The process of firing the casks was found to be carried on upon open hearths, the men employed were working in the midst of irritating smoke, and the walls and rafters of the workshop were covered with soot. The occupier conducted his own case and appealed to the Magistrate (Mr. H. Corser) to visit the premises and see the condition of them for himself. The summons was adjourned for a month for this purpose. The owner now set vigorously to work to cleanse and limewash the premises, thereby destroying some of the evidence as to smoke, &c. Mr. Corser was informed as to what was being done, and he declined to visit. At the adjourned hearing the occupier attended and agreed to an order. A Boot and Shoemaker in Warner Place was summoned for failing to comply with two notices, one requiring him to abate the overcrowding in his workshops, and the other requiring him to provide additional Closet accommodation for the women employed. In this last case the defendant denied the offence, and stated that his female employees were allowed the use of the W.C. at his private house a few doors away. Mr. Bushby ruled that the Sanitary Authority had power to order what additional closet accommodation they considered necessary, and that the Magistrate had no power to question this decision, but only to administer the law and inflict a penalty if the order of the Sanitary Authority were not complied with. Both cases were proved and fines of £5 and 2s. costs were inflicted in each case. Subsequently these fines were reduced by the Home Secretary to one-half. c COW-HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. These have been kept under constant observation. The new bye-laws of the London County Council as to dung-pits have caused some trouble and it has been necessary to oppose several of the licenses at the sessions for non-compliance. There are 11 licensed slaughter-houses and 24 cow-houses, renewals for the whole of these were applied for at the Licensing Meeting of the London County Council on Monday 29-10-94. The following licenses were objected to :— 149, Brick Lane, Charles Knight. Objection by Inspector of L.C.C. Premises have not been used by Mr. Knight for a period of more than twelve months, other persons are allowed to slaughter cattle on the premises, and there appears to be no necessity for a license being granted in respect of these premises, as the shop is only opened to retail trade on Sunday mornings. The license was eventually granted with a stipulation that the premises should be used by no one but the owner himself. 381, Cambridge Road, W. W. Burrows. Stable not effectually separated from the cow-shed. The work was completed before the hearing and the opposition withdrawn. 95, Collingwood Street, J. Richards. Dung receptacle erected contrary to bye-laws. Opposition withdrawn on Mr. Richards discontinuing the use of this dung pit and undertaking to provide a moveable receptacle. 216, Columbia Road, Messrs. Jones Bros. Council Inspector objected on the ground that Shed No. 2 had not been occupied as a cow-shed since February, 1892. The Vestry objected on the ground that the paving and surface drainage of the sheds was defective and the ventilation imperfect, also that a proper dung pit was required. The whole of this work was completed before the hearing and, as all opposition was withdrawn, the license was granted. 38, Fellbrigge Street, Susannah Bogos. Cow-shed requires to be thoroughly cleansed and lime-washed, the ventilation improved, and a proper dung-pit constructed in accordance with the Council's bye-laws. This was done before the day of hearing, and the license was granted. 1, Hamilton Road, Thos. Jones. 6, Warley Street, H. Griffiths. Neither of these cow-keepers had made adequate provision for the disposal of manure, both had sunken dung-pits inside the sheds. Both cow-keepers agreed to provide moveable receptacles; opposition was withdrawn and the license granted. BAKEHOUSES. The total number of these under inspection is 106, they are in a fairly clean and satisfactory condition, but about half of them are underground, and the ventilation of most of these leaves much to be desired. TURIN STREET HOARD SCHOOL. Complaints as to the condition of the drainage at these Schools were received, and on the 27th of April the Schools were visited by Mr. Foot, the Inspector of the district. He reported to me that serious defects existed in the drainage and sanitary arrangements. On the following Saturday I took advantage of the absence of the children to make a thorough examination of the buildings, accompanied by Mr. Foot. We found the following conditions existing:— The closets for the teachers in two departments were of the obsolete "pan and container" form,in a very filthy condition. In two of the lavatories defective "bell" traps were found, and the waste pipes from the basins in both were not disconnected nor were they properly trapped. Nearly all the rainwater pipes outside the building were directly connected to the soil drain; none of the drains were ventilated except through these rainwater pipes, the heads of many of which were in close proximity to windows. The drains were carefully tested and found in such a defective condition as to require entire re-construction. The W.C. accomodation for the children was situated in the playground and consisted of old, unglazed, iron trough-closets, flushed by hand, and of such construction as to render proper cleansing impossible. The matter was reported to the Sanitary Committee, and on May the 8th notices under the Public Health Act were served on the School Authorities. These notices resulted in much correspondence, and ultimately plans for the entire reconstruction of the drainage system were laid before the Sanitary Committee and approved. The School rose for the Summer Vacation on July 22nd, and I quite expected that the work would be immediately put in hand; nothing, however, was done, and finding that the usual arrangements preparatory to the re-assembling of the pupils were being made, I wrote the following letter:— "To G. H. Croad, Esq. "Dear Sir, Turin Street Board School "I understand the drainage works at this School will shortly be put in hand. I shall be glad to know what course the Board proposes to adopt with reference to the reopening of the School as I am informed that the usual preparations are being made for the reception of the pupils. "I am strongly of opinion that the School should not be used whilst the drainage works are in progress, as I believe it would be disastrous for children to be congregated in the immediate vicinity of a large number of open drains. "As you are aware Diphtheria is widely prevalent in the Metropolis, and the occupation of the School whilst this work is in progress would certainly induce a state of health amongst the children attending, such as would render them most likely to contract the disease. "Should the Board decide to re-open after this warning I shall feel it my duty to recommend the Vestry to take the usual steps to close the School so soon as the drainage works are commenced. "I am, dear Sir, "&c., &c." A reply to this letter was received intimating that closure of the School would, in the opinion of the Board, be unnecessary, as provision would be made in the contract with the builder, to whom the work was to be intrusted, which would obviate any of the evil effects I feared. Subsequently the contract was submitted, and in it the contractor was bound down to do the work in sections, with the understanding that the portion of the School actually under repair was to be closed, and the playground parted off by a high fence; moreover the contractor was strictly tied down not to interfere with any soil drain except during the period between Friday afternoon (after School hours) and the re-opening of the School on the following Monday morning. Under these conditions the Sanitary Committee were of opinion that the work might be allowed to be commenced, and on August the 26th the School re-opened, but the repairs were not started till early in September, when the School was in full swing. The operations were closely watched by Mr. Foot, who soon found that the promise not to interfere with soil drains could not be kept, as the actual course of these drains was quite unknown, and the workmen accidently broke into them in several places. On September the 11th notice to close the School was served upon the Managers and upon the School Board. These notices were obeyed under protest and the Schools were kept closed until October 29th, when the work was so far forward that I was of opinion that the children might re-assemble without danger. The work has been thoroughly carried out under Mr. Foot's supervision and the result is most satisfactory. SANITARY WORK. Table VI. gives details of the work done in the Sanitary Department. The appointment of two additional Sanitary Inspectors has thrown much extra labour and responsibility upon your Medical Officer. The resulting clerical work is much more than can be dealt with by a single clerk; and though Mr. Meadway is an exceptionally good officer, and really does the work of two men, additional help in the office is urgently required. I must apologise for the somewhat fragmentary nature of this report which has been brought out under considerable pressure, nearly three months earlier than usual. I was threatened by the Local Government Board in April that half my salary would be forfeited unless this report was sent in without delay, advance copies were therefore typewritten and forwarded as desired. Since my re-appointment under the Local Government Board it is necessary that the statistics in this report should be prepared on certain forms specified by the Board, and as I happen to prefer my own forms which have been used in my past reports for twenty years, I have been obliged to prepare the statistical portion of the report in duplicate. So far the advantages of reappointment under the Local Government Board have been wholly on the side of the Vestry, who get the return of half my salary from the County Council. All I have to shew on my side is a good deal of extra clerical work, and the necessity of preparing this report in the busy season, instead of later in the year. Moreover I have not had the advantage of perusing the annual Summary of the Registrar General which is usually published in June, but have had to dig out comparative Metropolitan statistics from whatever source I could. However, I hopefully look forward to these matters being taken into account when my salary is reconsidered, and meanwhile I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant.

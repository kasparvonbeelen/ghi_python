2 BET 72 FIRST ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH on the SANITARY STATE AND TRANSACTIONS IN BETHNAL, GREEN, DURING 1858. London: PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY. mdccclvii. TO THE GENTLEMEN of the VESTRY OF ST. MATTHEW, BETHNAL GREEN, whose untiring exertions for the physical improvement of their important parish, will save hundreds in money and lives: amongst whom the medical officer of health has the honor to number many old friends: HIS FIRST ANNUAL REPORT is dedicated with sentiments of deep and lasting respect. 135, Bethnal Green Road, February 15, 1857. " The great work of the day it to improve the health of the people" Gentlemen, The Instructions* to Medical Officers of Health direct them to inquire into, and to report, periodically, upon the physical conditions of the place and people, their vital statistics and sanitary state, the ventilation and drainage of houses, the drinking waters and water supply, the condition of the burial grounds, slaughtering places, and homes of the industrial classes, and to state, on referring to existing evils, what sanitary appliances are best for their mitigation. Accordingly, in my Report on 1856, I have comprised these several matters under the following heads:— 1. Births and Immigration—Increase. 2. Mortality and Sickness. 3. Health, Present, and Previous. 4. Sanitary Transactions. 5. Defects and Requirements. 6. Correlative Matters. 7. Summary and Conclusion. 1.—BIRTHS AND IMMIGRATION—INCREASE. The number of Births fell from 3717, in 1855, to 3640, in 1856. 3.6 children were born to each hundred persons, or 1.9 to every death. As 1905 persons died, the natural addition to our population by excess of Births over Deaths was 1735. But the births do not constitute all the increase; the influx of * From the General Board of Health, December 20th, 1855. 4 immigrants forms nearly a third. In the 10 years 1841—50, out of a total increase of 15,991, the excess of births over deaths was 10,697, the immigration—addition 5,294, or 529.4 per year. Where an area is not over crowded, immigration recruits the original stock. Where too, the migratory stream ebbs and flows, as in our Irish colonies of Elizabeth Place and John's Court, the sickness and deaths are probably less than a stationary population would have.* Since the census many new streets have been built, and the influx has, doubtless, further advanced. 2.—MORTALITY AND SICKNESS. Mortality. 1905 Deaths were registered in the Parish in 1856; of which, 518 occurred in the first, 422 in the second, 468 in the third, and 497 in the fourth quarters of the year. They were, consequently, less by 238 than in 1855, and 449 below the corrected average of the preceding 10 years. One person died of cholera at 16, Anchor Street, opposite a gully hole which receives the surface drainage of several streets and at times overflows.† The 6 Epidemics proved fatal to 385 persons, or to 1 in every 259 of the population. Their percentage to the total deaths was 20.2—nearly 1 in 5. Numerically—385 against 475, and 20.2 per cent against 22.16— they also contrast favourably with the previous year. One in every 90 deaths arose from Small Pox; 1 in 50 from Measles; 1 in 32 from Scarlatina; 1 in 22 from Hooping Cough; 1 in 25 from Diarrhœa; and 1 in 17 from Typhus. These returns, tested by those of last year, show, that the first 4 diseases were of less, and the last 2 (which depend more on endemic causes) were of greater amount. Their relative proportions, in the several Sub-districts during 1856, are * On shifting the Surgeons annually on the west coast of Africa, the mortality fell 53 per cent. Taper by Alex. Keith Johnston, F.R.S.E. † Because it only leads into a street reservoir. 5 given in Table 1, in the Appendix to this Report. In the same period, 23 persons died in the Consumption Hospital; 42 in Bethnal House Asylum; and 251 in our Workhouse. Hence, out of every 6 deaths, 1 occurred in our Public Institutions, while in all London, the proportion was about 1 in 5. According to population, our proportion of deaths in such Institutions would be 396, leaving a surplus of 80 to be distributed elsewhere. Conjointly, in the 6 Poor Law Divisions, there was 1 death to every 14 cases of sickness. Our total mortality was below that of London, being 19 per 1,000, or 1 death to every 52 living, while the London mortality was 22 per 1000, or 1 death to each 46. Our epidemic rate however was 1.3 per cent in excess, the London per centage forming 18.9 only. That excess apportions us more than our share of the diseases which rank in the preventible class. But if they be estimated, as Dr. Barnes estimates them, on our fractional proportions of the epidemics and population of London, the former would be represented by 385/10736, or 1/28; —the latter by 100,000/2,616,248, or 1/26, and would turn the scale in our favour. Inother words, instead of 385, our epidemics would number 410. Viewed either way, and contrasted with the healthier standards of Northumberland, Surrey and Sussex, our loss on those diseases is fearfully large. And as they are criteria of sanitary wants and defects, so, upon their amount will our labours and remedies especially tell. Should I have the honour to hold office next year, I shall be enabled—through the kindness and liberality of the Registrar-General, to furnish the Sub-district mortality, the death-rate of each Sub-division, and the Sex, Age, &c. of every death. To show the influence that weather has upon life, I have arranged, in Table 2, the atmospheric phenomena and deaths of each month after the plan of my monthly Reports. Sickness. The weather of 1856 was dry, the temperature, with 6 one short exception, was mild,* no great epidemic prevailed, and the health of Bethnal Green, as of all London, was "unusually good." In no year since 1850, the year after Cholera, has our mortality fallen so low. Among your Six Poor Law Divisions, the health-improvement was marked, for, notwithstanding the large population-increase, the cases of sickness were little more in amount than in 1846. Then however, the Dispensary and Consumption Hospital did not exist, now, doubtless they draw off a part. During the last six months of the year, 2825 cases were attended by your six Medical Officers. Of these 608 occurred in the Workhouse; —316 in District No. 1;—428 in No. 2;—514 in No. 3;— 568 in No 4;—and 391 in No 5. If calculated on the estimate of 8.25 attendances to every case,† the attendances would number about 23,300 in the latter half of the year. Two cases of Cholerac Diarrhoea in Wharf Road, on the borders of the Canal, and one in Claremont Cottages, all threatening collapse, were successfully treated by Mr. Welch. Of the epidemics, Typhus was most rife, and Hooping Cough next in amount. Their proportions one to another, and to each Sub-division, are given in No. 3 of the Tables adjoined. That Table shows that the epidemics formed nearly a third of the total attacks, and that 1 out of every 35 persons, was under the care of your efficient Medical Staff. 3.—HEALTH, PRESENT AND PREVIOUS. To estimate correctly our standard of health, we must compare the present and past, and contrast the Parish with other localities. The statistics of the Registrar-General prove that, of late years, our deaths have decreased. When Registration commenced, the mortality in Bethnal Green was at the * The "10 cold days (November 26th to December .5th,)" during which "the excess of deaths was 339, or nearly 34 daily." †This estimate is deduced from the returns of the Medical Officers in 1847, and closely agrees with the estimate of Mr. Welch. 7 annual rate of 3.095* per cent ,or 1 death to every 32 persons; but in the decennium 1841—50, it fell to 2.6 per cent., or 1 death to each 38. I shall presently show that, since 1850, life has further improved. To contrast Bethnal Green with other localities, to test the life differences of high and low levels, wealth and destitution, density and space, sewerage and sewerage wants, I have selected certain London Districts from the Registrar-General's 16th Report. These Districts are shown in Table 4 of Appendix, in which column 5 gives the death-rate per 1000; column 6—the excess over 17 per 1000, or the number of preventible deaths. Lewisham alone among the London Divisions, reached that zenith of health, and had no greater loss. Applied to ourselves, Table 4 tells that we, with more space to our population, suffered three times the excess of the City of London, and almost doubled that of the densely crowded Strand. It tells too, that in 10 years, we lost 7393 persons more than would have died, had we not exceeded the Lewisham rate. With favouring conditions of soil elevation, a beautiful Park, and an open eastern contour—on what, it may be asked, did our excess depend? Probably, in great part, on our sewerage-wants, and the unpaved saturated state of many of our Gardens, By-ways, and Courts. Such was our standard up to 1851. If we now add together the deaths in 1851—56, and calculate their ratio by the formula given below† the per centage resulting is 2.307, or 1 death to each 43. In those years, many sewers were made, and life rose proportionally, in Bethnal Green. Again, if we compare the Sub-district mortality in 1841 and 1843, with that in 1851 and 1853, we arrive at this striking fact, that while the deaths of the Hackney Road, Green, and Church Sub-divisions advanced, those of the Town became less:— the death proportions being, in Hackney Road +111; in * Registrar-General's First Annual Report. Population 1851. 90193 Deaths in 6 years 12489/6 Persons. 100 x: =1248900/541168 Death-Rate obtained 2.307. This formula is deduced from page 159 of the Registrar-General's 9th Annual Report. 8 the Green +406; in the Church +184; in the Town—69. The Epidemic deaths too, in 1856, were least in the Town. These differences, most probably, result from the differences in the decennial per centage increase of their population which I showed in my First Report to have been respectively 19.36, 40.49, 25.98, and 4.71. They accord with the law of Dr. Farr, that "an increase of density implies an increase of mortality." 4.—SANITARY TRANSACTIONS. During the last 20 years, vast improvements have been effected in Bethnal Green. The Highway, and many of the By-way foot paths have been paved; levels, inclinations, and drainage channels made; and the roads and streets put in repair. To the protection afforded by those means, to the houses and ground, much, probably of our health-improvement is due. Since the Metropolis Management Act came into force, you, Gentlemen, have nobly advanced "the great work of the day." You have abolished the black ditch in Lamb Fields, and made a pipe sewer instead—have arched over 30 feet of open sewer behind Hackney Road—the cause I believe of much local disease;—have constructed sewers in several streets, in which Fever was, before, constantly rife; —have connected hundreds of houses with neighbouring sewers, and ordered their cesspools to be disused, and filled up. You have, also, at a cost of nearly £5000, organized, and commenced four grand Sewerage Blocks—life-saving works which will testify hereafter, to your wisdom and zeal. By these grand reforms you will enhance the salubrity of the climate and air, and diminish, alike, the sick and death rolls! Having, from time to time, reported many of the worst and most ill-conditioned places, (copies of which are kept in my Journal, and at your Town Hall) I have now grouped together the several improvements, in the Retrospective Synopsis appended to this Report. 9 5.—DEFECTS AND REQUIREMENTS. The first comprise the causes that war against life; the second the remedies for their suppression. The principal of each are given below:— SANITARY DEFECTS. 1. Poisonous state of the soil from insufficient draining, paving, and cleansing. 2. Atmospheric Vitiation, by privies and cesspools, untrapped gullies, open gutters, or drains. 3. Defective Ventilation of Houses, Schools, Factories, Churches, &c. 4. Insufficient Water Supply, and its contamination from storage in dirty vessels and rooms. 5. Foul dirty Dwellings. 6. Cellar abodes. 7. Overcrowding of Inmates. 8. Unwholesome Provisions. SANATORY REQUIREMENTS. 1. a. House, surface, and subsoil drainage. b. Stone or asphalte pavement. c. Daily Scavenging. 2. a. Water-closet Apparatus, and suppression of cesspools. b. Trapping and flushing of all gullies and drains. e. Impermeable pipe gutters. 3. a. Arnott chimney openings, and perforated zinc window panes. b. The Charcoal Air filters of Dr. Stenhouse. c. Vent tubes, roof outlets, &c. 4. Continuous high pressure supply. 5. Periodic cleansing and liming. 6. Their abolition. 7. Regulation of numbers by ging Houses' Acts. 8. Systematic Inspection. Other causes, besides, prejudice health: such are the culde-sac streets of Hope Town, and courts of a similar form, which impede the transit of currents of air, and concentrate, and intensify, the emanations evolved. Back-to-back houses too, those without back windows or doors, and others below the levels of the streets, gardens, and courts—all militate against a healthy physical state. In such cases the erasement of an occasional building, or wall "counter openings, additional windows, and open spaces," are the remedies sugested by Mr. Simon. Much mischief, also, is often entailed by using 10 rubbish and road mud to form building sites, the evolutions from which poison the air, and increase the malignancy of zymotic disease. Other sources of illness are the gases arising from night-soil depots, and manufactories of manure, from dust and refuse yards, cow sheds, and dung heaps, cat-gut spinners, paunch dressers, slaughter-houses, &c. But in these,—beyond the employment of "the best practicable means" for their abatement—the privileges of trade interfere and render sanitary improvement uncertain and slow. Some defects you can remedy: others you cannot control. You have full power to cleanse, light, pave, and water the Parish, to ventilate sewers, trap all gully holes, fill up open ditches and substitute drains, to order covered dustbins, and prevent overcrowding, and, if you think fit, to erect public pumps. You can compel owners of property to pave any court, passage, or place which is not a thoroughfare, to provide drains, sinks, water-closet apparatus, and water supply, whenever there is a sewer, lower in level, within 100 feet; can abolish the cesspools, regulate cellar dwellings as to area, drainage and light, and exercise stringent powers over houses about to be built, or rebuilt. The landlords of their own accord may do much, namely: ventilate and limewhite the rooms, furnish drains, dustbins, and water supply, and, so long as the service remains intermittent—covered cisterns or butts. They should also put taps to the pipes to prevent the waste water soaking into the soil, and where there are closet pans, not allow the supply pipe to pass from the house butt, or cistern, into the pan.* It would further conduce to our improvement in health, if the canals were more frequently cleansed, and the interments in the Victoria Park Cemetery were limited to the numbers directed, per acre, in the Burials' Acts. Finally, the establishment of New or Renovated Model Dwellings, Ragged Dormitories, Baths and Wash-houses, would, alike, improve the physique, and morale, of Bethnal Green. * "Butts placed in contact or communication with privics, must rapidly become infectcd by their foulness."—Mr. Simon's Reports, p. 112. 11 6. CORRELATIVE MATTERS. Water Supply. It being indisputably established, by the chemical and microscopical researches of Drs. Thomson and Hassall, that the shallow well waters, in towns, abound in impurities derived from above, and from cesspools and sewers around—one opinion only can be entertained—that these "infusions of filth" are unfit for drinking and culinary purposes, and should only be used for extinguishing fires, watering roads, and flushing sewers and drains. The East London Company, who supply Bethnal Green, furnish a bright colourless water which cxercises no solvent power upon lead.* The analyses of 1851, and those instituted by Professor Hofmann and Mr. Blyth, in the early part of 1856, give the following results:— YEARS. HAEDNESS. SOLID CONSTITUENTS in grains per gallon. Total Permanent Temporary Total Organic Matter Inorganic Matter 1851 15.00 .... .... 23.51 4.12 19.39 1856 13.98 7.53 6.45 22.05 1.09 20.96 In this Table, the terms Permanent and Temporary, as applied to hardness, signify the reduction caused by 5 minutes boiling. By improving the source, and filtering through a bed of sand, the water of the East London Company has undergone a diminution of 3.03 grains, per gallon, of organic matter, and of 1.02 of hardness. When examined microscopically by Dr. Hassall in 1854, it contained "organic matter dead and living, pieces of vegetable tissue, and fragments of granular organic debris." But of the Nine Water Companies, the East London had, with two exceptions,— West Middlesex and New River,—the least organic contamination; * Report of Mr. Taylor to Mr. Simon. 12 and it is on this, that the influence of water in promoting epidemics mainly depends. Hence in the Cholera of 1854, when the Company drew their supply three miles higher up the Lea, a great decrease of mortality (in comparison with that of 1849) occurred in those districts which they supplied, e.g., in our own. Were the Company to employ the softening process of Professor Clark "expelling chalk by chalk," many degrees of hardness, and most of the organic matter would be removed. In the absence of that advantage, boiling, and filtering through animal charcoal, are the most approved means. As to individual allowance, the present intermittent standpipe supply, common to many houses and courts, is decidedly below the requirements of health. In such cases, each standpipe should have a tap, and be on the main. This would, in great measure, supersede its storage in dirty vessels and butts. Provisions. Hitherto, neither complaints nor seizures of provisions have been made. As with drinking waters, so, I believe, with the perishable articles of fish, fruit, and vegetables, much harm is done, in the poorer districts, by costermongers and small dealers, storing their wares under the beds, and in close dirty rooms. In respect of adulteration, it has been suggested by the Select Committee of the House of Commons, that "one or more scientific analysers be delegated by the Board of Health, to whom local authorities might refer any article seized under suspicion of adulteration," and that "these analysers should also undertake to examine any articles sent to them by private individuals." Places of Interment. The Jews' Burial Grounds, which have still a good deal of unoccupied ground, will be finally closed this year. Of the Victoria Park Cemetery, the state of which was noticed 18 in my former Report, many complaints have been made. Government Inspectors have condemned the piling and close packing system as out of all proportion to the space in use. It is said that, on every Sunday, 130 bodies are interred:— that, in fact, 16000 pounds* of mortal matter are added, on that day alone, to the already decomposing mass. So continuous is the dead march down Bethnal Green Road, that it has got the cognomen of the Road to the Grave. According to the Instructions issued by the Secretary of State to guide Burial Boards, the interment rate is 120 bodies, per acre, per annum. By that estimate, the annual interments in the Victoria Park Cemetery ought not to exceed 1440. Slaughtering Places. Having, Gentlemen, informed you, last October, in a special Report, of the condition of each slaughtering place, I have only, on this occasion, to express my admiration of the alacrity displayed, by the several butchers, in carrying out your orders, and my conviction that the improvements effected Trill, equally, conduce to the health of the occupants, and the preservation of the meat. Although we may hope that the day is not distant when abattoirs will be established round London, surrounded by trees,† yet, without doubt, it is possible (where slaughter-houses are isolated, as in Bethnal Green, and when all due requirements are made) to carry on the business, with little injury or offence. Pauper Statistics. At the close of the year 1855, 1265 persons were inmates of the "Workhouse in Bethnal Green. During 1856, there were 2187 Paupers admitted, and 2129 discharged; 48 Children were born—18 legitimate, 30 illegitimate; 251 died; and 615 Vagrants and 46093 Out-door Poor had relief. On December 31st, the inmates numbered 1072; namely, 360 * Leading Article, Lancet, Nov. 8, 1856. †As the Abatttoir of Roule is in Paris. 14 Adult Males, 361 Females, 199 Boys and 152 Girls, and of these, 19 were Idiots, or Imbeciles. At the same date, there were 24 Lunatics at Hanwell; 72 at Colney Hatch; 4 at Peckham; 1 at Camberwell; and 13 at Bethnal House. Habitations of the Poorer Classes. The last subject of my Report—one of deep interest in its bearing on Pauper Statistics, on which, in fact, the amount of our Poor Rates chiefly depends—is the "Internal Life," or the homes of the poorer and industrial classes. If we would strike at the roots of disease—at the prime causes of our death excess, and untimely decease, we must obviate the dangers that many of these miserable dwellings entail. It is not enough, great as are the advantages resulting therefrom, that they have scavenging, drainage, and water: if there be not ventilation within and without; if the courts be culs-desacs, and the houses be also of the cul-de-sac form; if their structural arrangements shut out the light; and especially, if with these, overcrowding occur:—such physical conditions will still war against life. Their atmosphere will be fetid with breath and skin poisons, will generate fever, destroy their adults, and leave the poor orphans to burden our Rates. But,—without a thorough reform of all such pestiferous places as Nova Scotia Gardens with its mountains of house refuse, road mud, offal, and filth;—as the manure baking depots of Digby Street, Globe Lane;—as Elizabeth Place, or Devil's Alley where lately were harboured in 30 small rooms of 10 feet by 6, and 2 sheds, 90 human beings, 2 horses, a dogfancier's dogs, and a goat;—as John's Court where the houses comprise one room in depth, and two rooms in height, and are minus back yards, windows, and doors, where 2 privies, confined in a corner, are almost enough to knock a man down;—as No. 1, Collingwood Street, where an open privy poisons the air, and the ground floor front room derives all its light from 2 small panes of glass; which, for want of a 15 window, the shutters contain;—as No. 10, Mead Street, with its rooms 3 feet lower down than the street, with its covered-in yard and overflowing privy and drain, where there has not been for months any water supply;—as Turville Buildings, Hepworth, Miring, and Nelson Places, Princes', Baker's, Shepherd's Courts, &c., &c.; and the conversion of their sites into better or Model Dwellings,—I know not how they can be adapted to cleanliness, comfort, or health. From the cradle to the grave their inmates "are a dircct money charge upon our funds." 7. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. The data furnished in this and in my former Report show, that comparing area and population, Bethnal Green is, by no means, overcrowded, and that, notwithstanding the rapid increase of its people, health and life have progressed. They show, also, that wherever sewers and drainage have been made, there mortality has most decreased. As we have yet much open ground, and as our new streets will be effectively drained, so, within certain limits, as our numbers grow, the value of life will increase. Hence if we supply our darker spots —"where the fuel is piled, and the spark is there"— with the sanatory remedies that they require, we may hereafter, as Sanitation has effected in the City, reduce our death roll, annually, 2 per 1000. Those remedies I have endeavoured to portray: they are briefly the greatest attainable purification of the soil and air, "the utmost possible improvement of each individual home." By their adoption we shall exalt the standard of life, and in the emphatic words of the Registrar-General, "obtain victories over death and the grave." So, too, shall we wipe out the reproach of 1849, that Cholera was allowed to fall on Bethnal Green as though the name of the pestilence had never been heard.* * Official Circular of Board of Health, Sept. 29, 1849, p. 107. 16 Gentlemen, our future is bright; our death rate last year was but 19 per 1000,—2 only beyond the normal or Lewisham rate, and we have still many foes to combat. Is it not then possible, and may we not hope to descend 2 more—to 17 per 1000, "the zero" of the death scale of Dr. Farr? May we not, too, expect that as in Wellington Street, Old Ford Lane, where, Fever in 1852, caused 11 preventible deaths, and sanatory measures arrested its march, so, that in all Bethnal Green, when likewise improved, the scythe of death will be stayed? This year, your four grand Sewerage Works will, in those favoured districts, prevent Fever, even as Vaccination protects from Small Pox. In another year we shall have constant, exhaustless water supply, and ere many more years elapse, the Great Middle Sewer will tunnel under our road, and purify much of the surrounding subsoil. So, works still progressing—Pestilence will not long "stalk in darkness'' among us, nor, like the fabled Atropos, cut short life's threads ! Be it our pleasing task to labour on in the field, to further the health, and to lengthen the lives of some of the 100,000 people of Bethnal Green. And assuredly, no pursuit can be purer, nothing more Godlike than to give health to man* ! I have the honour to be Gentlemen, With great respect, Very faithfully your's, SAMUEL PEARCE.

Gentlemen, To bring down our transactions to the termination of the first year of our sanitary cycle, I have appended a short summary of the first quarter of 1857. I have done so, because the RegistrarGeneral has recommended the Officers of Health to adopt his tabulation, and to publish in each quarter, uniform returns. To his Table I have added an Appendix to show, in each sub-division, the deathproportions of the most fatal classes of disease, and the ages at which the deaths occurred. During January, February, and March, the births of 513 boys, and of 487 girls, and the deaths of 593 persons were registered in Bethnal Green. The latter numbers exhibit a mortality fewer by 106 than the corresponding months of 1855, but higher by 75 than those of 1856. But although the sum total was more, the epidemic proportion was less, namely 87 against 99, or a percentage of 14.6 The same result obtained throughout Loudon, evidencing that Sanitation has already done good. 153 individuals fell victims to diseases of the respiratory class, 64 to consumption, 40 to hooping cough, and 2 to croup, forming conjointly 43.6 per cent of the total deaths. Grouped together those diseases and the epidemics destroyed 346 persons, or 50 beyond the half of all who died. Affections of the brain and nervous system cut off 54; those of the heart, 9; those of the digestive organs, 37; violence, privation, and other casualties were fatal to 25; and 42 persons died of age. One female, the widow of a dock servant died in the sub-district Church aged 90 years. The deaths of children under the age of 1 constituted 26 per cent of the total deaths; those under 5 about 48, while "in the more distant and rural part of Surrey, the latter do not quite reach 29," If, as Dr, Lyon Playfair says, to die between the ages 20—60 be to perish prematurely, then, in addition to our large infantile loss, out of 593, 148 were untimely deaths. The mean temperature of the quarter was "about the average, nearly 39°, on 9 weeks was above the average" but on "two days in the 5th and 6th weeks, the thermometer fell to 20°" The humidity also "was slightly above the average, remarkable storms of snow and hail occurred in March, and the ranges of the barometer exceeded one inch in each month." I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, with great respect, very faithfully yours, SAMUEL PEARCE, Medical Officer of Health. To the Gentlemen of the Vestry of Bethnal Green, TABLE 1.

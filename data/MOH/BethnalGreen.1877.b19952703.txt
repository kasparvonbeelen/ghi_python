SCAVENGING. The Special Committee, consisting of the members of the Works and Sanitary Committees, to which the subject of scavenging had been referred, recommended that tenders should be invited for the performance of the work for the year ending 10th August, 1878, and that the Committee should be empowered to continue their enquiries as to the best mode of executing scavenging work, with a view of reporting fully on the subject. Tenders were received on the 19th July, and The tender of Mr. Crane for District No. 1, at £1560, The tender of Mr. Irons for District No. 2, at £1599, The tender of Mr. Irons for District No. 3, at £1680, were accepted. £4839 The Special Committee have further considered the subject referred to them, especially with reference to the question whether the Vestry should do the work by men in their own employ, and with their own carts and horses, instead of contracting, and are about to report on the matter. SUNDAY STREET SCAVENGING. The Vestry empowered the Sanitary Committee to hire carts, with horses and men, for the purpose of clearing away the vegetable and other refuse left in the streets on Sunday mornings by costermongers and stall keepers. The Committee, after a fifteen weeks' experiment, 15 reported that the following streets had been cleansed every Sunday morning:— Green-street Fournier-street Mount-street Bacon-street Hackney-road Cambridge-road Brick-lane Bethnal Green-road Thomas-street Turk-street Tyssen-street Columbia-road Mile End-road Hare-street Virginia-row And York-street And that the total cost for the fifteen weeks, including disinfectants and superintendence, was £54 18s. 9d. The Committee recommended that the work should be carried on throughout the year, and that they should be authorized to arrange for contracting for the execution of the work. The recommendation of the Committee was adopted by the Vestry. FOURNIER'S CHARITY. All the applicants were on examination found eligible. The following thirteen were elected and received the gift:— Appleton, John, 37, Menotti-street Baxter, Maria Elizabeth, 27, Squirries-street Carter, Richard, 2, Hare-court, Hare-street Cox, George, 21 Alma-road Delieu, James, 24, Bonner-lane Larcher, Mary Ann, 11, White-street Niall, James, 16, Robert-street, Hart's-lane Oldman, Sarah, 41, Squirries-street Pack, "William, 6, Virginia-row Phillips, Abraham, 118, Gosset-street Poyton, John, 6, George-street, Old Bethnal Green-road Trigg, Sarah, 14, Matilda-street Walters, John, 58, Hare-street LEVERINGTON CHARITY.

The amount required by the Board for the next year is £6533 os. 7d., being £152 3s. 10d. more than the amount of the precept for the past year. SCHOOL BOARD PRECEPT. The amount of the precept for the next year is £6872 1s. 7d., being a decrease of £30 1s. 4d. on the amount of the precept for the past year. NEW CARRIAGEWAY PAVING. After obtaining an estimate by the Surveyor of the cost, the Vestry determined to pave with granite cubes the carriageways of Nottinghamstreet, White-street, Squirries-street, Gosset-street (crossing), and Warner-place; also, Roman-road—from Grove-road to the canal bridge,—the road from Cambridge-road to the west end of Greenstreet, and the margins by the paving laid down by the Tramway Company in Cambridge-road and Cambridge Heath to the respective boundaries of Hackney and Mile End. It was also determined to borrow £20,000 to meet the cost of the proposed work. Application was made to the Metropolitan Board of Works in November for the requisite sanction to borrow the money, and for the Board to advance the amount. The Board gave permission to borrow the sum required, at a rate of interest not exceeding £5 per cent., the principal to be repaid by equal annual instalments within twenty years; but the Board was then unable to make the advance, as the amount which the Board was authorised to advance to Vestries and District Boards during the then present year was all appropriated. In January the Vestry applied again to the Board for the advance. The Board then agreed to make it at £3 15s. per cent., and the Mortgage to that Board was completed, and the money paid to the Vestry, on the 7th March. The work was divided into two sections:— Section 1, consisting of Nottingham, White and Squirries-streets, Gosset-street (crossing), and Warner-place. Section 2, consisting of the Margins of Cambridge-road and 17 Cambridge Heath, the road from Cambridge-road to Green-street, and the part of Roman-road from Grove-road to the Canal Bridge. On the 7th March tenders for executing the Works were received. The tender of Mr. J. J. Griffiths for Section 2, at £12,489, was accepted, and the Tender of Mr. Frederick Wilson for Section 1, at £6942, was accepted subject to enquiries as to his ability to carry out the work and the sufficiency of his sureties. The sureties named by Mr. Wilson did not reply to the request for references, and declined to become sureties. Mr. Wilson, by a letter to the Surveyor, stated he had made a mistake in his tender, and offered to do the work for £560 more than the amount of his tender. He stated to the Clerk that he did not expect the Vestry would entertain such a proposal, and ultimately withdrew his tender. Mr. Griffiths, on being applied to, consented to adhere to his tender of £8016 for section 1., and he accordingly entered into a contract for executing the whole of the work of both sections at £20,505. MORTUARY. At the date of this Report the suit in the Ecclesiastical Court with reference to the Mortuary is standing for hearing. TRAMWAYS. On the 12th April the Vestry resolved to accept the proposal of the Company (mentioned in the last Report) to insert clauses in the Bill then before Parliament providing that without the consent of the Vestry the Company should not lay down lines in Prospect-place, or over Old Ford-road Bridge; and also that if within three years from the passing of the Bill, or within any extended time for laying down the tramways, the Vestry, by themselves or in conjunction with the Metropolitan Board of Works, should widen Prospect-place; the Company should contribute towards the cost of such widening either one-fourth of the cost or a sum of £3000; and the clauses were accordingly inserted in the Act. RAILWAY BILLS. A Bill by the Great Eastern Railway Company for power to make an 18 alteration at the Devonshire-street Goods Station of the line authorised by the Act of last year, was considered, and reported on by the Surveyor; and the alteration being trifling, and not affecting the streets or sewers, it was found unnecessary to take any steps regarding it. A Bill for an Underground Railway from Aldgate to Bow was introduced into Parliament, but was ultimately withdrawn. PUBLIC HEALTH (METROPOLIS) BILL. This Bill, which was introduced by the President of the Local Government Board, proposed to give to that Board extended powers over Vestries and District Boards in the Metropolis. The Bill was referred to a Committee, and on the report of the Committee being presented, the Vestry resolved to present a petition to the House of Commons against the objectionable clauses, and to request the Borough Members to support the petition. The Vestry also resolved to attend a Conference on the Bill, to be held at the Town Hall, Shoreditch. Ultimately the Bill was withdrawn. WATER SUPPLY. The Bills introduced into Parliament by the Metropolitan Board of Works with reference to Water Supply, were considered by the Parliamentary Committee, and delegates were appointed to attend a meeting of delegates from other Vestries and District Boards, convened to consider the Bills. The Vestry passed a resolution in favour of the proposal that the undertaking of the Water Companies should become the property of the Metropolitan Board of Works ; and afterwards, on considering the report of the delegates appointed to attend the Conference, and the report of the Parliamentary Committtee, resolved to oppose the scheme embodied in the Bill of the Metropolitan Board of Works, for obtaining a supply of water from the Counties of Bucks., Surrey, Kent, and Essex. At the date of this report the Bills are still pending. URINALS. Tenders were received from Messrs. Macfarlane and Co., and Messrs. Waller and Co., for providing and fixing in Waterloo-road a urinal for 19 five persons, and the tender of Messrs. Macfarlane and Co., at £49 2s., was accepted. Afterwards a deputation from the inhabitants of Waterlooroad and the neighbourhood presented a memorial to the Vestry objecting to the erection of the urinal, and pressing the Vestry to reconsider its decision. The memorial was referred to the Works Committee for consideration. A motion to rescind the resolution was made on the 28th June, but there not being a majority of two-thirds of the members present, the motion was lost. On the 5th July some inhabitants of houses in and near Waterlooroad attended, and urged further that the resolution to erect the urinal should be reconsidered; and on the 2nd August the Vestry passed a resolution rescinding the resolution ro erect the urinal in the Waterloo-road. A urinal has been erected at the Cambridge Heath end of Hackneyroad; the cost of which, including the cost of delivering and fixing, but exclusive of masons' work and foundations, was £157. The urinal which was purchased for Waterloo-road has been erected in Queen's-road, Cambridge-road, near the Queen's Head Tavern. METROPOLITAN FIRE BRIGADE. The subject of the proposed transfer of the management of the Brigade from the Metropolitan Board of Works to the Metropolitan Police was considered by the Vestry, and the Vestry passed a resolution expressing its concurrence in the views set forth in the Report of the 18th December of the Metropolitan Board of Works, as to the inadvisability of the suggested transfer being made. HOLLYBUSH GARDENS. The state of Hollybush Gardens has been repeatedly before the Vestry, and also the subject of opening the northern end so as to form a street from Bethnal Green-road into Middleton-street. The freeholders and leaseholders were communicated with. The road in the gardens was claimed to be, and clearly is, private property, and the freeholders and principal leaseholders objected to its being made a public road, and to having it opened into Middleton-street. The 20 only result was that one of the principal leaseholders promised (in conformity, it appears, with a covenant in his lease) to put the roadway into proper order, and to keep it so as to prevent water lying on it. SURVEYOR. On the 31st of March, the Vestry passed unanimously a resolution expressing its regret at the loss it had sustained by the unexpected death of Mr. Mundy, the late Surveyor, and its sincere condolence with his widow and family. The Vestry after consideration required that the new Surveyor should devote his whole time to the duties of his office, and that his salary should be £400. That an Assistant Surveyor should be appointed at a salary of £150. Advertisements for candidates were issued. The applications were referred to a committee of the whole Vestry. Six of the candidates for the office of Surveyor, and three of the candidates for the office of Assistant Surveyor, were selected as the most eligible. On the 7th June Mr. William Henry Gathercole was elected Surveyor, and Mr. John Alfred Tharp was elected Assistant Surveyor. SEXTON. In consequence of the death of Mr. Hayes, the late Sexton of St. Matthew's, the Vestry determined that the duties of the Parish Clerk and Sexton should be discharged by one person, and that Mr. Ames, the Parish Clerk, be elected Sexton for the current year, with an additional salary of £10 a year for discharging the duties of Sexton. TREASURER. Mr. Christopher Forrest was elected a Treasurer in the place of Mr. T. F. Bradbrook, who had ceased to be a member of the Vestry. MISCELLANEOUS. Application has been made to the Post Office to open a District Telegraph Office in Bishop's-road. The reply stated that the Postmaster-General found, after making due inquiry, that circumstances 2 I did not warrant the establishment of a Telegraph Office in Bishop'sroad. An application for permission to place a Cabmen's Shelter at the cab stand near the "Salmon and Ball" was considered. Objections were made by the inhabitants of some of the houses near, and after inquiries by the Works Committee, the Vestry decided not to accede to the application. The Vestry represented to the Metropolitan Board of Works that their refusal to permit houses to be brought out, and to allow only one-storey shops to be erected on the forecourts of the houses in Cambridge-road, between the Salmon and Ball Tavern and Parliamentstreet, would prevent probable improvements which might otherwise take place. A Committee of the Metropolitan Board viewed the houses, and now a line of frontage has been defined by the Architect of the Board; and permission will be given to bring out to that line houses to their full height. Application has been made to the Corporation of London asking that Temple Bar might be re-erected in Victoria Park, or some of its approaches. Messrs. Forrest and Hilditch were appointed as delegates to attend a proposed meeting at Mile End, which was to be convened with a view of devising means to obtain the removal of the Hay Market in Whitechapel to some other site, and in January it was referred to a Special Committee to consider as to the removal of the market. The plan of the sewer to be laid down by the freeholders in forming the new street through Wilmot-square to Old Bethnal Green-road, called Mansford-street, as originally prepared, was such as neither the Vestry nor the Metropolitan Board could have approved; but the Vestry took the opportunity of the sewer being formed to secure facilities for the better drainage of the part of the parish north of the Old Bethnal Green-road; and the freeholder agreed, on being paid £200, to construct a sewer at a lower depth and of greater dimensions than would have sufficed for his purpose, and to carry it as far as the Metropolitan Board sewer in Old Bethnal Green-road. A Committee appointed to consider as to the possibility of effecting the extinction of the Composition Rate met, but no suggestions were 22 made, and on the recommendation of the Committee the reference was discharged. The price to be paid by the Great Eastern Railway Company for Goddard's rents, taken under the Company's compulsory powers, has been fixed at £750. The School Board for London, when building their schools in Pritchard's-row, brought out a covered way beyond the building line without the permission of the Metropolitan Board or the Vestry, and the Vestry have required the covered way to be set back to the building line. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk SURVEYOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED FROM LADY-DAY, 1877, TO LADY-DAY, 1878. Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you a Statement of some of the principal works carried out under the supervision of this Department during the past year. The particulars of works included in the first three months of this Report have been supplied by the Assistant-Surveyor (Mr. John A.Tharp), as it will be remembered my term of office commenced at Midsummer. By far the most important branch of works carried out during the past year has been to the sewers, as will be more clearly shewn by the works enumerated below. SEWERS. A new 9 in. and 6 in. pipe drain has been laid in Grove-place, near to the Board Schools, Wolverley-street, at the expense of the School Board for London. The brick barrel sewer in Cambridge-street being found on examination, in a very defective condition, it has been demolished, and a 12 in. pipe sewer substituted, which has been laid to fall both ways, and connected with sewer in York-street, and connections, made therewith from houses which were drained into the old barrel sewer. The brick sewer at rear of houses in Cambridge-road, the centre of which forms the boundary between this Parish and the Parish of 24 Mile End, having fallen in, on examination the brickwork was found very much decayed and past repair. The sewer has therefore been reconstructed between the railway arch and Queen-street at a lower level, and falling both ways passes through Pelican-passage, and is connected with the sewer in Cambridge-road. I am pleased to report that this work, although attended with considerable difficulty and danger, owing to the fact that buildings had been erected immediately over the sewer, has been very satisfactorily carried out by Mr. Finch (contractor to the Mile End Vestry), under the joint superintendence of the Surveyors, and at the joint expense of the respective Parishes. A new 12 in. pipe sewer, about 450 ft. run, has been laid in Salisbury-place, conuected with sewer in Warley-street, and the old barrel drain has been demolished. Connections from the houses have been formed with new sewer. The pipe sewer in Braemar-street has been cleansed and lowered so as to admit of houses in the centre of street being effectually drained. Great inconvenience having been experienced in consequence of the inadequate depth of the pipe sewer in Arundel-street, which discharged itself into the sewer in Selby-street, it has been found necessary to divert the same and lower it into the sewer in Artillerystreet. The old brick barrel sewer in Waterloo-terrace being found so decayed as to be past repair, a new 12 in. pipe sewer has been laid in at a lower level, and connected with sewer in Arundel-street. A manhole was constructed at the junction of these sewers for future cleansing purposes. Plans having been submitted shewing a pipe sewer through the then proposed street on the Remmington Mills' estate, to be known as Mansford-street, negotiations were entered into with the freeholder's surveyors, that on consideration of their constructing a brick sewer of the dimensions 3 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft. 3 in., and at a level admitting of its being carried under the sewer in Old Bethnal Green-road, the Vestry were willing to contribute the sum of £200 towards the additional cost. This work, which has been satisfactorily carried out in 25 accordance with the suggestions of the Vestry, will afford, at the discretion of the Vestry, a means of lowering the sewer in Rushmeadstreet, and the sewers discharging themselves into it. The pipe sewer in Diss-street has been relaid at a lower level, so as to admit of property adjacent being efficiently drained, and has been connected with the sewer in Baroness-road instead of Hassard-street. The brick sewer in Globe-street has been entirely re-pointed in cement. Four hundred and seventy-two loads of sewer deposit have been removed from various sewers and carted away. Fifty-four connections have been made with the Parish sewers for draining private property. The following sewers have been cleansed and repaired where necessary by men in the employ of the Vestry:— Arundel-street Artillery-street Braemar-street Busby-street Brady-street Bonwell-street Coventry-street Columbia-road Chester-street Collingwood-street Cambridge-circus Cambridge-street Church-row Chester-place Cheshire-street Derbyshire-street Duke-street Diss-street Ely-place Felix-street Faith-street Granby-street Glo'ster-gardens Gosset-street Hope-street Hague-street Hague-place Horatio-street Ion-square London-street Little Collingwood-street Morpeth-street Minerva-street Matilda-street Mount-street Moss-street New-street Northampton-street Old Nichol-street Princes-street Palmer's-road Providence-place Selbey-street Southborough-place Satchwell-street Salisbury-place Sydney-street Sclater-street Somerford-street Shipton-street Trafalgar-place Teal-street Temple-street Thomas-passage Turk-street Tagg-street Willow-walk Wellington-place West-street, Brady-street West-street, Green-street 26 PAVING.

On the recommendation of the Works Committee, the Vestry has resolved to pave with Guernsey and Aberdeen granite cubes the undermentioned carriageways:— Section I. to consist of— Nottingham-street White-street Squirries-street Gosset-street (crossings) Warner-place Section II. to consist of— Cambridge-road (margins of tram lines) Green-street (from Cambridge-road to Falcon public-house) Roman-road (Twig Folly bridge to Grove-road) The tender of Mr. Griffiths for section II., and subsequently for section I., has been accepted, and the work is proceeding satisfactorily. Jobbing repairs to foot and carriageways have been carried out in the streets enumerated below by men in the employ of the Vestry:— FOOTWAYS. Artillery-street Abbey-street Brick-lane Bethnal Green-road Boundary-street Brady-street Bellhaven-street Braemar-street Burgoyne-road Cooper's-gardens Cumberland-place Clarkson-street Cambridge-road Columbia-road 27 Collingwood-street Cleveland-street Christopher-street Davis-place Devonshire-street Darling-row Edward-street Fleet-street Fournier-street Fuller-street Green-street Gibraltar-walk Gosset-street Hare-street Hassard-street Half Nichol-street Hart's-lane Hackney-road Hartley-street Hague-street James-street Morpeth-street Middleton-street Nottingham-street Nelson-place Old Ford-road Old Castle-street Pritchard's-road Prospect-place Preston-street Quilter-street Somerford-street St. John-street Swan-street Sclater-street Suffolk-street Sydney-street Turville-street Tyssen-street Thomas-street Virginia-row Viaduct-street William-street White-street Warner-place Whitechapel-road Weaver-street PAVED CARRIAGEWAYS.

The repairs to foot and carriageways, caused by the erection of scaffolding and construction of private drains, have been done by men in the employ of the Vestry at the cost of persons carrying out the work. An improvement has been made in Gascoyne-place by widening the roadway so as to admit of two lines of carriage traffic. The road has been re-paved with the stone removed from Brick-lane, supplemented by some second-hand cubes supplied by the contractor. The footways also have been almost entirely re-paved. This work has been carried out by men in the employ of the Vestry. Grove-place, Wolverley-street, has been entirely paved with Patent Victoria Stone by the contractor to the Vestry, at the cost of the London School Board. STEAM ROAD ROLLER. The carriageways of the following streets have been repaved with broken Guernsey granite and rolled with steam road roller, the roads being previously scored and prepared to receive the granite:— Bonner-road Pritchard's-road Bonner-lane Prospect-place Bishop's-road The carriageway of Approach-road has been re-coated with ballast and rolled with steam roller. LIGHTING. Nesv lamps have been erected as under, viz.:— Column lamp, corner of Rapley-place and Daniel-street. Ditto ditto Type-street and Green-street. Ditto ditto Anglesea-street and Selby-street. Ditto Olga-street. Ditto Corner of Preston-street and Collin's-place. Ditto Three lamps on urinal, Hackney-road. Bracket lamp, Skinner's-court, Prospect-place. Ditto Davis-place. The amount paid to the Gas Light and Coke Company for gas 29 supplied to 773 public lamps and St. John's Church clock, including repairs, &c., was £3582 8s. 2d. The amount paid to Commercial Gas Company for gas supplied to 67 public lamps was £278 8s. 0d. Lamps have been removed from Abbey-place, Wilmot-grove, and St. Peter's-square. RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING STREETS. The streets hereunder have been altered in accordance with the orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works. A register is kept of this work, which shows the old and new numbers, and the altered names:— Number of houses. Globe-street, re-named Globe-road, and re-numbered 65 Antill-road, re-numbered 93 Several patent enamelled iron name plates have been put up in various streets in lieu of the old painted tin ones. Orders have been given for one gross of street name lamp tablets, but up to the present they have not been received. MISCELLANEOUS. The sum of £297 6s. 9d. has been paid to the East London Water Works Company for water used in watering the roads, including the sum of £31 10s. 0d. for use of meters fixed in the various stand posts throughout the Parish. Two new hydrants have been erected; one at the corner of Butlerstreet and Knottisford-street, and one at Gore-road. The hydrant in Grove-road has been removed for the convenience of tramway traffic, and refixed at the expense of the Company at the corner of Groveroad and Thoydon-road. The public urinals in Teesdale-street, Treadway-street, Clare-street, Cabbage-court, Cambridge-road, the ironwork of Twig Folly bridge, the obelisks, Old Ford-road, Grove-road, and Hackney-road, have been re-painted by men in the employ of the Vestry. 30 The cost of water lor Hushing sewers, courts, alleys, &c., amounts to £50 17s. 0d. A "Jennings" patent urinal, of handsome elevation, has been erected in Hackney-road, opposite Cambridge-heath Railway Station. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. H. GATHERCOLE. REPORT ON THE SANITARY CONDITION AND VITAL STATISTICS OF THE PARISH OF Saint Matthew, Bethnal Green, DURING THE YEAR 1877. BY GEORGE PADDOCK BATE, M.D., Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, of Edinburgh; Fellow of the Royal Microscopical Society; and Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of Bethnal Green. LONDON: FORSAITH BROTHERS, PRINTERS, 329, BETHNAL GARDEN ROAD E. 1878. REPORT. Gentlemen, I propose, in the present Report, to place before you the Vital Statistics for the registration year 1877, which terminated on the 31st December last. In doing so I depart from the plan pursued in my last two Reports, which was to include the twelve months ending the 25th of March in each year. In making this change I have not acted without due consideration, for in my first year of office I was anxious to take this course; but I found, from the 25th and 26th Victoria, cap. 102, sec. 43, that Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health are required to present the Annual Report in the month of June, and I considered I had no option to do otherwise than follow the plan pursued by my predecessor. Upon looking further into the Act, however, I find that I am not bound to adhere to the four quarters ending 25th of March, as I previously considered. My attention was more particularly drawn to this by a notice of my last Report in the British Medical Journal. The reviewer in that paper complained that my Report not being for the registration year, it was, therefore, most difficult to make a comparison between it and others, or to correct the death rate for the proportion of deaths in hospitals of the inhabitants of the Parish. The custom of making the Annual Report for the registration year is now almost universal amongst Officers of Health; of its convenience and advisability there can be no doubt; still I did not consider that I should be justified in departing from the custom of my predecessor, Dr. Sarvis, without some good reason; and this reason is, that only now, for the first time since my appointment, am I able to present the Vestry with complete statistical tables of mortality, compiled from 4 the weekly returns of the local Registrars, with which our department is now regularly supplied. These returns are of immense value to us, not only for the purpose of computing statistics; but inasmuch as they give us information of the locality of deaths from contagious diseases, we are enabled to take measures for disinfecting and cleansing the infected premises, and also to cause such sanitary improvements to be carried out as shall, so far as is possible, prevent the recurrence or spread of such disease. The Statistical Tables appended are prepared according to the recommendations of, and upon the forms compiled by, the Society of Medical Officers of Health; they are very much more extensive and complete than any that have, in previous years, been presented by your Medical Officers. The greatest care has been taken in the preparation of these Tables to ensure accuracy. The statistics contained in Tables I., II., and V. in the Appendix are calculated upon the numbers of births and deaths extracted from the Annual Printed Reports of the late Dr. Sarvis, for the eight years, 1869 to 1877. Tables III. and IV. are, as before observed, based upon the returns of the local Registrars, each entry in which, excepting inquest cases and a few others, is a copy of the certificate of the medical practitioner last in attendance upon the deceased person. He is, of course, responsible for the accuracy of his certificate: the Act of Parliament requires the cause of death to be stated to the best of the practitioner's belief and knowledge, and imposes a penalty of forty shillings in case of his refusal to deliver such certificate to any person qualified to demand the same. Now, this duty is performed by the medical profession without fee or reward, and in almost every instance the certificates supply the desired information in a sufficiently well defined manner for statistical purposes; it is, however, to be regretted that a practitioner in this neighbourhood occasionally returns the cause of death as "a complication of diseases," and another gentleman sometimes certifies "chest disease," since in compiling Statistical Tables it is utterly impossible to properly classify such assigned causes of death under their proper headings. As the provisions of the Births' and Deaths' Registration Act are of considerable interest, I subjoin a resumé of the law upon the subject, so far as it refers to the registration of the cause of death. 5 By the 20th section of this Act (37 and 38 Vict., cap. 88) it is enacted that:— "In case of the death of any person who has been attended during his last illness by a registered medical practitioner, that practitioner shall sign and give to some person required by this Act to give information concerning the death, a certificate stating to the best of his knowledge and belief the cause of death, and such person shall, upon giving information concerning the death, or giving notice of the death, deliver that certificate to the registrar, and the cause of death, as stated in that certificate, shall be entered in the register, together with the name of the certifying medical practitioner." It is necessary, under this Act, that the certifying medical practitioner shall be on the medical register, and that he shall have been in attendance during the last illness of the deceased; it is also required that the certificate be under the hand of the registered practitioner himself, and not signed by any deputy, as no other person whatever is authorized by law to sign such certificate in the practitioner's behalf. It is desirable that the medical certificate shall be on the official form issued by the Registrar General, but this is not absolutely necessary, and registrars are not authorised to refuse a medical certificate on the ground of informality, provided it duly states the cause of death, and is properly signed. When no medical certificate is produced, and the Registrar ascertains from the informant that a registered practitioner was in attendance, he must require its production before registering the death, as the refusal by the medical man to deliver the certificate is prima facie evidence that he considers there is something suspicious about the case; but as a certain number of persons die without having any medical attendance during their last illness, the Registrar has not power to refuse to register a death under these circumstances, unless the death was sudden, or occasioned by violence, or neglect, or occurred under suspicious circumstances, in all of which cases notice must be given to the Coroner. During the year 1877 Mr. Humphreys or his deputy held 211 inquests in Bethnal Green; of these 103 were violent deaths, while the remainder occurred under circumstances that called for enquiry. In addition to these, twenty deaths were registered without any medical certificate, of which seventeen were those of infants a few days old, the mothers having been attended by midwives only; the other three were submitted to the Coroner, who, however, did not consider 6 inquests necessary, and the deaths were accordingly registered upon such information as could be obtained from the friends of the deceased, and were respectively entered as old age, phthisis, and childbed (a midwife only in attendance). By the Friendly Societies' Act it is illegal for any registered society to pay any sum of money upon the death of a member, except upon the production of a certificate under the hand of the registrar of deaths, and this certificate the registrar must give for the sum of one shilling. It is also illegal to insure, or pay, on the death of a child under five years of age, any sum exceeding six pounds; or on the death of a child under ten years, any sum exceeding ten pounds. POPULATION. By the Registrar General's plan I estimate the population of Bethnal Green for the middle of the year 1877 at 129,600. The area of the district is 755 acres, and the number of inhabited houses 17,325: this gives a population of 145.1 to the acre, and an average of 7.4 inhabitants to each house. The corresponding density for the whole of London being 7.8 persons to each house and 46.9 to each acre. The following table, prepared for me by Mr. W. W. Burrows, gives the distribution of the houses, workshops, etc., in the various wards of the parish. TABLE A.

The total number of deaths registered during the year from all causes was 2886, but of these 98 were non-residents, that is to say that though actually dying in Bethnal Green they were inhabitants of other parishes, who had applied for treatment and been admitted as in-patients at some of the hospitals within our boundaries ; these 98 deaths must therefore be excluded; but as, on the other hand, a certain number of people belonging to Bethnal Green die in hospitals in various parts of London, it is only fair to add on a proportion of such deaths. 14,805 deaths occurred during the year 1877 in the various public institutions of the metropolis, and as the population for the year was estimated at 3,533,484, we get an Hospital death rate of 4.1 per 1000 persons living, and a proportionate number of 543 for the estimated population of our parish. Only 342 of these deaths, however, were registered in Bethnal Green (after deducting the nonresidents) and 201, the difference between 342 and 543, must therefore be added on, which will bring our corrected number of deaths up to 2989 against 2923, the corrected number for the previous year; the births during the same period being 5169 against 5299 in 1876. The excess of births over deaths is less by 196 in the present year than in 1876, as is shewn by the annexed table:— TABLE B. 1876. 1877. Estimated population in the middle of the year 128,100 129,600 Total Births 5.299 5,169 Total Deaths 2,923 2,989 Excess of Births over Deaths, shewing the natural increase of the population 2,376 2,180 ANNUAL DEATH RATE. Taking these figures as the basis of our calculation, we shew an annual death rate for 1877 of 23.0 per thousand against 22.8 last year 8 the death rate for the whole of London for the corresponding periods being 22.3 for 1876, and 21.9 for 1877. I subjoin a comparative table of the mortality for this Parish and the whole of London:— TABLE C. London. Bethnal Green. March Quarter 23.6 22.3 June „ 22.2 24.0 September ,, 19.4 23.1 December ,, 22.4 22.7 As will be seen, this death rate of 23 per thousand is higher than the general rate for the whole of London, and it is also an advance on our own death rate for last year; but, as previously stated, this is the first Annual Report for this Parish in which a true correction has been made in the death rate. It is no use blinking matters, and making everything as rose-coloured as possible; we want to know exactly how we stand, and not how we should like to be. On the old plan of calculation our death rate for the year, after excluding nonresidents, would shew only 21.5, or, by including them, as is commonly done by Health Officers, to compensate for the deaths of parishioners in Hospitals, and at other places beyond the limits of the district," 22.2, neither of which is probably as correct as the larger rate shewn above. This, moreover, is considerably below the collective rate for the eastern districts of the metropolis, which was 24.4. ANNUAL BIRTH RATE. The births during the year were 5,169, or 1 to every 25 of the population, giving a rate of 39.8 per 1000 persons living; the rate for the whole of London, for the corresponding period, being 36.1, a difference of 37 per 1000. DEATHS OF INFANTS, (Under one year of age). Of this number of 5,169 children, only 4,370 attained the age of one year, 799 having died under twelve months of age, being at the rate 0f 154.5 per thousand births, or 6.1 per thousand population; in other 9 words, out of every thirteen children born two die before the other eleven are twelve months old. The rate for London, for the corresponding period, was 14.6 per thousand. The largest number of these deaths were, from Measles, 32; Whooping Cough, 31; Diarrhœa, 63; Tales Mesenterica, or Consumption of the Bowels, 41 ; Acute and Chronic Hydrocephalus (Water on the Brain), 40; Convulsions, 101 ; Bronchitis and Pneumotiia, 119; Premature Birth, 53 ; Atrophy and Debility, 144 ; Malformations of various kinds, 19 ; amongst the violent deaths it is to be noted that no less than 46 were from Suffocation, and though one only was returned as homicide, many must have been the result of sheer carelessness on the part of the mothers, or other persons having charge of the infants. DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN, (Under five years of age). Out of the 2,886 deaths registered in the Parish 1,426, or nearly one half were young children under five years of age, a mortality on the estimated population of iro per thousand. DEATHS OF OLD PEOPLE, (Over sixty). 578 deaths were registered amongst people over 60 years of age, a rate of 4.4 per thousand population ; among these may be mentioned an old lady aged 104 years, at 69, Cleveland Street, and a pensioner aged 86 years, who was present at the Battle of Waterloo. The registered cause of death in both cases was "old age." Class I.—ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths in this Class, which includes the four orders —Miasmatic, Enthetic, Dietic, and Parasitic—was 615, of which number 471 were young children. SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The registered deaths from the seven principal diseases of this Class during the year have been 521, against 436 for last year, an increase of 85. The numbers of each are shewn below, contrasted with the previous year. 10 TABLE D. 1876. 1877.

This gives a Zymotic death rate of 4.4 per thousand, against 3.5 for all London. The Zymotic rate, excluding the Hospital deaths, was 4.0, against a similarly uncorrected rate of 3.4 for last year. For the following return I am indebted to the courtesy of W. F. Jebb, Esq., the Clerk to the Board of Management of the Metropolitan Asylums' District. TABLE E. METROPOLITAN ASYLUM DISTRICT.

The disease shewing the greatest increase was Small Pox. The number of cases reported to us during the year (including deaths) was 468 ; of these 230 were removed to Hospital, of whom 41 died. The remaining cases either came to our knowledge too late in the course of the disease for removal, or else declined to submit, and as the surroundings of the patients were not such as would, in the present state of the law, justify our resorting to compulsion, legal proceedings were not taken. Of the deaths in Hospital I have been able to obtain no particulars; but of the 47 in the parish 25 were under five years of age, 16 of these being under two years. With the exceptions to be presently mentioned, only three deaths were certified as vaccinated; 27 were returned as unvaccinated; of the remainder the medical certificates gave no information; in the 27 unvaccinated cases I have included an infant upon whom vaccination was performed a few days before the Small-pox eruption appeared, and upon whom, therefore, the protective influence of the operation had not time to exert its power; it may therefore be fairly classed as unvaccinated. Of the fatal cases, registered in Bethnal Green, thirteen occurred in the first quarter of the year, ten in the second, one in the third, and four in the fourth. This mortality corresponded with the prevalence of the disease, which had steadily declined during the first three quarters of the year, and shewed an increase in November and December. The following table shews the age distribution of the fatal cases registered in this parish:— 12 TABLE G. Under three months. 0—1 1—2 2-5 5—15 15-25 25—35 Vaccinated 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 3 Not Vaccinated 3 4 3 7 10 0 0 27 Not stated 2 1 3 2 2 1 6 17 Totals 5 5 6 9 14 1 7 47 With regard to the cases of Small-pox treated in Hospital, I extract the following information from the report of Dr. Collie, the Medical Superintendent of the Homerton Fever Hospital:- The Hospital was opened for the treatment of Small-pox on the 8th of December last, and from that time until the 12th of May, when it was closed, 915 cases of that disease were admitted, and 50 cases of other diseases. Of the former, 173 died, a mortality of 18.8 per cent. Dr. Gayton, the Medical Superintendent of the Small Pox Hospital, States that:— From the 1st of January, 1877, to the 31st of December, 1877, 1,935 Patients were admitted; of these 1,471 were discharged recovered; 328 died, and there remained under treatment the last day of the past year 136. The total mortality, therefore, for the 12 months, of the completed cases, is 18 23 per cent. From the return previously alluded to I gather that 180 of these patients were removed from this parish, of whom 29 died. From Mr. Jebb's return, it will be seen that 50 cases were removed from this parish; twelve of whom have since died. The Registrar General, in one of his recent weekly returns, speaking of this eminently preventible disease, and referring to its prevalence in London while almost absent from the provinces, has the following note:—"There must be something radically wrong in the treatment of the epidemic. Is the Vaccination Act steadily carried out ? Have the cases, said to be vaccinated, been effectively vaccinated ? Is the isolation of patients during and after attack carefully carried out? There are Hospitals, and yet people die of Smallpox in these exceptional numbers." The first question may be answered by saying that though the Vaccination Act is carried out, yet numerous people evade its provisions; and again, that the Act itself is not adequate as it does not make re-vaccination compulsory. It must also be confessed that there is a great deal of bad, that is to 13 say, inefficient vaccination done. Medical men in some instances, unfortunately, allow themselves to be influenced by their patients, and instead of producing four or five good vesicles, perhaps cause only two or three imperfect ones. Statistics clearly shew that the rate of mortality from Small-pox in persons who have not been vaccinated is about 50 per cent., whilst amongst vaccinated persons • it is 13 percent, and that this 13 per cent is reduced still lower in proportion to the efficiency of the vaccination, whilst deaths amongst the efficiently re-vaccinated are almost unknown. Dr. Collie, in reporting upon the 915 cases of Small-pox treated in the Homerton Fever Hospital during the five months in 1877, for which period that institution was open for the reception of patients suffering from this disease, states:— (1) That the unvaccinated died at the rate of 53 per cent. ; (2) that the badly vaccinated died at the rate of 26 per cent. ; (3) that the fairly well vaccinated died at the rate of 2.3 per cent, ; and (4) that but one death occurred in any person under 16 years of age who showed two good cicatrices of vaccination, and after 16 only three such persons died. Dr. Gayton, in reporting upon the patients admitted into the Homerton Small-pox Hospital from the 1st of February, 1871, when the institution was first opened, till the 31st of December last, has the following statements:— The great contrast between the Vaccinated and the Unvaccinated is unmistakable and incontrovertible, and the same remark holds good as regards the vaccinated also, the differences in the latter being that in some of them the disease is of a mild form, in others most severe, sometimes terminating in death. Thus as regards the 183 having one good mark, 19 died; of 461 with two good marks, 17 died; of 331 with three good marks, 10 died; of 222, with four or more good marks, 4 died ; giving an average rate of mortality of 10.38 per cent., 3'68 per cent., 3.02 per cent., and r8o per cent, respectively; or taking all good cicatrices together, whether they be one, two, three, four, or more, we find that only 3.57 per cent. die. With imperfect marks there were 2,165 cases, of whom 247 died, making the mortality 11.40 per cent., the average mortality being, with one cicatrix, 15.93 per cent. ; with two cicatrices, 11.52 per cent., and with three cicatrices, 7.90 per cent., and with four or more cicatrices, 5.75 per cent. Of those stated to have been vaccinated, but without evidence (that is with no visible marks) 674 have come under notice, of whom 194 died, or at the rate per cent, of 28.78 ; and lastly, 1,243 were confessedly unvaccinated, and of these 574 died, or at the rate of 46.17 per cent. With regard to vaccination the same gentleman says:— That one only amongst the large number of nurses and others who have been occupied here (and in her case the operation was neglected) should have contracted the disease is, or should be, convincing proof of its great and almost prophylactic influence. 14 Dr. Gayton has further informed the Registrar General that since the hospital was opened, more than seven years ago, 367 nurses and others have been engaged in the work of the hospital, and, with the solitary accidental exception mentioned, re-vaccination has been an indispensable condition of employment, unless the applicant had had Small-pox or had already been re-vaccinated. The result has been that not one of these has contracted Small-pox while there employed: I am reluctantly compelled to state, that it is my firm conviction that the present plan of carrying out the provisions of the Vaccination Act is inefficient. All Vaccination, by whomsoever performed, should be certified, after inspection, by a public vaccinator only, and his instructions should be to grant two classes of certificates. Those not having sufficiently good marks, to be placed in the first class, should only be granted a provisional certificate with the understanding that they should be submitted to a second vaccination in a year or two, as the protective influence of an imperfect vaccination rapidly wears away, and the operation must be repeated to insure immunity from Small Pox. As to the second question, there is no doubt that the isolation of patients affected with the disease under consideration is most imperfect. In the existing state of the law, people are practically allowed to exercise their own option as to removal to the Small Pox Hospitals; the only cases in which the Sanitary Authorities can interfere are where there arc more than persons of one family inhabiting a room, or where the person subject to the disease is improperly lodged. Removal should be made compulsory by law in all cases of infectious disease, when the means of isolating the affected person are not satisfactory to the Medical Officer of Health ; and in disputed cases proceedings might be taken at the Police Court before a Magistrate, whose order for immediate removal to a hospital should be carried out without delay. Vigorous proceedings of this kind would soon cut short an epidemic, and many valuable lives would be saved. While considering the manner of dealing with infectious diseases, I may as well refer to the whole subject of Hospital accommodation for such cases, and I am happy to say that there is some probability of a speedy and satisfactory settlement of this most important matter. As before mentioned, the powers of the Sanitary authorities are 15 extremely limited, and had it not been for the establishment of the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board we should have been in a very much worse position than we are ; and I must here thankfully acknowledge the great help and assistance we have received in dealing with the present epidemic, not only from the Managers of the Asylums' Hospitals, but from the Officers of the Board of Guardians of this Parish. Many of the persons that were removed were of course not paupers, and the Guardians would have been perfectly justified in refusing to take charge of them; but no question of this kind has, within my knowledge, been raised, and all persons suffering from infectious Fever or Small Pox have been removed to an Hospital, except those refusing to submit to such removal. But the only legal mode by which persons can obtain admission into these Hospitals is by an order signed by the Relieving Officer or the Master of the Workhouse, and a certificate of a District or Workhouse Medical Officer. Much valuable time is thus lost in obtaining the attendance of the Poor Law officials, and getting the necessao' forms made out and signed. It would be a very much better plan, and would save much of the time of the already fully occupied District Medical Officers, if the certificate of any properly qualified medical man were accepted by the Hospital Authorities as sufficient for this purpose. Some suggestions for the treatment of Small Pox epidemics in the (previously referred to) report of the Managing Committee of the Homerton Fever and Small Pox Hospitals are of such importance that I give them in extenso:— Small Pox lias very seriously disturbed tlie health and comfort of the dwellers of London twice during the past seven years: it has not only destroyed a large number of lives, which might have been saved, but has put the Ratepayers to an immense expense for the maintenance of Patients in the Hospitals. Notwithstanding these deplorable results, and the lessons they teach, the same state of things is allowed to continue year after year, no measures of a comprehensive character, suited to the wants of this vast Metropolis, being taken to arrest the ravages of the disease, beyond the mere sending of 50 or 60 per cent, of the cases to the Hospitals for Paupers, while the remaining cases are permitted to remain in their own homes, spreading the infection in every direction, and thus keeping the epidemic alive. The certainty of the recurrence of Small Pox epidemics, unless steps are taken for improving the measures now adopted for preventing Small Pox, and for dealing with it when it breaks out in a severe form, demands early and earnest consideration by the Legislature, and by the Public Health Authorities. With regard to the measures which might be taken in these matters, there is little need for the Committee to refer to the subject of primary vaccination, as they believe that the Vaccination Acts in this respect are working satisfactorily, and are 16 having beneficial results; but the Committee consider it their duty to draw serious attention to the question of re-vaccination. The dangers, misery, and expense attendant upon the neglect of such a simple precaution as re-vaccination, as well as the certainty of its protective power, are yearly becoming more apparent, and the mclancholy spectacle afforded by the array of figures appended hereto, lends strength to the opinion of the Committee that re-vaccination at or just before puberty of those who have been vaccinated in infancy, especially of those cases in which there is evidence that the operation was not efficiently or successfully performed, should be made compulsory. The necessity for such an addition to the Vaccination Laws, and for making more effective regulations for the treatment of Small Pox and other epidemics, becomc more and more evident as each year adds to the Small Pox and Fever Statistics, and enlarges the experience gained at the several Hospitals. The Committee suggest that such regulations should embrace :— Periodical House to House Visitation, to ascertain if the inhabitants have been vaccinated or re-vaccinated ; Hospital accommodation for Non-Pauper Cases ; Removal to Hospital of Cases which cannot be effectively isolated ; and The Registration of Infectious Diseases (i.e., notice to be given by every Medical Practitioner to the Health Officer of the District, of cases of infectious disease, so that precaution may be taken to prevent its spread). All of which if made compulsory would, the Committee believe, tend to prevent Small Pox epidemics recurring so frequently, or, at all events, to obviate this dreadful scourge spreading so rapidly and extensively as it has done hitherto. (Signed) JAMES BARRINGER, Chairman of the Committee. The following important correspondence upon this matter, though not coming within the year 1877, bears directly upon the subject, and is therefore inserted here:— "The Metropolitan Asylum District, 37, Norfolk Street, Strand, London, April 1st, 1878, W.C. Dear Sir,—Referring to my circular letters of the 26th February and the 20th June, 1877, transmitting copies of Reports of the Committee for General Purposes of this Board upon the subject of providing Hospital accommodation for non-paupers when suffering from contagious diseases, I have been directed by the Managers to forward for the information of your Vestry the accompanying copy of a Memorial which the Managers have recently received from the Limehouse Board of Works, upon the subject in question, together with a copy of a Report thereon of the Committee for General Purposes, to whom such Memorial was referred by the Managers. I have also been directed to request that the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bcthnal Green, will be good enough to inform the Managers as to how far they agree with the Limehouse Board of Works in the views which they have enunciated, and upon which they have memoralized the Managers. I am, dear Sir, yours faithfully, W. F. JEBB, Clerk. To R, Voss, Esq., Vestry Clerk, St. Matthew, Bethnal Green." 17 TO THE METROPOLITAN ASYLUM DISTRICT BOARD. The Memorial of the Board of Works for the Limehouse District Sheweth— That your Memorialists are the Sanitary Authority for the Limehouse District, which comprises the Parish of Limehouse, the Hamlet of Ratcliffe, and the Parishes of Shad well and Wapping, and under certain circumstances such Authority has power to remove persons suffering from contagious disease to Hospital. That in the winter of 1876.77, and again in the winter of 1877.78, there were a considerable number of Small Pox cases in your Memorialists' district, and most of the Pauper cases were removed to the Hospitals belonging to your Board. That during the Epidemics some persons who were not Paupers fell victims to the disease, and much danger resulted to other persons from their non-removal to Hospital. That although the Sanitary Act of 1866 confers powers upon the Sanitary Authorities to provide Hospital accommodation for Non-Pauper cases, many almost insurmountable obstacles present themselves to such a provision being made, the principal being the enormous expense, and the serious result to many localities if all the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis purchased sites and erected Hospitals for their respective districts, also the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of procuring suitable sites for 39 Hospitals, it being useless to hope for anything like joint action of the several Sanitary Authorities, or of any amalgamation of districts, considering the differences of opinion which exist on the matter. That if each of the Sanitary Authorities of the 39 several districts were to build a Hospital of its own, such Hospital might not be required perhaps for years together, and although removable Non-Pauper cases are comparatively-few, the Buildings and a Staff must be kept up with all appliances, necessitating a very large annual expenditure for each district, without any corresponding benefit or use. That in the winter of 1876.77 your Memorialists endeavoured to provide an Hospital by hiring a Building at Bromley belonging to the Guardians of the Stepney Union, but in this they failed. That your Memorialists, having given the matter full consideration, have come to the conclusion that the most practicable way of overcoming the difficulty in providing Hospital accommodation for Non.Pauper cases in each district, would be for the Metropolitan Asylums District Board, who already have the necessary Staff and appliances, to make arrangements, upon the request of the Sanitary Authorities, to receive any person not in receipt of Parish relief whom the Sanitary Authorities might require to have removed to Hospital, and that the Asylums Board should provide a separate Department for the accommodation of such cases, so that they could be kept distinct from Pauper Patients. That the Sanitary Authorities should pay to your Board for the accommodation provided for Non-Pauper cases by an annual payment, whether such accommodation is required or not, or by a fixed sum for each Patient sent. Your Memorialists trust that your Board will agree with them as to the importance of the subject, and that upon consideration your Board may determine that the views of your Memorialists should be carried into effect. The Seal of the Board of Works for the Limehouse District, affixed in the presence of (Signed) THOS. W. RATCLIFFE, Clerk to the Board. 18 METROPOLITAN ASYLUM DISTRICT. Report ok the Committee for General Purposes. 1. 18th March, 1878. 2. Under the reference to them of the 9th instant, your Committee have considered the memorial of the Board of Works for the Limehouse District "as to providing accommodation in the Asylum Board's Hospitals for persons suffering from contagious diseases who are not in receipt of parochial relief." The Managers are aware that this subject has engaged their attention for some time past. The question for providing Hospital accommodation for Patients of the Non-Pauper class was first brought officially under the notice of the Managers by a letter dated 27th December, 1876, from the Vestry of St. Marylebone, calling attention to the want which then existed, as it does now, of proper Hospital accommodation for the class referred to. In reporting to the Managers upon this letter on the 13th January, 1877, your Committee expressed their opinion that "the necessary powers for the reception and treatment of such cases should be vested in some Central Authority charged with the responsibility thereof." The matter, however, did not rest here, for during the following month (February) a letter upon the same subject from the Vestry of St. Mary, Newington, was referred by the Managers to your Committee, who, in reporting thereon, summarised the conclusions at which they had unanimously arrived, as follows:— (a) That such provision could be best made in a comprehensive and systematic manner by one Central Authority acting for the whole Metropolis, not only for Pauper Patients, but for other classes desirous of Hospital accommodation. (b) That such Central Authority should not be merely a Department of Poor Law Administration, but should have the powers of the Sanitary Acts conferred upon it. (c) That either the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be merged into such Central Authority, or should itself be that authority, in which case its constitution should be altered and adapted to its enlarged duties and responsibilities. Your Committee explained, in a subsequent report, that they did not for a moment contemplate that the proposed Central Authority should supersede or interfere with the existing Vestries and District Boards in the ordinary and important duties which devolve upon them, but merely that it should have such powers of the Sanitary Acts conferred as would enable it to deal efficiently with all cases of epidemic infectious diseases occurring in the Metropolis. In adopting the Report which embodied the above conclusions, the Managers directed that a copy thereof should be sent to the Local Government Board and their careful attention solicited thereto, and farther that a copy of such Report should be transmitted to each of the Sanitary Authorities and Medical Officers of Health in the Metropolis, with an invitation to communicate their opinions thereon to the Managers. This was done, and the purport of the various replies received from these authorities, showing some diversity of opinion, was communicated to the Managers by your Committee on the 16th June last. During the last Session the attention of the Managers was directed to a " Bill to consolidate and amend the Law relating to Public Health in the Metropolis," which was then before Parliament, and as ccrtain of its clauses appeared to affect materially the duties of the Managers, your Committee were deputed to seek, and 19 they obtained, an interview with the President of the Local Government Board with reference thereto. At such interview the difficulties set forth in the memorial of the Board of Works for the Limehouse District were discussed; and subsequently the Managers, upon the recommendation of your Committee, suggested to the Local Government Board that certain clauses, numbers 56 and 64 of the Bill, should be amended by making "it incumbent upon all Local Authorities either to provide the requisite Hospital accommodation for their districts, or failing their so doing within a specified time, to contract with the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District for the reception into their Hospitals of persons other than paupers who may be suffering from contagious or infectious diseases." The withdrawal of the Bill subsequent to its second reading, however, left this allimportant question in abeyance. It will be seen from the foregoing that the subject upon which the Limehouse Board of Works have memoralised the Managers has already been fully considered and dealt with, and that the Managers used their best endeavours to obtain through the Local Government Board the requisite authority to receive into their Hospitals, and if necessary, powers to provide additional accommodation for, Patients other than those of the Pauper class. It now rests with the several Sanitary Authorities either collectively or individually, to take the matter up and deal with it as they may think best. Your Committee recommend that a copy of this Report be sent to the Limehouse District Board of Works as a reply to their memorial. (Signed) EDWIN H. GALSWORTHY, Chairman. MEASLES. Measles was very prevalent, and caused 142 deaths (the highest number in the zymotic class), all, with the exception of ten, amongst children under the age of five years. It is very much to be regretted that people do not look upon this disease from a sufficiently serious point of view; indeed, occasionally, they even put other children in the sick room, in order that they may take the disease and "get it over." Parents are also not sufficiently careful to protect the convalescent patient from the chance of taking cold. It must be borne in mind that, though the deaths from simple uncomplicated measles are extremely few, the inflammatory chest affection, so commonly accompanying the disease, often leads to a fatal result. SCARLATINA. Scarlatina comes next in the order of fatality, causing 93 deaths. Many of these, however, were from the subsequent kidney affection, which is always so very likely to follow the acute disease, and which is also said to be more frequent after a slight than a severe attack. No child or person having been the subject of 20 Scarlatina should be allowed to go out, or to be otherwise exposed to the chance of a chill, so long as the process of desquamation or peeling is going on; as not only is kidney inflammation likely to arise under these circumstances, but the person is also capable of communicating the disease to others, and the same may be said of all other acute zymotic diseases which are followed by this process of shedding the epidermis, or outer layer of the skin. FEVER. Fever caused 38 deaths against 54 in 1876; of these five were Typhus, 22 Enteric, and 11 Simple Fever. To these, however, must be added the 10 Hospital deaths (sec table E), bringing up the total to 48. The number of cases of Fever of all kinds reported to us during the year was 225, of those removed 32 were obliged to be taken to the Stockwell Fever Hospital, as the Ilomerton Fever Hospital was being used for Small-pox cases ; this latter institution, however, after proper cleansing and disinfection, was re-opened for the reception of Fever cases on the 27th of September last, and from this date to the end of the year 1877, 18 patients were admitted from Bethnal Green, 10 of these had Enteric Fever, four Scarlatina, three Simple continued Fever, and one was a case of some disease other than Fever. The ten deaths were equally divided between the two Hospitals. WHOOPING COUGH. Whooping Cough was much less prevalent, and caused 89 deaths, against 120 last year, all the deaths from this disease, except three, were amongst young children. DIARRIICEA. Diarrhoea caused 95 deaths against 114 last year; the diminished prevalence of this disorder was probably owing to the temperate summer. 82 of the deaths were registered in the September quarter of the year. Of the total deaths, 87 were amongst young children, 52 of these being infants between the ages of three and twelve months, a somewhal significant fact when one considers that between these two periods of a child's life it is most often crammed with improper food. 21 CHOLERA. Cholera is credited with seven deaths ; but I have no reason for supposing that these cases were of the Asiatic type, they were probably what would be more correctly described as Choleraic Diarrhoea. OTHER ZYMOTIC DISEASES. Only two deaths were registered as from Childbed Fever. Erysipelas causd 13 deaths, Carbuncle 4, and Croup the very large number of 31, all except one being amongst children under the age of five years. To Rheumatism only three deaths are credited, those from the heart affection so commonly following Rheumatic Fever have been classed as heart disease. Enthetic Diseases.—Syphilis was the cause of twelve deaths, and as all occurred under the age of two years, the disease was, in all probability, transmitted from the parents. Dietic Diseases.—Privation caused three deaths, Want of Breastmilky five. To Alcoholism only seven are credited (five of which were Delirium tremens), but this small number does not represent anything like the true proportion, as many cases of kidney, liver, and brain disease, are undoubtedly remotely due to the abuse of alcohol, and though this fact may not appear in the medical certificate, it is undoubtedly too true. Within the last few years a steady reactionary wave has set in against even the moderate use of alcohol. Like all other reactions this is probably excessive, and will, in process of time, find its own level. We may, however, safely conclude that alcohol is not a necessity for a healthy existence, it is either a luxury or a medicine, and is on the whole infinitely more potent for evil than for good, and though occasionally a valuable and almost indispensable servant, it is a dangerous friend and a deadly master. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASE. The two orders, Diathetic and Tubercular, included under this head, are accountable for 576 deaths. Order I.—Diathetic causing 63 deaths, all, except four, amongst persons over the age of fifteen years. The four infantile deaths from Mortification call for some special remark : two were cases of sloughing of the abdominal walls, commencing at the umbilicus, and occurred 22 in new-born children; of the other two I have no particulars, except that they were under the age of three months. Order II.—Tubercular. The various diseases under this head were accountable for 513 deaths, 322 of which were from Phthisis alone. Of this disease, which has the highest mortality of any, 72 were registered in the first quarter of the year, 88 in the second, 80 in the third, and 82 in the fourth; in these numbers are included the deaths in the Victoria Park Hospital. The death of an infant under three years of age was certified as Phthisis. I have grouped this under the head of Scrofula. The total deaths from Tubercular diseases, exclusive of Hydrocephalus, were 415, being a mortality of 3.2 per thousand population, or nearly fourteen per cent, of the whole number of deaths from all causes. Hydrocephalus—under which is included Tubercular meningitis, the acute, and almost invariably fatal, form of this disease—caused 98 deaths, 93 of which were among children under the age of five years, 68 of whom were under two years. Tabes Mesenterica, or Consumption of the Bowels, another children's disease, caused 72 deaths, 66 of which were amongst children under five years of age, 39 of whom were infants under one year. Class III.—LOCAL DISEASES. The deaths in this group, which is the largest and most comprehensive of the six Classes, number 1,136; 455 of which were amongst children under five years of age. Order I.—Nervous System, causing 329 deaths ; of these Apoplexy, which is a disease of advanced life, caused 45, all over the age of 35 years ; Paralysis, usually a symptom or sequel of other, and often obscure, affections of the nervous system, caused 30 deaths, all (except one child) amongst persons over 35 years. To Insanity are credited 24 deaths, mostly among patients in the Bethnall House Asylum, a large number being cases of General Paresis. Epilepsy caused 12 deaths; other Brain Diseases, 65 ; and Convulsions—mostly a children's disease,—133, all, except three, being under five years of age. The deaths from the Convulsive diseases of children, a group including Hydrocephalus, Infantile Meningitis, Convulsions, and Teething, caused 246 deaths, a mortality of 1.8 per thousand 23 Iation, or 8.2 per cent, of the total number of deaths from all causes. Order II.—Organs of Circulation, causing 121 deaths, all, except one, over the age of five years. The 113 deaths from Heart Disease include several which were complications of Rheumatic Fever. Order III.—Respiratory Organs. Total deaths, 547: of these Laryngitis was the cause of 14 deaths; Pulmonary Disease, other than Phthisis, 533, a mortality of 41 per thousand population, or 17-8 per cent, of the total deaths from all causes; of these Bronchitis caused 286, and Inflammation of the Lungs, 192. The mortality from diseases of this Order, being much affected by temperature, was, as usual, very unequally distributed over the four quarters of the year, the first and fourth shewing the highest. The following Table is an analysis of the deaths from all diseases of the respiratory organs, except Phthisis:— TABLE H. Quarter ending Deaths of Children under five years. Adults. Elderly Persons over fifty-five. Total. Mean Temperature.

Order IV.—Digestive Organs.—The diseases of these organs caused 84 deaths; of these Liver Disease, including Hepatitis and Jaundice, caused 30, all over the age of 35 years, except three infants a few weeks old. Enteritis and Peritonitis each caused 14 deaths; Ulceration of the Bowels, 6; Stricture of the same, 4; and various diseases of the Stomach, 3. Order V.—Urinary Organs.—Total deaths, 42; of these Bright's Disease caused 19; Diabetes, 8; Inflammation of the Kidneys, 3 Stone in the Bladder, 1. Order VI.—Organs of Generation.—Total deaths, 6; made up of Ovarian Dropsy, 2; and various diseases of the Uterus, 4. 24 Order VII.—Organs of Locomotion.—Various affections of the Joints caused 3 deaths. Order VIII.—Integumentary System.—Total deaths, 8; three of which were from Abscess, and one each from Ulcers and Skin Disease. Class IV.—DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASE. Order I.—Diseases of Children.—Dentition caused 19 deaths ; 53 children died through being prematurely born ; 6 others had Cyanosis, or Blue Disease, a peculiar condition of things, arising from some deficiency in the construction of the heart, which allows a mixed circulation of arterial and venous blood ; 5 had Spina Bifida, which is a malformation of the spine, and 10 others had various Deformities which, with one exception, prevented their living beyond the age of twelve months. Order II. Adults.—Childbirth; although only 2 deaths were registered as from Childbed Fever, 12 others were entered as Childbirth, which includes Hemorrhage, Exhaustion from Prolonged Labour, Metritis, Puerperal Convulsions, &c., making 14 deaths in all. Now, in the year 1877, 5,169 live births were registered, but as no record of still-born children is, in this country, allowed to be made, either in the register of births or deaths, we cannot ascertain the exact number of children born ; we must, therefore, seek for our information in another direction, and ascertain the proportion of live births to dead births, and raise the numbers accordingly. In the fifth Report of the Guy's Hospital Lying-in Charity, from 1863 to 1875, by Dr. Galabin, there is the following statement:— The total number of women attended during the twelve years was 23,591. The total number of children born was 23,811 ; of these 22,838, or 95.92 per cent., were born alive; 973, or 4 08 per cent., were still-born. Taking these figures as the basis of our calculation, the corresponding proportions of still births to the registered number of live children born in Bethnal Green would be 233, which, added to 5,169, brings up the total of children born to 5,402, and deducting one per cent, for plural births, the remainder 5,348 gives the number of women delivered in Bethnal Green for 1877. As before mentioned, 14. deaths from the various diseases and accidents consequent on labour were registered during the same period, which shews a mortality of 2.6 per thousand deliveries, which, considering that a large number of the women were attended during their confinements by midwives, is a very low rate. 25 Order III. Old People.—Old Age was the registered cause of 183 deaths, a large number of which happened in the Workhouse Infirmary. Class V.—VIOLENT DEATHS. These number 101, and were, with two exceptions, returned by the Coroner. Suffocation caused 48 deaths, of which no less than 46 were amongst infants under one year of age. A large number of these were what is popularly known as "overlaid," a good many happening on Saturday nights, when the parents probably indulging in a heavy supper, with or without an extra allowance of beer, afterwards go to bed with the infant between them ; presently the little thing slips down beneath the bed clothes, and not being able to get any fresh air, soon suffocates, and is found in the morning, dead. Fractures and Contusions caused 21 deaths ; Drowning, 8 ; Foison, 3 ; and Incised Wounds, 1. Twelve deaths were Suicidal, and one was Homicide. CAUSES NOT SPECIFIED. In five instances the cause of death was returned in such an indefinite manner as to render proper classification impossible. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. 440 deaths occurred in the various public institutions in this parish ; of these 329 occurred in the workhouse (193 males, 136 females), 76 in the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest (49 males, 27 females), and 32 in Bethnall House Lunatic Asylum (15 males, 17 females).

REGISTRATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. As the result of some correspondence between Dr. Dudfield, the Medical Officer of Health for Kensington, and the School Board for London, instructions have been sent to all the Superintendents of Visitors to exchange confidential communications upon the subject of cases of infectious diseases with the Medical Officers of Health of their respective districts. The following form of certificate (as recommended by Dr. Dudfield) was accordingly prepared and placed in the hands of W. Hetherington, Esq., the Superintendent for the Hackney Division. 28 Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Confidential. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Typhus and Typhoid Fevers, &c. 187 I have reason to believe that there is case of at No. Name Remarks Signature Address Visitor of the School Board for London. To Dr. Bate, Medical Officer of Health, Vestry Hall, Church Row, Bethnal Green. Upon this form a large number of cases have been reported to us, and in exchange the Sanitary Inspectors have forwarded to Mr. Hetherington information of all cases of a similar nature which have come to our knowledge from other sources. I am informed that children from these addresses have not been allowed to attend school until such time as the infectious disease has terminated, and the premises have been properly disinfected and cleansed. While upon this subject I may as well refer to a most important Act of Parliament now in force in Bolton, compelling persons to give information to the Sanitary authority in all cases of infectious diseases; it would be of immense importance and advantage if a similar Act could be made applicable to the Metropolis. The Bolton Improvement Act, 1877, contains the following Provisions for the Compulsory Registration of Infectious diseases:— Section 87.—In order to secure that due notice be given to the Corporation of any inmate of any building used for human habitation, who is suffering from Smallpox, Cholera, or any contagious or infectious fever, the following provisions shall have effect (that is to say):— (1) If any such inmate be suffering from any such disease as aforesaid, the occupier or person having the management or control of such building shall, as soon as he shall become aware of the existence in any such inmate of any such disease, forthwith give notice to the Corporation, at the Town Hall, of the existence in such inmate of such disease ; (2) If such inmate be not a member of the family of such occupier or person, the head of the family (resident in such building) to which such inmate belongs, and if there be no such head, then such inmate (unless prevented by reason of such disease or of youth) shall, on becoming aware of the existence in such inmate or in his own person as the case may be of such disease, forthwith give notice thereof to such occupier or person; 29 (3) The Corporation shall provide and supply gratuitously to every registered medical practitioner, resident or practising in the borough, forms for the certificate or declaration by such medical practitioner of the particulars hereinafter mentioned, in relation to such cases according to the form set forth in the fifth schedule to this Act. (4) Every medical practitioner attending on or called in to visit such inmate shall, on becoming aware that such inmate is suffering from any such disease as aforesaid, forthwith fill up, sign, and send to the Corporation at the Town Hall a certificate or declaration, stating according to the forms prescribed and supplied to him by the Corporation, the name of such inmate, the situation of such building, and the name of such occupier or person, and the nature of the disease from which such inmate is suffering. (5) The Corporation shall pay to every medical practitioner, who shall, in pursuance of this section, duly make and give any such certificate or declaration a fee of two shillings and sixpence for each such certificate or declaration; and any person who shall offend against this enactment (unless ignorant thereof, the burden of the proof of which shall be on him) shall for every such offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding ten pounds. The subjoined form is in use in Bolton in carrying out the provisions of the Act. [To be left in the Sanitary Office, at the Town Hall. A certificate is required only on the occurrence of any of the following diseases, viz.:—Small-pox, Cholera, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Typhus Fever, Typhoid Fever, Continued Fever, Puerperal Fever, and Diphtheria.] BOLTON IMPROVEMENT ACT, 1877. Section 87. To the Corporation of the Borough of Bolton. Pursuant to the above mentioned Act I hereby certify and declare that in my opinion the under-mentioned person is suffering from a disease within the terms of such section. Dated the day 18 (Signed) Name of person suffering from the disease Situation of the building wherein such person is Name of occupier or other person having the charge, management, or control of the building or room Nature of the disease Note.—This certificate must (under penalty of five pounds in case of neglect) be forthwith sent to the Corporation, at the Town Hall, and delivered to the official clerk or servant of the Corporation who shall be found in attendance there. As an Act is now in force compelling certain parties to give information to the sanitary authority of a large district in England, it surely might, with modifications if required, be made applicable to all the sanitary authorities in the United Kingdom. 30 DESTRUCTION OF INFECTED BEDDING. The following Report was presented to the Vestry early in the present year:— Gentlemen,—It having been intimated to me that some explanation of the increased expenditure by the Sanitary Department during the past eighteen months, for bedding, would be desirable, I have the honour to report, for the information of the members of the Vestry, that it is my custom to order the destruction of infected bedding in all cases of Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, and Typhus Fever; also in Typhoid, when necessary. I need scarcely remind the members of the Vestry that we are still in the midst of an epidemic of Small-pox, and that very many cases are reported to us. By favour of the Board of Guardians of the Parish, and of the School Board for London, our department now receives information of all cases of infectious disease coming under the cognizance of the Officers of these Boards ; we are also regularly supplied by the local Registrars with information of all deaths in the Parish. From these various sources a very much larger number of cases come to our knowledge than was the case during the time of your late Medical Officer, Dr. Sarvis. All these cases of infectious disease are visited, and such instructions as to disinfection, destruction of bedding, &c., notices as to sanitary defects, &c., arc given as I consider advisable, and such action is reported by me to the Sanitary Committee on the Wednesday of each week. It is our custom to have feather beds disinfected, the expense of which is ten shillings; but flock beds are, in most instances, not worth such disinfection; we, therefore, destroy them, and replace with new. Many of these beds are mere heaps of filthy rags, and could not possibly be disinfected; it is our custom, however, to replace them by good new flock beds. Accompanying this Report is a Schedule, which I have had prepared, shewing for each quarter of the year 1877 the number of articles destroyed and replaced, and the cost of the same. The subject of a disinfecting apparatus has been several times mooted, but I do not think that the annual expense for this would be less than our present bedding account, though such apparatus would of course be available for other articles besides bedding, and, therefore, of great value. Still, as before remarked, many of the beds condemned are in such condition that they could not possibly be effectually disinfected by any apparatus. Their possessors, however, would not consent to their destruction, •without we undertook to replace them. I am informed by the Sanitary Inspectors that, since our increased action in this direction, much fewer instances of the communication of infectious disease to a second person in the same house come under their notice. 1 have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, GEORGE PADDOCK BATE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health for St. Matthew, Eethnal Green.

W. BURROWS, Sanitary Inspector. 32 EAST LONDON WATER COMPANY. The following information, extracted from a valuable monograph by Dr. Tidy on The London Water Supply will be read with interest:— The district supplied by this company includes a population of 839,752 people, residing in 111,967 houses, 68,129 of which are supplied on the Constant Service (November, 1877); more than one half of the houses in the district of the company, therefore, arc supplied on the Constant System. The company intend introducing a Constant Service, section by section, throughout their whole district. The company take their water chiefly from the River Lea, at Ponder's End, from which spot it is conveyed to subsidence reservoirs. The company, moreover, possess powers to take 10,000,000 gallons daily from the Thames. During the past year this has been done in the months of April (2,200,480 gallons daily), May (2,693,713 gallons daily), June (2,303,821 gallons daily), and September (107,143 gallons daily). The company possess nine storage and subsiding reservoirs, having an area of 222 acres, and a total capacity of 605,000,000 gallons. Eight of these are situated at Walthamstow, and one small one at Hanworth. There are four reservoirs for the pure, filtered water one at Old Ford, two at Hanworth, and one at Hornsey Wood. Their total capacity is 10,500,000 gallons. The company have 25 filter-beds, occupying an area of 23 acres. The filtering material is 3-ft. 6in. thick, and consists of sand (2-ft)., hoggin (6-in)., and coarse gravel (1-ft). The average rate of filtration is 1-33 gallons per hour per square foot of filtering area. The company deliver unfiltered water in separate mains for street watering and for trade purposes. I content myself with merely quoting the words of the Rivers Pollution Commissioners (sixth report, p. 281):—'The arrangements of the company for the filtration of the water of the Lea are not surpassed in completeness by those of any other of the London Water Companies. NOXIOUS AND OFFENSIVE TRADES. Sodkman's Stay Busk Factory.—Complaints having been received as to the manner in which this business was conducted, the premises were inspected, and the following report presented to the Sanitary Committee:—"May 3rd, Visited premises in Hassard-street, Ilackncy-road, used as a Stay Busk Manufactory. During a portion of the process plates of steel are heated in a furnace and plunged while red hot into a bath of whale oil. At the moment of immersion the oil ignites and flames up, giving off a most offensive empyreumatic odour, resembling that produced by frying sprats, it is clearly a nuisance under the Act, and in my opinion Mr. Sodeman does not use the best known means of abating the said nuisance, as the process is carried on in a small shed with no special provisions for the escape or destruction of the noxious fumes." In accordance with our 33 recommendations Mr. Sodeman constructed a tall air shaft into which the fumes from the oil bath were led, which had the effect of greatly mitigating the nuisance. Messrs. Cook's Tallow Melting Factory.—Early in the year these premises were inspected by the Sanitary Committee, the members of which unanimously expressed themselves as satisfied with the good effect of the alterations jointly recommended by Dr. Tidy and your Medical Officer. Messrs. Grace's White Lead Factory.—I received a communication from Mr. Liddle, the Medical Officer of Health for Whitechapel, to the effect that several cases of lead poisoning had been reported to him by the medical officers of the union, the patients having worked at Messrs. Grace's White Lead Factory in Bollybush Gardens. In consequence of this I visited the premises and carefully inspected the arrangements. I found that the firm, from whom I received every assistance and information, had adopted all the usual regulations as to cleanliness, etc., in the factory, and had provided for the use of the workers a plentiful supply of Sulphuric Acid Lemonade (which is an antidote to the poisonous effects of lead). I further ascertained that there were upon the premises a separate cookhouse and eating room, with strict regulations as to washing hands and face before handling food. I am, however, informed by Messrs. Grace, that they have very great difficulty in prevailing upon the workpeople to obey the rules, and adopt the appliances provided for their benefit. COW HOUSES. The cow houses in the parish have been kept under constant supervision, but we have considerable difficulty in prevailing upon the owners to carry out our recommendations as to paving, cleanliness, etc., and very much feel the want of compulsory Bye-laws by which to regulate the conduct of the business. At the licensing sessions, held in November last, the only new licence applied for was one for a shed in William-street, by Mr. W. Robinson (who has another cowshed in Squirries-street): to the granting of this, no opposition was raised, as the premises were suitable for the purpose. By direction of the Sanitary Committee the following licences were opposed. 34 James Moore, 389, Bethnal Green-road.—This shed had been disused for upwards of twelve months, it was structurally defective and without proper drainage.—The licence was refused. W. Holloway, 25, Arundel Street.—The building was entirely unfit for the purpose, and had been disused for more than two years.—Licence refused. Samuel Wiseby, 87, Railway Arch, Three Colts Lane.—This shed was not provided with proper conveniences, and was being used as a paraffin oil store. No cows had been kept for upwards of twelve months.—Licence refused. Wm. Mansfield, Digby Street.—This licence was opposed by reason of the yard in which the cowshed was placed being used as a dust-shoot. Mr. Mansfield stated that he was rapidly removing the accumulation of dust, and did not intend to receive any more.—The licence was granted, but impounded until such time as the yard should be clear of refuse. A list of the cowsheds in the parish is given below, they call for no special remark. LICENSED COW HOUSES. District. No. 1. Boakcs, William Columbia-road. Cockcrell, William 4, Boundary-street.

The slaughter houses present a pleasing contrast to the cowsheds, and have, with one or two minor exceptions, been kept in good order; they have been frequently visited by the sanitary staff, and very few infringements of the excellent bye laws have come within our cognisance. In no case was the renewal of a licence opposed by us, but no fresh ones were applied for. In the following instances, however, renewals were opposed by order of the Metropolitan Board of Works, under whose supervision the slaughter houses now are:— Mason, Mr. George, Bethnal Green road. Long, Mr., Essex street, Cambridge road. These licences were opposed on account of structural defects, but the cases were adjourned for the work to be completed. This was subsequently done, and at the next meeting the licences were granted. The following is a list of the slaughter houses in the parish:— LICENSED SLAUGHTER HOUSES. District No. 1.

Mazengarb, George 47, Green-street. Simons, Samuel 21, Roman-road UNWHOLESOME FOOD. Four firkins of butter were brought to me by a tradesman in Green street, who stated that he had received it from Ireland in the condition in which it then was, and that he was afraid to sell it. Upon examination the butter was found to be rancid, of very bad colour, and mixed with a quantity of foreign material; it was apparently chiefly composed of the scrapings of butter casks, and was evidently unfit for human food—a certificate to this effect was accordingly given. Some months afterwards I was summoned to attend the Whitechapel County Court to give evidence upon the matter. The wholesale dealers in Ireland summoned the tradesman for payment for the butter notwithstanding my certificate, and contended that the butter, which was invoiced as "Cork sixths," was a well known quality and used for machine purposes only, never being intended for human food, and thnf, therefore, the man received what he ordered. The tradesmau, however, held that he ordered "Butter for human food," and expected to receive such an article as he could sell, which this certainly was not, and the judge decided in his favour after hearing my evidence as to the condition of the article in question. 37 A portion of cheese, sold by a tradesman in the Bethnal Greenroad, was eaten for supper by the family of a gentleman residing in the neighbourhood ; this caused violent sickness and purging in six persons and a little dog which also ate some of it, while other members of the family who did not partake escaped. The cheese upon examination seemed to be ordinary American of rather strong flavour. I instructed Mr. Lapworth to obtain a sample to be submitted to Dr. Tidy for analysis, and warned the tradesman not to sell any more of the article. Dr. Tidy, after making the analysis reported that he could find nothing wrong with the cheese, which was perfectly sound. Mr. W. W. Burrows reports that he has condemned a great quantity of unsound fish and fruit brought to him by men who had purchased it. Certificates were given as to the condition of the articles, which were afterwards destroyed. About two tons of "Preserved" salmon in tins, and in a most putrid and offensive condition, were found by Mr. Lapworth upon the premises of a "general dealer" in Parliament-court. I ordered it to be immediately disinfected, and it was afterwards carted away into the country to be used as manure. The owner attended before the Sanitary Committee, and stated that he had purchased the article for the sake of the tins and cases in which it was packed. The committee resolved that as the fish was not offered for sale, legal proceedings should not be taken. Mr. Lapworth also reports that eight bushels of rotten Brazil nuts were seized upon the premises of a tradesman in Brady-street, but for the same reason as in the previous case no legal proceedings were taken. Mr. J. W. Burrows reports that on the 25th of August last he noticed some meat being removed in a somewhat suspicious manner from a house in West-street, Prospect-place, he accordingly followed the van in which the meat was contained to a sausage maker's 38 premises in Brooksby's-walk, Hackney. Having seen the meat delivered and the van driven away, Mr. Burrows then called the attention of the Medical Officer of Health and the Sanitary Inspector for the district to the circumstances; the party then visited the premises and discovered the carcase of a diseased cow. This was seized, and the owner afterwards prosecuted at Worship-street Police Court, and fined ten pounds and costs. Mr. Burrows was complimented by the magistrate upon the praiseworthy manner in which he had acted in the affair. MORTUARY. The question o the provision of a mortuary, though now decided, remained during the whole year in the hands of the lawyers, and the room in the old Watch House has been our only mortuary accommodation. I am informed by Mr. J. W. Burrows that 76 bodies have been removed and temporarily placed in this building, which is, of course, utterly inadequate for the purpose. SANITARY COMMITTEE. The Sanitary Committee has held 42 meetings at the Vestry Hall, and has also visited all the cowsheds and fish curing establishments in the parish. Messrs. Cook's and Mr. Sodeman's premises, where noxious trades are carried on, have also been inspected by them. Members of the committee, accompanied by the Sanitary Inspectors' also visited portions of the surrounding parishes to ascertain the manner in which the streets and market places were swept and cleansed on Sunday mornings. At their next meeting the Committee passed the following resolution: That the Sanitary Committee are of opinion and recommend that the cleansing of the market places of the parish on Sunday mornings be carried out throughout the year, and that they be authorized to arrange for the carrying out of the same, and that the above report be presented to the Vestry at their next meeting. This was accordingly done and unanimously adopted, the cleansing being afterwards carried out under the supervision of Mr. W. W. Burrows. The result has been most encouraging, as may be seen in the marked" improvement in the appearance of the streets on Sundays. 39 SANITARY WORK. Table VI. in the appendix shows some portion of the work executed by the inspectors under my supervision. It is, of course, utterly impossible to present the whole of this work in the form of a table, as a great portion is not done in a strictly formal manner, legal proceedings, especially, being always avoided where possible. In conclusion I have much pleasure in expressing my great satisfaction with the manner in which I have been assisted in my work by the Sanitary Inspectors, whose multifarious, and often dangerous duties have been performed throughout the year in a most careful and zealous manner. To Mr. W. W. Burrows my thanks are especially due for the manner in which (in addition to the duties of his own district) he took for a lengthened period the work of one of the other inspectors who was temporarily incapacitated by severe illness. I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without again thanking the officers of the Board of Guardians for the assistance they have rendered us in dealing with the Small-pox epidemic : they have on all occasions shewn the utmost readiness to afford me every information in their power. To Dr. Welch I am under great obligations, as I believe almost every case of infectious disease or defective sanitation coming within his cognisance has been immediately communicated to me. Lastly, I desire to return my grateful thanks for the manner in which my own efforts have been supported by the vestry, especially by those gentlemen forming the Sanitary Committee, whose cordial assistance and co-operation have upon all occasions been freely afforded me. I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, GEORGE PADDOCK BATE, M.D. To the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. 40 BETHNAL GREEN SANITARY DISTRICT. TABLE I.

Notice was given by the County of London Electric Lighting Company of their intention to apply, on or before the 21st December, for a Provisional Order for supplying Electric energy in the Parish, but no steps wore taken in pursuance of the notice. MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. The duty of providing a sufficient Mortuary is, by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, imposed on the Vestry; but the duty of providing a Coroner's Court and a place for holding inquests in cast upon the London County Council. 22 A correspondence has taken place between the County Council and the Vestry, as follows:— Spring Gardens, S.W. 10th August, 1892. Sir, The Council has had under consideration the question of the provision of Mortuary accommodation and Coroner's Courts in the County. By section 88 of the Public Health (London) Act, every Sanitary Autherity is required to provide proper Mortuary accommodation for its district, and, if called upon by the Council to do so, to provide (section 90) a proper building, "otherwise than at a workhouse," for post mortem examinations. By section 92 the Council is required to provide proper accommodation for the holding of Inquests, and may do this by agreement with the Sanitary Autherity in connection with any building belonging to the Sanitary Autherity. From information which has been before the Council as to the amount of such accommodation in the County, it would appear that the Mortuary in the Parish of Betlinal Green is not sufficiently large for the purposes of the Parish. The Council would therefore be glad to learn if the Vestry of Betlinal Green has given consideration to this subject, and if so, if it has come to any conclusion as to the steps the Vestry should take to meet the requirements of the Act in this direction, and generally the views of the Vestry upon the subject. It appears, moreover, that the accommodation for the holding of Inquests is unsatisfactory, and the Council would therefore be glad if the Aestry, when considering matter of Mortuary provision, would also consider if adequate accommodation for the holding of Inquests could bo afforded in connection with a suitable Mortuary in the Parish, or with any other building belonging to the Sanitary Autherity, and I am to intimate that in the event of the Vestry being able to afford such accommodation, the Council would be advised to enter into an agreement with the Vestry as provided by the 92nd section of the Act. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. DELA HOOKE, The Clerk, Clerk of the Council. The Vestry of Bethnal Green. 23 [ Copy. ] 17th September, 1892. Sir, MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURTS. This subject is under consideration by a Committee, and the views of the Yestry will be communicated to the Council at an early date. Yours obediently, ROBERT YOSS. II. De la Hooke, Esq., Clerk, London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. [ Copy. ] 17th October, 1892. Sir, the subject of the provision of Coroner's Court and Mortuary accommodation is still under consideration. I will communicate to you the views of the Yestry as soon as they come to a decision. When your letter of August 10th came the Yestry was in recess, and did not resume their sittings until the close of September. Yours obediently, ROBERT YOSS. H. De la Hooke, Esq 24 [ Copy. ] 2nd November, 1892. Sir, He MORTUARY. Your letter of 10th August has been referred to the Works and Sanitary Committees, who have caused a return to be made, showing the numbers of bodies (adults and children), taken to the Mortuary during the year ended 29th September last. I enclose a copy of the Return. I also forward, for the information of the Council, a copy of the Report of the Medical Officer of Health of the Yestry, for the year 1879 and 1880, which contains (see addendum) a description of the building and its capabilities. You will observe that the Medical Officer of Health states that it is capable of accommodating 40 bodies. 'From the Return sent herewith it appears that the largest number of bodies (including children), on any day during the year, was 11. It therefore appears to the Committee the present Mortuary is sufficient, and that there must have been some misconception when it was represented to the Council as inadequate. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, II. Dela Hooke, Esq. ROBERT YOSS. 25 [ Cory. ] 2nd November, 1892. Sir, He CORONER'S COURT. Your letter of 10th August has been referred to the Works and Sanitary Committees jointly. I am desired to inform you that for some time past the Yestry have endeavoured to provide accommodation for holding Inquests, by allowing them to be held in the Committee Room at the Yestry Hall, and on occasions when the Committee Room is in use, or when the enquiry has been of an unusually important character, the Board Room has been placed, when possible, at the disposal of the Coroner. The Committee are aware the accommodation afforded is in many respects imperfect, but it is all that is available. The Committee understand the Yestry have no power to erect buildings for the purpose of a Coroner's Court, but that the power of doing so is vested by the Public Health (London) Act in the Council. As it is obviously desirable that the Coroner's Court should be near the Mortuary, the Committee request me to inform you that there is a vacant piece of land (the property of the Yestry), adjoining the Yestry Offices, and nearly opposite the Mortuary, which might be available as a site. Should the Council entertain the question of building a Court, the Yestry would probably feel disposed to make an arrangement with respect to the land. I am, Sir, Yours obediently, ROBERT YOSS, H. Dela Hooke, Esq. 26 London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. 24 th February, 1893. MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. Sir, The Council's Committee dealing with this matter has had under consideration your letter of the 2nd of November as to the provision of a Coroner's Court in Betlinal Green. The Committee wish mo to point out that in many ways the erection and maintenance of the Court by the Council would bo attended with serious disadvantages, and that it would be a better arrangement for the Vestry to provide the Court, the Council paying for its use by the Coroner on such terms as may be agreed upon in accordance with section 92 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. It will bo noted that this section directly provides for such an arrangement, and for the information of the Vestry I enclose copy of resolutions arrived at by the Committee, as to the basis on which payment in such cases should bo made. the Committee would therefore bo glad if your Vestry would consider as to the practicability of this course being taken, and communicate its views at an early date. Your letter as to the Mortuary is still under consideration, and will form the subject of a separate communication. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. DE LA HOOKE, Clerk of the Council. The Clerk, Vestry of Bethnal Green, Bethnal Greon, E. 27 Resolutions of Committee as to terms on which Council would be advised to agree with Sanitary Authorities for use of Coroners' Courts, provided by Sanitary Authorities— Where the Court has been specially built and is solely used for the purposes of a Coroner's Court, payment to be made by the Council on the basis of 3½ per cent. on the capital outlay, together with a reasonable proportion of the cost of maintenance. When the Court is not solely used for the purposes of a Coroner's Court, a rent to bo agreed upon by the Council and the Sanitary Authority, or a fee in accordance with the Council's schedule of disbursements. [ Copy] 22nd March, 1893. Sir, MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. Your letter of the 21th February last was referred by the Vestry to the Works Committee. the Committee have the subject under consideration, and will communicate with you after they have received the letter referred to in the last paragraph of your letter. Yours obediently, ROBERT YOSS. Subsequently to the 25th March last, the Council wrote to the Vestry: "The Council having had under consideration a report by its Medical Officer on the Bethnal Green Mortuary, does not consider it necessary to make any suggestions with regard to the Mortuary accommodation for the District." The subject of the Coroner's Court remains to be disposed of. 28 COLLECTION OF RATES. the Report of the Finance Committee, mentioned under the above heading, on page 27 of the Vestry Report of last year, was considered. It was as follows:— March, 1892. At present the Collectors pay the amount collected by them for Poor Rate to the London and County Bank in Shoreditch—the General and Sewers Rates to the General Account of the Vestry at the London and Midland Bank in Shoreditch. The Composition Rate is paid direct to the Churchwardens. As a largo part of the rates is paid by cheques, it has hitherto been necessary for Collectors to keep private banking accounts, so as to make their payments to the two different banks. the Committee consider that no money should be paid into the private bank accounts of the Collectors, but should be paid direct to an account in the name of and under the control of the Vestry, to bo called the "Rate Account," and from which should be transferred weekly by the Bank to the proper accounts the sums paid in for Poor Rate Account and Vestry Accounts. To obviate difficulties in effecting this object, the Committeo are of opinion that the Poor Rate Account should bo closed, and a new account opened with the London and Midland Bank in respect of Poor Rate. the Committee are of opinion that there should be established a more frequent supervision over the actual stato of collection of rates beyond what has existed, and that the Rate Books should remain in the custody of the Vestry at the Vestry Hall. This will necessitate the employment of a clerk. the Committee hope that the employment of one efficient clerk will be adequate, and propose to make the experiment for one quarter. the Rate Clerk will have to check the returns to be furnished by the Collectors, to examine their rate receipt books, and enter in the rate books the sums received by the Collectors, etc. This would relieve the Collectors from some of the clerical work done in the past, but they will have to supply instead detailed returns, and it is proposed 29 that they should, at the close of each quarter, balance their own Rate Books, attending for this purpose at the Vestry Offices. the Committee propose that the Collectors shall daily pay the sums in their hands into the Bank, and shall, at the end of each day, make and post to the Vestry Clerk a return of the sums received on such day by the Collector. There is much matter of detail with respect to forms, books to be kept, and the like, which the Committee suggest should be left to the Committee to prescribe and alter as may be found necessary, if the Yestry adopt the subsequent recommendations of the Committee dealing with the general principles, leaving the Committee to report, and, if necessary, apply further to the Vestry. the Committee therefore recommend— 1. That an account, to be called the "Rate Account," be opened with the London and Midland Bank, into which the Collectors shall pay all negotiable instruments and moneys received in respect of rates, including the Composition Rate. 2. That the Poor Rate Account with the London and County Banking Company be closed, and a new account in substitution bo opened with the London and Midland Bank. 3. That the London and Midland Bank be requested to furnish security to the extent of £5000 for money held by the Bank. 4. That the Collectors pay to the Rate Account, and furnish returns of the sums collected daily, or otherwise, and in such manner as the Finance Committee prescribe. 5. That the rates assessed on the Great Eastern Railway, Gas, Water, and Industrial Dwellings' Companies, and the School Board for London, be collected through the Yestry Clerks' Department, and paid to the Rate Account. 30 6. That the Vestry pay to the Vestry Clerk such sum as ho may actually pay to the Clerk to be employed for the purpose of checking the Collectors' returns, vouchers, and posting the rate books, &c., not exceeding £2 5s. per week. 7. That the Collectors return weekly a statement of all empty houses, new occupations, property newly built or increased in value by alterations, with such particulars as will enable the Rate Books to form a correct register for voting purposes, except as to tenement houses. 8. That the Finance Committee be empowered to proscribe the books, returns, forms, particulars, days, times, and places requisite, in the opinion of the Committee, to give effect to the Resolutions of the Yestry, and to require all officers and servants to comply with the directions of the Committee with regard to the subject matter, and all procedure incident thereto. All the recommendations of the Report were adopted, except No. 6, which was amended thus:— "That the Yestry employ and appoint a clerk for the purpose of checking the Collectors' returns and vouchers, and posting the rate books, &c., at a salary of £2 5s. per week," and as so amended was passed and adopted. It was referred to the Finance Committee to advertise for applications by candidates for the office of Rate Clerk, and to select from the applicants the three appearing the most eligible, out of whom one should be elected by the Yestry. There were sixteen candidates, from which three were selected, one of whom, Mr. George Frederick Leserve, was elected by the Yestry on the 28th April. On March 2nd, upon consideration of what the duties of the Rate Clerk had proved to be, the Yestry altered his salary to £150 per annum. 31 The sum of £5000, £2 15s. per cent. Consolidated Stock, has been transferred at the Bank of England to an account of the Vestry and the London and Midland Bank, and a deed executed making the sum of stock a security to the Vestry for moneys held by the bank. The prosecution of Mr. William Isaac Shenton, late Rate Collector of the West Division of the East Ward, directed by the Vestry in February, 1892, was proceeded with. After many remands ho was committed for trial. lie was convicted at the Central Criminal Court, after a hearing occupying nearly two days. Before the trial the whole of the defalcations had been made good. What the guarantee policy of £1000 was insufficient to cover had been paid (it is understood through the efforts of friends of Mr. Shenton) to the credit of the Vestry account. The verdict of the jury was accompanied by a recommendation to mercy, which, with the evidence as to previous character, and the punishment entailed by the loss of his situation, weighed with the Court, and the prisoner was bound over to come up for judgment if and when called on. An application by the three junior Rate Collectors for an increase of salary was referred to the Finance Committee, who recommended that the salaries of these Collectors be raised as from Christmas then next to £180, and be raised by annual increments of £5 to a maximum salary of £200. The Report was considered in October, and the matter adjourned for six months. COLUMBIA ROAD IMPROVEMENT. The London County Council acceded to the application of the Vestry to contribute to the cost of the widening, and agreed to pay one-half of the net cost of the ground to be bought, not exceeding £215. When the Vestry were ready to take possession and complete the purchase, it appeared that part of the ground agreed 32 to be bought had been built upon, and formed part of the lobbyentrance to a music hall. The Guinness Trustees required the removal of the encroachment, and the restoration of the land on which it stood. On the removal of the building and the restoration of its site, possession was given of the whole of the ground sold to the Yestry, and the purchase completed in March, 1893. The exact purchase money was £442 10, from which has to bo deducted the £215 agreed to be given by the London County Council. NORTH PASSAGE. The Vestry directed the "Paving" to be proceeded with, which was done, and a new apportionment made of the actual instead of the estimated cost. Fresh demands have been accordingly served upon the owners of the various properties abutting on the passage. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT.

In August a report of the Works Committee was presented, recommending that the carriageways of the following streets should be paved with granite cubes:— Bethnal Green Road, from opposite No. 377, down to Cambridge Road. Virginia Road, from Boundary Street to Austin Street. Mansford Street, from Hackney Road to Old Bethnal Green Road. 35 Hollybush Gardens, the unpaved margins between stone tramway and kerb. Darling Row. Morpeth Street. Globe Road, from Green Street to Old Ford Road. Austin Street. Gosset Street, from Orange Street to Old Bethnal Green Road. Old Ford Road, from, near Peel Grove to the "Greyhound" Tavern. Hassard Street. Wilmot Street. Canrobcrt Street, from Old Bethnal Green Road to Bethnal Green Road. Waterloo Terrace. Wellington Place. Columbia Road, from Hackney Road to Barnet Grove. the report suggested that the subject of providing the requisite money should be referred to the Finance Committee. The report was received and adopted. The Finance Committee recommended that the requisite money be obtained from the London County Council, at interest not exceeding £3 10s. per cent. per annum. It was ultimately decided, instead of borrowing at once the whole £20,000 necessary, to borrow the amount in two equal sums. In January the mortgage to the London County Council for the first £10,000 was completed. In February it was resolved to invite tenders for the work to be done in Austin Street, Bethnal Green Road, Canrobert Street, Columbia Road (from Barnet Grove eastward), Gosset Street, Old Ford Road, and Virginia Road. In March the tenders were received and opened, and that of Mr. William Griffiths, which was the lowest, was accepted. 36 THE UNEMPLOYED. On the 15th of November, the Vestry, as the Sanitary Authority, received from the Local Government Board the following letter:— Pauperism and Distress. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 14th November, 1892. Sir, From information which the Local Government Board have received, it appears that there is at the present time a considerable amount of distress in different parts of the country occasioned by scarcity of employment, and it is probable that this condition of things may become more general, and be intensified in the course of the coming winter. In the spring of 1886 the Local Government Board issued a circular letter to local authorities indicating the course which might with advantage be adopted for the provision of employment for the unemployed of the class who do not ordinarily seek poor law relief. The following extracts from that circular appear to me to deserve the immediate and careful consideration of the local authorities, both in the metropolis and elsewhere :— "The Local Government Board are convinced that in the ranks of these who do not ordinarily seek parish relief there is evidence of much and increased privation, and if the depression in trade continues, it is to be feared that large numbers of persons usually in regular employment will be reduced to the greatest straits. "The spirit of independence which leads so many of the working classes to make great personal sacrifices rather than incur the stigma of pauperism, is one which deserves the greatest sympathy and respect, and which it is the duty and interest of the community to maintain by all the means at its disposal. 37 "Any relaxation of the general rule at present obtaining, which requires, as a condition of relief to able-bodied male persons, on the ground of their being out of employment, the acceptance of an order for admission to the Workhouse, or the performance of an adequate task of work as a labour test, would be most disastrous, as tending directly to restore the condition of things which, before the reform of the poor laws, destroyed the independence of the labouring classes, and increased the poor rate until it became an almost insupportable burden. "It is not desirable that the working classes should be familiarised with poor law relief, and if once the honourable sentiment which now leads them to avoid it is broken down, it is probable that recourse will be had to this provision on the slightest occasion. "The Local Government Board have no doubt that the powers which the Guardians possess are fully sufficient to enable them to deal with ordinary pauperism, and to meet the demand for relief from the classes who usually seek it. "What is required in the endeavour to relieve artisans and others who have hitherto avoided poor law assistance, and who are temporarily deprived of employment, is :— "1. Work which will not involve the stigma of pauperism ; "2. Work which all can perform, whatever may have been their previous avocations; "3. Work which does not compete with that of other labourers at present in employment; and "Lastly, work which is not likely to interfere with the resumption of regular employment in their own trades by these who seek it. "The Board have no power to enforce the adoption of any particular proposals, and the object of this circular is to bring the subject generally under the notice of Boards of Guardians and other local authorities. 38 "In districts in which exceptional distress prevails, the Board recommend that the Guardians should confer with the local autherities, and endeavour to arrange with the latter for the execution of works on which unskilled labour may be immediately employed. "These works may bo of the following kinds, among others :— "(a) Spade husbandry on sewage farms. "(b.) Laying out of open spaces, recreation grounds, new cemeteries, or disused burial grounds. "(c.) Cleansiug of streets not usually undertaken by local autherities. "(d.) Laying out and paving of new streets, &c. "(a.) Paving of unpaved streets, and making of footpaths in country roads. "(f.) Providing or extending sewerage works, and works of water supply. "In all cases in which special works are undertaken to meet exceptional distress, it would appear to be necessary, first, that the men employed should be engaged on the recommendation of the Guardians as persons whom, owing to previous condition and circumstances, it is undesirable to send to the Workhouse, or to treat as subjects for pauper relief ; and, second, that the wages paid should be something less than the wages ordinarily paid for similar work, in order to prevent imposture, and to leave the strongest temptation to these who avail themselves of this opportunity to return as soon as possible to their previous occupations. "When the works are of such a character that the expense may properly be defrayed out of borrowed moneys, the local autherities may rely that there will bo every desire on the part of 39 the Board to deal promptly with their application for their sanction to a loan." I would urge on the local autherities, on whom devolves the duty of carrying out the works required for their districts, that the execution of such works should, whenever practicable, be commenced at an early date, so that employment may be given during the winter months when work is the more needed, rather than later in the coming year. I would at the same time emphasise the great importance which I attach to the co-operation of Boards of Guardians with local authorities, in order that the pauperisation of these persons whose difficulties are occasioned only by exceptional circumstances arising from temporary scarcity of employment, and who are unwilling to become dependent on poor law relief, may, as far as practicable, be avoided. In the case of the metropolis, some of the classes of employment suggested above are not practicable, but, apart from the execution of new works, it will probably be found that in the performance of the ordinary routine duties of the sanitary autherity occasions will arise when surplus labour may be profitably utilised. I shall be obliged if this letter is brought under the consideration of the authority at once, and it will be satisfactory to me to be kept informed of the state of affairs in your district, and to learn the results of any efforts which may be made in the direction suggested. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Henry H. Fowler. The Clerk to the Guardians or Sanitary Autherity. The letter was referred to the Works Committee, with power to act. 40 On the 15th of December, a deputation waited on the Vestry: six members of the deputation were received, who presented a written statement, as follows:— To the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. At a meeting of ratepayers and inhabitants of Bethnal Green, the following resolutions were submitted and carried unanimously, and ordered to bo sent to the Vestry intact, and then to each body affected. That the present condition of provision by the Local Government Authorities for distress amongst Bethnal Greeners, owing to the want of work, is very unsatisfactory and inadequate. This meeting, therefore, respectfully suggests the following means to meet the special needs:— Firstly.—That a larger number of men may be found work upon the roads, and the work shall be more fairly distributed so that all may have a fair chance. Secondly.—That the £11,000 that it is proposed by the Vestry to spend upon the roads shall be spent, as far as it is possible, witheut the intervention of a contractor, and that the work shall be at once commenced. Thirdly.—That the needful work in connection with the Workhouse and Infirmary, in the shape of cleansing, painting, and whitewashing, shall bo done at once, and that the Guardians bo requested to take such means as shall employ direct these in need of work in the Parish. Fourthly.—That the London County Council be requested to complete the arrangements now pending in reference to the laying out of the Poor's Land and the Victoria Park Cemetery, also to proceed as speedily as possible with the clearance of the Boundary Street area, so that needful work may be provided for these out of employment. 41 Fifthly.— That the School Board be requested to take immediate steps to ensure the cleansing of the Board Schools in the Parish during the Christmas holidays, and to employ for this purpose the men out of work in this Parish. Sixthly.—That in all these several cases the different Boards be requested to put the same into operation as soon as possible. That the Chairman be requested to forward a copy of the above resolutions to the London County Councillors for the Parish, and to the Rev. Stewart Headlam for the School Board, and to the President of the Local Government Board. Signed on behalf of the meeting, James Morden, Chairman. Submitted again at a great meeting at Abbey Street, on Wednesday, December 14th, 1892. Oliver R. Hales, Chairman. On the motion of Mr. Bedford, a resolution was passed as follows:— "That during the continuance of the exceptional distress, the Vestry shall employ at least 200 inhabitants of Bethnal Green three days a week at sweeping, scoring roads, and such other work as can be found for them." On February 2nd, the Vestry resolved, "That not less than 100 men be employed during three days in the week each, and another 100 for the other three days, for the next 28 days, to take effect from Monday next." Information as to work done by the unemployed, and the nature of it, will be found in the Surveyor's Report. NOTIFICATION OF DISEASES. The Vestry directed the prosecution of the medical practitioner for delaying for six days notifying a case of scarlet fever, He was fined £2 and costs. 42 CHOLERA. At the end of August, Circular Letters of the Local Government Board, of the 24th and 25th of that month, drawing attention to the outbreak of Cholera at Hamburg, were received; they were printed and circulated, and a Special Meeting of the Sanitary Committee was, on a requisition by the Chairman, convened. At the Special Meeting of the Committee the letters of the Local Government Board were considered, and also a Circular letter, of the 29th of August, from the Metropolitan Asylums Board, stating the intention of that Board to deal with accommodation in existing Hospitals and Institutions, and to provide special means of conveyance for Cholera Patients, and suggesting that the Vestry should avoid covering the same ground, was read; and also a letter from the Asylums Board to the Medical Officer stating ambulances and litters had been provided for use at ambulance stations. A Report, prepared by the Medical Officer, as to precautions to bo adopted in the Parish against an outbreak or spread of Cholera was read. the Committee resolved as follows:— % "That two persons be appointed for four weeks at £2 2s. 0d. per week each, to act as temporary Sanitary Inspectors, with a view to making a house-to-house inspection of the worst portions of the South District, and for the discovery of insanitary conditions and the prevention of overcrowding." " That the Committee approve of the course adopted by the Surveyor in utilizing the ordinary staff in flushing and disinfecting pavements, courts, and alleys; and request him temporarily to engage such additional number of men as he thinks fit to continue and extend the work." "That the Report of the Medical Officer bo printed." 43 The Committee reported that Messrs. Abrams and Hunt had been appointed temporary Inspectors at £2 2s. 0d. per week. The Committee reported what had been done by them to the Vestry at a meeting held on the 15th of September, when it was resolved:— "That the proceedings of the Sanitary Committee be approved and adopted." STREETS REGULATIONS. In May, Mr. John Angell, of No. 181, Mare Street, Hackney, was elected Street Inspector in place of Mr. Dowling who had resigned. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk. Analytical Laboratory, Vestry Hall Padding ton Green, W., July 12 th, 1892. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Chairman and Gentlemen, During the Quarter ending June 24th, 1892, I have received from your Inspectors 41 samples of food for analysis. These consisted of Milk, 27 samples; Butter, 7; Condensed Milk, 3; Mustard, 2; and Pepper, 2. Of these, 13 samples of Milk and 3 of Butter proved to be adulterated. In the case of the Milk samples, where the adulteration was but slight, the Sanitary Committee thought it advisable merely to caution the offenders; but in 9 cases proceedings were taken, and wore very successfully carried through by your Inspectors, fines ranging from 5s. to £3 being imposed. It is difficult to understand on what basis the Magistrates impose fines, seeing that, for adding 30 per cent. of water to Milk, the vendor was fined only 5s.; while another vendor, who diluted his sample with but 10 per cent. of water, was fined £3. the proportion of adulterated Milk samples this quarter is very high, no less than 48 per cent. of the samples being adulterated. In an adulterated Milk case, No. not decided last quarter, but settled this quarter, the vendor appealed to the Somerset House Chemists. They upheld my analysis, and the vendor was fined £10 and costs. Of the 3 adulterated samples of Butter, 1 was obtained from the Workhouse, and was found to contain only 10 per cent. of real Butter, the rest being beef fat, water, and salt. Not being taken under the requirements of the Food and Drugs Adulteration Act, no prosecution could bo instituted. the fact, however, shows the necessity of looking into the purity of the food supplied to largo institutions, where too frequently the adulteration is wholesale in its character upon these who cannot protect themselves. The vendors of the other 2 samples of adulterated Butter, containing only 25 and 46 per cent. respectively of real Butter, were fined £11 and £15 each. In all the above cases the fines carried with them also costs, in two cases the cost of the analysis being also imposed; so that this quarter a total sum of £46 14s. 6d. has been ordered to be paid into the Vestry's account.

The vendors of two samples, containing respectively 5 and 6 per cent. of water, were merely cautioned not to repeat the offence. In the other cases summonses were issued, and fines ranging from £3 to £15 were imposed. One sample of Butter contained 65 and the other 85 per cent. of Margarine; prosecutions were undertaken in these cases, and fines of £10 and £15 were imposed upon the vendors. The amount of fines for the quarter ordered to be paid into the Vestry's account was £59. A short resume of the year's Analytical Work may bo of interest: The total number of samples received during the year 1892 was 89, consisting of Milk 66, Butter 16, Condensed Milk 3, Mustard 2, and Pepper 2. No less than 29 samples wore adulterated; these consisted of Milk 22 samples, and Butter 7 samples. If these represent a fair average of the food sold in the Parish, it would seem that 30 per cent., or almost one third, of the articles are adulterated. 48 Of Butter samples 44 per cent. were found to be more or less mixed with Margarine, so that a purchaser buying Butter in this district would be almost as likely to get Margarine as Butter. This substitution of Margarine for Butter entails a great loss on the British Dairy Farmer, who is undersold by tho Foreign Grease Merchants. Neither do the poor benefit by the legitimate sale of Margarine, since a higher price is extracted from them by selling it as Butter. This Parish unfortunately shews a higher percentage of adulterated samples than the rest of London; the average for the Metropolis is about 16 per cent., in this Parish it is 30 per cent. Only one sample of food for every 1450 inhabitants was examined during the year. I am pleased to bo able to bear witness to the able way in which the various prosecution-cases wore carried out by your Inspectors. The total amount paid into tho Vestry account for fines during the year was £109 4s. 6d. I remain, Your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, F.C.S. F.I C. Public Analyst.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Gentlemen, During the quarter ending March 25th, 1893, I have received from your Inspectors only 10 samples of food for analysis. These consisted of 6 samples of Milk, and 4 of Butter. All of them were genuine. One sample of Milk contained 7 per cent. more than the average proportion of Cream; evidently the vendor suspected the purpose of the purchase, and contrived to give the sample an additional supply of Cream. Two samples of Butter were of suspiciously low quality. Appending a tabulated list of the articles analyzed, I remain, Your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, F.C.S., F.I.C., Public Analyst.

On November 17th, a lengthy circular letter from the President of the Local Government Board was submitted to the Vestry, in which a number of suggestions were made as to dealing with exceptional distress which might arise during the coming winter, and this letter was referred by the Vestry to tho Works Committeo, with power to act. Tho Committeo gave your Surveyor instructions to employ as many additional men as ho could find useful work for in sweeping the roads, and the sweeping gangs were at onco largely augmented. On December 1st, a deputation of eight members of the Board of Guardians waited on tho Vestry, and tho matter was again referred to tho Works Committee to confer with the deputation. A deputation on behalf of tho unemployed also waited on the Vestry, and the Vestry resolved that "It bo an instruction to the Works Committee to pay all casual labourers taken on from the unemployed Gd. per hour" It was also moved "that the Vestry employ fifty residents of Bethnal Green, from to-morrow morning forward for a fortnight," but this motion was lost. On December 6th, the deputation of the Board of Guardians attended the Works Committee, and 7 ???ade the following propositions to the Committee:— 1. Will you employ men sent "by the Guardians with temporary work? 2. Will you give preference to those sent by the Guardians? 3. Have the Vestry started a Labour Bureau, and how has it worked? 4. Would you be prepared to employ men from 1 to 5 o'clock? 5. Would you forward a list of men employed each day, and for easy reference let each man work to a number in addition to his name? After consideration the Committee resolved " That as far as practicable and where useful work can bo found, the Committee adopt suggestion No. 1; also to adopt suggestions Nos. 2, 4 and 5,'' and the deputation were informed that the question of establishing a Labour Bureau was under the consideration of the Vestry. It was also resolved that the Surveyor bo empowered to engage a person to act as temporary clerk to enter the names and assist in keeping the accounts in connection with the engagement of the unemployed. These arrangements, as agreed with the Board of Guardians, were carried out until December 15th, when the Vestry passed the following resolution:— "That during the continuance of the exceptional distress, the Vestry shall employ at least 200 6 "The Unemployed" The large sum expended in connection with "the unemployed" will doubtless be noticed, and requires explanation.

It was also resolved that the Surveyor bo empowered to engage a person to act as temporary clerk to enter the names and assist in keeping the accounts in connection with the engagement of the unemployed. These arrangements, as agreed with tho Board of Guardians, were carried out until December 15th, when the Yestry passed the following resolution :— " That during the continuance of the exceptional distress, the Yestry shall employ at least 200 8 inhabitants of Bethnal Green throe days a week at sweeping, scoring roads, and such other work as can be found for them." This resolution was put into force on the following morning; but for a few days until it became generally known that the Vestry had resolved to employ at least 200 men daily, the number applying was not sufficient to comply with the resolution, but shortly afterwards large numbers applied daily. It became necessary to engage men to make enquiries into the statements made by each man applying for work before they were taken on. Tho results of these enquiries were practically as follows. There were 1353 applicants for employment, made up of the following trades:— 9 LIST OF TRADES.

Thirty-seven men were reported by their gangers for laziness, and struck off the books; 78 were struck off, being single men; 15 as occupants of common lodging-houses. Two were reported as having obtained work, and others did not answer to their names after having been called on three separate days. On January 5th, a notice of motion was given at the Vestry meeting to rescind the resolution of December 15th, and on February 2nd the Vestry substituted the following resolution for that of December 15th, "That not less than 100 men bo employed during three days in the week each, and another 100 for the other three days for the next 28 days, to take effect from next Monday." A number of the most able-bodied of these applying were then selected, and the construction of a pipe sewer in Squirries Street, Florida Street and Brick Lane put in hand. These works lasted some time beyond the period mentioned in the last resolution of the Vestry, and some of the men were continued on the work at the usual rate of wages until their completion.

A number of the most suitable men were selected from amongst the ranks of the unemployed, and an 18-inch pipe sewer constructed in Squirries Street, from Bethnal Green Road to Florida Street, and the sewer in Florida Street, from Squirries Street, westward, broken up and a now 12-in. pipe sewer constructed at a lower level to communicate with the new Squirries Street sewer, and a manhole built at the crossing of Squirries and Florida Streets. This new outfall sower will relievo Florida Street and the surrounding streets which were a constant source of trouble in consequence of the insufficient depths and gradients of the sewers, and it has been constructed at such a depth and size as to admit of further extension if it is presently found desirable. Brick Lane, Shacklewell Street, and Peter Street. A new 15-inch pipe sewer has been constructed in; Brick Lane, between Peter Street and Bethnal Green Road, and the old sewers in Shackle well Street and Peter Street lowered and connected with it at the manhole chamber. There was hitherto no sewer in this portion of Brick Lane, and the sewers in Peter Street and Shacklewell Street were periodically becoming stopped in consequence of the insufficient depth and gradient. As in the case of Squirries and Florida Streets, the now outfall has been constructed of sufficient size and at sufficient depth to admit of its further extension if it is presently found desirable. Flushing Sewers, &c. The cost of water for flushing sewers, &c., amounted to £50 8s., and for the supply to the public urinals to £119 18s. 6d. House Drainage. During the year, applications have been made and Squirries Street and Florida Street. 23 Lans submitted to and considered by the "Works Committee for the drainage of— 87 Old Houses. 73 New Houses. 34 Additions. 11 Workshops and Warehouses. 4 Stables. 9 Forecourts. 1 Gymnasium. 1 Music Hall. 1 Dispensary. 1 Section House to Police Station. 2 Timber Stages. RE-NUMBERING HOUSES. Orders have been made by the London County Council for re-numbering the houses in Bræmar Street and part of the houses in Mansford Street. These orders have been carried out by the Vestry, and 46 houses re-numbered. NEW STREETS. During the year the sum of £180 18s. l1d. has been collected under apportionments from the owners of property for paving new streets, and the works have been carried out at Helen's Place and Minto Place. GENERALLY. As foreshadowed in my last Annual Report, the Columbia Buildings of the Guinness Trustees have been completed, the new fence next Columbia Road erected, and the land agreed to be sold to the Vestry has been handed over to the Vestry and has been paved, and now forms part of the Highway. 24 On taking possession of the land on behalf of the Vestry, your Surveyor found that a portion of the ground which the Trustees agreed to sell to the Vestry had been built upon, and formed part of the lobby entrance to the Baxendale Music Hall. The Trustees' architect was communicated with upon the subject, with the result that the building was pulled down and the Vestry put in possession of the whole of the land which they agreed to purchase. The ground was purchased at 4 s. per foot, and the purchase-money amounts to the sum of £442 10s., of which amount the London County Council have promised to contribute £215. Hart's Lane. The old houses on the Western side of Hart's Lane being pulled down, a give and take line was arranged with the freeholder's surveyor, resulting in the widening of the footway about 2 feet at its narrowest point. Gullies. Under the Scavenging Contract, the Contractors were required to remove the deposit within half an hour of its being taken out of the gullies; but the Works Committee, feeling that it would be a great advantage to have it removed from the gullies direct into the waggons, made a provisional arrangement with the Contractors to do so, a sum of £40 for each district to be paid by the Vestry for the remainder of the term of the Contract. This arrangement was adopted by the Vestry. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, F. W. BARRATT, Surveyor to the Vestry.

Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you in this report the vital statistics of Bethnal Green for the fifty-two weeks included in the registration year 1892. The usual tables will be found in the Appendix, but it will be noticed that Table III. has been somewhat modified, in deference to the requirements of the Local Government Board, and now shews, in addition to the deaths at various groups of ages, the deaths in each Sub-district. The tables formulated by the Local Government Board require Public Institutions to be regarded as separate localities, and the registered deaths in each to be separately recorded; but I do not consider this a suitable plan for Bethnal Green as its adoption would entail either a double set of statistics or a break in the continuity of my reports, which have been prepared on similar forms for the past seventeen years.* In my opinion the forms of the Local Government Board, though excellent for the country, are inapplicable to a Metropolitan District, as here we have an arrangement with the General Register Office, by which we receive information of all deaths of inhabitants of Bethnal Green, who die in extra-parochial hospitals. I include these deaths in my figures and allocate them to the Sub-districts wherein the deceased persons resided during life. The deaths in the Workhouse, the Victoria Park Hospital, and the Mildmay Mission Hospital I treat in a similar manner, but I entirely exclude all deaths of non-parishioners who have died in these * Since this was written the Vestry has decided to place the Sanitary Staff under the Local Government Board, and when this is accomplished the use of the tables referred to will be compulsory in future reports. 2 institutions, though these deaths have been registered in Bethnal Green, and if the forms of the Local Government Board were rigidly adhered to, would have to be shown. POPULATION. The population of Bethnal Green, as enumerated in April, 1891, was 129,1134, but upon taking into consideration the slow rate of our increase between the census of 1881 and that of 1891, compared with the increase of previous intercensal periods, and looking also at the fact that the births during 1892 were 87 fewer than these of 1891, I am of opinion that our population is diminishing. This opinion is confirmed by the decrease in the number of inhabited houses, as these are gradually being replaced by manufactories and warehouses. I believe that in the near future a largo portion of the North and South Sub-districts of Bethnal Green will cease to be residential, and will become, like the City of London, one vast manufactory and storehouse. To go more into detail: the recent census has shewn that during the last ten years the South district has been decreasing in population, that the North district has been almost stationary, while the East district has been rapidly growing. In a district in which the population has been diminishing irregularly, the task of estimating the number of inhabitants is more than ordinarily difficult, the only certain fact wo havo to dopond upon is the number of births, for birth rates are known to vary very slightly. The population of this district as enumerated in March, 1891, was found to be 129,134, and this number of persons produced 4,998 children during the year, but as during 1892, only 4911 births were registered, I am reluctantly drawn to the conclusion that our population must have proportionately diminished, and that our numbors are 2094 fewer than they were when the census was taken.' 3 The following table shews the births and population in the three registration Sub-districts for the two years under consideration. The table indicates a net decrease of 2,094; for theugh the East Sub-district seems to have gained 492, yet the North has lost 250 and the South 1216. TABLE A. Population and Births in Sub-Districts for Years 1891 and 1892. Sub-District. 1891. 1892. Population (enumerated). Registered Births. Population (estimated). Registered Births.

The births during the year were 4911 against 4998 in 1891, a decrease of 87. The excess of the births over the deaths, however, was 1927; this is 212 more than last year. This number 1927 should represent our natural increase of population, but it is enormously discounted by emigration, which is constantly going on and is not to any largo extent counterbalanced by immigration. 4 TABLE B. 1892. 1891. Estimated population in the middle of the year 127,040 129,134 Total Births 4911 4998 Total Deaths 2984 3282 Excess of Births over Deaths, shewing the natural increase of the Population 1927 1716 DEATH RATE. The number of deaths registered in the parish during the year was 2800 against 3080 in the previous year, but this included 179 non-parishioners who died in Bethnal Green Hospitals, and whose deaths must be excluded from the number. On the other hand I have received information from the General Register Office of the deaths of 363 inhabitants of Bethnal Green who died in Hospitals outside the parish; these deaths must be added, thus making a net total of 2984. In the Sub-districts the deaths (after correction and distribution) were as under:— North 1187 South 796 East 999 Taking the estimated population as a basis, we shew a mortality rate for the year 1892 of 23.49. This, though two per thousand below the rate of the previous year, is still three per thousand above the mortality for the whole of London, which was 20.6. The mortality in the Sub-districts of this parish was as under:— North 23.1 South 25.5 East 22.3 5 In the following table the mortality rates for London and Bethnal Green are compared by quarters.

The numbers of births registered in the whole of Bethnal Green during the year was 4911, a rate of 38.67, which is identical with that of last year; but it is, as usual, nearly eight per thousand higher than that of the whole of London for 1892, which was 0.9. In the Registration Sub-districts the birth rates were as under :— North 40.04. South 40.60. East 35.70. MARRIAGES. In this Parish there are fourteen Churches, fifteen Chapels, and one Registry Office licensed for marriages; of these there were the First Quarter 259 Second Quarter 383 Third Quarter 353 Fourth Quarter 452 1447 This total indicates a marriage rate of 11.4 to every thousand persons; or, as in each marriage there are two contracting parties, 2.8 per thousand of our population entered the bonds of matrimony. DEATHS OF INFANTS. Two-fifths of the deaths from all causes were these of infants aged less than twelve months; for out of 4911 children born alive, 79 died before reaching the age of one year. This gives a death late (calculated upon the births) of 158.6, the corresponding rate 10 for the whole of London being 155. The diseases most fatal to infants were:— Atrophy and Debility 152 Chest Diseases 169 Convulsions 87 Premature Birth 64 Whooping Cough 39 Diarrhœa 44 Suffocation 35 Tabes Mesenterica 23 Tubercular Meningitis 25 DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. As usual nearly half the deaths (1439, that is 48.22 per cent.), were these of children aged less than five years. This gives a rate of 76 per thousand calculated upon the estimated population of young children. OLD PEOPLE'S DEATH RATE. The deaths of elderly people (that is to say, of persons over 65 years of age), numbered 487, or 132 fewer than during the previous year. This gives a rate of 65.5 per theusand calculated on the estimated population of old people. 11 SPECIAL CAUSES OF DEATH. Summary of Table III. No. of Deaths. Per Centage or Total Deaths.

SPECIFIC FEBRILE OR ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The total number of deaths from this group of diseases was 629, ore than twenty per cent. of the total deaths from all causes. 12 Of these deaths 481 were amongst young children under five year of age, 138 of whom were infants. THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths referred to the orders Miasmatic and Diarrhœal (exclusive of Influenza), wore 526, an increase of seventeen over last year. The Decennial average of Zymotic deaths for the ten years 1882 to 1891 was 492 (see table V.) The death rate from Zymotic diseases was 4.14 against 326 last year, the corresponding rates for London being 2.28 in 1891 and 2.80 in 1892. TABLE D. 1892. 1891.

(Decennial Average, 11.1). Thirty-nine cases of Small Pox were reported during the year, land all except six were removed to Hospital. Five died, two of whom (adults) had been vaccinated; but three (children) were unvaccinated. The mortality on the reported cases was 12.82 per cent. SCARLET FEVER. (Decennial Average, 79.3). The cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year numbered 924, resulting in 53 deaths, or a mortality of 5 73 per cent, on the reported cases. FEVERS. (Decennial Average, 28.6). The number of cases of Enteric and Continued Fevers reported was 102, of which all but five were notified as Enterica. This disease caused 22 deaths, a mortality of 21.5 per cent. on the total number of cases reported. 14 DIPHTHERIA (including Membranous Croup). (Decennial Average, 46.0). The number of cases reported to me under these two heads was 567. I found it impossible to separate the Membranous Croup from the Diphtheria cases, as when wo get two certificates for the same person (a not uncommon occurrence), as often as not tho disease is returned by one medical gentleman as Croup and by tho j other as Diphtheria. Looking at it from a Sanitary point of view I have long been in the habit of taking the same precautions whichever of these two diseases has been reported to me. The number of deaths was 119, a case mortality of 21 per cent., and a mortality of 09.3 per thousand on the estimated population at all ages. . Of the deaths 97 were amongst young children aged less than five years; tills was 513 per thousand on the estimated population of young children. The general Metropolitan death rato was 044 per thousand living, and was the highest yet recorded. WHOOPING COUGH. (Decennial Average, 122 4). Whooping Cough caused 122 deaths, all except four being amongst young children, and making a mortality of 6.2 per thousand on tho estimated population of young children. MEASLES. (Decennial Average, 102 9). Measles caused 131 deaths, all but six being amongst young children. This is a mortality of 6.61 per thousand children alive. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. A total of 1954 cases have been notified during the year. The numbers are shewn month by month, together with the Hospital admissions and discharges in tho following table.

The deaths from Lung diseases, exclusive of Phthisis and Pulmonary Influenza were 759, over twenty per cent, of the total mortality from all causes, and corresponding to a rate of 5 97 per thousand population at all ages. As far as possible I have excluded Influenza, but probably many of the Bronchitis and Pneumonia deaths were due to this disease, though the statement did not appear on the medical certificate. The Influenza outbreak has now lasted three years, with an annual exacerbation. In 1892, this occurred during the first two months of tho year. Table "H" separates the respiratory mortality into quarters, shows the age distribution, and also the rainfall and mean temperature for each period of three months. 22 TABLE H. Quarter ending.

Quantities of vegetables, fruit, &c., are brought to us by the purchasers, usually street hawkers, who have bought at market auctions. Certificates as to tho condition in which wo find the articles aro given, and tho matter is settled between vendor and purchaser. Other cases calling for special note are the following:— Minute of Sanitary Committee MeetinG, 6th January, 1892. Inspoctor Weston reported that ho had seized 114 turkeys in a putrid condition from 231, C Road. Those contained in three of tho crates were offered to him for sale. The turkeys were conveyed to Worship Street Police Court, and condemned by the magistrate as unfit for food. Mr. H. P. attended, and asked that the Committee would not take proceedings against him, as the turkeys were offered for sale by his foreman without his knowledge. Resolved. That as this was a first offence, and Mr. P. acknowledges his fault, and agrees to pay all costs, no furthor action be taken. On February 17th, R. P. was fined £5 and costs for exposing for sale on a stall in Cambridge Road a quantity of meat, consisting of nino pieces of mutton, such meat being in an unsound condition and unfit for food. BAKEHOUSES. Tho bakehouses have been cart-fully inspected. Of these 102 are in occupation, but twenty others (including those in the Boundary Street area) are closed. In forty per cent, the bread is made in cellars, which are usually situated under the shops, where the retail business is carried on ; the remainder of the bakehouses are behind the shops, either on a level with the pavement, or only a few steps down. In the whole of the parish I only found seven of these places in, what I should call, a clean and satisfactory condition; the others are either dirty and untidy, or some sanitary fault was found, such 26 as bad ventilation, defective sink traps, closet flushing apparatus out of order, or bad surface drainage of yard, &o. In ten bakeries (seven of them collars) I found the sanitary arrangements so bad, and the lighting and ventilating arrangements so imperfect as to render them totally unfit for use, and as I am of opinion that tho original construction of the buildings is so faulty as to render them incapable of improvement, I see no other course than to get them closed and rebuilt. Accordingly I recommend that proceedings bo taken under Section 16 Factory and Workshops Act, 1883. In sixty-four instances, the walls, ceilings, and passages were in a dirty condition; most of the places were very untidy and the utensils improperly cleaned. In fifty-seven instances I found refuse flour and floor sweepings accumulated under the troughs. I object very strongly to this custom as it is uncleanly and encourages vermin; I have, therefore, forbidden it and have directed notices to be served requiring the floor beneath tho troughs to be smoothly cemented and kept free from sweepings. I am afraid the bakehouses are not sufficiently well looked after. They require frequent inspection and should be visited at least four or five times a year, but your present staff of inspectors are too fully occupied to devote sufficient time to them, and I think that the appointment of a Workshop Inspector as recommended by the Sanitary Committee should be at once proceeded with. COW-HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. Your officers, in conjunction with the Inspectors of the County Council, have kept the cow-houses and slaughter-houses under careful supervision, and have found them to be in a fairly satisfactory condition, so that it has not been necessary to oppose any of the licenses. WORKSHOPS. Nothing has at present been done in the way of systematic inspection of workshops, but all complaints have been attended to. A communication was received from the Local Government 27 Board drawing the attention of the Vestry to an order made by the Secretary of State under Section 27 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1891, by which lists of out-workers are required to be kept in tho following trades:—The manufacture of articles of wearing apparel, cabinet and furniture making, upholstery work, manufacture of electro plate, and the manufacture of files. This order came into effect on November 20th, 1892. It requires the occupier of every factory and workshop, where any of tho above businesses are carried on, to keep lists of the names and addresses of all persons employed by them to do work at their own homes. These lists are required to be open to the officers of the Vestry, in order that the sanitary condition of domestic workshops may be looked after. So far no action has been taken by your officers under the above order, for your present staff are so fully occupied that they have not had time to inspect the workshops known to them, it was, therefore, considered useless to obtain the addresses of fresh ones. The matter must remain in abeyance till additional inspectors are appointed as recommended by the Sanitary Committee. Bearing upon this subject, tho following report by Mr. Shirley Murphy will bo read with interest, as it shews tho present number of Sanitary Inspectors in each Metropolitan District:— £ouboit (Comttij Council. Public Health Department, Sritixo Gardens, S.W. 24th April, 1893. SANITARY INSPECTORS. Report of the Medical Officer of ITealth of the Administrative County of London, submitting a Return sheicing particulars as to the Sanitary Inspectors in the several Sanitary Districts of the County. In presenting a return shewing the number of Sanitary Inspectors in the Administrative County of London, and other information concerning these officers, it should be stated that changes in the staffs of 41 sanitary authorities are not infrequent, and it may bo that during the time this return was in course of preparation some small modification of the staff of one or other of these authorities may have been made. The present return shews that the total number of Sanitary Inspectors in the county, inclusive of five vacancies and 17 temporary officers, is 188. This number for a population of 4,230,474 persons is equivalent to one Inspector to every 22,503 inhabitant. In order to compare the number of Inspectors at the present time with the number employed in 1889, when the last returns of the number of these officers was made, it is necessary to deduct the number of inspectors of the City and Whitechapel, i.e., 15, seeing that information as to these districts was wanting when the 1889 return was prepared. Excluding these two districts, the number of inspectors employed in 1889 was 115, as compared with 173 in 1893, or an increase of 58. This increase, however, is more apparent than real, for before the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the police were concerned in the abatement of smoke nuisances, a duty which, as the result of the passing of that Act, now devolves solely upon the Sanitary Authorities. I am informed that before the year 1891 48 police constables were engaged in this duty, 25 of whom were wholly occupied in connection with it, and the remaining 23 partially. In the interval between the two returns, the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, the Housing of the Working Classes Act, the Public Health (London) Act, and the Factory and Workshops Act have become law. It is very difficult to supply any precise material for comparing one district with another in respect of its need of inspection and tho sufficiency of the staff employed, particularly as the duties which devolve upon the inspectors are not identical in every district. Thus in some districts the inspectors are provided with clerical assistance in the keeping of registers of complaints and proceedings, and in the preparation of notices, while in other districts the inspectors do not receive assistance of this sort. The number of inhabitants to each sanitary inspector employed in the several sanitary districts of the county is shown in the following table:— 29 Number of Sanitary Inspectors.

In Glasgow, Manchester, and Brighton women are already employed in connection with the work of the sanitary staff. Tho tabular statement does not contain any reference to the provision for the inspection of places mentioned in Schedule C of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and which are now sanitary districts. Tho arrangements already made include the appointment of one inspoctor at a salary of £30 per annum for the Charter House, Staple's Inn and Furnival's Inn, in the Holborn Union; the appointment of one inspector at £'20 per annum for the lnner Temple; the employment of one of the inspctors of St. Margaret's and St. John's, "Westminster, for the purpose of the (Close of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, at a salary of £5 5s. per annum; and the appointment as inspector for Grays Inn of the Medical Officer of Health. Shirley F. Murphy, Medical Officer of Health. SANITARY STAFF. A glance at Table VI. will shew that there has boon a very large increase in the amount of work devolving upon the department during the past year. Recent legislation has thrown so many additional duties upon Sanitary officials that your present staff is utterly unable to cope with them, and much remains undone ; moreover, it is conducive neither to the credit of the Vestry or the health of the officials concerned, that Sanitary Inspectors should sit up half the night doing clerical work at their own homes after working all day at out-door inspection. I trust that this will soon bo rendered unnecessary by the appointment of additional officers as recommended by the Sanitary Committee. I have the honour to bo, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, 31 BETHNAL GREEN SANITARY DISTRICT. TABLE I.

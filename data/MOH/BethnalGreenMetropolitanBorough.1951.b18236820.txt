June, 1952, To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Qreen Madam, Ladies and Gentlemen, Although I am submitting the Annual Report on the Public Health and Sanitary Circumstances of the Borough for the year 1951. the work of the Public Health Department was under the direction of Dr. W.T. Donovan until his sudden death on the 15th October, 1951. Dr. Donovan was appointed Jointly by the Boroughs of Bethnal Green and Poplar as Medical Officer of Health on the 31st March, 1949. and held this appointment until his death. The general health of the Borough remained satlsfactory during the year and there was no undue incidence of any major infectious disease. The Registrar General's estimate of the population of the Borough was 58,000, a decrease of 730 as compared with the previous year. The number of live births registered was 976 giving a birth rate of 16.8 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 16,7 for 1950 and with 15.5 for the whole of England and Wales in 1951. -6- The crude death rate was 13.5 as compared with 12.3 for the previous year. In comparing with other districts or the country as a whole It Is necessary to take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population and for this purpose the Registrar General gives a comparability factor. Using this factor the death rate In Bethnal Green Is to be taken as 14.5 as compared with 12.5 for England and Wales. The Infantile Mortality Rate, or the deaths of children under 1 year of age per 1,000 live births, was 22.5 as compared with 28.5 during the previous year and with 29.6 for the whole of England and Wales In 1951. This Is a very satisfactory figure but It must be remembered that when dealing with such small numbers as 22 Infant deaths, a single death can materially alter the rate and consequently too much reliance should not be placed on this figure as an Indication of the standard of child care in the Borough. Prom a perusal of the records there is much evidence of the assistance which was forthcoming from the Council and from the Public Health Committee in particular and of the high standard of work carried out by the staff of the Public Health Department. I feel sure that Dr. Donovan would have wished me to add his thanks to the Members of the Council and to the Staff. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, R. DUNCAN DEWAR, Medical Officer of Health -7- SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population, estimated mid-year 58,000 Number of Inhabited houses (at 31st December, 1951) 15,827 Rateable Value £439,938 General Rate 20s.8d.

In addition 2,756 letters were sent out by the department in connection with insanitary conditions and 608 letters appertaining to housing and various public health matters. CO Legal Proceedings It was found necessary on 128 occasions during the year to take legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the requirements of Notices served.

To meet the problem, occupiers of factories have extended their premises either by reconstructing old or disused parts of their premises or by constructing temporary prefabricated structures where approval has been obtained under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947- It is interesting to note that where new factories have been built on sites specially zoned for industrial purposes in this Borough, the modern methods of construction have resulted in improved lighting, ventilation, heating arrangements, washing and other facilities, thereby adding to the comfort and welfare of employees. • In addition to the ordinary routine inspections, a number of visits were made In regard to drainage and applications under the Town and Country Planning Act, 19^7- The following Tables give details of work carried out under the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, during the year:- -19- TABLE 4 INSPECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OP PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH (including inspections made by Sanitary Inspectors) Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written notices Occupiers prosecuted 1.

While the proposals put forward by the Borough Council were not fully satisfled, it was indicated that those areas not included in the first five year period would be noted for attention subsequently. The agreed plan for Bethnal Green allowed for 1,305 premises to be dealt with in the first five year period and 236 of these would be dealt with by the Borough Council. During 1951 detailed surveys of premises in the Arline Street Area were completed and with the approval of the London County Council the number of unfit premises to be dealt with was increased from 77 to 98.

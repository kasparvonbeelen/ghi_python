To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with the "Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my fourteenth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1906, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1906, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 169,975:— Registration London. 4,721,217 Poplar. 59,935 Bromley. 67,300 Bow. 42,740 being 60.l inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 73.04 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 5140 per acre in Poplar Parish, 111.23 2 in Bromley, and 77.00 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1906. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Parish of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three parishes might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., and VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. Births. During the year 1906, 99 births were notified outside the Borough belonging thereto:—98 by the Medical Officer of Stepney and one by the Medical Officer of Finsbury. 91 of the Stepney births occurred in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road, and 7 in the London Hospital. The birth in Finsbury took place in the City of London Lying-in Hospital. Mothers' Home, Commercial Road. poplar. bromley. bow. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male.

In the 52 weeks 3072 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 781 deaths having occurred in the Parish of Poplar, 1818 in Bromley, and 473 in Bow; from the 781 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 77 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 364 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1068 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1818 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 799 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 199 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1218. From the 473 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 5 non-residents and added 237 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 705 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III. that in considering the deaths of nonresidents and those from outlying institutions, that certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 3072 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 514 deaths of actual nonresidents and 433 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, 7 making a total for the Borough of 2991 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1068 deaths in Poplar included 11 illegitimate children, 4 male and 7 female; the 1218 deaths in Bromley included 17 illegitimate children, 7 male and 10 female; the 705 Bow deaths included 5 illegitimate children, 2 male and 3 female, making a total for the Borough of 33 deaths of illegitimate children.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the years 1901-1905, females also exceeded the males. 8 The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 22 years (see page 2):— Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

Together with Mr. Councillor A. H. Darby, the Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, I attended the National Conference on Infantile Mortality held at the Caxton Hall, Westminster, on 13th and 14th June. * For Tables of Infantile Mortality, see Tables XIII., XIV., XV. and XVI., pages 41, 42, 43 and 44. 12 The programme of subjects or discussion was as follows I. Administrative—Measures Immediately Practicable. 1. The teaching of infant feeding and nursing in schools. 2. The appointment of qualified women with special reference to the hygiene and feeding of infants. 3. The supply of pure or specially modified milk for the feeding of infants. II. Educative—Problems for Discussion. 1. The influence of alcoholism on infantile mortality. 2. The relation of premature births to infantile mortality. 3. Infant Life Insurance. III. Legislative—Measures requiring further Legislation. 1. Earlier registration or notification of births. 2. Employment of women before and after confinement. 3. The regulation of the placing of infants out to nurse, and the amendment of the Infant Life Protection Act. 4. The sale and control of infant food stuffs. 5. The increase of the powers of Local Authorities in regard to milk supply. 6. The extension of the Midwives Act to Scotland. The resolutions of the conference were as follows :— 1. That the Education Department be urged to add instruction in Elementary Hygiene with reference to the dietary and rearing of infants, to their present scheme for systematically training girls in the senior classes in the practice and principles of personal hygiene and the elements of dietary. 2. That, in the opinion of this Conference, immediate legislation is required enabling Sanitary Authorities to establish or support depots for the supply of pure, or modified, or sterilized milk, and to defray any cost out of the monies available for public health purposes. 3. That, in view of the information submitted, the Conference is of opinion that all still births should be notified within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur, and that no burial should take place without a medical certificate. 13 4. That notification of all births be given within 48 hours to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they occur.* 5. That, in the opinion of this Conference, the question of the insurance of infant lives under 12 months is one demanding serious consideration, and, with a view to receiving reliable information, the Government should be asked to appoint a departmental committee of enquiry on the whole question. 6. (a) That the period of one month's abstention from factory work away from home now imposed on mothers be extended to at least three months, and that, on their return to work, evidence must be produced satisfactory to the Local Authority that proper provision has been made for the care of the child. (b) That no employer of labour shall permit a woman advanced in pregnancy to engage in factory labour unless her ability therefor has been certified to the satisfaction of the Local Authority. 7. (a) That, having regard to the ascertained fact that in centres of industries where women are largely employed away from their homes, an excessive number of deaths of infants takes place, and that this is contributed to by the improper conditions existing at the houses in which infants are placed out to nurse, it is necessary that the persons by whom, and the places into which infants are received, should be under supervision by the Local Sanitary Authority. (b) That the Infant Life Protection Act be amended to remedy abuses which are not at present piovided against. • Whilst this report is going through the press Lord Robert Cecil asked leave to introduce a Bill to provide for the early notification of births. Under the present registration law six weeks are allowed for registration to take place. Lord Robert Cecil's Bill is modelled upon the provision which already exists at Huddersfield. It provides that there should be within 48 hours of the birth of every child a notification of its birth sent to the Medical Officer of Health. That notification should be given in the simplest way without any formalities. It might be given by a postcard. The duty was thrown upon the father of the child of making the notification, and, failing him, upon any one who has been in attendance on the mother. Another provision provides that notification should be made in the cases of stillborn children. Lord Cecil stated one-third of the children who died in the first year died within six weeks of their birth. Leave was given for the Bill to be introduced and read a first time. There are no Health Visitors in Poplar, but should this Bill become law the Hints on Infant Feeding will be forwardod to the mother by return of post within three days of the birth, instead of seven weeks, as at present. C 14 8 That all preparations offered or sold as food for infants should be certified by a Government Analyst as non-injurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. 9. That the Dairies, Milkshops, and Cowsheds Order is defective, and that any amendment should extend the definition of disease as applied to animals, and should make the provision of Regulations by Local Authorities compulsory. That the scope of the Regulations should be extended to cover dirty milk, and should enable Local Authorities to prohibit the sale of any milk which fails to comply with the conditions of purity agreed upon. 10. That, in the opinion of this Conference, the Midwives Act, 1902, should be extended to Scotland and Ireland. At the close of the Conference it was unanimously agreed— That the Conference resolve itself into a Committee to give effect to the foregoing resolutions, and with power to remit to an Executive Committee to carry out the same. Arising out of the National Conference on Infantile Mortality, a deputation of the Executive Committee waited, recently, on the Prime Minister, and the President of the Local Government Board, to submit the resolutions passed by the Conference, and generally to urge the necessity of Government action in relation to the matter. The Prime Minister's reply was sympathetic to the objects of the Conference, as set out in the resolutions, and in the observations of the speakers for the deputation—Bailie W. F. Anderson, of Glasgow, and Alderman G. Broadbent, of Huddersfield, hon. joint secretaries, and Mr. Evan Spicer, M.P., Chairman of the Conference, and of the London County Council. Mr. John Burns, M.P., President of the Conference, in welcoming the deputation, said it was in the responsible position of president of a department which had promised to assist them, and intended to adhere to its word, that he responded to the invitation given by the Prime Minister to deal with the practical and administrative points embodied in the excellent speeches that had been made. Increasing attention, he observed, was being given to the matter of instruction in hygiene, and kindred matters, in the public elementary schools, and not only in the secondary schools, but in the Universities also, and he would communicate the views that had been expressed to the President of the Board of Education. As to supply of sterilized milk by the sanitary authorities, incalculable 15 good had been done in those districts which had adopted the system, and he had decided to introduce a Bill sanctioning what was doubtful and illegal in the action of the local authorities in establishing such depots. The general subject of the notification of still-births would be considered at the end of the year, from the point of view of the Huddersfield Experimental Act, and the attention of the Home Secretary would be called to the proposal to inquire into the question of the insurance of infant life. As to the proposed restrictions in regard to mothers working in factories, it was only just beginning to be found out the amount of disease due to pre-natal causes; but infantile mortality often sprang from other causes than those which the factory inspector could prevent. The question of infant feeding would be further inquired into, and dealt with by a Departmental Order—or legislation if necessary. The tendency on the part of people to spend on beer what they should lay out on food for their children, and for securing that leisure which should be given to the expectant mother, was one of the contributing factors towards the high infantile mortality rates in districts where housing was relatively good, and where wages were fairly high, as compared with other districts. The Infant Life Protection Act, 1897* (see footnote.) 60 and 61, Vic. cap. 57. Section 2 enacts the following as to persons retaining or receiving for hire infants for the purpose of maintenance to give notice thereof, viz.:— * Infant Life Protection Bill, Presented by Mr. Staveley Hill. Ordered to be printed 19th February, 1907. 1. By the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, a person receiving for hire or reward more than one infant under five years of age for the purpose of nursing or maintaining such infants apart from their parents for longer than forty-eight hours, or receiving an infant under two years of age, to bring up in consideration of a sum of money not exceeding twenty pounds paid down, is obliged to give notice thereof within forty-eight hours to the local authority, as defined in such Act. Such local authority is obliged to appoint inspectors to inspect such infants. Failure to give such notice renders the offender liable in the first-mentioned case to a fine of not less than five pounds, or to imprisonment for not more than six months, and in the second-mentioned case to only forfeiture of the amount received. If any infant, as aforesaid, is kept in any house or premises which are so unfit or overcrowded as to endanger its health, or is retained or received by any person who by reason of negligence, ignorance, or other cause, is so unfit as to endanger the child's health, the local authority may order the removal of the infant to the workhouse or a place of safety until it can be restored to its relatives or guardians or otherwise lawfully disposed of. 2. The object of this Bill is to extend the provisions of the Act to cases where only one child is taken in to be nursed or maintained, and to any child received in consideration of a sum of money paid down, whatever the amount may be ; to raise to seven years the age-limit of children within the Act; to render any person failing to notify the 16 (Sub-section 1)—Any person retaining or receiving for hire or reward in that behalf more than one infant under the age of five years for the purpose of nursing or maintaining such infants apart from their parents for a longer period than forty-eight hours, shall within the said forty-eight hours give notice thereof to the local authority. (Sub section 2) Such notice shall truly state the name, age and sex of such infants, the name of the person receiving the infants, and the dwelling within which such infants are being kept, and the name and address of the person or persons from whom the infants have been received. (Sub-section 3)—If any such infant is removed from the care of the person who has received the infant for the purpose aforesaid, such person shall forthwith give to the local authority notice of the removal, and of the name and address of the person to whose care the infant has been transferred. (Sub-section 4)—If any person who has retained or received any infant as aforesaid omits to give the said notices, or any of them, or knowingly or wilfully makes or causes or procures any other person to make any false statement in any such notice, he shall be guilty of an offence against this Act. At a Meeting of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, held on 22nd June, the following resolution was passed unanimously :— " That, in the opinion of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incor" porated Society of Medical Officers of Health, it is desirable in " the interests of public health that Section 2 of the Infant Life " Protection Act, 1897, should be amended in order to provide for " the control of persons receiving for hire or reward, for a period of " 48 hours, one or more infants under the age of five years; and, " further, that in London the controlling authorities under the Act " should be the Borough Councils." reception of an infant, adopted in consideration of a lump sum payment, to fine or imprisonment as above mentioned, as well as to forfeiture of the amount received; to make it clear that the inspection of children within the Act shall extend up to their reaching seven years or earlier removal by the local authority; to enable the local authority to remove an infant kept by a person who is unfit by reason of character or otherwise to have its care and maintenance, or who is in a house or premises unsuitable for the purpose, although such person or premises are not so unfit as to endanger the child's health ; and to require notice to be given of all changes of residence of a person having the care or custody of children within the Act under penalty of imprisonment or fine. 17 The Secretary was directed by the Branch to communicate this resolution to the Local Government Board, and to the Metropolitan Borough Councils and their Medical Officers of Health, and to express the hope of the Branch that the Borough Councils would support this resolution and make representations to the Local Government Board accordingly. It will be seen that the Act provides that persons receiving more than one infant for hire, shall give notice and be placed under inspection. The Controlling Authority in London is the London County Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the amendments proposed are desirable, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and representations on the subject be made to the Local Government Board. AGE MORTALITY. The number of deaths from one year to 65 years of age was 565 for Poplar, 659 for Bromley, and for Bow 353, making a total for the Borough of Poplar of 1577.

The following letter with a memorial was received in February from the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption and other Forms of Tuberculosis :— 20, Hanover Square, London, W., February, 1906. Sir, I beg respectfully to request that you will bring the accompanying Memorial of the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption before your Board. Consumption is largely due to the conditions which attend poverty, and affects chiefly the poor who in sickness become a charge on charity or on the public funds. Among the poor from this point of view must be included large numbers of the working classes reduced to poverty by this disease. Its prevention is thus eminently a social and public question, and it is in a great measure practicable. Consumption is a contagious disease; the predisposing influences and the mode in which it is spread 21 are well known, but it can only be efficiently dealt with by organised and co-ordinated effort on the part of the public Authorities of various kinds who are directly or indirectly charged with the care of the poor or the maintenance of the public health: Poor-Law Guardians, Health Authorities' Municipalities, County, Urban and District Councils. By such combined efforts tuberculosis could be brought under control, and its ravages effectually checked to the great advantage of the community. The object of the Memorial is to point out how this can be done, and to urge upon public Authorities generally the duty of action in the matter. I remain, Your obedient Servant, W. H. BROADBENT, Chairman of Council, National Association for the Prevention of Consumption. Whilst this Report is being written the second interim Report of the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the relations of human and animal tuberculosis has been published. The two interim Reports of the Second Royal Commission, dated respectively 1904 and 1907, go far to prove that the effects of the bacillus of bovine and human tuberculosis are one and the same. The Commissioners were of opinion that a very considerable amount of disease and loss of life, especially among the young, must be attributed to the consumption of cow's milk containing tubercle bacilli. It must be urged that the making of regulations under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order should be compulsory throughout the country, and some modifications bringing them up to date should be made. Careful supervision of farms, cattle and milk utensils is necessary, but until orders in Council are made mandatory but little good can result from such precautions. The Contagious Diseases Act, 1878, gave power to the Privy Council (now transferred to the Local Government Board) to make an order under which Local Authorities are empowered (inter alia) to make regulations for the inspection of cattle and dairies, for securing cleanliness of milk stores and of milk utensils, and also for regulating the lighting, ventilation, cleansing, drainage, and water supply of dairies and cowsheds. If these regulations are made compulsory on every sanitary authority 22 much would be done to lessen the danger that arises from tuberculous cows. The simplest and most certain method of destroying tubercle germs in MILK is to BOIL it, and if, in carrying out this operation, the following rules are observed, the "cooked" flavour objected to by many individuals will be found to be comparatively slight, and the formation of surface scum will be practically nil:— 1. Use a double milk saucepan. If, however, this cannot be obtained, put the milk into an ordinary covered saucepan and place it inside a larger vessel containing water. 2. Let the water in the outer pan be cold when placed on the fire. 3. Bring the water up to the boil, and maintain it at this point for four minutes without removing the lid of the inner milk pan. 4. Cool the milk down quickly by placing the inner pan in one or two changes of cold water without removing the lid. 5. When cooled down, aerate the milk by stirring well with a spoon. Experimentation has shown that a temperature of 176° F. (80° C.) is insufficient in all cases to destroy the germs, and great care should therefore be exercised by those who prefer to use such "Pasteurisers" or " Sterilisers " instead of simply boiling the milk to ascertain with certainty that the particular apparatus used is capable of, and actually does raise the milk to a temperature exceeding that above mentioned, viz., 176° F. (80° C.). No steriliser should be looked upon as thoroughly efficient for the purpose in which a temperature of at least 185- F. (85' C.) is not attained. COMPULSORY NOTIFICATION OF PHTHISIS (PULMONARY CONSUMPTION). The question whether compulsory notification of phthisis is necessary to enable Sanitary Authorities to combat this most fatal disease, is one which at all events in this country is not settled. The Local Government 23 Board is of opinion it is not a disease to which compulsory notification can with advantage be applied. The Local Government Board for Scotland, on the other hand, in their circular letter of 10th March, 1906, expressed the view that " for the effectual application of the Public Health Act to pulmonary phthisis, a system of notification is essential;" and stated that " it is open to the Local Authority, with the approval of the Board, to add pulmonary phthisis to the list of diseases notifiable under the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889, and that the Board will be prepared to give favourable consideration to any application for their approval, provided they are satisfied that the Local Authority are in a position, and are ready, to deal effectively with the cases notified to them." Dr. Koch in his " Nobel" lecture delivered at Stockholm, and published in The Lancet, May 26th, 1906, after stating that " the starting point for the combating of all pestilences is notification, because without it most cases of disease would remain unknown, we must demand it for tuberculosis too." The Society of Medical Officers of Health (Metropolitan Branch) have arrived at the conclusion that a system of compulsory notification is desirable for the Metropolis, on the lines of the Sheffield Corporation Act, 1903, which have been followed in the Bolton and Rathmines Acts of 1905. It was ordered that a copy of the resolution be forwarded to the Local Government Board, the London County Council, and the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption and other forms of Tuberculosis. I understand that the Health Committee of Glasgow, the second city in the empire, have unanimously recommended to the Corporation that the compulsory notification of pulmonary phthisis should be adopted for a period. The recommendation was adopted. I also understand the Town Council of the City of Edinburgh acting on the recommendation of the Health Committee decided on the 18th December to apply to the Local Government Board for Scotland for sanction to add consumption to the list of diseases scheduled in the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Act, 1889. 24 ADMIINSTRATIVE CONTROL OF PULMONARY PHTHISIS. Under this heading, the Local Government Board for Scotland, under date 10th March, addressed a Circular to Local Authorities :— Pulmonary phthisis (consumption) is stated to be "an infectious disease within the meaning of the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897." " The cardinal fact is that the infection of pulmonary phthisis passes from one person, directly or indirectly, to some other person. Accordingly, the sections of the Public Health Act applicable to other infectious diseases are equally applicable to pulmonary phthisis, and the obligation resting on the Local Authority to deal with and control infectious disease, extends to consumption." Disinfection.—" The provisions of the Statute with regard to disinfection are available in dealing with pulmonary phthisis, and it is the duty of the Local Authority to secure that, whenever necessary, these provisions are enforced. . . . Not only the homes but also the workshops or other places where consumptives have been employed, should be carefully and thoroughly disinfected." The work should be done by the officers of the Local Authority. Isolation and Treatment.—" The provisions of the Public Health Act as to the removal of cases of infectious disease to hospital, and as to the provision of hospitals,'' are stated to be "available for dealing with cases of pulmonary phthisis as with cases of other infectious diseases." "In structure, Sanatoria may be of the simplest and cheapest form"—costing, say, £90 per bed. The need of isolation of advanced cases is emphasised. "For this purpose vacant wards of an infectious disease hospital may be utilised." Dispensaries for consumption are recommended "where the number of phthisical patients is large." "On the continent, notably in France and Germany, dispensaries have been of immense value in the discovery of insanitary conditions, and in the organisation of nursing service." Notification.—"For the effective application of the Public Health Act to pulmonary phthisis, a system of notification is essential." "It is open to the Local Authority, with the approval of the Board, to add pulmonary phthisis to the list of (notifiable) diseases," and the Board "will be 25 prepared to give favourable consideration to any application for their approval, provided they are satisfied that the Local Authority are in a position, and are ready to deal effectively with the cases notified to them." THE SANATORIUM QUESTION THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD'S DECISION. In my last Annual Report it was stated that the General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Asylumns Board had under consideration a memorial addressed to the Managers by the Metropolitan Branch of the Society of Medical Officers of Health ... on the subject of the provision of hospital accommodation for the treatment and isolation of patients suffering from pulmonary phthisis. The prayer of the said Memorial was:— " (a) That an Order of the Local Government Board be " obtained to make Section 5 of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, " applicable to the case of ' poor persons ' suffering from pulmonary " phthisis (consumption); and, if necessary, " (6) That an Act be obtained to make the provisions of " Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, applicable " to pulmonary phthisis (consumption), as if such disease were " therein mentioned as well as ' fever or smallpox or diphtheria.' " The Metropolitan Asylums Board forwarded a copy of the Memorial to the Local Government Board in April, 1905. It was further resolved to inform the Local Government Board that:— " Having regard to the uncertainty which prevails as to the " probable number of patients who would come under the schemes " referred to in the memorial, and to the great prospective cost to " the ratepayers of the Metropolis, the Managers will be glad to "receive the judgment of the Local Government Board upon the " prayer of the memorial referred to." At the meeting of the Managers on the 31st March, the Board's "judgment" was read as follows :— 26 Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 22ncl March, 1906. Sir,—I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 19th ultimo, with its enclosures, with reference to the suggested establishment by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylum District of sanatoria for the treatment of patients suffering from phthisis. I am directed to inform the Managers that the subject has received much careful consideration on the part of the Board, but that the information at present before them does not appear to afford sufficient justification for the very heavy outlay which would be involved in the proposal. At the same time, I am to forward for the information of the Managers a copy of a communication which the Board have received from Sir William Broadbent on the subject. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sd.) J. S. DAVY, Asst. Secretary. The Clerk to Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums District. The communication from Sir William Broadbent adverted to was as follows :— 84, Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, W. 7th February, 1906. Sir,:—Since I sent you a copy of the Memorial which I addressed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board on the subject of Tuberculosis, I have learnt that this body is too extensively associated with Poor Law Administration to act as a Tuberculosis Authority for non-pauper classes. I was misled by the fact that Fever Cases are sent to the Hospitals of the Board, whether pauper or not, and I was not aware that, being elected by the Guardians, the Metropolitan Asylums Board could not exercise the coordinating authority reqiiired in order to bring to bear on the prevention of consumption all the agencies which would have to work together. A consideration which influenced me greatly was that the Board has some thousands of empty beds which might be utilised for the care, treatment, and isolation of sufferers from consumption. The Authority must evidently be sought elsewhere. There are many hundreds of members of the industrial classes lying dying in their homes 27 from consumption. Impoverished by the diseases, they cannot be properly fed and cared for themselves, and they are preparing fresh victims in their families by the double process of privation and contagion. A great deal could be done to diminish this suffering and waste of life at very little expense. The agencies are in existence; all that is needed is to combine and direct their efforts. I remain, yours faithfully, (Sd.) W. H. BROADBENT. The Right Hon. John Burns, M.P. 28 TABLE I.

Diphtheria post Scarlatina 19th Nov. 59 The corrected number of notifications would be— Poplar 326 — 15 = 311 or 5.18 per 1000 living Bromley 463 — 16 = 447 or 6.64 ,, Bow 323 — 13 = 310 or 7.25 ,, Borough of Poplar 1112 — 44 = 1068 or 6.28 ,, In the course of the year 1906 it will be seen no fewer than 44 patients or a percentage on the total admissions of 6 3 were, after admission at the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certificates upon which they were removed to hospital. The percentage on the total scarlet fever cases was 4.02, diphtheria cases 4.08, and enteric fever cases 11.62. Amongst the 23 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 2 of erythema, 1 of tonsilitis, 3 of rotheln, 2 of varicella, 1 of urticaria, 3 of measles, ] of lichen, 1 of suppurative adenitis, 1 of acute nephritis, and 1 of tubercular meningitis. Amongst the 10 cases wrongly certified as diphtheria were 1 of tonsilitis, 1 of pneumonia, 1 of stomatitis, and 1 of syphilis. Amongst the 10 cases wrongly certified as enteric fever were 3 of pneumonia, 2 of meningitis, 1 of abdominal tumor, 1 of ulcerative endocarditis. In the course of the year 1906 no fewer than 2,151 patients against 2,157 in 1905, 1,993 in 1904, 1,913 in 1903, and 2,108 in 1902, or a percentage on the total admissions of 8.3 in 1906, 9.04 in 1905, 10.7 in 1904, 10.4 in 1903, and 8.6 in 1902 were, after admission to the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certificates upon which they were removed to hospital. The number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar and London for the years 1899—1906 and removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals, have been as follows:— Percentage of mistakes in total admissions. Poplar. London. 1899 49 cases 8.4 6.3 1900 60 „ 7.3 7.9 1901 131 „ 13.1 9.2 1902 93 „ 6.3 8.6 1903 46 „ 6.5 10.4 1904 54 „ 5.5 10.7 1905 57 „ 4.7 9.04 1906 44 „ 6.3 8.3 Bacteriological Examinations. Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from 60 throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever bacteriologically examined. (See pages 91 and 94.) Arrangements are made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department.* Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. One case of measles was connected with a milkshop in Poplar. Four cases of scarlet fever, one of measles and one of typhoid fever were connected with milkshops in Bromley. Two cases of scarlet fever, two of diphtheria and two of erysipelas were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected, † Fifty-one premises with outworkers were‡ connected with infectious cases notified, 8 in Poplar, 17 in Bromley, and 26 in Bow—21 scarlet fever, 6 diphtheria, 5 typhoid fever, 19 erysipelas. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Twenty-two cases of measles§ (5 Poplar, 5 Bromley, and 12 Bow) were also connected with outworkers' premises, and where work was found on the premises it was disinfected before being returned if there were any likelihood of infection, but there is no power to prevent work being executed on outworkers' premises where measles exists. For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 79. * As it is possible that the medical applications to a throat before a patient arrives at a hospital may interfere with the bacteriological examination which would be made at the hospital, and this examination may not agree with that made prior to the removal of the patient, the Secretary of the London Hospital was communicated with requesting that instructions might be given when cases of Diphtheria or Typhoid Fever are notified from that Institution in which bacteriological examinations are made, the result of the examination be written on the notification, and, in the event of a patient being removed to an Infectious Disease Hospital, the result of the examination be written also on the removal certificate. † See page 124. ‡ See pages 116 to 119. § See page 99. 61 ALPHABETICAL STREET LIST OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

The General Powers Bill of the London County Council passed the third reading in the House of Lords on 16th July. The Ambulance Clauses (23, 24 and 25) had been struck out by the Select Committee on the ground of the inadequacy of the scheme proposed by the Council. The City Corporation opposed the clauses on the ground that they, and not the County Council, should have power to deal with such a matter in the City itself. The Secretary of State has decided to appoint a Committee to inquire what steps should be taken with a view to providing a service for dealing with cases of accident and illness occurring in the streets. A Committee of three has now been appointed, viz., Sir Kenelm Digby, G.C.B., K.C. (Chairman), who may be regarded as representing the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police, Sir William Collins, M.D., M.P., representing the County Council, and the Earl of Stamford, who, as a former Manager, and member of the Ambulance Committee, may be held to represent the Metropolitan Asylums Board, with its unequalled experience as ambulance authority. The reference to the Committee is, " to inquire as to the provision made for dealing with cases of accident and sudden illness occurring in streets and public places within the Metropolis, and to report." I understand that an ambulance service for the Corporation of the City of London will come into operation early in the year 1907, and that motor vehicles are to be employed. 69 DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT.

Balance Sheet and Stability of Fluid : Germicidal and Antiseptic Peopeeties. The plant has now been working satisfactorily for twelve months, and is a complete success. I am pleased to find the statement which was made when the introduction of this enterprise was suggested, that " the health of the Borough would suffer if such a disinfectant were introduced," has, happily, not proved true, for the annual notification rate per 1,000 living in the Borough was 6'2 against that of 7.5 for London for the year 1906. The death rate of the Borough of Poplar being 17.5 per 1,000 living. I am very conscious that the step initiated has proved itself overwhelmingly satisfactory from every point of view, particularly that of the public health of the district during the period for which the plant has been at work, in spite of the unwarranted and unfair attacks made by the unofficial press on a subject of which they could have no practical knowledge. " It nearly always happens, truth, long unrecognised, ends by overcoming the systematic resistance, the absurd prejudices and the presumptuous incredulity of its opponents." The successful issue of the scheme was greatly due to the very able assistance and support afforded me by the members of the late Public Health and Housing Committee in general, and particularly to Mr. Councillor Thorne, J.P., the present Mayor of Poplar, and the Chairman of the then Works Committee, Mr. Councillor A. G. Smith, the Chairman of the then Public Health and Housing Committee, and John Bussey, Esq., J.P., late Mayor of Poplar, and the Chairman of the then Electricity Committee, who at considerable inconvenience to themselves accepted the responsibility of representing the Council on a visit of inspection of plant at Rolleville, near Havre, France, and what they observed on that occasion assured them of a successful issue of the scheme, as proposed. My best thanks are due to Mr. Bowden, the chief electrical engineer (who also accompanied the representatives of the Council to Rolleville), for the kindly words of cheer which he gave during the exceedingly trying time when endeavours were being made to make the apparatus work simply and automatically, and to render the fluid stable by simple means 71 in order to justify the recommendation to the Council to expend public money for such a venture. The system adopted at Poplar is to mix a certain quantity of fluid in an elevated tank and then to allow this fluid to flow through four double troughs, or cells, placed one above the other, so that the liquid descends continuously by gravity. Each trough is divided laterally by a partition, and in each of the two divisions five distinct " elements " (consisting of one positive and two negative plates) are suspended (Fig. 1). The positive plates are of thin platinum wire wound upon slate slabs and the negative plates are of zinc. There are thus four troughs, each containing ten "elements," or 40 cells in all. The liquid enters through the funnel visible towards the top left-hand side of the illustration, passes along the front division of the top trough, back through the division behind, over a weir and into a sub division, from which it is drawn off by the bent glass tube discharging into the second funnel; it passes along the front division, back through the division behind, over the weir into the pocket of the second trough, and so on to the final bent tube, which discharges it into a carboy. A bottle arranged at the right-hand side of the tier of cells (shewn) supplies the sodium hydroxide used as a preservative, which flows drop by drop into the carboy as it is filling and serves to neutralise free hypochlorous acid. As the liquid passes through the troughs it is subjected to the action of a regulated current of 15 to 17 amperes at 230 to 250 volts, being 5 7 to 6 2 volts per cell. During the run the liquid in the carboy is thoroughly stirred by means of an ebonite rod provided with rubber flaps (shewn). The objects aimed at to make the working of the apparatus and the manufacture of the fluid become simple and automatic were as follows:— (1) To see at a glance whether the apparatus is working properly. This is accomplished by a gauge glass in front of the large tank and another gauge glass on the little supply tank (Fig. 1), the first to show the quantity of salt liquor capable of being acted upon, and the second to show if the liquor is running properly into and out of the small supply tank, as the chloride of magnesium contains impurities which are likely to block up the valve of the small cistern and the taps leading to and from the same. A thermometer is kept in the small supply tank to see the temperature of the salt liquor, and another thermometer is placed at the outgo of the last electrolyser; the difference of the temperature gives the rise in temperature due to the eloctrolysis, and which is found, when the apparatus is working satisfactorily, to be under 30°F. The small tank is necessary to keep a constant flow of the fluid into the electrolysers. When first the apparatus was erected the fluid used to become unduly hot on account of the flow 72 slowing down through the diminution of the head of water in the large tank. The tank had ultimately to be raised on to girders, and a small supply tank fixed at a lower level. (2) The liquor to be electrolysed in the large tank had to be stirred from time to time to keep the mixture of an equal gravity throughout, more especially as for obvious reasons a certain quanity of a solution of sodium hydroxide is added. To keep the liquor stirred a large broad drilled plate of galvanized iron is used, one end of which acts as the fulcrum when the other is lifted up by means of a chain leading over pulleys to the ground, so that the attendant has only now and again to pull the chain to lift the plate up and down instead of running up and down the ladder and stirring the liquid with a rod. (3) It is necessary to govern the electric current, which is taken direct from the mains, on account of the density of the salt mixture to be acted upon varying from time to time owing to temperature changes and consequent changes in conductivity. This difficulty is got over by the current regulator. (Fig. 3.) (4) To prevent shocks and waste of fluid whilst changing the carboys, a special glass tap has been made. (Fig. 1.) (5) To prevent loss of available chlorine the solution of sodium hydroxide drips into a specially blown carboy at the same time as the fluid is running into it, and the two fluids are mixed with a stirrer inserted through an aperture in the neck of the carboy, and when the carboy is full a final mixing for about two minutes is given by means of a stirrer fixed to gear wheels. (Fig. 1.) Before the ebonite stirrers with rubber flaps were made, full carboys and half carboys had to be shaken rapidly for 10 minutes, and this not always with the best results as to bringing about the desired stability, for when sodium hydroxide is added the precipitate falls to the bottom, and it is necessary to render the solution milky throughout. (6) So far as oxychlorides are concerned, the apparatus in 10 months had only been taken to pieces and cleaned twice. Every day, after working, the electrolysers are emptied by means of the mud holes by removing the rubber plugs, and the fluid which is run out is kept to recharge the electrolysers. The electrolysers, after being emptied, are washed out by means of a hose, and then until the next working are kept filled with water, which softens any deposit formed upon the electrodes, and before starting work the electrolysers are emptied and washed out again, a matter which takes up a few minutes every day before and after each working. Balance Sheet and Stability of Fluid. During twelve months (the apparatus was installed at the beginning of February, 1906), some 17,000 gallons of fluid have been manufactured of a strength between 4.0 and 4.5 grammes of available chlorine per litre—1,000. Fig. 1. Electrolyser in Situ. Shewing elevated tank and glass-gauge containing solution of sodium chloride aud magnesium chloride, which solution is transmitted through small ball valve cistern fitted with glass-gauge (shewn on left top of platform) to the four electrolysers (shewn on stage) and thence to carboys. The large tank has a mixer inside, consisting of a flat drilled piece of galvanised iron, operated from ground level by a pulley (at right of stage). On the left-hand side of Electrolysers is jar containing solution of sodium hydroxide which drips automatically into funnel in carboy during filling of carboy with the electrolysed fluid. A thermometer is suspended in the small supply tank and in the last electrolyser. The special carboys are shewn with the improved stirrer, and on the right is seen stirrer which is used in carboys when filled. Fig. 2. The Saturators in Situ.

At top are the voltmeter and ammeter, in the centre the unit meter, and the switch handle below. On the right is the Rheostat or current regulator. 73 The fluid has been issued to the public in pint bottles from the depots at Old Ford Road, Bickmore Street, and West Ferry Road, and from the manufacturing depot, Violet Road. For watering the roads, market places, etc., the Works Department has been furnished with 9,116 gallons, at a charge of a 1d. per gallon. The Poplar Guardians, for their Institutions inside and outside the Borough, and the Managers of the Sick Asylums, Blackwall and Devon's Road, have been supplied with 568 gallons during the last four months of the year's working, for which no charge has been made. There have been required 2,543 units of electrical energy at l½d. per unit, four tons of salt have been used at 24s. per ton, and two tons of chloride of magnesium, at £3 17s. 6d. per ton, Caustic Soda costing £4 0s. 8d., water, together with that used for washing out the electrolysers and for other purposes, £2 15s. 8d., including meter rent.

The expenditure for bottles could also be lessened if applicants brought their own bottles, which could be filled directly from the carboys—there being no need for a specially made and coloured bottle as there was for the carbolic acid.

Experiments carried out have shown that samples of fluid prepared a year ago showed a fall of chlorine not exceeding 0.5 grammes per litre (about 10 per cent.) in the first few months, since which time the chlorine has remained quite constant.

Germicidal and Antiseptic Properties. From experiments carried out at the Royal Institute of Public Health upon "Hermitine," which is the purified electrolytic fluid for medical purposes, it is evident that the fluid manufactured at Poplar when used in about 5 per cent. solution—i.e., one ounce of fluid to 19 ounces of water—is a powerful germicide for Typhoid and Diphtheria bacilli, and that it also shows a strong destructive influence on the Bacillus Coli in strong faecal emulsions. At the Royal Institute of Public Health, the following experiment was carried out with the Poplar fluid:— "A sample of urine, freshly passed by a healthy subject, was divided into two parts, one of which was at once mixed with an equal quantity of the Poplar fluid, whilst the other part was first cooled down to room temperature, and then mixed in the same proportion with the Poplar fluid. Both mixtures were allowed to stand in open beakers at room temperature and exposed to diffused daylight. In both of them a very distinct positive reaction was shown by potassium-iodide-starch paper as late as the twenty-seventh day, after which date a definite reaction could no more be obtained. No bacterial growth developed in any of these mixtures. "Immediately after being brought into contact with decaying carcases, bad meat, putrid fish, faces or other objectionable matter, the fluid is observed to evolve chlorine; the foul smell disappears almost at once, and does not reappear if sufficient hypochlorite fluid has been employed. There can, therefore, be no doubt that after the first rapid re-action a slow, continuous evolution of chlorine takes place, so long as there is an excess either of oxydisable substances or of hypochlorites." "It is thus evident that it is the presence of organic matter which sets the reaction going and commences the evolution of nascent chlorine. An excess of nascent chlorine being therefore produced, this will permeate the liquid and will come in close contact with the microbes present, thus leading to their more or less speedy destruction: for it must be borne in mind that, according to the fundamental experiments of Kronig and Paul, nascent chlorine is one of the strongest disinfectants we possess. The fact of a continuous decomposition of this kind going on is proved by the observation of gas being developed, and by the distinct smell of chlorine." 77 CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897.* CLEANSING OF VERMINOUS CHILDREN. PROPOSED BILL. With respect to the bathing of verminous persons at the Shelter, to prevent the bathers tampering with the gas of the geysers, stop cocks were fixed outside the bathrooms. At times, on account of the number of bathers, the two baths in the upper Shelter had to be used; therefore means of communication was made between the bathrooms and the attendants' room in the lower Shelter. Better ventilation was afforded to the bathroom of the lower Shelter. The three geysers were overhauled and funnels were fixed to convey any fumes to the open air. So far as the means of communication between the bathrooms of the upper Shelter and the attendants' room in the lower Shelter is concerned, communication is necessary, in case a bather is taken ill whilst the bathing attendant is away with the bather's clothes at the disinfecting apparatus. During the year 856 persons had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfected. Cleansing of Verminous Children. On October 12th, I received a communication from the Medical Officer (Education) of the London County Council, as follows:— " A scheme for cleansing the heads of children attending the Schools under the supervision of the Council has been in operation for some considerable time. There is now little difficulty in regard to the heads, but we find children attending school with verminous body and clothing. The following scheme has been applied in several districts with marked success:— "The Nurse visits the Schools, examines the children and notes the names and addresses of all who are unfit to be in School owing to their verminous condition. In some cases the names and addresses are forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health, whose Inspectors call at the homes and leave a copy of card (No. 1). In other cases the Medical Officers of Health furnish me with a supply of cards (No. 2) which the Head Teachers send to the parents. * For cleansing of verminous rooms, see page 148. G 78 "I shall be glad to know whether you would be willing to co-operate if this scheme were put in force in your district, and if so, what methods you would like to adopt." "Card (No. 1)," which emanates from the Council of the Borough of St. Marylebone (Public Health Department), is to the following effect:— "This card entitles of to the use of the disinfecting station and a hot bath, etc., at No. 27, Grove Eoad, N.W., and is available from to between the hours of 9 and 11 a.m., and 2 and 4 p.m." "Card (No. 2)," which emanates from the Borough of St. Pancras (Public Health Department), reads as follows:— " Children's Baths. Entrance from St. Pancras Gardens, N.W. "Please admit sex age of the.... Department of School, to a hot bath, etc., at the Children's Baths, St. Pancras Gardens, St. Pancras Road, N.W., between the hours of 9.30 a.m. and 5.0 p.m. (Saturdays 1.0 p.m.) "Date of issue of Bath Card Signature of Teacher or other responsible person Address of do "This Bath Card is to be retained by the child, as it is available for more than one bath, according to the instruction of the Attendant, and must be shown to Attendant, Teacher, or other responsible person when asked for." In reply to the foregoing communication, a letter was sent to the Medical Officer (Education) as follows:— "There are baths in connection with the Council's Shelters and Disinfecting Station which are used for the cleansing of verminous persons, and whenever communications are received from you endeavour is made to induce the mothers to take their children to the baths, but I am sorry to say the mothers will not do so, although in nearly every case they are willing to have the clothes and bedding disinfected, which is accordingly done. "I think the calling at the house is the better system, as then the Officer of the Local Authority can make arrangements, leave the card at the time of his visit and inspect the premises and articles therein, so that the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, may be put into operation if necessary. I 79 presume if the Teachers or Nurses give the cards they will from time to time examine them (the cards) to see if the children have had baths, but then the Officers of the Local Authority will not know of the verminous houses unless a notice be received from you at the same time; or it maybe a good system for your Teachers and Nurses to give the cards and a communication sent to the Officers of the Local Authority; but in any case the Officers of the Local Authority, to cause permanent good, must know of the matter in order that the premises and contents can be inspected, and pressure brought to bear on the parents, if necessary. "However, I am only too willing to co-operate with you in any scheme which you may find works well for the good of the community." Proposed Bill—Cleansing of Children and Inmates of Common Lodging-houses. In the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1907 (Part VII.—Cleansing of Verminous Persons), it is proposed to deal with the cleansing of children attending school and their clothing, and also with the cleansing of inmates of common lodging-houses and their clothing. PORT SANITARY AUTHORITIES. Notice was received, dated 11th April, from the Bristol Port Sanitary Authority, of a passenger proceeding to the Poplar District from the s.s. "Macduff," from which vessel a case of Small-pox was landed at Aden on 17th March. Notice was received, dated 12th April, from the Cardiff Port Sanitary Authority, of a passenger proceeding to the Poplar District from the s.s. " Kenley," on which vessel there had been cases of Small-pox. Notice was received from the -Commandant, Discharge Depot, Gosport, dated 24th April, of a soldier proceeding to the Poplar District from the s.s. "Ionian," on which vessel a case of Bubonic Plague had occurred, and was landed at Aden on 6th April. Notice was received on 27th April from the Officer in Command, E.H.A., Manchester, of a soldier arriving on the s.s. "Ionian,'' and 80 ceeding to the Poplar District, on which vessel a case of Plague had occurred. Notice was received on 9th May from the Commandant, Discharge Depot, Gosport, that a soldier was proceeding to the Poplar District from H.I.M.S. "Dufferin," on which vessel cases of Measles had occurred. Upon enquiry at the address given the soldier was stated to be not known. On 29th June information was received through the London County Council that a person apparently in good health was proceeding to Poplar from the s.s. "Gaelic," which had arrived at Liverpool from W.C. S. America, and that a case of Small-pox had occurred on board. Upon enquiry at the address given, the person was stated to be not known. On 6th July notice was received from the London Port Sanitary Medical Officer that a case of Small-pox had occurred on board the s.s. "Goorkha," during the voyage from Cape Town, and that 30 persons were proceeding, apparently in good health, to addresses in the Poplar District from the vessel; also on 7th July, from the same source, information was received of another person proceeding from the above-mentioned vessel to Poplar. Enquiries were made at the various addresses given, and in one instance the passenger was stated to be not known, the Port Medical Officer being so informed on 7th July. On 9th July information was received through the Medical Officer of Health for Stepney that two passengers from the s.s. "Goorkha," on which vessel a case of Small-pox had occurred, had arrived thereon from Cape Town, and were proceeding, apparently in good health, to addresses in Poplar. On 3rd July a male, aged 45 years, was notified as having Enteric Fever at an address in Poplar, and was removed to Hospital as suffering from that disease. Upon enquiry at the address given, it was ascertained the patient had come home on the previous Sunday (1st July) in the s.s. "Ingeli" from Durban. The Port of London Medical Officer was informed of these facts on 4th July. Notice was received from the Port of London Sanitary Authority of three of the crew of the s.s. " Arabia," from Bombay, coming to the Poplar District. A case of Plague had occurred on board during the voyage. One address given was not in the Borough and at another address the individual was not known. 81 ANTHRAX (WOOLSORTERS' DISEASE). A case of Anthrax was notified in a male, aged 31 years, who had been living in the Parish of Bromley. I visited the premises, and immediate disinfection of the room with contents was carried out. No information being able to be obtained from the friends of the patient, I interviewed the patient at the London Hospital and learned he was a Dock Labourer, and had been working at loading hides in St. Katherine Dock on the s.s. "Alice," belonging to Messrs. Haller, of Hull. The patient was taken ill on Friday the 8th June, became worse, and was admitted into the London Hospital on the 11th inst. I telegraphed and wrote particulars of the case to the Medical Officer of the Port of Hull Sanitary Authority, where, he was informed, the ship had gone to with the hides. Particulars of the case were sent to the Chief Inspector of Factories at the Home Office, the Secretary of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and to Dr. Williams, the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London. The Medical Officer for the Port of Hull, in answer to the telegram, stated in a letter dated the 1-lth June:— "I inspected the hides on arrival of the vessel this morning, and they have been thoroughly disinfected externally. I have also written to the consignees, requesting them to take precautions for the employes when they are unpacked. Two lots are going forward to Leeds, so I have also notified the Medical Officer of Health of that city." PUERPERAL FEVER. Eight cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, three Poplar and five Bow. One Poplar case was treated in the Sick Asylum, and two of the Bow cases were admitted into the same institution, and one Bow case went to the London Hospital. Three of the Bow cases died. 82 SMALL-POX. A case of Small-pox occurred in a man aged 23 years, a Swede, and removed from the Dispensary of the Seamen's Institute in Jeremiah Street. The patient had been living in a seamen's lodging-house in Pennyfields. He was one of the crew of the s.s. "Tomoana," from New Zealand, which called at Barcelona on 4th April, having touched at Las Palmas, and arrived at Barry on 11th April. Patient went on shore at Barcelona, but not at Las Palmas. Patient slept in Cardiff on the night of the 11th, but could not describe where, and arrived in London on the 12th April. Patient was vaccinated in infancy, and the case was one of modified Small-pox—Varioloid. The case was removed and kept under observation at South Wharf from 20th to 23rd April, and then removed to the Smallpox Hospital. The Medical Officer of the Barry Port Sanitary Authority was immediately informed by telegram of the case. The Dispensary at Jeremiah Street was without delay disinfected, and the necessary disinfection was forthwith carried out at the seamen's lodging-house in Pennyfields, the inmates, 16 in number, were vaccinated, and 6 of them went to the Council's Shelter and had baths and their clothes disinfected. Three other contacts were also vaccinated. A male, a seaman on the lightship " Girdler," lying off Margate, was reported on June 23rd to be suffering from Small-pox, and was removed to the hospital of the Port of London Sanitary Authority at Denton. The patient had been living at Montreal Buildings up till the morning of June the 15th, and had been working at Trinity Wharf. He was revaccinated three years ago. Upon the receipt of this information the premises and contents thereof were immediately disinfected. On June 25th the patient was reported by the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London Sanitary Authority to be suffering from Chicken-pox and not Small-pox. 83 VACCINATION.

Bather less than a year ago we commented on a report issued by the Metropolitan Asylums Board on the subject of "return" cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria—cases, that is to say, which arise owing to infection conveyed by patients discharged as cured from the hospitals over which the Board presides.* That report was drawn up by Dr. A. G. E. Cameron on the basis of returns extending over a period of 13 months, and embodied certain suggestions calculated to diminish risk from this source of infection. The period of time covered by the report was, however, obviously insufficient to allow any very certain conclusions to be reached, and we expressed the hope that further investigations would be made into a matter which so deeply concerns the welfare of the community. We are glad to see that this view has commended itself to the authorities of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and that the results of further study of the problem are now available. The present report is written by Dr. F. M. Turner, the medical investigator for the Board, and is distinguished by the same industry and ability which characterised Dr. Cameron's work. Unfortunately, although the figures for three years are analysed, thus affording a more trustworthy statistical basis, the practical conclusions reached are no more encouraging than those of the former observer. Indeed, the result of the present investigation is to contradict or neutralise some of the conclusions which the earlier series of figures appeared to warrant. Among the principal points emphasised in Dr. Cameron's report were the following two—that a large proportion of so-called "return" cases were in reality the result of mere coincidence—instances of purely accidental outbreaks of scarlet fever in houses to which cured patients had recently returned from hospital; and that in the majority of cases in which infection had really been conveyed by the discharged patient rhinorrhcea had been a feature of his attack, such nasal discharge being, therefore, the probable means by which infection was carried. The fact that "return" cases were most frequently met with in autumn and winter seemed to favour this mode of infection, as suggesting that a chill with consequent increase of coryza might have been contracted as a result of exposure to the cold outer air. Dr. Turner has carefully tabulated statistics of 1,000 consecutive cases at the Eastern Hospital, at which a * The Lancet, Nov. 18th, 1905, p. 1487. 86 careful record was kept of all cases showing rhinorrhœa, and he finds that while among 397 cases without complications of any kind 3.27 per cent. caused infection on returning to their homes, among 343 cases with rhinorrhœa only 2.62 per cent. proved infectious. Among 256 cases with other complications only 1.54 per cent. caused further outbreaks. The figures certainly appear to negative the suggestion that sufferers from nasal discharges are those most likely to convey infection. On further scrutiny of the figures there is, however, one point at least which deserves consideration in order that we may be sure that we are not drawing erroneous inferences. Thus it appears from the tabular statement showing the dates of discharge of the 1,000 cases used for this inquiry that, whereas the "return" infectivity rates for cases without complications or with other complications than rhinorrhœa discharged after less than eight weeks' detention were respectively 3.6 and 3 per cent., cases with nasal discharge similiarly treated showed a percentage of over 6.6 "return" cases. The low proportion of infective cases among the whole number of cases of rhinorrhœa may be due to the fact that no less than 180 patients who had exhibited this complication were detained in hospital over ten weeks, by which time the nasal infection had very probably become attenuated. In view of these considerations it would seem at all events premature to discard Dr. Cameron's warning as to the special danger attaching to these cases, at all events when they are discharged from hospital after only a short period of detention. It is to be regretted that at present the casual organism of scarlet fever is unknown, so that bacteriological examination cannot afford any assistance in determining the presence or absence of infection. It is remarkable, however, that in the case of diphtheria, in which the bacillus is easily found, insistence on a free bill of health from the bacteriologist has not tended to lessen the number of " return" cases arising at the institutions enforcing this method of precaution. Another feature of this recent report which is the reverse of reassuring is the practical contradiction of Dr. Cameron's contention that a large number of "return" cases of scarlet fever are pure coincidences. It thus appears that the public danger from discharged cases of this disease is very real. On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that at the present day scarlet fever is a comparatively mild ailment—it has even been suggested by Dr. L. C. Parkes that it might safely be treated as measles is, the patients not being removed to isolation hospitals. Dr. Turner's figures do not tend to support the belief that the mortality of "return" cases is greater than that of other patients, a suggestion that was in any case contrary to probability on theoretical grounds. A somewhat curious point in which the present report is in 87 ment with the former is that a larger proportion of infecting cases is found among those patients who are detained for periods varying between 8 and 12 weeks than among those whose stay in hospital is either shorter than 8 or longer than 10 weeks. It is legitimate to suggest that the reason for this peculiarity is to be seen in the fact that cases discharged in less than 8 weeks are instances of mild infection, in which the power of contagion is also mild, while, on the other hand, a detention of over 10 weeks usually gives time for the infective agent to die out. Another point in which the two reports are in accord is in uprooting the ancient belief in the special contagiousness of the peeling stage of the disease. We read in the present report: " The above figures are, therefore, what we should expect if late desquamation has no relation to power of conveying infection. If any such connexion exists it must be insignificant in amount." It is, however, unfortunate that while taking away this old criterion of infectivity our more recent mentors supply no other test to take its place. The difficulties of investigating in this direction are, however, very considerable in view of the multiplicity of fever hospitals and of the necessarily promiscuous manner in which cases from any one district are sent to one or another of them according to the existence of vacant beds. " Return " cases from one hospital are thus often sent to another, and the difficulty of tracing sources of infection is greatly increased, We congratulate the able medical officers of the Asylums Board on the extent to which they have overcome the difficulties presented, and hope that the subject of " return " infection may continue to receive attention at their hands in years to come. The matter is one upon which the public requires precise medical guidance. CONTINUED AND TYPHUS FEVERS.

Admitted into the Brook Hospital on 6th March, but was certified on the 30th March as not suffering from Typhoid Fever nor any other notifiable disease. A positive Widal re-action was obtained prior to the removal of the patient. There is every reason to believe that this case was probably one of an abortive form of Typhoid Fever, although the patient in the hospital shewed no clinical signs of Enteric Fever, nor other diseases, and two Widal re-actions carried out at the hospital gave negative results, yet on the 10th, 16th, 21st, 29th and 29th March brothers and sisters (five in all) of the patient were removed to the same hospital suffering from Typhoid Fever.

Fifty-three specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever were forwarded to the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine. In 27 instances (50.9 per cent.) the Typhoid (Widal) reaction was obtained. Three Poplar parishioners died from Typhoid Fever, 5 fatal cases occurred among the Bromley patients, and 3 among the Bow, making a total of 11 deaths in 76 cases.

See pages 56, 57, 58 and 59 as to cases of Diphtheria admitted into Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals which were certified as not having the complaint. No deductions have been made in respect of these patients. School Certificates and Bacteriological Examinations. The 69 cases in Poplar were notified from 61 premises, the 67 cases in Bromley from 50 premises, and the 109 cases in Bow from 90 houses, and of these premises the drains were found to be defective in 18 instances—9 Poplar, 3 Bromley, and 6 Bow. The following communication was received on 24th November from the Medical Officer (Education) London County Council respecting the giving certificates of freedom from infectiousness in cases which were actually at the time "carriers" of diphtheria. "Throughout the past summer considerable difficulties have arisen 95 during the prevalence of diphtheria in different districts, from medical men frequently giving certificates of freedom from infectiousness in cases which were actually at the time "carriers" of diphtheria. The matter was discussed at a meeting of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, and the following resolutions passed:— "i. That in the opinion of this Branch it is not possible in the absence of a bacteriological examination to decide that a child is free from infection of diphtheria. "ii. In the event of the prevalence of diphtheria in any district, any child excluded for sore throat should not be re-admitted to school without a medical certificate of freedom from infection, based on a bacteriological examination. "Since then the London County Council have considered the matter and passed the following resolution:— "That the Education Committee be authorised to refuse, during the presence of diphtheria in any district, re-admission to school of children excluded on account of diphtheria or sore throat until such children shall have obtained a medical certificate of freedom from infection, based on a bacteriological examination. "In the event of diphtheria becoming prevalent in a district the teachers will therefore be instructed not to re-admit any child, who is absent from sore throat or diphtheria, until they receive a certificate of freedom from diphtheria, based on the results of a bacteriological examination. The Medical Officers of Health will be kept informed of any such orders to teachers. "We propose to use a card for such cases when they are sent home from school, giving the reason for exclusion, and stating that the certificate can be signed by their own doctor, or, if necessary, the Medical Officer of Health can be communicated with and will give such certificate, when the child is free from infection, without cost. "The present occasion may possibly afford an opportunity for the Medical Officers of Health communicating with local practitioners as to the importance of bacteriological recognition of diphtheria, and the fact that when diphtheria is prevalent only certificates based on bacteriological diagnosis will be accepted at once as satisfactory. It may be noted in passing that several cases of "carriers" are known to us where doctors 96 have within a few hours submitted swabs to various laboratories with negative results.0 "The necessity of a gradual education of the public, and also the profession, to the importance of this step forward will justify its application being gradual and only to schools where diphtheria is actually prevalent and threatening." London County Council. Education Offices, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 190 . School. Dear Sir (or Madam), While Diphtheria is present in the district I shall be glad if you will exclude any child suffering from sore throat, and forward the name and address to the Medical Officer (Education), the Medical Officer of Health for the District, and the Divisional Superintendent. The child should not be allowed to resume attendance until a certificate (based upon bacteriological examination) has been furnished, stating that it is free from infection. This precaution is necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. If necessary this certificate can be obtained from the local Medical Officer of Health. This rule will apply until further instructions are sent you. Yours faithfully, JAMES KERR, M.D., Medical Officer (Education). * The Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, Chelsea Gardens, Chelsea Bridge Road, London, S.W. September 28th, 1906. Dear Sir,—In reference to your letter of 25th September re diagnosis of a fatal case of Diphtheria. It is not uncommon to fail to find diphtheria bacilli in swabs taken from the throats of undoubted clinical cases of diphtheria. In an enquiry made into this point by Caiger & Pakes (British Medical Journal, 1901. Vol. II., p. 758), such a failure occurred in no less than 25 of 78 cases. Of the swabs received here not more than 20 per cent. give positive results. I imagine that this failure is not infrequently due to the swab not being taken 97 London County Council. Notice to The Parent or Guardian. From The Head Teacher Dept., School. Diphtheria being present in the district, and your child having exhibited some symptoms of the disease, namely, sore throat, you are requested, in the interests of your own child and of the other children, to keep at home. A medical certificate, based upon bacteriological examination, stating that is free from infection, should be obtained before presenting the child for re-admission to school. This certificate can be obtained, free of cost, from the Medical Officer of Health for the district by those who have no private doctor. Show this card to the doctor. Date Signature. The following letter was addressed to all practitioners within the Borough:— Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Department, Bow Road, E. 27th November, 1908. Dear Sir, Re Diphtheria. The London County Council have considered and passed the following resolution, viz.:— That the Education Committee be authorised to refuse, during the presence of diphtheria in any district, re-admission to school of children excluded on account of diphtheria or sore throat until such properly. It is essential that the swab should be firmly rubbed on any patch of membrane and not contaminated by contact with the teeth and anterior parts of the mouth. This is, of course, difficult to do with many young children without causing them some distress. There is nothing fresh in the way of directions as to taking swabbings. Whether the delay in the swab reaching us was responsible for the failure to detect diphtheritic bacillus is doubtful. They are often easily cultivated from dried-up swabs several days old. As a matter of routine, however, it is doubtless best that they should be submitted to examination as soon as possible. (Signed) A. E. BOYCOTT, 98 children have obtained a medical certificate of freedom from infection, based on a bacteriological examination. In the event of diphtheria becoming prevalent in a district the school teachers will be instructed not to re-admit any child, who is absent from sore throat or diphtheria, until they receive a certificate of freedom from diphtheria, based on the results of a bacteriological examination. Therefore, might I ask you to kindly co-operate with the Education Department of the London County Council and myself in this matter, and be good enough to inform the parents of any patient whom you may be called upon to treat that before such patient can be considered free from infection and allowed to return to school and mix with other children a bacteriological examination of the throat must be made. Thanking you in anticipation for your kind co-operation for preventing the spread of such a terrible disease. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, FRED. WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health.

For death rates see Tables XVIII. and XIX., page 47. At the end of the year there were 978 entries in the Measles Register (358 Poplar, 404 Bromley, and 216 Bow), representing the number of premises where Measles had been stated to have occurred. Upon enquiry 13 cases were stated to have recovered, 24 were found not to be cases, 65 were stated to be suffering from a different disease other than the one notified, 56 wrong addresses (empty houses and unknown) were given, 16 moved away before enquiries could be made, and 44 were stated to have no sickness in the house. So that practically as far as is known 892 cases of Measles occurred in the Borough. Two cases of Measles occurred in connection with milk shops, one Poplar and one Bromley. 423 rooms were disinfected by the Public Health Department, and the remainder were disinfected by the tenants, medical practitioners giving certificates that disinfection had been satisfactorily carried out. Twentythree cases removed before a certificate of recovery was received. Respecting outworkers and the articles disinfected by the Council, see pages 60 and 69. London County Council Regulations respecting exclusion of Children from School. A communication was received in April stating that the London County Council had adopted the undermentioned regulations for the exclusion from school of children suffering from measles, or coming from houses where measles exists:— "Children suffering from measles must be excluded for at least one month. "Children coming from houses where measles exists, but who are not themselves suffering from the disease should be dealt with as follows:— (i.) A child attending other than an infants' school who has bad measles need not be excluded from attendance at school. (ii.) A child attending other than an infants' school who has not had measles must be excluded from attendance at school 101 until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the first case. (iii.) A child attending an infants' school, whether or not it has had measles, must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the last case." This procedure superseded the existing regulation (Sub-section (v.) of Section (c) of Article 111 of the Provisional School Management Code). Closure of Class Eooms. Communication was received from the' Medical Officer (Education) London County Council, on 8th June, that Classroom A of the Infants' Department at Ricardo Street School would be closed until 25th June, on account of Measles, and that he considered disinfection unnecessary, and that the School Keeper had been instructed to do the usual cleansing. Communication was received from the Medical Officer (Education) London County Council on 12th June that Classroom C of the Infants' Department of Malmesbury Road School would be closed for a period of 14 days on account of Measles, and on 14th June a letter was received that he did not consider disinfection necessary and that the School Keeper had been instructed to do the usual cleansing. On 30th June and 11th July letters were received from the Medical Officer (Education) of the London County Council that Classroom A of the Infants' Department of the Byron Street School, and Classroom A of the Infants' Department of the Upper North Street School, had been respectively closed until Monday, the 16th July, and until after the summer holidays, on account of Measles. In each case it was stated the schoolkeeper had been instructed to carry out the necessary cleansing. Notice was received on 19th July from the Medical Officer (Education) London County Council that Classroom C of Knapp Road School Infants' Department is closed until after the summer holidays on account of the prevalence of Measles. Infectious Diseases Hospitals and Isolation. The Battersea Borough Council made a representation to the Local Government Board in favour of accommodation being provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the reception and treatment of cases of Measles, and asked other Borough Councils to make similar representations. 102 The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the provision of Infectious Diseases Hospitals by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for isolation and treatment of cases of Measles is not necessary or desirable, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the Local Government Board, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the Battersea Borough Council be so informed. CEREBRO SPINAL FEVER (SPOTTED FEVER.) A case of Cerebro-Spinal Fever (Spotted Fever) was certified from the London Hospital in a child aged 2½ years, a resident of Bow. Upon receipt of the information the Local Government Board was communicated with, and the premises visited. All the inmates were well and no history could be obtained as to the cause of the child's illness. He became suddenly ill whilst playing in the street on the 13th October, and the mother took him to the London Hospital on the 18th October. There were other cases of Cerebro-spinal Fever in the London Hospital at the time, but they did not belong to the Poplar District.

The others were sailing and ordinary barges. "Each boat was found to be in good order, those registered under the Acts especially so. The certificates were examined, inspections made as to overcrowding, and no fault was to be found. "The 'water vessels' and means of keeping out the bilge water, such as the pumps and bulkheads between the cargo (which was always gas liquor to be used at the tar factory in my district), and cabins were found to be in good condition, and no percolations into the cabins were known of. "No case of disease was found on any of the boats, and where the two sexes lived on board the proper conditions as to separation existed. "One registered canal boat was examined twice during the year." † Mr. Langley's 23 inspections of non-registered boats included two visits to one boat. ‡ Mr. Miners' 43 inspections of non-registered and registered boats included the inspection of three non-registered barges twice. § Mr. A. J. Field reported:— "In the case of one registered Canal boat the Master had no certificate aboard; the boat had been run down in the Thames and I 110 certificate consequently lost; the Master had forgotten to apply for a new certificate; letters written to Registration Authority and owner. "In another instance the Master had a provisional certificate until meeting of the Registration Authority. "The seams of cabin were open in the case of one boat, but she was to be laid up for repairs on her return. "Two registered boats were examined twice." || Mr. Boyce's five inspections of registered boats included two visits to one boat. WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES AND OUTWORKERS. HOME WORK REGULATION BILL. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 112 and 113. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1146, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 112, and Table C and D, pages 115 to 117. The places where the outworkers are employed were inspected all of them twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 218 and 219, and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 175 and 180. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 60. A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the 111 ance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 115 to 120) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled is without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops, and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. 112 TABLE A Table giving number of, and inspections, etc., of Bakehouses, Laundries, Workshops, Workplaces, Places where food is prepared, Milk premises, Cowsheds, Slaughter-houses, Offensive Businesses, Ice Cream premises, Registered Houses Let in Lodgings, and Homeworkers' premises.

The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a circular letter from the Home Office respecting the administration of the Home Work Provisions of the Factory Act. The communication stated that the Secretary of State desired "to bring specially before them the question of the enforcement by the Council and their officers of the provisions in the Act which deal with the subject of home work, that is, work in the manufacture, repair, &c., of articles by the worker in his or her own house." . . . "The inference cannot be avoided that in a considerable number of districts little use has been made by the Local Authorities of their important powers under the Home Work Provisions." . . . . "Outworkers form the weakest section of the labouring class, and the class in respect of which the State, from the nature of the circumstances, is least able by its officers to control the conditions of work." "If these conditions are to be effectively controlled, the Local Authorities, to whom Parliament has entrusted the duty of supervising them, must make a full use of their powers. The Secretary of State may remind the Council that in addition to the ordinary sanitary inspection under the Public Health Act of outworkers' dwellings, which is even more necessary in their case than in the case of ordinary dwellings, the following special obligations are placed on the Council:— "1. The lists of outworkers should be duly received from employers and the necessary steps taken to enforce them in case of default. 118 "2. Addresses of any outworkers in the lists who reside in other districts should be communicated to the Councils of those districts. " 3. Where insanitary conditions or dangerous infectious diseases are found on outworkers' premises, action should be taken if necessary under Sections 108, 109 and 110 of the Factory Act which give power to the Council to prohibit outwork in such premises. For this purpose outworkers' premises should be systematically visited. "4. The annual report of the Medical Officer should be sent to the Home Office. "The Secretary of State trusts that if in the past any of these duties have been imperfectly fulfilled in the Council's area, steps will be taken to remedy the omission in future." The Secretary of State forwarded with the letter a "Return (to an address of the House of Commons) as to the administration in each County and County Borough during 1904, by the Local Authorities, of the Home Work Provisions, as shown by the reports of the Medical Officers of Health sent to the Home Office, under Section 132 of the Act," giving information on specified matters, including "the number of outworkers' lists received by the Local Authority under Section 107, and the number of outworkers shown by them." A reference to the Home Work Return for 1904, accompanying the . circular, shows that, with the exception of Westminster, the inspections made in Poplar exceed those in any other London Borough, and that of eight prosecutions in London in respect of failure to supply the necessary lists of outworkers five were instituted by the Poplar Borough Council. An occupier of a workshop was summoned for not keeping in the workshop in the prescribed form and manner, and with the prescribed particulars list showing the names and addresses of his outworkers. A penalty of 10s. was inflicted, with 23s. costs. HOME WORK REGULATION BILL. The Home Work Regulation Bill is a Bill to provide the better Regulation of Home Industries, presented by Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, supported by Mr. Crooks and others, and was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed 21st February, 1907. The Bill provides that it shall not be lawful for any employer in and 119 by way of his trade to give out any work or any materials for the performance of any work in any trade or industry, to which the Act shall apply to any person to be done in any dwelling-place, unless such person is in possession of a certificate granted to him under the provisions of the Act. Any person desirous of taking in any work or materials for the performance of any work in any trade or industry to which the provisions of the Act shall apply to be done in any dwelling shall before taking in any such work apply to one of His Majesty's Inspectors of Factories for the district in which is situate the dwelling-place in which he proposes to do such work. The certificate will remain in force (with provisos) for a period of six months, and is to be renewed at the expiration of this period. The inspection of the premises is to be undertaken by ELM. Inspector of Factories. TABLE E. Registered Workshops. Workshops on the Register (s. 131) at the end of the year. Number.

The Bakehouses throughout the Borough were inspected at least twice during the year. There are 115 bakehouses in the Borough of Poplar, 38 Poplar (including one factory bakehouse), 48 Bromley, 29 Bow, but at the date of the last inspection two were disused in Poplar, five in Bromley and one in Bow, so that there were in use 107 bakehouses, 36 Poplar, 43 Bromley and 28 Bow. See Table A, page 112. There are 37 underground bakehouses in the Borough, 9 Poplar, 16 Bromley and 12 Bow. At the end of the year four were not in use in Bromley. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES & COW-HOUSES. Notices were received from occupiers of slaughter-houses and cowhouses of their intention to apply for the renewal of their licences at a Special Meeting of the Public Health Committee of the London County Council, held at the Clerkenwell Sessions House, Clerkenwell, on Thursday, the 18th October, at 10 a.m. 121 The slaughter-houses and cow-houses in the Borough were inspected prior to the renewal of the licenses by the London County Council. There are 19 slaughter-houses: 7 Poplar, 5 Bromley, and 7 Bow, and 15 cow-houses: 3 Poplar, 5 Bromley, and 7 Bow. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. Division. Reg. No. Premises and Tenant.

"Want of cleanliness was found in 128 instances, and 82 other defects existed. 128 intimations were served, which in 9 cases were followed up by Statutory notices, but no legal proceedings were taken. A register of these premises is kept. See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 175, 177, 188, 192, 198, 208, and 214. HAIR-DRESSERS' PREMISES. The hair-dressers' premises were inspected during the year. MILKSHOPS. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. Conference of Dairymen and Keepers of Milkshops. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 360 registered premises (including 15 cow-houses, 3 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 7 Bow) where milk is sold, 116 Poplar, 156 Bromley and 88 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspectors' reports, pages 174, 180, 188, 193, 200, 206 and 214. 12 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 4 Poplar, 2 Bromley and 6 Bow. 58 Premises were on account of change * See Tables A and C, pages 112 and 115. 124 of owner, re-registered as milkshops, 21 Poplar, 22 Bromley and 15 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 60. Conference of Dairymen and Keepers of Milkshops. At a Conference of the Public Health Committee of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth Council and dairymen and keepers of milkshops in the Borough, held at the Council House, Wandsworth, on the 17th July, 1906, the following Resolutions were passed, viz.:— 1. That the Board of Agriculture be urged to bring into force and carry out the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order in the country, with such variations as are applicable in various districts. 2. That the Board of Agriculture be requested to take steps to ensure that the udders of the cows and the hands and arms of the person milking shall be clean at the time of milking, and that the vessel used shall be clean and be kept solely for the purpose of milking. 3. That in the opinion of this Conference all Railway Companies carrying milk should provide proper insulated trucks, as now used by the London and North-Western Railway Company, for the purpose. 4. That the Board of Agriculture be urged to take steps to ensure the carriage of milk in sealed churns. 5. That in the opinion of this Conference all dairies should be licensed annually, and only licensed dairies should sell milk for consumption on or off the premises, and that all milk on the counter for sale in open vessels should be covered with muslin or other suitable cover. 6. It was generally admitted that preservatives are not necessary. The Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth, with a view to the delivery of milk in London free from dirt resolved that a copy of the foregoing resolutions should be sent to the Board of Agriculture and to the Metropolitan City and Borough Councils; and that they be asked, if they approve, to support the resolutions. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council:—That the resolutions be approved and a communication addressed to the Board of Agriculture in support thereof. 125 ICE-CREAMS. About the middle of the year 1906, all the known premises within the Borough where ice creams are manufactured were inspected. There are 139 such premises within the Borough, 52 Poplar, 64 Bromley and 23 Bow. See Inspectors' reports, pages 174, 180, 187, 193, 202, 208 and 214. SMOKE NUISANCES AND NUISANCES FROM TRACTION ENGINES AND LOCOMOTIVES. 119 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year—18 Bow East, 5 Bow West, 31 North Bromley, 6 Bromley Central, 10 East combined, 19 West combined, and 30 Poplar South. 89 intimations and 35 statutory notices were served. Whenever traction engines and locomotives created a smoke nuisance whilst passing through the district, the matter was reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee. Summonses were applied for in four instances, see pages 159, 160. FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS* Butter and Margarine Bill (footnote page 129).

Vendor cautioned. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 3.5 per cent. The sample was curdled when received, and the deficiency of solids not fat may have been due to the decomposition thus indicated. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 3.5 per cent. Vendor cautioned. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 5.8 per cent. Vendor cautioned, Butter.—Containing 1.7 per cent. excessive water. Vendor cautioned. Butter.—Containing 14.5 per cent. of water and 03 per cent. of boric acid. No summons applied for in consequence of the two wrappers in which the sample of butter was served having printed upon the same—"THIS IS THE CHOICEST BUTTER BLENDED WITH PURE ENGLISH FULL 129 CREAM MILK, whereby the percentage of water in the butter is increased to about 24 per cent., but this limit of percentage is not guaranteed in milk blended butter."* Butter.—Containing excessive water to the extent of 1.4 per cent. Vendor cautioned. Butter.—Containing 1.2 per cent. excessive water. Vendor cautioned. Margarine.—Containing 1.0 per cent. excessive water. Vendor cautioned. * Butter and Margarine Bill. The Butter and Margarine Bill presented by Sir Edward Strachey, which was ordered by the House of Commons to be printed on Feb. 14th, 1907, is intended "to make further provision with respect to the manufacture, importation and sale of butter and margarine and similar substances." The Bill is calculated to deal the deathblow to the sale of watered butter under the ingenious name of milk-blended butter. It provides for the registration of butter factories in which by way of trade butter is blended, re-worked or subjected to any treatment but not so as to cease to be butter. Any premises are similarly to be registered in which there is manufactured any butter substitute (that is to say, any mixture other than margarine, produced by mixing or blending butter with milk, cream or any substance other than butter) or any imitation butter (that is to say, any article of food which resembles butter, but which is not margarine or a butter substitute) or on which there is carried on the business of a wholesale dealer in butter substitutes or imitation butters. Consignments also of butter substitutes are to be registered in the same way as are consignments of margarine in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. Any officer of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries is to have power to enter at all reasonable times premises so registered, and an officer of a local authority who is authorised to procure samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts may have similar powers. When the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries has reason to believe that any of the processes of blending, and so on, are carried on in unregistered premises it may appoint an officer and authorise him to inspect such premises. It is thus proposed to repeal Subsection (2) of Section 7 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. If any substance intended to be used for the adulteration of butter is found in any butter factory the occupier of the factory will be deemed guilty of an offence under this Act, and if any oil or fat capable of being so used is found it shall be deemed to be intended to be so used, unless the contrary is proved. This provision is obviously meant to avoid the difficulty which the use of certain oils in butter has created in regard to their detection by chemical analysis. It will be an offence under the Act to store butter or margarine containing more than 16 per cent. of water, or to consign from a factory such butter or margarine unless the occupier or consignor proves that the butter or margarine was net made, blended, or re-worked, or treated in the factory. The sale of any butter substitute containing more than 24 per cent. of water will constitute an offence; and in the list of articles the importation of which is an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, butter or margarine containing more than 16 per cent. of water, butter substitutes containing more than 24 per cent. of water, or any imitation butter, except in packages conspicuously marked "butter substitute" or "imitation butter," will be included. Regulations are proposed in regard to the proportion of curd in butter. For a first offence the fine proposed is £20, for a second offence £50, and for any subsequent offence £100, while imprisonment may be inflicted under Section 17 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, in which such punishment is authorised. It is proposed that this Act shall come into operation on the first day of January, 1908. 0 130 Coffee and Chicory.—Chicory and Coffee containing 75 parts of the former to 25 of the latter. Vendor cautioned. Coffee and Chicory (five samples).—These samples contained respectively 75 per cent., 60 per cent., 60 per cent., 70 per cent. and 65 per cent. of Chicory. The Public Analyst's opinion was that the name of a dominating ingredient in a mixture should come first. The Solicitor's opinion was that as the Inspectors had asked for a mixture and they received it, and as there is no fixed standard as to the respective proportions of Coffee and Chicory, proceedings could not be successfully institutad unless evidence could be called that there was a recognised commercial standard with reference to the proper proportion of Coffee and Chicory. The Committee were of opinion a standard should be adopted for such mixtures or other means taken for the protection of the purchaser, and recommended to the Council that a representation on the subject be made to the Local Government Board. Lime Water.—Deficient in lime to the extent of 90.8 per cent. No action taken on account of declaration at time of purchase. Lemonade.—Lemonade the acidity of which consisted solely of phosphoric acid and containing a trace of metallic impurity equivalent to 0 008 of tin in 10 ounces. Lemonade.—Lemonade containing a trace of impurity equivalent to 0 01 grains of tin in 10 ounces. There being no standard nor definition as to how "Lemonade" is to be manufactured, no legal proceedings were instituted in respect of the sample acidified by phosphoric acid and not by citric acid.* *No doubt lemonade should consist of aerated water acidulated with citric acid and sweetened with sugar, but there is no objection to its being acidulated with phosphoric acid and flavoured with essence of lemons, providing the phosphoric acid is made from pure phosphorus by burning it in air, care being taken during the whole process of manufacture and distilled water only being used Metallic contamination in lemonade and other saccharine beverages is no doubt due to the use in their manufacture of glacial acetic acid made by distillation from acetate of sodium and sulphuric acid and also acids which are manufactured by treating calcined bones with sulphuric acid or by boiling phosphorus and nitric acid with water. Nitric acid is also made with sulphuric acid, and this last acid is liable to contain arsenic and other metallic impurities. Of course acetic acid can be used and prepared from wood by destructive distillation and purification, and there is no objection to using it, but it is an inferior tonic to phosphoric acid, which, as mentioned above, is best prepared and less likely to contain metallic 131 Preservatives in Milk and Butter. In 30 samples of Butter out of a total of 119 samples preservatives were found as under :— Boric acid 012%; 0.22%; 0.37%; 0.18%; 0.13%; 0.27%; 0.25%; 0.4%; 0.2%; 0.2%; 0.25%; 0.15%; 0.25%; 0.3%; 0.25%; 0.2%; 0.12%; 0.2%; 0.25%; 0.15%; 0.25%; 0.18%; 0.18%; 0.18%; 0.18%; 0.25%; 0.17%; 0.25%; 0.12%; and 0.12%. Two samples of Margarine contained boric acid: 0.25% and 0.1%. Two samples of Milk contained formaldehyde : 0.016% and 0.013%. The Local Government Board issued a circular calling attention to the use of preservatives in food, especially in milk, and suggested that the Council should notify milk traders that action will be taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in instances where preservatives are reported found in milk. As regards formalin and boron preservatives, the Board were advised that the presence in milk of formalin to an amount which is ascertained by examination, within three days of collecting the sample, to exceed 1 part in 40,000 (1 part in 100,000 of formic aldehyde) raises a strong presumption that the article has been rendered injurious to health, and that the purchaser has been prejudiced, and also that similar presumption is raised where boron preservatives are present in milk to an amount exceeding 57 parts of boric acid per 100,000, or 40 grains of boric acid per gallon. Action had already been taken by the Public Health and Housing impurities providing it is made from pure phosphorus and distilled water, care being taken during the whole process of manufacture. If citric acid and acetic acid are used great care should be taken to see that they are pure, for in the Final Report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into Arsenical Poisoning from the consumption of beer or other articles of food or drink it is stated :— "85. The liability of tartaric and citric acids to contain arsenic, in consequence "of the use in their manufacture of large quantities of sulphuric acid, has been "frequently mentioned in evidence, and we have been informed that small amounts "of arsenic have been detected in certain samples, including some of foreign manu"facture. We have evidence that care is taken by firms manufacturing these "substances to obtain sulphuric acid which is free from arsenic, and that the "stringent precautions against contamination by lead which are usually taken "would also remove arsenic if present." "86. Acetic acid, sulphurous acid and bisulphites—used in the preparation "of a variety of food substances—have also, in a few instances, been reported to "contain small amounts of arsenic." 132 Committee in cases where preservatives had been found in milk, and convictions obtained. The Committee directed notice be given to milk dealers in the Borough as suggested. The following is a copy of a notice given to each milk dealer in the Borough:— Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. TO MILK TRADERS. Preservatives in Milk. SALE OF FOOD AND DEUGS ACTS. This is to give notice that the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar have directed that Legal Proceedings shall be instituted under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in instances where Preservatives in Milk are discovered on analysis by the Public Analyst. FREDERICK WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., 27th July, 1906. The Lancet stated:— "We are glad to see that the Local Government Board is drawing the attention of the authorities who are responsible for the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts to the fact that the use of preservatives in milk is not a sine quâ non to the trade. The Board, in a circular recently issued, states that in certain boroughs in London and elsewhere in which samples of milk are systematically tested for preservatives, the presence of substances at any time of the year has been found to be exceptional, and there is evidence to show that a very large number of milk vendors conduct their business without the use of antiseptics, even in those instances in which the milk comes long distances by rail. Proceedings instituted against vendors of milk containing preservatives have usually been taken under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. Conviction has followed, it being held that when the purchaser who asks for milk is supplied with milk plus a preservative he does not receive an article of the nature, substance and quality demanded and is prejudiced thereby. The Board suggests that analysts should record in their quarterly reports the number of samples of milk which have been 133 examined with the view of ascertaining the presence of preservatives and should report at once to the Council concerned the facts as to samples which proved on analysis to contain an added preservative. It is further suggested that proceedings should be taken in all cases where such a preservative is found. Also it is suggested that when the presence of a preservative is declared the condition of such preserved milk should be carefully examined. As regards formalin and boron preservatives, the Board is advised that the presence in milk of formalin to an amount which is ascertained by examination within three days of collecting the sample to exceed 1 part in 40,000 raises a strong presumption that the article has been rendered injurious to health and that the purchaser has been prejudiced in the sense conveyed in Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. A similar presumption is raised where boron preservatives are found in milk to an amount exceeding 57 parts of boric acid per 100,000 parts of milk. The despatch of this circular to the authorities administering the Sale of Food and Drugs Act looks as though the Local Government Board at last means to codify the recommendations of the Departmental Committee on Preservatives and Colouring Matter in Food which reported so long ago as 1901. We have long urged for an official recognition of the findings of this commitee." Warranties under Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. It was reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee that a summons taken against the vendor of a sample of milk deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 7.4 per cent. was dismissed on production of a warranty from the wholesale dealer. The question of proceeding against the latter for giving a false warranty was considered, but in view of difficulties in securing convictions in such cases, no prosecution was instituted, but a letter of caution was addressed to the wholesale vendor. The Committee directed that the circumstances should be reported to the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture. The Southwark Borough Council convened a Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils, on the subject of milk warranties, produced in defence in proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The Conference was held at the Town Hall, Walworth Road, on Wednesday, 30th May, at 3 o'clock, and Councillors J. H. West and W. J. Purdy, with the Medical Officer of Health were appointed delegates. The following are the resolutions passed at the Conference of Representatives of the Metropolitan Borough Councils as to Milk Warranties :— 134 That in the opinion of this Conference the provisions of Section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and Section 20 of the Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1899, operate to the prejudice of the purchaser and the public health and should be repealed, leaving the seller of milk to his remedy at common law against the person from whom he purchases it. That notices in shops, &c., to the effect that milk sold therein is not warranted as pure shall be no defence. That the act of mixing water or separated milk with whole milk for the purposes of sale should be made a penal offence. That any Metropolitan Borough Council should be enabled to sample at any railway station milk coming to dealers in the area of that Borough, although the station may be in another district. That copies of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board and the President of the Board of Agriculture. At the same Conference the following amendment was moved, but not carried, viz.:— That in the opinion of this Conference it is desirable that steps should be taken to obtain an amendment of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in respect to warranties in the direction indicated in the following suggestions:— (а) That all warranties should be in a specified form and be properly executed, stamped and registered in a Government Department; (b) That a continuous warranty shall be deemed to be a fresh warranty in respect to each sale or transaction, and that it shall not be a defence to a prosecution against a warrantor to allege that the warranty was given above six months previous to the prosecution, provided the sample in respect to which the prosecution is instituted was taken within the statutory period; (c) That if, in a prosecution, it is alleged by the defendant that the article was sold in the condition in which it was supplied to him by the warrantor, or that the adulteration is due to a further warrantor, it should be possible for the defendant to attach the first or any further warrantors to the prosecution ; 135 (d) That the onus of proof of the fact that the milk wa9 delivered unadulterated shall rest upon the warrantor or the further warrantor at the hearing of the charge; (e) That the certificate of the Public Analyst shall, in respect to a sample of milk proved to have been sold in the condition in which it was supplied by a warrantor, be evidence against the warrantor and any previous warrantors ; and (f) That proceedings against all warrantors may be taken in the district of the prosecuting local authority, and not in that of the warrantor. The Hammersmith Borough Council had under consideration the question of the amendment of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. The Hammersmith Council were of opinion that the resolution passed at the Conference would, if acted upon, inflict in many cases a hardship upon the retail seller, who, if honest, could probably give no better proof of his bona fides than to obtain a proper contract and warranty with his milk, and for that reason it did not think it was likely or desirable that the proposal should be embodied in any future legislation on the question. On the other hand, the Hammersmith Council considered that the proposals set out in the amendment were reasonable and would materially assist local authorities in prosecuting offenders under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. The Hammersmith Council accordingly adopted a resolution in the terms of the amendment referred to, and directed that a copy thereof be forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board, and also requested the Metropolitan Borough Councils, if they agreed therewith, to support the action taken. The Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar had already adopted resolutions urging the repeal of Section 25 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, and Section 20 of the Sale of Food and Drugs (Amendment) Act, 1899, or, as an alternative, the passing of an enactment that the person relying on a warranty, should bring up the warrantor for conviction in his stead, and had also passed resolutions on the subject of taking samples at railway stations in other boroughs, of milk consigned to the Borough. 136 INSPECTION OF FOOD AND EXAMINATION OF UNSOUND FOOD AT WHARVES, Etc. With respect to the examination of food stuffs see Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 175, 177, 188, 193, 198, 209 and 214-216. Also, with respect to the examination of food stuffs at wharves, see Inspectors' reports, pages 198, 208 and 215. The Public Health Committee of the London County Council, under date 21st June, submitted a report which came before the Council on 17th July, in which "the need for improved administration in London for the purposes of inspection of food entering London" is suggested; the recommendation submitted being— "That application be made to Parliament in the Session of 1907 for authority (i.) to enable the Council to establish food inspection stations and public slaughter-houses in London, and (ii.) to provide for the inspection of food entering London; and that, before the introduction into Parliament of any bill on the subject, the Public Health Committee do report details upon which the provisions of such Bill shall be based." The recommendation was summarily disposed of by a motion "that the Council do proceed to the next business." However a Bill to enable regulations to be made for the prevention of danger arising to public health from the importation, preparation, storage or distribution of articles of food, was presented by the President of the Local Government Board, supported by Mr. Runciman. At the Annual Meeting of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, held on 6th July, a discussion took place on the subject of Tinned and Preserved Foods, and the following resolution was passed:— "That, in the opinion of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, it is necessary, in order to secure better protection for the public in regard to Tinned and 137 Preserved Foods, that legislation should be passed embodying the following important reforms:— "1. That the name and address of the manufacturer, and the date of canning, shall be impressed on the cans. "2. It shall be unlawful to sell for any purpose canned goods that are unfit for human consumption, and it shall be the duty of any person in possession of unsound canned foods to notify and surrender same to the local authority, who shall destroy such unsound food free of charge. "3. A certain number of tins (say 1 per cent.) from each consignment shall be opened on importation and the contents examined under the supervision or instructions of the Sanitary Authority concerned, prior to such canned foods being placed on the market. "4. Tins which are known in the trade as 'doubtfuls' shall be deemed to be unfit for human consumption. "5. Food intended for canning shall be inspected by independent officials prior to being canned, and all foods shall be canned under strictly hygienic conditions. "6. In the opinion of the Branch the use of preservatives in canned foods is unnecessary, and should under no circumstances be permitted." The Secretary was directed by the Branch to forward this resolution to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture, the London County Council, and the Metropolitan City and Borough Councils, and to express the hope that the Poplar Borough Council would support the Branch by making representations to these bodies, with a view of obtaining the desired reforms. In submitting the above resolutions to the Public Health and Housing Committee, I suggested that the Sanitary Authority shall have in respect of factories where food is prepared, the same powers of entry as an Inspector under the Factory and Workshop Act of 1901, and that the Local Authority be empowered to institute legal proceedings upon the report of the Medical Officer of Health or Sanitary Inspector, as under Section 135 of the aforementioned Act, in respect of such factories. 138 I suggested that similar provision should be made in respect of all places as well as factories where food is prepared. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the resolution of the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers, proposing legislation for the better protection of the public in regard to tinned and preserved foods, and recommended that communications be addressed to the Local Government Board, the Board of Agriculture and the London County Council urging legislation as suggested; also proposing that the Local Sanitary Authority should have the same right of entry and of institution of legal proceedings in respect of factories where food is prepared, as possessed by Factory Inspectors under the Factory and Workshops Act of 1901; that such provisions should be extended to places where food is prepared other than factories: and that other Metropolitan Borough Councils be asked to take similar action. The Westminster City Council had before them a Report of their Public Health Committee, respecting the liability of the wholesale vendor of a tuberculous carcase of a pig recently seized by one of their Sanitary Inspectors. It was originally intended to institute proceedings against the wholesale dealer, inasmuch as the carcase was seized on the morning of the day following that on which it was received from him by the retailer. The Committee were, however, advised that many difficulties might arise in obtaining a conviction against the wholesale dealer. For instance, it would be necessary to issue a summons at the Guildhall, the premises of the wholesale dealer being situate in Smithfield Market; and it would be a good defence for the wholesale dealer if he could prove that at the time he sold the carcase he did not know, and had no reason to believe, it was diseased. Furthermore, summonses recently taken out by one of the Metropolitan Borough Councils under similar circumstances failed at the Guildhall. The City Council, after due consideration of all the circumstances, came to the conclusion that in such a case as the one in question facilities should be afforded for proceedings against the wholesale dealer, and resolved to ask the Local Government Board to consider the advisability of the law relating to unsound food being amended in such a way as would make the wholesale dealer responsible for the sale of unsound food by himself or his servant. The Local Government Board had been communicated with accordingly, and the Town Clerk of the City of Westminster was directed 139 to inform the several Metropolitan Borough Councils of the City Council's action. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable the law should be amended as proposed, and recommended that the Council concur in this opinion, and the application of the Westminster City Council to the Local Government Board be supported. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. For report of Mr. William Johnson, Inspector for Houses Let in Lodgings, see pages 220-223. There are 960 houses let in lodgings on the register, see report, pages 222 and 223. WATER CERTIFICATES AND CUTTING OFF WATER SUPPLIES. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—New Cottages, Nos. 157 & 159, Mellish Street; and New Office and Dwelling House, Dudgeon's Wharf, Manchester Road. The Islington Borough Council called attention to the fact that the Metropolitan Water Board were continuing the practice of the Water Companies of cutting off the water supply from any inhabited house in respect of which the water rate had not been paid, ana subsequently giving notice to the Borough Council that the water had been disconnected from the premises, in order that legal proceedings may be taken by the Council to compel the rate defaulter to reinstate it. It was urged that the Board should, on sanitary grounds, discontinue the practice of cutting off supplies, and take legal proceedings against defaulters for recovery of the rates. The Islington representative had been requested to urge this on the Metropolitan Water Board, and other Borough Councils were asked to take similar action. The Public Health and Housing Committee concurred and recommended that the Council's representative on the Metropolitan Water Board be asked to urge the Board to discontinue the practice of cutting off 140 the water supply from premises in respect of which the water rate had not been paid, and to substitute legal proceedings for the recovery of such rate, where necessary. The following letter was submitted to the Committee:— Metropolitan Water Board, Savoy Court, Strand, W.C., 31st December, 1906. Dear Sir, Disconnecting Supplies for non-payment of Water Rate. With reference to the resolutions recently passed by the Islington Borough Council on the subject of the disconnection of supplies by the Water Board as a means of recovery of outstanding water rates, I am directed by the Finance Committee to inform you of the following facts. The subject was gone into very carefully by the Committee in February, 1905, when they decided that it would not be in the interests of the Board and therefore of the general body of consumers to entirely abandon the practice. Since that date, however, the power to cut off supplies has been very sparingly used; the number of disconnections being reduced to a minimum. No supplies are disconnected without the order of the Committee being first obtained, and in each case the whole of the surrounding circumstances are brought before them and fully considered. It has been the practice to refrain from giving such orders where the premises are known to be occupied by more than one family, and in genuine cases of poverty. Moreover, as you are doubtless aware, the Board are precluded by the Water Companies (Regulation of Powers) Act, 1887, from cutting off water where the owner and not the occupier is liable by law or by agreement for the payment of the water rate in respect of any dwellinghouse or part of a dwelling-house occupied as a separate tenement. With regard to the suggestion that the Board are continuing the practice of the late Companies, I am to state that the number of cases disconnected by the Board is very considerably less than before the transfer from the Companies, in fact, it amounts to less than one-third. During the half-year to Michaelmas, 1906, out of a total of nearly 1,100,000 supplies only 213 were actually withdrawn, and of these 213 cases, 132 were merely turned off at the stopcock, leaving only 81 cases in which a physical disconnection was made. When regard is had to the fact that the Board's area of supply 141 comprises some 252 Parishes it will be seen that the cutting off of supplies has been reduced to a very low point, and I may add that whenever a supply is withdrawn notice is immediately sent to the Clerk and the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority. I might mention that during the period above referred to, no supplies were disconnected in the Borough of Poplar. I am, Yours faithfully, A. B. PILLING, Clerk of the Board. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended—That the Council expressed its complete satisfaction with the assurances given and the regard which the Metropolitan Water Board pays to the public interest. SEWERAGE, DRAINAGE AND SEWER VENTILATION. In the memorandum issued by the Local Government Board to the Medical Officers of Health respecting their Annual Reports, it is stated that the Local Government Board desired to obtain, through the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, information of particular changes of condition that occur by the action of the Local Authority, and one of the subject matters which is required to be reported upon is the condition of sewer and house drains. At the instigation of the Borough Surveyor, the sewer on the north side of Bow Road from Fairfield Road in Old Ford Road was reconstructed. The Lewisham Borough Council suggested that Bye-law No. 5 of the London County Council Drainage Bye-laws, made under Section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, should be repealed, and the County Council inquired whether the Poplar Borough Council was of opinion that steps should be taken in the direction suggested. The bye-law in question is as follows : — L 142 "5. Every person who shall erect a new building shall provide in every main drain or other drain of such building which may immediately communicate with any sewer, a suitable and efficient intercepting trap at a point as distant as may be practicable from such building, and as near as may be practicable to the point at which such drain may be connected with the sewer. "He shall, except in cases where the means of access to be provided in compliance with the preceding bye-law shall give adequate means of access to such trap, provide a separate manhole or other separate means of access to such trap for the purpose of cleansing it." The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the provision of an intercepting trap between the drainage of any premises and the sewer is desirable to prevent the possibilities of gases from the sewer being conveyed into such premises, and recommended the Council to express disapproval of the proposed repeal of the bye-law in question. Sewer Ventilation. The attention of the Engineer of the London County Council was directed by the Borough Surveyor and myself to the desirability of substituting sewer upcast ventilating shafts for the open gratings in Fairfoot Road, ventilating the County Council's low level sewer, and also of erecting a ventilating shaft on the old sewer in Cold Harbour. The Engineer agreed to recommend his Committee to erect shafts and fix closed covers in lieu of the open gratings, and the Borough Surveyor agreed with him as to suitable positions for 6 shafts, 36 feet high and 12 inches diameter, as follows:— Junction of Knapp Road and Fairfoot Road. 87-89, Fairfoot Road. Rounton Road. 66-68, Bruce Road. Junction of Franklin Street and Hancock Road. Cold Harbour. The Works Committee approved the positions selected, And recommended the Council to confirm their action. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered complaints as to nuisance from the sewer ventilating shafts of the London County 143 Council, and directed the London County Council be urged to increase the height of such shafts throughout the Borough. The following communication was received from the London County Council in reply :— "With reference to your letter of the 4th instant, as to complaints which have been received of nuisance arising from the sewer ventilating shafts in Poplar, I am directed to inform you that the ventilator by the Atley Road School, to which you draw special attention, was closed some time ago, as a result of complaints made by the Managers of the School. It is found, on inspection, that the sacking, which was placed in this column to prevent foul smells arising, is still in position, and the Council, therefore, cannot understand that there should be any cause for complaint in this instance. "One or two complaints were received during the summer of this year of emanations from other ventilating columns, and in these cases the shafts were increased in height to 42 feet. "The Council does not consider it necessary to raise all the columns in the Borough of Toplar as suggested in your letter, as in some cases the height of 36 feet, which is that usually adopted, is ample. Where, however, specific complaints are received of foul gas being emitted from the column, and the surrounding buildings are of greater height than the shaft, the Council will be prepared to take action in the direction suggested, but in no case can a column be increased to a height greater than 42 feet." COMBINED DRAINAGE AND CONFERENCE. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises, either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order:—*136 to 140, Bow Road; 1to8, Burdett Street and 178 and 181, Devons Road; 88 and 89, Cadogan Terrace; 19 to 25, Locton Street; 1 to 9, St. Leonard's Street and 96 to 104, High Street, Bromley ; 19 to29, Chiltern Road and 31 to 37, Knapp Road; 13 * See Police Court proceedings, page 159. 144 to 17, Andrew Street and 2 to 6, Wilson Street; All Saints' Schools to 92, High Street, Poplar; 28to32, Glaucus Street; 16 and 17, Charles Street; 1 to 13, Alpha Road; 29and31, Wellington Street and 22to25, Chadbourne Street; 21 to 23, Chilcot Street; 24 to 32, Tooke Street; 25, Brunswick Street, through Poplar Station, G.E.R.; St. Stephen's Schools, Speeding's Gardens, and 27 to 37, Lower North Street; 381, 383, and "The Dorset Arms," Manchester Road; 48 to 60, Grundy Street; 53 to 57, High Street, Poplar ; 27 to 28, Lyal Road. Combined Drainage Conference, etc. The General Purposes Committee considered a reference from the Council of the question of combined drainage with a view to the submission to Parliament of a Bill for the amendment of the law on the subject by throwing upon owners the cost of maintenance of all combined drainage systems or other drains not approved by the proper authority as sewers. A Bill to effect this purpose was prepared by the London County Council and introduced in five Sessions of Parliament during 1896—1900, but without successful result. On the 18th June, 1903, a deputation from Metropolitan Borough Councils waited upon the then President of the Local Government Board to urge legislation on the subject, and a sympathetic reply was given; nothing, however, was done, and in October, 1904, the Council approved a suggestion of the London County Council that a joint representation should be made to the Government with a view to legislation. The General Purposes Committee were informed a private Bill dealing with the matter would have small chance of passing into law, and the introduction of such a Bill would involve a certain loss. The General Purposes Committee were of opinion the London County Council should be asked to introduce a clause into a General Powers Bill for the purpose of effecting the object in view, and recommended the Council that a representation to this effect be made to the London County Council, and other Metropolitan Borough Councils be asked to support such representation. Intimations were received from the Metropolitan Borough Councils, with a few exceptions, in support of the application of the Council to the London County Council to introduce a clause into a General Powers Bill dealing with the question of Combined Drainage. 115 The General Purposes Committee considered an invitation from the Fulham Borough Council to appoint delegates to a conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils on Monday, 21st May, at 4 o'clock, at Fulham Town Hall, for the purpose of approaching by deputation the President of the Local Government Board and urging upon him the importance of an alteration of the existing law dealing with combined drainage, and the advisability of the Government taking action in the matter. The General Purposes Committee recommended— "That Councillors A. H. Darby and J. H. West, with the Medical Officer of Health and Borough Surveyor, be appointed to attend the Conference." Together with the Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee, Mr. Councillor Darby, and Mr. Councillor West, I attended the Conference of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, held at the Fulham Town Hall on Monday, the 21st of May, 1906, to consider the question of the unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to Combined Drainage, and to urge the President of the Local Government Board to receive a Deputation representing the Conference with the object of pressing upon him the necessity of securing an amendment of the law which now operates so unfairly to the ratepayers of London. The following resolutions were unanimously agreed to: — (a) That this Conference of London Borough Councils do respectfully urge upon the Bt. Hon. the President of the Local Government Board to give the subject of the unsatisfactory state of the law relating to combined drainage in London his serious consideration with the view of a Bill to amend the law being introduced into Parliament at an early date. (b) That a deputation be formed to wait upon the President of the Local Government Board in order to present the foregoing resolution to him in person, and to urge the views of the Conference on the subject matter. (c) That the whole of the delegates appointed to this Conference form the proposed deputation and that the Councils of the City of Westminster and Metropolitan Boroughs of Battersea, Chelsea, Greenwich, Stepney and Wandsworth be invited to appoint representatives thereon. 146 (d) That the resolution passed by this Conference be embodied in the form of a joint Memorial to the Local Government Board setting out the facts of the case, and that the several Metropolitan Borough Councils represented by the Deputation be asked to affix their seals thereto when ready. (e) That the terms of the proposed Memorial be referred to the Mayor and Town Clerk of Fulham to settle. The following letter was forwarded to the delegates:— Town Hall, Fulham, S.W., 19th June, 1906. Dear Sir, Conference re Combined Drainage. Adverting to my letter of the 23rd ult., transmitting copies of resolutions passed at the Conference of representatives of London Borough Councils, held at the Fulham Town Hall on 21st May, I beg to forward herewith, for your information, copy of the reply which has now been received from the President of the Local Government Board with regard to the deputation appointed by the Conference to wait upon him. Yours faithfully, B. M. PRESCOTT, Hon. Sec. of the Conference, Town Clerk, Fulham. [Copy.] Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 12th June, 1906. Sir, I am directed by the President of the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 31st ultimo, requesting him on behalf of a Conference of representatives of the Metropolitan Borough Councils held on the 21st ultimo, to receive a deputation on the subject of the law with regard to combined drainage. In reply Mr. Burns desires me to state that he will be prepared to consider the representations in the Memorial proposed to be submitted by the Borough Councils concerned, but that he does not 147 consider it necessary to trouble a deputation to attend here with reference to the matter. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) H. C. MUNRO, Assistant Secretary. E. M. Prescott, Esq., Fulham Town Hall, Fulham, S.W. The following letter was submitted to the General Purposes Committee :— Town Hall, Fulham, S.W., 3rd December, 1906. Dear Sir, Combined Drainage. Eeferring to the Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils held at the Fulham Town Hall on the 21st May last on the subject of Combined Drainage, and to the joint Memorial presented to the Local Government Board as the result of such Conference, urging the necessity of amending legislation being introduced at an early date to deal with this question, I beg to transmit hereunder copy of a letter I have now received from the Local Government Board hereon, viz.:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 20th November, 1906. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the question of Combined Drainage, and in reply to state that the Board are not at present in a position to promise to introduce legislation on the subject. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) NOEL T. KEBSHAW, Assistant Secretary. E. M. Prescott, Esq., Fulham Town Hall. Having regard to the importance of the subject, and to the unsatisfactory nature of the reply from the Local Government Board, 148 may I suggest that you again bring the matter before your Council with a view to resolutions being passed and forwarded to the Prime Minister and the President of the Local Government Board, strongly urging the views of the Conference, and also asking the Parliamentary Eepresentatives of your Borough to bring pressure to bear upon His Majesty's Government to deal with the question without delay. Yours faithfully, E. M. PEESCOTT, Town Clerk. The General Purposes Committee recommended the Council— "That a strong representation be made to the Prime Minister and the President of the Local Government Board, again urging the introduction of legislation to deal with the question of combined drainage, and that the members representing the Borough in Parliament be requested to support such representation." LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Verminous Booms and Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Eooms. Verminous rooms are now brought to the notice of owners upon the " Intimations " which are followed, if necessary, by " Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are " in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. The above procedure saves a large amount of time, as under the 149 London County Council (General Powers') Act a certificate must be given by the Medical Officer of Health, who would have to inspect every room. During the year 333 rooms have been cleansed of vermin:— Poplar South Division 8 West Combined Division 57 East Combined Division 24 Bromley Central Division 12 Bromley North Division 60 Bow West Division 67 Bow East Division 68 Houses let in lodgings 37 Licensed Premises' Urinals. Five notices were served under Section 22 calling upon the owners to provide proper doors to the urinals attached to their licensed premises. ANALYSIS OF FLOCK AS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF BEDDING. The Metropolitan Borough of Hackney forwarded a copy report of Public Health Committee upon an analysis of Flock as used in the manufacture of bedding. The analysis was made by Leo Taylor, F.I.C., the Public Analyst for the Borough of Hackney. Samples of " Flock" or material used in stuffing pillows and mattresses were analysed. At Glasgow, in the year 1905, the Chief Sanitary Inspector of that town read a paper on " What People Sleep Upon " before the Congress of the Sanitary Institute, and in that paper he gave the results of his investigation into the organic matter obtained from flock by washing. The results of Mr. Taylor's analyses are given in Tables, and for the sake of comparison he gives the analysis of a sewage effluent recently decided by the Magistrates to be too bad to turn into a flowing watercourse. Mr. Taylor reported :— " It will thus be seen that organic matter exists in the flock, and 150 of course the question arises whether this soluble organic matter is from 'dirt' existing in the original old clothes from which the flock was made, or whether it is natural to the material. I am informed that flock is made from the old and filthy rags which are too bad to be remade into cloth. The rags are put into a ' Devil,' the machine which performs the laniary process, and come out as flock, shredded so finely by the spikes or teeth on the periphery of the drums as to appear as fluffy wool of a dark grey, black or brown tint, depending on the colour of the rags passing through the machine. No treatment is attempted of the rags before going into the ' Devil,' except that those pieces which are soaking wet or too damp for the ' Devil' to tear into shreds are cast aside to be stcved. "I find that tailor's cuttings and trimmings are not used for flock, they are teased up and remade into cloth of a kind. "It follows, therefore, that whatever filth exists in the original rags, which may have been collected from dust-heaps, &c., passes into the flock, and is made up in the form of pillows and mattresses into cheap bedding. " There is no doubt a preliminary sorting of rags into clean and dirty, because flock varies very considerably, and some specimens I have met with have evidently undergone a certain washing, but these qualities command higher prices and cannot be, or are not used in the cheaper bedding, which is naturally the subject of consideration now. " One would expect that such a product would be teeming with microbial life, and the following figures do not come quite as a surprise, but when it is found that one gramme, of flock yields 7,590,000 colonies of bacteria and sewage about 6,400,000 (Crossness) it must be admitted that one is dealing with a very filthy article. This number was yielded by the pillow flock which was white and very much cleaner and better than the mattress flock which was dark in colour. "The solutions obtained in washing the flock were yellowish brown and dark brown to black in colour, and when evaporated to dryness yielded a residue which gave a strong urinous odour when ignited. "The figures obtained are somewhat higher than those which led to wholesale condemnation by the Glasgow Inspector, but I am not fully convinced that the figures indicate actual dangerous 151 tamination. Organic matter such as is used in the preparation would naturally yield high figures when washed in the manner described, and I want to be sure that the ' filthy rags ' are actually used uncleaned for the flock. "Sufficient cause has been found to justify further investigations, as the results are certainly disquieting, and very probably a serious source of the spread of disease is to be found in the flock bed and mattress so commonly in use among the poor." Mr. Taylor had an opportunity of visiting a flock manufactory, and of seeing in actual operation the process of converting rags into " Flock," and reported:— "The process is extremely simple and devoid of sanitary precautions. " The old rags of every description, but consisting largely of old clothing in the most filthy condition, stinking horribly, are received at the factory in bundles, and, without any preliminary treatment, are placed in a machine which tears the cloth to pieces, rejecting the buttons and metallic substances; the shredded cloth then passes under cover to a revolving ' Devil,' where the long teeth further break up the cloth and where by a current of air, exhausted through a flue into a settling chamber, the dust is removed. "Owing to the friction, a certain amount of heat is evolved, so that, in addition to being freed from dust, the ' flock,' which the material has now become, is dried, and leaves the machine free from odour. This is the whole process, no attempt is made to cleanse the material beyond the agitation in a current of air, and although this removes the foul odour, it cannot remove the filth with which much of the cloth is impregnated, and which only awaits favourable conditions of moisture and warmth to prove a kind of hot-bed. "The flock which we saw made was being packed for delivery to certain large firms whose names were mentioned, to be used by them for bedding manufacture. "The revolting condition of the old clothing going into the machine, and the absence of all attempts at sterilization, were the noticeable features of the manufacture. "It is very evident that the use of flock thus prepared is a serious danger to public health, and steps are urgently needed to 152 require the purification of the material either before or after preparation. "The better and whiter kinds of flock are washed and dried again before use, but the dark varieties undergo no such cleaning. "The rags or old cloths ought to be stoved before use, and the resultant flock should be thoroughly washed, preferably with some disinfectant. A good and useful bedding would then be obtained at a very slightly increased cost, but practically safe from a health point of view. "Unless some such treatment is adopted, the consequences in the event of an epidemic are difficult to estimate, but they are bound to be very serious." The Hackney Public Health Committee recommended— (a) That a copy of the Public Analyst's report be forwarded to the Local Government Board, pointing out the desirability of flock being subjected to some process of disinfection and cleansing before it is used for pillows, mattresses, &c. (b) That a copy of the Public Analyst's report be forwarded to each Metropolitan Borough Council, asking them to make similar representations to the Local Government Board. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable action should be taken to compel disinfection and cleansing of flock before being used for bedding purposes, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and representations on the subject be made to the Local Government Board. The following letter was received from the Local Government Board: — Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 6th November, 1906. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 22nd ult. with respect to the disinfection and cleansing of flock before it is used for the manufacture of bedding, &c., and I am to state that the question of the conditions under which the trade 153 in flock is carried on has been noted for consideration in connection with any proposed amendment of the Public Health Acts. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LITHIBY, The Town Clerk, Assistant Secretary. Poplar, E. CROWN PROPERTY CONFERENCE RESPECTING EXEMPTION FROM PROVISIONS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. The Islington Borough Council convened a Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils on the subject of the exemption of Crown Property from the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the bye-laws made thereunder, the Conference was held on Thursday, 21st June. The Council had on several occasions passed resolutions protesting against such exemption, and recommended that Councillor W. J. Purdy, with the Medical Officer of Health, be appointed to attend the Conference. A Conference of Metropolitan City and Borough Councils was held at the Town Hall, Upper Street, Islington, at 7 p m., on Thursday, the 21st June, for the undermentioned purpose. To consider the following letter from the London County Council: — County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W., 10th February, 1906. Sir, Several Metropolitan Borough Councils have represented to the Council that legislation should be promoted to provide that buildings in the occupation of or used by or for the purposes of H.M. Government should be brought within the operation of the bye-laws with regard to drainage and sanitary arrangements and the inspection thereof. With reference thereto, I am to state that the Council has been advised by Counsel that the Crown not being named in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is not bound by any of its 154 provisions nor by any of the bye-laws thereunder. Property therefore in the occupation of the Crown or in that of persons using it exclusively in and for the service of the Crown, that is to say, for the purposes of the public government of the Country, is entirely exempt from the provisions of the Act and bye-laws. The Council is however advised that the provisions of the Act and bye-laws do apply to property not exclusively in and for the service of the Crown and to Crown property occupied under lease by private persons for private purposes. I am to add that the Council has noted that the question of how far Crown property should be brought within the operation of the Act is one for consideration in connection with any general revision of the provisions of the Act which may be projected in future. I am, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, The Town Clerk, Clerk to the Council. Metropolitan Borough of Islington. The following resolution was carried :— " That in the opinion of this Conference it is undesirable that any lands or buildings situate in the County of London should be exempt from the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or from the sanitary provisions of the Metropolis Management Acts or from the bye-laws made thereunder, and that a memorial be addressed to His Majesty's Government urging them to introduce a Bill to ensure that all lands and buildings owned by or on behalf of the Crown or at present otherwise exempt are brought within the provisions of the said Acts and bye-laws." It was thereupon resolved that copies of the resolution be forwarded to the London County Council and Metropolitan City and Borough Councils, and that the Prime Minister be asked to receive a deputation to present him with a copy of the resolution. 155 CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1. Cap. 8, Sect. 26 (2) REVENUE ACT, 1903. 3 Edw. 7, Cap. 46. Application was made for relief under the above Acts in respect of two premises in Bromley. The premises were inspected and found in each instance to be let in two flats, and in one case each flat was sublet with a total number of 19 persons and in the other case the lower flat was sublet, the upper flat was not and there was a total of 14 persons. The flats were considered to be not separately contained, as there was only one water closet and one copper for two flats, and as the three flats were sublet they could not be stated to be used for the sole purposes of separate dwellings. The bye-laws of the London County Council state that there shall be one water closet for not less than 12 inmates in each lodging-house, and it was considered three of these flats would come under the category of a " lodging-house " or " occupied by members of more than one family." The certificates were not granted. 156 SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION, OVERCROWDING, &C., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Where w.c. pans and traps are fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builder is written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise the matter will be reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee in order that legal proceedings may be instituted against him for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work has been found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. For fixing in pans and traps without giving the proper notice no legal proceedings were instituted, but in one instance for having done work and covering up without inspection, authority was obtained from the Committee to open the ground, and the builder was summoned for repairing the drain so as to be a nuisance and injurious and dangerous to health. A penalty of £6 was inflicted, with £2 2s. costs. In 1904 the journals of the Sanitary Inspectors were examined from the date of the coming into operation of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and lists were compiled (which involved a large amount of work) of houses not inspected, and also those inspected with the number of inspections made. Lists of houses not inspected were given to the Inspectors with instructions to inspect such premises as soon as possible. The inspection of these premises is now being completed. The inspections have taken a long time as many defective drainage systems had been discovered, which had to be rectified before furthur inspections were made and fresh drainage work created.

Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting five cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served ; 29 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 34 of overcrowding abated ; 3 cases of overcrowding were abated in workrooms (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 219); 98 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, pages 220 and 221). Legal proceedings were instituted in one instance, see page 161. General. 7,479 communications were received, and 858 complaints (including 119 smoke) as to nuisances were made. The Public Health and Housing Committee suggested to the Works Committee that the unpaved portion of footway in Wellington Street, at the corner of Cobden Street, should be paved. The spot in question was formerly the forecourt of the adjoining house, but had been open to the public for a great many years, and the owner had relinquished all rights thereto. The Public Health Committee suggested to the Works Committee that a short length of footway in Highland Street beyond the back line of pavement should be paved and thrown into the public way. The owner had relinquished his rights thereto. 159 Police Court Proceedings. No. of Street or Name of Premises or Locality, &c. Nature of Complaint. Date of Attendance at Police Court.

The above Act consolidates and amends the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Acts, 1881 and 1892. The following communication was received from the Local Government Board:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 28th September, 1906. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that under the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Act, 1906, which repeals the Alkali, etc., Works Regulation Acts, 1881 and 1892, certain Chemical Works not hitherto liable to registration are required to be registered, and are subject to inspection by the Board's Inspectors. It therefore becomes necessary for the Board to ascertain what works throughout England and Wales not within the scope of the repealed Acts have, by the Act of this year, been made subject to registration ; and I am to forward to you the enclosed form, specifying the descriptions of these works, and to request that the Council will have the goodness to cause the Board to be furnished with the information required, so far as regards such of the works as are carried on within the limits of the District. If there are no such works within the District, a " nil " return should be sent. The Board do not doubt that with the assistance of the Medical Officer of Health and the Inspector of Nuisances there will be no difficulty in supplying the particulars asked for, and they will be glad to receive the Return duly filled up not later than the 15th of October next. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, S. B. PROVIS, Secretary. A return of thirty-three separate works within the Borough was forwarded to the Local Government Board. The Return furnished :—(1) 163 Description of works; (2) Parish where situate; (3) Name of proprietor, company or manager, and (4) Address. Although thirty-three separate works were included, as stated above, in the Return, it is possible that the Local Government Board might not consider they all came under the Act. Education (Provision of Meals) Act, 1906. 6 Edw. 7, Cap. 57. This statute, which is essentially of a permissive character, enables local educational authorities to make provision for meals for children attending public elementary schools. Hitherto such provision has been made in many cases by voluntary associations, and it is intended that such voluntary associations shall be encouraged to continue under the name of " School Canteen Committees." By Section 1 local education authorities are empowered to associate themselves with School_ Canteen Committees on which they are represented, and to furnish land, buildings, furniture, servants, etc., for the provision of meals; but they are not permitted to incur any expenditure on the purchase of food, except as thereafter provided. By Section 3, if a local education authority resolves that any children attending school are unable through lack of food to take full advantage of education, and has also ascertained that private charity is insufficient to defray the cost of food, the Board of Education may on application authorise them to provide the cost of food out of the rates, subject to a limit of a halfpenny rate. By Section 2 the local education authority is required to make a charge for the meals provided, and to levy payment summarily as a civil debt upon the parent of the child, unless they are satisfied that the parent is unable to pay " by reason of circumstances other than his own default." There is no provision for prepayment, and the amount of the charge is left to the discretion of the local education authority. By Section 4 it is provided that supply of food to a child shall in no case operate to the disfranchisement of the parent. Employment of Children and Street Trading by Young Persons. By-laws made by the London County Council, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 1 and 2 of the Employment of Children Act, 1903, regulating (a) the employment of children generally, and (b) street 164 trading by persons under the age of 16 years within the County of London (exclusive of the City of London).

The foregoing By-laws were made by the London County Council on the 31st day of July, 1906, and the common seal of the Council was hereunto affixed on that day. G. L. Gomme, Cleric of the London County Council. County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 31st July, 1906. I hereby confirm the foregoing By-laws, H. J. Gladstone, One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. Whitehall, 4th October, 1906. 167 LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS-SESSION OF 1907. Under the above heading, the Public Health Committee of the London County Council presented on 24th May a report containing " recommendations " as to the legislation in public health matters which the Council should promote in the Session of 1907. The report was considered by the Council on 3rd July, and the recommendations, nine in number, having been " agreed," they will form the basis for clauses in the General Powers Bill. The first of the recommendations relates to milk— "(i.) Enabling the Council to prohibit the supply, within the county, of milk from a dairy within or without the county, if the Medical Officer is of opinion that infectious disease is caused or is likely to be caused, by the consumption of such milk: enabling the Council to prohibit the supply within the county, of milk causing or likely to cause tuberculosis; providing for appeal against the decision of the Council in the above matters; enabling the Council to require dairymen to supply lists of their customers and the sources from which their supply of milk is derived; authorising or requiring the Council, according to the nature of the case, to allow compensation in the event of a milk supply being prohibited; enabling the Council to take samples of milk within the county; providing for penalties against persons who knowingly sell, or suffer to be sold or used for human consumption within the county, the milk of any cow which is suffering from tubercular disease of the udder; imposing upon dairymen within the county an obligation to notify cases, or suspected cases, of tubercular disease of the udder; requiring the isolation of any cow suffering from such disease; enabling the Council to take samples of milk arriving at railway stations in London, and Metropolitan Borough Councils to take samples of milk elsewhere, and enabling the Council and Metropolitan Borough Councils to deal with milk which on examination appears to be so filthy as to be unfit for human food." 168 Milk for the food of Infants— "(ii.) Empowering Metropolitan Borough Councils at their discretion to provide and sell, in their respective districts, milk for the food of infants." The Committee based this recommendation on the fact that at the Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils, " On the Administration of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891," convened by the Council in July, 1904, a resolution was passed as follows:— "That, having regard to the declining birth-rate and the large infantile mortality-rate of the metropolis, it is desirable that the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be empowered, at their discretion, to provide, in their respective districts, depots for the preparation and sale of sterilised and humanised milk for the food of infants, and that the London County Council be requested to insert a clause in its General Powers Bill for the Session of 190E, to confer such power upon the said Borough Councils." Fried fish shops, fish-curers, and marine store dealers— "(v.) Enabling the Council to make bye-laws, to be enforced by sanitary authorities, with regard to the proper regulation of the businesses of a seller of fried fish, fish-curer, and marine store dealer." Houses adapted as tenements— "(vi.) Enabling sanitary authorities to require owners to make reasonable provision for the supply of water, and the storage and cooking of food in tenement houses." Premises used for preparation of food for sale— "(vii.) Enabling sanitary authorities to examine premises on which food is prepared for sale, and to require the removal of conditions likely to give rise to contamination." Infant Life Pkotection Bill, see page 15. Homewokk Regulation Bill, see page 118. Butter and Margarine Bill, see page 129. 169 Sale of Whisky Bill. Presented by Mr. Williamson, ordered to be printed 18th February, 1907. The object of this Bill is to secure to purchasers of whisky a clear statement whether it is a whisky made in a pot still from pure malt, or of malt and com, or is in part a spirit made in a patent still from unmalted grain. To carry out this object the Bill proposes to enact that all whisky shall, from the time of leaving the distillery till sold to the consumer, be described by a mark or label on the cask or bottle as " whisky " or " blend of whisky and patent still spirit," as the case may be. Provision is made for similar information being given to persons purchasing whisky on draught. Under the existing law the Inland Revenue are furnished with returns of the materials used in each distillation, and they have, by means of the permits or certificates required on the removal of spirits and the stock books required to be kept by rectifiers, dealers and retailers, the information necessary for tracing the whisky till it reaches the retailer. Power to prosecute for offences against the Bill is therefore given to officers of Inland Revenue, but persons authorised by local authorities having the execution of the laws relating to food and drugs are also to have power to prosecute, and are to be supplied by the Inland Revenue with the information necessary for that purpose. Weekly Rest-day Bill. Presented by Mr. Goddard Clarke, ordered to be printed 6th November, 1906. The object of this Bill is to provide for each person who is working or an employer having the twenty-four hours of Sunday as a rest-day in each week, or when Sunday labour is necessary to have one Sunday of twenty-four hours uninterrupted in a fortnight, and the day before or the day after the following Sunday to be a free and uninterrupted rest-day. 170 Again I must thank Mr. Shillinglaw, the principal Clerk in the Town Clerk's Department for his kind assistance which at all times he has so willingly rendered me, adding efficiency to the working of the Public Health Department. Mr. Shillinglaw acts as Clerk to the Public Health and Housing Committee, and has recorded the resolutions, recommendations and reports of the Committee which have been quoted in thi3 report.

Public Health Department, December 31st, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my seventeenth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending 31st December, 1906, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 1112 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 201 Do. on house-to-house visitation 214 Do. Canal Boats 48 Ee-inspections 2,521 Making a total of 4,096 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,527 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that 38.17 per cent, of the premises thus inspected various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out—requiring the service of 583 written intimations, 407 statutory, and 85 final notices. In many of these cases on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 2 cases it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating 2 attendances at the police-court to ensure enforcement. IIouse-to-Housc Visitation. The house-to-house inspection comprised the whole of the houses in the under-mentioned roads and streets— Prince Arthur's Avenue Victoria Cottages (twice) and sections of Eanwell Street, Appian Eoad, Wendon Street and Candy Street. The foregoing includes some houses which had been found to have been overlooked during the past few years. New drainage systems, of which plans and particulars were submitted to the Council for approval, have been laid at the under-mentioned premises:— 172 Ranwell Street, 26, new w.c.

The market places have been regularly inspected throughout the year, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. The following have also received constant attention throughout the year:— Bakehouses 21 Registered Milksellers 59 Public House Urinals 26 Marine Store Dealers 3 Butchers' Shops 19 Fishmongers' Shops 15 Fruiterers' Shops 9 Ice Cream Shops 16 Hairdressers' Shops 16 175 Food and Drugs Acts.

Places where Food is Prepared. The 18 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Unsound Food. Through the year 1 trunk of cod's roes were specially examined by request of the owner, and found unfit for human consumption. The roes were destroyed and the usual certificate given. Factory and Workshop Acts. The workshops, workplaces and outworkers on the Eegister have been visited, and the terms of the Acts relating to them have been required by notice, where necessary, to be complied with. No summonses were necessary, as the works were immediately executed on the service of intimation or notice. 176 PARISH OF BOW (West Division).

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM BOYCE, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Bow West Division. 177 Report of Inspector, Bow East Division. Public Health Offices, Bow Boad, E. December 31st, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— In detailing the sanitary work carried out in the Bow East Division during the past year I have to observe that nothing of any particular moment has engaged my attention during the period, but, on the contrary, the duties have been more or less exceptionally routine in character. This has, no doubt, largely arisen from the continued attentions in the past ten years, during which time, you are doubtless aware, much work of a concrete and lasting nature has been executed, and it is gratifying to find that at last the solid work of the past years is shewing some effect in the great reduction of the serious sanitary defects discovered, as well as the probable reduction of diseases usually associated with those defects. Indeed the number of cases of notifiable diseases occurring within the past twelve months has been remarkable by reason of the pronounced diminution bearing most favourable comparison with any previous year, and yet withal more ground has been covered with bricks and mortar from year to year till the uncovered portion is now reduced to a minimum. This is as it should be, where there is sowing, reaping should follow, and we are encouraged in realising our work has borne fruit. By this process we are also permitted to discharge the continued extra varying duties of a more trivial description which are attached to us from time to time, duties of a more routine character, yet none the less important from the public health point of view, and which include persistent visitation of milkshops at short periods, inspection of bakehouses, ice cream shops, coffee shops and eating houses, outworkers and workshops, and canal boats, offensive businesses within and without the district, smoke nuisances, slaughterhouses and premises used for the preparation of foods. 178 Primary Inspection of Premises:— On Complaints of Nuisances 1101 On Notifications of Infectious Diseases 123 On House to House Inspection 222— 1446 The House-to-House Inspection in the Division comprised:— Kelday Eoad. Remus Road. Blondin Street. Dye House Lane. Gandy Court. And sections of:— Davey Eoad. Rothbury Road. Wansbeck Road. Old Ford Road. Allanmouth Road. Douro Street. Drainage. Part re-construction of drainage was carried out on old lines at:— Bow Road, Nos. 61, 220, 222, 224. Landseer Road, Nos. 3, 14. Addington Road, Nos. 36, 38.

Gluckstein, Wansbeck Road. Bow Road, No. 167 (new gully connection). Smoke Nuisances. Smoke nuisances arising within the district have been of a very minor character, which is also evidenced by the greatly diminished number of complaints received from the Coal Smoke Abatement Society and the London County Council. Where nuisances have occurred intimation and notice have been served and the nuisance abated thereon. Most of the complaints seem to arise from some unexpected breakdown of a boiler or careless stoking. Only one smoke nuisance presented itself under the Highways and Locomotives Act. A summons was applied for and resulted in the defending owner being fined £3 and 2 guineas costs. No nuisances have occurred in the district arising from without the district. Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. Under the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations 55 boats have been examined. Of these 24 were registered and 31 non-registered. In the case of one registered canal boat the master had no certificate aboard. It appeared the boat had been run down in the Thames and the certificate consequently lost. The master after repairs had been carried out had forgotten to apply for a new certificate. The Registration Authority and owner were communicated with by letter. In another instance the master had a provisional certificate until meeting of the Registration Authority. All the registered canal boats, with one exception, were found in fair condition and in compliance with the Acts and Regulations. One boat had the seams of cabin head leaky, but was laid up for repair on her return. No contravention of the Acts was discovered on any of the nonregistered boats. 180 Offensive Businesses. No serious nuisances from offensive businesses arising within or without the district have occurred during the past twelvemonth, though the year previous was prolific of complaints respecting this description of nuisance. Verminous Booms. 68 verminous rooms have been cleansed under the provisions of the London County Council General Powers Act. Factories, Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces have been visited and found generally satisfactory, and any nuisanc.es arising within these premises have been abated on the service of intimation. Homework. The outworkers, who are all boot and shoe operatives, have been visited twice during the year, and the premises of each examined for nuisances and sanitary defects. The workrooms were mostly found in a fair condition, and any defects in the premises were remedied by the owner on a notice being served. Milkshops and Cowsheds. The milkshops and cowsheds have given no cause for complaint; the cowsheds were limewhited and cleansed twice during the year, in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds orders, and the milk vessels and measures of the various milk vendors were satisfactory. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. On visiting the ice cream makers and vendors during the season, the London County Council (General Powers Act, 1902) was apparently carefully complied with with one exception—an alien with crude ideas of cleanliness, but these ideas were amended on the service of intimation and notice, and the room where the ice cream was made and at the same time used as a common kitchen by a number of itinerant vendors was discontinued for cream making. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts fifty-one varied samples have 181 been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analyses. Seven on analysis were found to be adulterated—three only sufficiently to require the vendor to be cautioned by the Public Health and Housing Committee, whilst in the cases of the remaining four, summonses were issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples and results of proceedings are appended. Butter.—Containing at least 3.2 per cent. excess of water. Vendor ordered by Magistrate to pay costs, 23s., as he relied on warranty, though warranty was not given notice of within the statutory seven days before the hearing. Butter.—Adulterated with 88 4 per cent. of foreign fat and containing 0.18 per cent. of boric acid. Vendor fined £14 and 23s. costs. Margarine.—Containing 1 per cent. of excessive water. Vendor cautioned. Milk.— Milk deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 11.7 per cent. Vendor fined 1s. and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with 86.1 per cent. of foreign fat and 0.25 boric acid. Vendor fined £5 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Milk deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 5.8 per cent. Vendor cautioned. Butter.—Contained an excess of water to extent of 1.4 per cent. Vendor cautioned. In addition to these six other samples were mixed with foreign substances, i.e., boric acid (preservative) in varying small proportions, making in all thirteen defective samples. Number of samples obtained 51 Containing excess of water in butter 2 ,, ,, ,, in margarine 1 ,, boric acid in butter 7 „ ,, in margarine 1 „ foreign fat in butter 2 Deficiency of solids not fat in milk 2 ,, cream ,, 182 Twenty samples of butter were obtained for analyses, of which 7, o 35 per cent., were found to contain boric acid preservative.

Another sample of coffee and chicory was found to contain 50 per cent, of each ingredient, and also cost 1s. per lb. Houses Let in Lodgings. In the Bow East Division 109 houses have been placed on the register of houses let in lodgings.

During the year the above premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected. Milk Shops. There are 57 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation. A caution was necessary in one shed. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. Attention has been given to the sale of unsound milk. The class of meat sold has, in my opinion, been sound. Unsound Food. Several trunks of fish have been surrendered by owners, and certificates given. Forty-eight boxes of tomatoes have also been surrendered. Bakehouses. These are often inspected, but there has been little cause of complaint. They are now classified as Workshops or Domestic Workshops. 189 Smoke Nuisances. Observations have been made throughout the district with respect to smoke nuisances. Several intimations have been served and the nuisances abated. Offensive Matter. There has been no cause for proceedings under this heading during the year 1906. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Assoc. San. Inst. Cert. Sanitary Inspector Exam. Board (Lond.) and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and Canal Boats Act, Bromley North Division. O 190 Report of Inspector, Beomley Central Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my seventeenth Annual Report of the Sanitary Works executed for the abatement of nuisances which have existed in the Central Division of the Parish of Bromley under the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Council for the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1906. Inspection of District. I have inspected 1,313 premises, 887 in response to complaints of nuisances, 127 on account of infectious diseases notified, and 299 houseto-house visitations have been made. Of the 1,313 premises so dealt with 454 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the 861 premises (the remainder) nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated list, page 157). In the supervision of the same 3,419 re-inspections were made. I have to add that in the above statement the remainder of outstanding arrears of premises not inspected during past years have now been dealt with. The total number of premises in the district has been reduced by 23 dwelling-houses demolished to form sites for an open space adjacent to Devas Street, new thoroughfare in the Abbott Road, and footbridge in Clutton Street, etc. The Council's continued work of reconstruction of sewers, both public and on private property also the reconstruction of combined drainage systems by owners where necessary have had a marked effect, inasmuch as complaints respecting choked drains are of less frequent occurrence, as a rule being limited to slight local obstructions, which are soon remedied. 191 House-to-Housc Inspections.

The drains of 230 premises were tested by means of the "rocket" smoke test, 51 were proved defective (not gastight), whilst the remainder, 179 cases, with negative results. The water test has been applied to all new drainage works, and also where practicable to drains partially reconstructed or repaired. Drains newly Constructed and Reconstructed on old lines of Drainage. The drains of the undermentioned premises were newly constructed and reconstructed, and also (where possible) intercepted, ventilated and furnished with means of access for cleansing purposes in accordance with the London County Council's drainage bye-laws and plans of drainage as approved by Council:— Andrew Street, Nos. 14, 15, 16, 17.

In carrying out the above-mentioned drainage work it necessitated submitting on the owners' parts six plans for Council's approval. Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorization granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with London County Council's and Poplar Borough Council's bye-laws, as the statutory notices served were complied with. Inspection of Eating-Houses (Coffee Shops and Stewed Eel Shops), Pork Butchers, Sausage Makers and Fried Fish Shops. I have by your direction inspected the whole of the above described business premises, and where required served "intimations," notices, etc., for works of repair, cleansing, etc., which in every case has been carried out. In no instance upon such visits made was there cause for complaint so far as the food was concerned. 193 Inspection of Bakehouses. I have, as specially instructed, made periodical inspections of the bakehouses, and where required served extracts of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, and statutory notices for the necessary work of repairs, which were respectively complied with. Dairy, Milk Sellers and Purveyors. The cowsheds and milk purveyor's premises were frequently inspected and the register kept at the Public Health Offices corrected in the cases of those found to be non-registered, through change of ownership of business. The new occupiers were furnished with forms in accordance with your instructions, which were duly signed and particulars inserted in register. Constant attention has been given to the enforcement of the regulations relating to cleanliness of utensils, premises, etc., but in no case has any infringement been discovered. Upon notice received for renewal of licence the cowshed at the rear of 27, Abbott Road was again inspected and found in fair sanitary condition; no objection was raised to the application of the owner of business to the London County Council. Examination of Food. I have on several occasions, upon applications from different itinerant vendors and tradesmen, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found "unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food" witnessed the same which were destroyed by the owners, and I have given certificates to that effect. In no instance was there any article of food " exposed for sale, deposited for sale, or preparation for sale" at the time of my visit in such condition as to justify seizure. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. As directed by you, all the premises where ice cream was made were inspected, with the view of detecting nuisances and auy infringement of the London Council's General Powers Act, 1902. The barrows used by the itinerant vendors were examined to see that they were legibly marked with their names, etc.; also care taken that the premises in question were clean and kept in a sanitary condition, and that the ice cream was wholesome and the utensils, etc., with surroundings satisfactory. Factory and Workshop Inspections. Nuisances arising within the several factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., were dealt with. 194 The whole of the ascertained premises above described were inspected and found in most cases to be in a clean condition. Where necessary intimations, notices, etc., were served, which were duly complied with by the work of repairs being carried out. Smoke Nuisances. I have, where a nuisance has occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney other than belonging to a private dwelling house, viz.: factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., either on complaint or from my own personal observation, served "intimations," notices, etc., and the nuisances, for the time being, were abated. Inspection of Canal Boats (Barges). I have made 43 inspections of the cabins, etc., of non-registered barges, with the result that no infringement of regulations had been discovered; 3 of that number were sailing barges. Schools. I have at different times visited the public schools, all of which have been found in fair sanitary condition. There are no private schools in the Bromley Central Division. Hairdressers' Shops. I have at your request visited the above described premises, and have, where found necessary, had the same put in proper order. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. I have, as required, procured 52 samples, articles of food, etc., and submitted same to the Public Analyst (Mr. W. C. Young) for analysis. Three were found so much adulterated that legal proceedings were taken, the nature of article, extent of adulteration, and result of prosecutions being as follows:— Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 7 per cent. Vendor fined 20s. and 23s. costs, or 10 days' imprisonment. Milk.—Contained a proportion of a foreign ingredient, formaldehyde 13 per cent. Vendor fined £2 and £3 3s. costs. 195 Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat and in fat to the extent of 15.2 and 3.3 per cent. respectively. Dismissed upon statute notice, production of written warranty, and evidence which proved that the milk in question had been sold in the same state as delivered to the defendant. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS. Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Canal Boats Act, Bromley Central Division. 196 Report of Inspector, West Combined Division. Public Health Department, 31st December, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my sixth Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith in the West Combined District during the past 12 months, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds 1,376 houses or other premises have been visited, 199 of these visits being on account of infectious diseases. This number shows a steady decrease year by year and compares favourably with the 298 cases last year. Of the 199 cases 15 were notified from Langley House Receiving Home and 9 in connection with the Union, including one case of enteric brought from the Farm Colony. House-to-House Inspections. These visits, to the number of 151, were carried out in the undermentioned places, and a large amount of drainage work crops up by inspecting the houses on the list which the Medical Officer had prepared about three or four years ago, and which had escaped attention for the past 16 years. About 80 per cent. of the drains of these premises are found to be in a very bad state. Augusta Street. Bath Street. By grove Street. Barchester Street. Cotall Street. Charles Street. Canton Street. Canton Buildings. Castor Street. Cording Street. 197 Duncan Cottages. East India Road. Giraud Street. Garford Street. Hill Place Street. Hale Street. Ivy Cottages. King Street. Kerby Street.

The drains of 144 premises have been tested with either smoke or scent tests, and in 104 cases found to be defective. During the year the drains of the following premises were taken out (where necessary right through to the sewer) and reconstructed, and where practicable, in order to comply with the Bye laws of the London County Council and Borough Council, were intercepted, ventilated and provided with proper means of access for clearing in times of stoppages, the whole being subjected to a water test before being passed as sound. In a number of cases combined systems were dealt with: — Alton Street, Nos. 29, 36 (part). Augusta Street, Nos. 96, 98, 100, 102, 40, 42, 54, 56. Bygrove Street, Nos. 9, 11, 19, 41, 2, 39.

Wade Street, Nos. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 (part), Wade Street Schools. According to arrangements with the Surveyor's Department I have been present on most of the work on new buildings when drains have been under test. The drainage of many premises has also been repaired and made sound. Coffee and Eating Houses. These have been regularly inspected during the year, new shops have been placed on the register and in 2 instances old ones taken off. There are now 31 in the district. While inspecting these premises, attention as far as possible has been paid to the food about the place and ready to be cooked or in preparation. They have been kept clean, and no complaints have been received respecting same. Food Inspection at Wharf, etc. Aberdeen wharf, where food and skins are landed for transit, has been regularly visited, nothing being found to complain of. 199 The butchers' premises and market stalls are inspected, sometimes by day and sometimes by night. In each place where sausages and brawn are made special attention has been given. On each visit during the year the places have been found in good order. Several consignments of damaged wheat, rice, barley, etc., have been received from the docks into my district to be made up into poultry food. These have been watched throughout and dealt with. The following is a list of food destroyed during the year: — 26 wings of roker. One box of roker. A consignment of onions. A consignment of crabs (100). 3 baskets of pears, and numerous small lots of damaged fruit have been dealt with in the market in a satisfactory manner. Factory and Workshops. All those now on the register are regularly visited, and when necessary cleansing notices are served, which are usually soon attended to. No overcrowding in any workshop has been found to exist. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited, and notices to cleanse the premises served where required. Smoke Nuisances. All observations of black smoke from the factory chimneys and shafts in the district, notified by the London County Council and also my own observations, have been dealt with. It was not necessary to take any legal proceedings during the year. Bakehouses. The occupied bakehouses now number 20, and have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily, and they have all been measured up by the owners and 200 forms fixed showing the amount of cubic space in each bakehouse and also the number of persons that may be employed therein at one time. This affords ready means of ascertaining if any overcrowding exists at times of inspection. Some occupiers have had to be cautioned respecting the "sweepings" being allowed to congregate about the place, but generally speaking nothing much to complain of has been found to exist. Dairies, Cowsheld, Milkshops and Slaughter Houses. These places have received proper attention throughout the year. The dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness, especially under the handles, and have been mostly kept well covered to keep out dust, etc. The cowsheds before the renewal of licences have always been inspected, attention being paid to all overhead parts where dirt could gather. One cowshed has been taken off the register, as it is not now used for keeping cows in. The register of milkshops requires constantly altering and amending, owing to the smaller shops so often changing hands and the new tenants have been placed on the register. This entails some amount of watchfulness as rarely do the new tenants seek registration of their own accord. The slaughter houses have been visited at times when killing is in progress, and nothing out of the way found to exist. The number of these premises now on the list is as follows:— Milkshops 84 Cowsheds 1 Slaughter houses 3 Canal Boats Acts. During the year I have had an opportunity of boarding 20 canal boats, four of which were registered under the Canal Boats Acts, the others were sailing and rowing barges. Each boat was found to be in good order, those registered under the Acts especially so. 201 The certificates were examined, inspections made as to overcrowding and separation of sexes, and no fault was to be found. The "water vessels" and means of keeping the bilge water out of the cabins, such as the "bulkheads" and pumps, were found to be in good condition, and no percolation of gas liquor (which principally comprises the cargo of these boats which come to the tar works in the district) was found. No case of disease was found on any of the boats. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. Forty-nine samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis by the Public Analyst during the year, 4 of which proved to be adulterated. By directions of the Committee legal proceedings were instituted in each case. In 2 other cases samples proved to be badly adulterated, namely, a sample of limewater which proved to be deficient in lime to the extent of 90.8 per cent, and a sample obtained as " Coffee and Chicory," which proved to contain 75 per cent, of chicory. In the first case the chemist told my purchaser that he could not guarantee the lime water to be up to B.P., and in the other case the Council's solicitor advised that no action be taken, unless as a test case. The amount of adulteration and result of proceedings are set out below :— Butter.—Adulterated with S2 per cent, of foreign fat. Defendant fined 40s. and 12s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to extent of 14 per cent. Defendant fined 40s. and 23s. costs. Milk.—Containing formaldehyde 0 016 per cent. Defendant fined 10s. and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with 81 per cent, of foreign fat. Defendant fined 40s. and 23s. costs. Public Health Act. All cases of infectious diseases notified during the year have been closely enquired into in order to trace the connection (if any) between one case and another. 202 In the month of April, on Easter Monday, a proprietor of "shows" was arrested on a warrant on Wanstead Flats for not answering to a summons I took out against him, for occupying No. 18 Chrisp Street without a water supply to the premises. He was running the shop as a "show place," where he exhibited 14 Zulus. The premises were occupied by himself and wife also, and were in an indescribable condition. After hearing the evidence the magistrate said he would inflict the utmost penalty he could as it was a loathsome and disgusting case, and he shuddered to think what might have happened had an infectious disease been introduced into the place, crowded as it was. A fine of 20s. and 30s. costs or 14 days' imprisonment was inflicted with the remark that he was sorry he could not make it more. A horse slaughterer of Barking was summoned for infringing the new bye-laws of the London County Council, viz., for conveying a dead horse through the streets in a cart which was not properly covered and lined with an impervious material. Defendant was fined 3s. and the costs of the proceedings, as this was the first summons under the bye-laws. The owner of Nos. 1 and 2, Charles Street, Bromley, was summoned for not complying with the Council's notice to amend a defective drain. An abatement order of 14 days and 26s. cost was made and the work was then done. A builder was summoned at Thames Police Court under the 42nd Section, for repairing a drain in such a manner as to be dangerous to health. He was cautioned by the magistrate, and was fined £6 and £2 2s. costs and had to put the work right. The owner of 86, Sussex Street was summoned for not complying with the Council's notice to amend a defective drain. An abatement order of 14 days and 23s. costs was made, and the work was then done. London County Council (General Powers) Acts. Ice Cream Regulations. All premises where ice cream is made or sold in the district, numbering 35, have been regularly inspected during such times as the "cream" is handled, and where necessary cleansing notices have been served and complied with. 203 The itinerant vendors have kept their names and addresses conspicuously displayed on their barrows as required by the Act, and also kept their utensils clean. Public House Urinals. These have been kept as clean as possible, and comply with the London County Council (General Powers) Act. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH JOHNSON, H.P.C., Cert. San. Insp. Exam. Board (London) ; Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs and Canal Boats Acts, West Combined Division. 204 Report of Inspector, East Combined Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my eleventh Annual Report of the sanitary work carried out in my district (East Combined Division) during the year ended 31st December, 1906. 1523 premises have been inspected, 1237 in response to complaints of nuisances, 129 on account of infectious diseases, and 157 house to house visitations. Of the 1523 premises so dealt with 916 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst the remainder, 607 premises, nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated list, page 157). House-to-House Inspections. House-to-house inspections have been carried out in the whole of the following streets :— Blair Street, Commodore Court, Lodore Street. House-to-house inspections have been carried out in sections of the following streets:— Aberfeldy Street, Albert Street, Brunswick Street, Cold Harbour, Creekside, East India Dock Road, Gaselee Street, Grosvenor Buildings, Grundy Street, High Street, Naval Row, Orchard Place, Prestage Street St. Leonard's Road, Scouler Street, Tetley Street. Drainage Construction and Reconstruction. During the year the drains of the undermentioned premises were constructed or reconstructed, and in most cases (where there was sufficient 205 fall in the drain) intercepted, ventilated and furnished with means of access back and front, in accordance with the London County Council's bye-laws and the regulations of the Borough Council, plans of each having been submitted and approved. "The Fishing Smack" p.h., Cold Harbour; 14, Robin Hood Lane; "The Nag's Head" p.h., Cotton Street; 3, 5, Bow Lane; 38, Cotton Street; "The Royal Standard," p.h., St. Leonard's Road; Brunswick Road Industrial School, part.

P 206 Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorization granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with the London County Council's and Council's own bye-laws, as the statutory notices served were complied with. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. 53 samples of food of different kinds have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis during the year, four of which were certified to have been adulterated. In two instances convictions were obtained with costs, in the other two the adulteration was so small that the Council's Solicitor, who stated that no magistrate would convict, advised that a letter of caution be sent. The detais are set out below:— Butter.—Adulterated with 8.4 per cent, of foreign fat. Defendant fined 20s. and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 2 per cent. A letter of caution was sent to the vendor. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 10 per cent. Defendant fined 20s. and 23s. costs. Butter.—Containing 1.7 per cent, of excessive water and a proportion of a foreign ingredient. Boric Acid 0.2 per cent. I have by your instructions distributed printed circulars throughout the district to each of the milk vendors re "preservatives in milk" as suggested in the printed circular from the Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., July, 1906. Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of premises where milk is sold throughout the district, with the object of detecting any infringement of the regulations under " The Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order cf 1885, as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, with respect to means of storage, prevention of contamination, cleanliness and registration, and during the 207 year there has been no occasion to take legal proceedings. In one case new measures were required to be provided, and in another case a letter of caution was sent with respect to the condition of the measures, which had the desired effect. Number of Milk Sellers 42 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 7 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 0 Number of Milk Sellers added to Register 0 Factory and Workshops. During the year the workshops and workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number employed in each case being checked, and any alteration found duly reported and entered in the register kept for that purpose. Particular attention has been given to the sanitary arrangements, cleanliness, light and ventilation, and where necessary notices served and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. Bakehouses. By your instructions I have made periodical inspections of the bakehouses throughout the district (16), three of which are underground. In several instances the abstracts required to be fixed in accordance with the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, were not exhibited, and duly reported on. Instructions were left for the said abstracts to be affixed in a prominent place, specifying as regards the cubic capacity and the number of persons employed therein during the ordinary period of employment, particularly in reference to night work. The condition in some cases necessitated service of intimations with respect to limewashing, removal of sweepings from under the troughs, and cleansing of utensils. Cowsheds and Slaughter Houses. Five notices were received for the renewal of licences. The premises were duly inspected and where any infringement of the regulations was found intimations and statutory notices were served and the infringements abated before the licences were granted (Cowsheds, 2; Slaughter Houses, 3). Overcrowding. During the year complaints of three cases of overcrowding were received. In two instances the nuisances were abated after service of 208 intimations and statutory notices. In the other case a summons was heard at the Thames Police Court against the occupier of second floor room at 18, Gaselee Street. The defendant was fined 7s. 6d., including costs, the nuisance having been abated previous to the summons being heard. Smoke Nuisances. During the past year the shafts throughout the district have been kept under special observation and in seven instances nuisances were detected. Intimations and statutory notices were sent, and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. There has been no recurrence of the nuisances, therefore no necessity to take legal proceedings. Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, &c. Special supervision has been given to these premises, all of which have been inspected with respect to cleanliness. Limewashing and cleansing in nearly every case was found necessary, the particulars of which have been duly reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee. The foodstuffs at each of the premises were examined at each visit and found to be satisfactory. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. All the premises where ice cream is made have been inspected with a. view to detecting nuisances, also any infringements of the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1902, Part VIII. Each itinerant vendor's barrow has been inspected, and in each instance the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto. At the same time the utensils were found to be in a clean condition, and the ice cream of good quality. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, &c. There is only one wharf in my district where food (all tinned) is landed for sale, at home and abroad, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour, Eamournie Meat Co. These premises have been carefully inspected, and kept under strict supervision during the past year, and tins containing the following articles were found to be blown or otherwise damaged, and on inspection were found to be unfit for human consumption, and were condemned with the consent of the manager, who stated that they were not intended for sale:— 209 January.—64 1½lbs. chicken ; 29 21bs. mock turtle. February.—132 2lbs. chicken ; 123 61bs. beef. April.—14 21bs. beef; 11 4lbs. beef. June.—259 1½lbs. sausages; 114 61bs. mutton; 66 61bs. beef. July.—362lbs. beef. August.—126lbs. beef; 23 21bs. kidney and soup. September.—61 6lbs. beef; 42 6lbs. mutton. November.—27 2lbs. oxtail soup; 572lbs. beef. December.—70 2lbs. beef ; 4 2lbs. beef. Unsound Food. Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been regularly visited with a view to detecting unsound and unwholesome food, and in a few instances parcels of fish, meat and fruit, on being examined, were found to be unfit for human consumption and destroyed. In each case the vendor was severely cautioned ; 27 cases of tomatoes, 1 box of haddocks, 3 cases of haddocks, and 3 barrels of apples were brought to the Public Health Offices during the year, and on examination were found to be unfit for human food, which I condemned, and gave the usual certificate to that effect. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected with respect to the sanitary conditions of the premises and cleanliness of the articles used in the businesses, and where necessary intimations and statutory notices were served and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. Public-House Urinals. These have been kept as clean as possible under the new powers conferred by the Act. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without particular incident. All the boats visited appeared to be in fair condition and in compliance with the requirements of the Acts and Regulations. Cleansing of Cisterns. The cisterns of the following buildings have been inspected during 210 the year and the conditions duly reported upon, the cleansing has been done, and the cistern lids where defective amended and made as far as practicable dustproof. Each cistern was so situated as to be free from pollution:— Adelaide Buildings, Baffin Buildings, Grosvenor Buildings, Hudson's Buildings, Melbourne Buildings, Montreal Buildings, Ontario Buildings, Ottawa Buildings, Prestage Buildings, Quebec Buildings, Ealeana Road Buildings, Sydney Buildings, Toronto Buildings, Winnipeg Buildings. Outworkers. The various premises where male outworkers reside have been visited and invariably found to be in a satisfactory condition. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 20. During the year, on inspection, 24 rooms were found to be in a verminous condition. Intimations were served, also statutory notices where necessary and the nuisances abated, without recourse to legal proceedings.

Drains. Drain construction and reconstruction, including means of access and ventilation, were carried out at the following premises:— Glengarnock Iron Works. Grosvenor Wharf. Wharf Road. West Ferry Road (182, 184, 186), 107, 109, 111, 113, 115. ,, ,, „ St. Paul's Presbyterian Church. ,, „ „ St. David's Wharf. ,, ,, ,, St. Luke's Schools.

The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. In no instance was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings. The smoke preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking, as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits and cautions no doubt contributed to this result. Workshops, etc. The workshops and workplaces were regularly inspected—numbering 34—and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Public Health Prosecution. A summons was issued against the owner of 87, Stebondale Street, Cubitt Town, for neglecting to comply with a notice to repair the yard paving, roofs and sink wastepipe. On the 30th November, the date of the hearing, the works having been satisfactorily completed, the summons was withdrawn on the payment of £2 4s. costs by the owner.

Frequent visits were made to the under-mentioned wharves for the purpose of detecting the landing or storage of unsound food intended for sale for human consumption, with the results indicated:— Victoria Wharf (Crosse & Blackwell), West Ferry Road. Chiefly used for landing and storing vinegar and pickles. No other food stuffs landed at time of visits. Hutchings' Wharf, West Ferry Road. No food stuff landed. Timothy's Wharf, West Ferry Road. No food stuff landed. St. Andrew's Wharf and Cattle Food Factory, West Ferry Road.

Average number of tins per case 30 dozen. June 18th, 1906.—128½ cases desiccated cocoa nut, 1½cwt. per case and about 10 tons loose. August 22nd, 1906.—1½cwt. desiccated cocoa nut. Maconochie's Wharf and Food Preserving and Manufacturing premises, West Ferry Road. The above premises were constantly visited during the year. All unsound or tainted food stuffs, blown or suspicious tins, etc., were rejected by the firm and destroyed in the furnaces on the premises, in most instances in my presence. Food stuffs examined :— 100 doz. tins soup, fish and meat. 273 tins mixed fish, meat and vegetables. 3 barrels preserved pigs' livers. 216 4cwt. and 2 doz. large tins fruit pulp. 4 bushels uncooked shrimps.

The food stuffs examined and destroyed by the firm were as follows:— 188 cases mixed tinned goods, salmon, sardines and tongue, 4 doz. tins per case, equal to 9024 tins. 20 tins lobster, 1 doz. tins salmon, equal to 32 tins. 7 cases mixed tinned goods, average number tins per case about 3 doz., equal to 252 tins. Public Health Act. Seizure of Unsound Food. On the 1st June last I noticed in the window of the shop, No. 97, Stebondale Street, Cubitt Town, 5 tins—two contained herring and tomatoes and three sardines. The latter appeared to be blown. I entered the shop, purchased and opened one of each. The sardines were partially decomposed and unfit for food. I therefore promptly seized the remainder, and the following morning took them to the Thames Police Court for examination by the magistrate, who condemned the articles as unfit for human food. The owner, although advised to be present, did not appear. A condemnation order was obtained and a summons issued against the vendor. At the hearing on the 22nd June the magistrate convicted the defendant, and inflicted a penalty of £5 and 23s. costs. Food and Drugs Acts. 54 samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of that number 3 contained boric acid 217 preservatives ranging from 1. to .4 per cent., for which no action was taken. One was certified to be so adulterated that legal proceedings were instituted. The nature of sample and extent of adulteration, with result of prosecution, are indicated below :— Margarine containing 3.3 of excessive water. Vendor fined £2 and 23s. costs.

Public Health Department, December 31st, 1906. To the Medical Officcr of Health. Sir,— I beg to present to you my seventh Annual Report, which deals with the work done in the factories, workshops and among outworkers during 1906. During the year four intimations have been served where the sanitary accommodation was insufficient, unsuitable or not separate for the sexes. One new convenience was erected, and in three cases alterations were made. I have visited a number of houses from which children were excluded from school on account of their verminous condition, and have had cleansing carried out. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 105 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 214 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs, containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 158 lists have been sent to other Councils, containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. One employer was prosecuted and fined for not sending in his list as required. The following is a tabulated statement of further details: — 219 Tabulated Statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1906:— Poplar.

Public Health Department, December 31s£, 1906. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to hand you my third Annual report and a detailed statement of the work carried out under the Bye-laws, for the year ended December 31st, 1906. Registration. The work of registration was proceeded with, and many enquiries were made, which resulted in 75 houses being added to the registers, bringing the total number of registered houses up to 960. Owing to a growing tendency on the part of owners to frequently change Agents and collectors, much clerical work is entailed in connection with the registers and Journals. Overcrowding. Most of the overcrowding was again prevalent in several areas, as was the case in previous years, and although most of the cases were soon abated, it was found necessary to serve 35 notices to bring about the required state of affairs. Note 1. See tabulated statement * (page 221)—Included in the 93 cases abated during the year are 3 cases that were outstanding from 1905. Note 2. See tabulated statement ** (page 221)—The 13 cases outstanding at the end of the year were all abated during the early part of this year, 1907. Night Inspections. During the year many inspections were made at late hours of the night, and it was on these occasions that most of the cases of overcrowding 221 were discovered. Very little trouble was experienced with the Italian people residing in the Borough. Cleansing. In addition to the rooms, etc. (shown in the accompanying tabulated statement † (see page 222), having been cleansed, a large amount of work has been carried out by owners, on receiving verbal intimation, in order to comply with the bye-laws. During the times cleansing is in hand at many of the registered houses, a large number of re-inspections have to be made in order to check the bad habit of hanging new papers on walls without first removing the foul papers. Wherever possible the removal of old and dirty papers is insisted upon. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 20. Notices under this Act were served during the year, and as a result 37 rooms were thoroughly stripped and rid of vermin. Nuisances. As was the case in previous years, all nuisances that came to my notice, and could not be dealt with under the bye-laws, were duly notified to the inspector for the district. Legal Proceedings. I am glad to report that the year's work was carried through without recourse to legal proceedings being found necessary. Tabulated Statement for year ended December 31st, 1906.

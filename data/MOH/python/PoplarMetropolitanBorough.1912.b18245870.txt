The Reports of the Lady Health Visitors are also included. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1912, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1901 and 1911 being maintained, is 161,597 :— Registration London.

The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1911 are the rates as stated in previous Reports ; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Sub-District of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three subdistricts might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., VI. and VII., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1901 and 1911.

In the 52 weeks 2553 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 613 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1608 in Bromley, and 332 in Bow ; from the 613 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 57 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 405 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 961 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1608 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 763 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 211 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 1056. From the 332 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 3 non-residents and added 306 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 635 deaths. 8 In dealing separately with the sub-districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III., that in considering the deaths of nonresidents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub-districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2553 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 378 deaths of actual nonresidents and 477 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2652 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 961 deaths in Poplar included 11 illegitimate children, 4 male and 7 female ; the 1056 deaths in Bromley included 8 illegitimate children, 3 male and 5 female ; the 635 Bow deaths included 4 illegitimate children, 2 male and 2 female, making a total for the Borough of 23 deaths of illegitimate children.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was a gain of females from the Sub-Districts of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the years 1901-1909 and 1911 there was also a gain of females, but for the year 1910 the males gained over the females. 9 The following figures are the deaths rates per 1000 living for the past 28 years (see page 2):— Borough of County of Poplar.

[Copy.] November 14th, 1912. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Sir, It has come to my notice that there is a difference of opinion as to the class of case which should be notified as Ophthalmia Neonatorum. In some parts of London and even in some of the hospitals, cases of Ophthalmia are not notified unless they are due to the gonococcus of gonorrhæl origin. Is it not possible in the interests of humanity for the Local Government Board to obtain the opinion of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians, in the same way as I believe was done in Puerperal Fever and Cerebro-spinal Meningitis, for a definition as to Ophthalmia Neonatorum ? 15 I understand that cases have gone blind and have not been notified, and in other severe cases the plea has been that the the Ophthalmia has not been due to the gonococcus. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sd.) Feed. Wm. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health. The Secretary, Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. [Copy.] Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 19th December, 1912. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 14th ultimo, with reference to the interpretation to be placed upon the term ophthalmia neonatorum for the purposes of the notification of the disease. In reply, I am to state that the term ophthalmia neonatorum is not intended to be restricted to cases of purulent ophthalmia of new-born infants caused by the gonococcus, but should include cases of purlent eye discharges caused by other organisms, when these discharges occur during the first few days after birth. 16 In this connection I am to refer you to page 41 of the Nomenclature of Diseases drawn up by the Royal College of Physicians (Ed. 1906), where two special forms of purulent conjunctivitis are described : (1) Gonorrhæl; (2) From other genital discharges, and a note is added to the effect that " purulent ophthalmia of new-born infants may belong to either of these two forms, and should be noted as Ophthalmia Neonatorum." I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) J. S. Davy, Assistant Secretary. F. W. Alexander, Esq., Medical Officer of Health, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. AGE MORTALITY.

The following letter was considered by the Public Health and Housing Committee, viz.: — London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 20th May, 1912. Sir, The Council has under consideration the interim report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis, which has recently been appointed to report on "the consideration of general policy in respect of the problem of tuberculosis in the United Kingdom." In a letter dated 14th May, 1912, the Local Government Board stated that it agrees generally with the finding of the Committee and commends the report to the serious consideration of local authorities. In this connection, the Council is endeavouring to obtain information as to the existing means for the treatment of tuberculosis within the County of London, whether in the hands of the local authorities or otherwise, and to estimate the needs of the area. In particular, the Council desires information as to the number of beds in existing institutions which are or could be used for the treatment of persons suffering from tuberculosis, and as to the work now being done by the sanitary authorities in London under the recent tuberculosis regulations or otherwise. In view of the desire expressed in this report that regard should be had to all the existing available authorities, organisations, and institutions with a view to avoiding waste by overlapping, and to obtaining their co-operation, it will be of great assistance in the drafting of a scheme for London if the information referred to above is made available. The Council therefore trusts that the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council will be good enough to furnish the necessary information, so far as concerns the borough, at as early a date as possible, in view of the fact that the National Insurance Act, 1911, willshortly come into operation. It would save trouble if the information could be given under the several heads set out in the enclosed form, and the Council will be glad if the Borough Council will adopt this form as far as it is applicable to the circumstances of the borough, giving any special information that may be available in any case. At the same time the Council will give every consideration to any scheme which the Borough Council may consider desirable. 34 As soon as the Council has received the required information it is proposed to draw up a general scheme for the County and to invite the opinion of the Borough Councils thereon, and as this matter is one which so deeply concerns the Borough Councils, the Council feels sure of their active co-operation. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) Laurence Gomme, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. A circular letter was also received from the Local Government Board asking for similar information, and this was supplied to both authorities. Provision of means for Treatment of Tuberculosis—Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils. The Holborn Borough Council suggested Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils on the subject of the provision of means for treatment of Tuberculosis, within the County of London. The following resolutions were adopted at the Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils on the subject of the Interim Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis, viz. : — (1) That the Metropolitan Asylums Board having been constituted the Central Authority in London entrusted with the duty of providing accommodation for the isolation and treatment of persons suffering from notifiable infectious diseases, and pulmonary tuberculosis being now included in the category of such diseases, and having regard to the great experience gained by the Metropolitan Asylums Board in the establishment, maintenance and management of such institutions, this Conference is of opinion, that in the best interests of London it is very desirable that the provision and management of sanatoria and hospital accommodation for the treatment of tuberculous persons should also be entrusted to the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 35 (2) That tuberculosis dispensaries should be established and controlled by Metropolitan Borough Councils, either singly or in groups. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion that the proposals of the Conference should be supported, but that in respect of resolution No. 2 no action by the Council in this Borough is at present necessary, in view of the establishment of a Tuberculosis Dispensary by voluntary agency. Upon the report of the Public Health and Housing Committee the Council resolved that the resolutions of the Conference be approved, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Local Government Board, the London County Council, the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Insurance Commissioners be so informed. National Insurance Act, 1911. Council's Representative on the Local Sub-Committee. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee, viz.:— National Insurance Act, 1911. Insurance Committee for the County of London, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 19th July, 1912. Sir, A Sub-Committee of the Insurance Committee for the County of London have had under consideration the question of the arrangements to be made for the immediate administration under the National Insurance Act, 1911, of sanatorium benefit in the County. In this connection the Sub-Committee have decided to recommend the appointment temporarily of local sub-committees, consisting of ten members, in each metropolitan borough, the duty of such sub-committees to be to investigate cases of tuberculosis reported from within the areas for which they are respectively constituted, and to make arrangements for treatment. Arrangements will be made by the Committee for the provision of necessary sanatorium accommodation. d 36 It is proposed that each metropolitan borough council should be invited to appoint a representative on the local sub-committee established in their area, and in anticipation of the Insurance Committee approving the scheme at their meeting to be held on the 25th instant, I have been directed to ask that the Poplar Borough Council will nominate a representative, and further that the medical officer of health of the borough may be permitted to serve as an ex-officio member of the sub-committee. I am also to ask whether the borough council will be good enough to assist the Insurance Committee by allowing the local sub-committees, who will only be required to act pending the establishment of district committees under section 59 of the Act, to use the offices of the borough council for their meetings. It will be a great convenience if a reply to this letter can be received by the first post on Thursday, the 25th instant. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Laurence Gomme. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Mr. Alderman A. E. Thorp was appointed the Council's representative on the local sub-committee for administration of sanatorium benefit under the National Insurance Act, and the Medical Officer of Health was an ex-officio Member of the Committee. Anti-Tuberculosis Dispensary. [Copy.] Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 23rd July, 1912. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to forward to the Borough Council of Poplar the enclosed copy of a letter which has been addressed to the Board by the Executive Committee 37 of the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption, and I am to request that the Board may be furnished with the observations of the Council upon the subject of this communication.

With regard to Section 26 (page 17) of the Interim Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis referring to the " Position of existing voluntary institutions," and requiring that, so far as possible, existing voluntary institutions, such as sanatoria, etc., should be utilised, provided that they fulfil the following conditions :— (1) That they be approved as suitable by the Local Government Board; (2) That they fall into the general scheme for the prevention and treatment of Tuberculosis ; and (3) That they be subject to inspection by the Local Government Board whenever considered necessary ; D2 38 the Executive Committee of the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption trust that their institution, which has now been in full work since 22nd April last, and is already dealing with over 100 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis and suspected pulmonary tuberculosis, practically on the lines laid down in the Interim Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis, will be accepted as suitable by the Local Government Board, and that the Local Government Board will take an early opportunity of inspecting the Institution, which has been fully equipped and is quite up-to-date. A photograph of the exterior of the Dispensary, and articles from the "East London Observer" and "East End News" with reference to the aims and objects of the Institution, are enclosed herewith. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) A. Evans Thorp, Chairman. [Copy.] Local Government Board. Whitehall, S.W. 16th August, 1912. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state for the information of the Poplar Borough Council that they have approved, under Section 16 (1) (a) of the National Insurance Act, 1911, for a period of six months, the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption, Alexandra House, 135, Bow Road, E. The Board's approval is subject to the following conditions : (a) the inspection of the Institution at any time during that period by any of the Board's officers or inspectors, and (b) the keeping of such records as the Board after consultation with the Insurance Commissioners may require. 39 The Board have at the same time informed the authorities of the Dispensary that, as it is contemplated that in London arrangements for the provision of dispensaries will ordinarily be made by the Metropolitan Borough Councils, they should, if they desire the period of approval extended, communicate with the Council of the Borough on the subject. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. Willis, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk, Poplar. It was seen by the letter of the Local Government Board to the Dispensary dated loth August, that the Board had approved of the Dispensary under Section 16 (1) (a) of the National Insurance Act, 1911, for a period of six months, which period might be extended. Under these circumstances the Committee were of opinion that, for the present, there was no necessity for the Council to take any action for the provision of a Dispensary in view of the fact that the work of the Executive Committee of the Institution in the Bow Road apparently complied with the requirements set out in the "Interim Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis," and recommended the Council to concur in the opinion of the Committee as stated, and the Local Government Board be so informed. The Public Health and Housing Committee from time to time were informed by the Medical Officer of Health of the progress of the Dispensary situate at 135, Bow Road, and on more than one occasion had visited the Institution, inspected the building, and been made acquainted with the inside and outside administrative arrangements. The Dispensary, as carried on at the present time, appears to comply with the requirements of the " Interim Report of the Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis," appointed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The twenty years' lease of the Bow Road premises was purchased by the Executive Committee of the Institution, and a sum of money sufficient to pay the ground rent during the period of the lease, and which sum will likewise cover any expenses at the end of the lease, has also been invested in the names of two trustees. The Executive Committee consists as follows :— 40 Edwin J. Aldrick, J.P., Atlas Chemical Works, Millwall, E., Mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Fredk. Wm. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health for the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. George Mathieson, Clarnico Works, Hackney Wick, N.E., Chairman and Managing Director of Messrs. Clarke, Nicholls & Coombs, Ltd. Fred. Thorne, J.P., Manchester Road, Cubitt Town, Member of the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. A. Evans Thorp (Chairman), Fairfield Works, Bow, E., Alderman of the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. T. H. Fisher (Hon. Treasurer), Manager, London County & Westminster Bank, Ltd., Bow Branch. At a very large expense the building has been added to, adapted furnished and fitted quite up-to-date as follows :— Waiting room, nurse's room, medical officer's consulting room, dispensary, bacteriological laboratory, and committee room; there are also living rooms for the caretaker and his wife. The Dispensary has been well stocked with drugs, and the laboratory furnished with the latest scientific instruments used in such institutions for assisting in the diagnosis and prognosis of tuberculosis, and there is also an up-to-date X-ray apparatus, useful in the diagnosis of deep-seated tuberculosis of the chest and also as a record keeper of the condition of the patient. The Dispensary was opened on the 22nd April last, and a Medical Officer, Dispenser, Nurse, Caretaker and Clerk have been duly appointed. A Care Committee has been instituted, consisting of ladies residing within the Borough and two medical practitioners, to inquire into the requirements and wants of cases attending the Dispensary. The ladies of the Committee (numbering at present seven) also visit the homes of the patients. The Executive Committee have also taken one bed at Benenden Sanatorium, Kent, and are lending shelters for patients to sleep in at their own homes, and are lending beds and bedding, so that consumptive patients may sleep alone. 41 TABLE I.

The percentage on the total (admission) scarlet fever cases was 4.10, diphtheria cases 6.50, and enteric fever cases 14.28. Among the 12 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 2 broncho-pneumonia, 2 measles, 2 tonsillitis, 1 rotheln, 1 stomatitis, and 1 strophulus. Among the 13 cases wrongly certified as diphtheria were 5 of tonsillitis, 2 Vincent's angina, and 2 laryngitis. 1 case was scarlet fever and not diphtheria. In the course of the year 1912 no fewer than 1,899 patients* against 2,237 in 1911, 1,723 in 1910, 2,322 in 1909, 2,594 in 1908, 3,109 in 1907, 2,151 in 1906, 2,157 in 1905, 1,993 in 1904, 1,913 in 1903, and 2,108 in 1902, or a percentage on the total admissions of 10.5 in 1911, 11.2 in 1910, 10.2 in 1909, 9.27 in 1908, 9.7 in 1907, 8.3 in 1906, 9.04 in 1905, 10.7 in 1904, 10.4 in 1903, and 8.6 in 1902 were, after admission to the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certificates upon which they were removed to hospital. The number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar for the years 1899— 1912 which were removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals, have been as follows :— Percentage of mistakes in total admissions.

Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever and also sputum from suspected tuberculous patients bacteriologically examined. (See pages 123, 119 and 24.) Arrangements are still made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the medical officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. One case of measles was connected with a milkshop in Poplar. No infectious cases were connected with milkshops in Bromley. Two cases of measles, and one of erysipelas, were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.* Fifteen premises with outworkers were† connected with infectious cases notified, two in Poplar, seven in Bromley, and six in Bow—four scarlet fever, five diphtheria, one typhoid fever and five erysipelas. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Thirteen cases of measles were connected with out-workers' premises—three Poplar, three Bromley, and seven Bow. For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 105. Suggested Notification of Leprosy. The Greenwich Borough Council called attention to cases of Leprosy in London, including a case in Greenwich, and suggested to the London County Council that an Order should be made applying throughout London to the disease, the notification, disinfection, and precautionary sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The support of the Council to such proposal was desired. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the proposal be supported. * See page 159. † See page 149. 83 ALPHABETICAL STREET LIST OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

Since the plant has been installed, a period now reaching seven years nearly a quarter of a million gallons have been manufactured at a cost for electricity and materials of about £480—£272 for electricity and £208 for material. The fluid costs under one-halfpenny per gallon.* The Public Health Department is not only furnished with the disinfectant and the various institutions of the Council (the public baths, etc.), but the institutions of the Managers of the Sick Asylums and of the Board of Guardians (within and without the Borough) are supplied with an unlimited quantity free. For the fluid supplied to the Works Department a charge of 1d. per gallon is made ; the Public Health Department is credited with this amount although no actual monetary transaction takes place. As applicants now usually bring their own receptacles to the Depôts there is also a very appreciable saving in the expense on bottles alone. * See "Comments on Adverse Criticisms," Annual Report, 1911. 95 Expenditure for the Year ended 31st March, 1912, and Expenditure for Quarter ended 30th June, 1912, average Expenditure for the Six Years ended 31st March, 1912, Estimate for Year ended 31st March, 1913, and for Year ending 31st March, 1914.

A total 960 gallons were supplied to four London County Council Public Elementary Schools for spraying and cleansing floors of class rooms. Swimming Baths, the use therein of the Electrolytic Fluid. The fluid continues to be added to the water in the swimming baths in the same quantity and strength as mentioned in the Annual Report for the year 1909, viz., 1 part of Chlorine to 2,000,000 parts of water. 4,832 gallons were supplied to the Poplar Baths, 5,527 gallons to the Bow Baths and 1,110 gallons to the Island Baths, making a total of 11,469 gallons. The Bath Superintendents repeat their statements that the addition of the fluid prevents the formation of slime in the water, the slime is not found at the bottom of the baths when they are emptied, and there is no offensive smell when the baths are being cleansed. Pollution of Swimming Baths and the Purification of the Water of Swimming Baths. The Public Health and Housing Committee viewed the Electrolytic Disinfectant Manufacturing Plant and the shed for its accommodation, reconstructed on another site in Violet Road, and their attention was called to a paper on the " Pollution of Swimming Baths," by Dr. J. Graham Forbes, issued by the Medical Officers of Schools Association. Dr. Forbes says that: "considered as a possible means of conveying infection, whether epidemic or not, it is a matter of surprise that comparatively little attention has been drawn to the evils and dangers lurking in our swimming baths. Although much has been done by Dr. Alexander, Medical Officer of Health for Poplar, to point out and remedy these dangers by the electrolytic process of disinfection, the subject is not one which has been seriously met by medical officers." 97 Allusion is made to a recent suggestion in reference to poliomyelitis and its possible association with public bathing, by Dr. Alexander, who points out " that during July, August and September, when swimmingbaths are most used, poliomyelitis has its greatest prevalence. He therefore suggests, as worthy of scientific investigation, that the highly polluted condition of the baths during those months, and especially the slime forming on the floor of the baths, possibly provide a factor in the causation of the disease and a medium of conveyance of the infecting virus. In support of this suggestion he quotes the reference made by Dr. Batten in his paper on ' Acute Epidemic Poliomyelitis,' to the Massachusetts epidemic, in which, out of 150 cases carefully inquired into, it was noteworthy that 62 were swimming or wading in water more or less contaminated by sewage before the attack. The point is certainly one which might well repay careful investigation." After alluding to various methods of sterilisation or filtration adopted, Dr. Forbes proceeds to state that " Dr. Alexander has introduced an entirely different method of sterilisation by the use of electrolytic disinfecting fluid, a solution containing hypochlorite of magnesia. This method has been applied for the last three years in the five public baths in the borough of Poplar. Briefly, the fluid is prepared by the electrolysis of a saturated solution of chloride of magnesium (3 tons), together with salt (4½ tons) and caustic soda, which produces over 27,000 gallons of electrolytic fluid at a cost of £53, including the amount of electricity used, or at just under £2 per 1,000 gallons. The capacity of four of the Poplar swimming-baths varies from 75,000 to 85,000 gallons ; for these an amount of electrolytic fluid of 20 to 30 gallons is added during the filling of the baths. A smaller bath holding 39,000 gallons receives 10 gallons. Subsequent additions of the fluid are made at intervals of two or three days, according to the condition of the water and number of bathers. The bath is emptied and cleansed at regular intervals of about seven to ten days. The fluid is also used for cleansing the dressing boxes and side paths of the baths. The advantages claimed for this method of disinfection are, first: The water is purified both chemically and bacteriologically by the oxidising and germicidal properties of the fluid. Secondly, the water from its purification is far pleasanter to bathe in, clear and invigorating and free from the usual unpleasant odour. The cleansing of the bottom and sides is much more easily accomplished, owing to the absence of slime commonly found at the deep end of the bath. 98 Thirdly, the cost of purification and cleansing by means of electrolytic fluid is very considerably less than the costly process of emptying cleansing and refilling with clean water at frequent intervals. At the same time the primary object has been to provide a clean bath for the bathers, rather than to effect economy in the use of water. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the value and practical use of the electrolytic method of disinfecting swimming-baths shown in the Poplar district clearly demand its general appliction to all swimmingbaths, including not only those under the control of the borough and district councils, but also those of our public schools." The cost of the Poplar electrolytic installation was quickly recovered owing to the greatly reduced expenditure on disinfectants as compared with similar expenditure in previous years. In a discussion on Dr. Forbe's paper, Dr. Shrubsall bore personal testimony to the fact that the water in the Poplar swimming baths is not rendered unpleasant by the electrolytic fluid, and that the water in the second-class baths compares favourably with that of the first-class baths in some of the Western Boroughs. Since the report of Dr. J. Graham Forbes, the Royal Sanitary Institute appointed a Committee to consider the question of " The Purification of the Water of Swimming Baths." The Committee was composed of the following well-known men :— Louis C. Parkes, M.D., D.P.H. (Chairman); Philip Boobbyer, M.D., M.S. ; Col. J. Lane Notter, M.A., M.D., R.A.M.C.; S. Rideal, D.Sc., F.I.C. ; A. Saxon Snell, F.R.I.B.A. ; H. D. Searles Wood, F.R.I.B.A. ; and W. C. Tyndale, M.Inst.C.E. The dangers of swimming-bath water are expounded in the Committee's report to the Royal Sanitary Institute. Two purification processes are reported upon, namely, the "continuous æration and filtration," and the treatment of bath water by electrolytic disinfecting fluid, which has been in use at the Poplar Borough Baths for over three years. The Committee were very much impressed with the results obtained in the Poplar Baths, and in their report compared the advantages of the two processes. An extract of the report is furnished below :— "The Committee has also investigated the treatment of bath water by electrolytic fluid, which is in use at the Poplar Baths, and was very much impressed with the good results obtained. By the addition of hypochlorite of magnesia solution to the pond 99 water in amount sufficient to give one part of free chlorine to every one or two million parts of water, not only is the water sterilised, or deprived of all organised living molecules, but it is kept sweet and. free from odour, and there is no tendency in the water to the deposition of slimy sediments on the floor of the pond. A certain amount of slimy matter collects on the walls of the pond at the line where the surface of the water is in continual movement from the undulatory motions induced by the movements of the bathers, but this is readily removed with a swab by the attendant. At Poplar, the hypochlorite of magnesia solution is prepared by the electrolysis of Water Board water, containing certain definite proportions of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride. An elaborate plant has been erected, as the electrolysis fluid is largely used in the Borough of Poplar as a disinfectant. Seawater would serve equally well for the manufacture of hypochlorite solution, as its chief constituents are the chlorides of sodium and of magnesium. It is quite unnecessary, however, to erect a plant for the manufacture of hypochlorite solutions, as these can be obtained as commercial products from the manufacturers of chlorinated disinfectants. It should be said that the electrolytic fluid in the Poplar Baths is not used with idea of rendering unnecessary periodic changes of the pond water, but to keep the water in the pond fresh and free from harmful organisms all the time it is in use. The class of persons who use the swimming ponds in Poplar is always likely to contain uncleanly or infected individuals, and it is to guard against danger from the latter that the fluid finds its chief application. At Poplar the electrolytic fluid costs in its preparation about £2 per 1,000 gallons, or a little less than ½d. per gallon. Thirty gallons are added to a swimming pond of 85,000 gallons capacity on first filling, and subsequent additions are made as required, at intervals of two or three days. The bath is emptied weekly or every ten days." Comments on Adverse Criticisms respecting the process. See annual report 1911. h 100 VICTORIA PARK BATHING LAKE. Representations to the London County Council as to A Fresh Water Shower Bath. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a resolution adopted by the Bethnal Green Local Government Officers' Association to the following effect, viz. :— "That in view of the unsatisfactory condition of the water in the men's bathing lake in Victoria Park, expecially when a large number of people use the lake at the same time, the London County Council be asked to consider the desirability of affording facilities to persons using the lake to obtain a fresh water showerbath after using the lake." In view of the condition of the bathing lake during the summer months, the Committee were of opinion the request was reasonable, and were advised the shower-baths could be provided at a moderate cost. The Committee recommended the Council that representations be made to the London County Council in support of the proposal. Respecting representation to the London County Council as to supervision of persons using Lake and representations to the London County Council as to Cleansing and Flushing, see annual report 1911.

H2 102 Arrangement with the London County Council for the Cleansing of School Children infested with Vermin. The Agreement with the London County Council for the Cleansing, at the Borough Council's cleansing station, of verminous school children, expired on the 31st July, and the London County Council suggested its renewal for a period of three years. The County Council agreed to the amendments suggested by the Borough Council, viz., that the payment of two shillings for each child cleansed should include any necessary cleansing during one month from the date of the first cleansing, and that the clause requiring treatment of the home in each case as a condition of payment be omitted. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the Seal of the Council be affixed to Agreement with the London County Council for the cleansing of verminous school children during a period of three years. CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. The Council is empowered by the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, to give any person applying, on the ground that he is infested with vermin, free use of any apparatus for cleansing his person and clothing, and may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants for this purpose. Provision was made in 1905 for cleansing verminous persons. During the year 378 persons (including 309 from Common Lodging Houses—see below) had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfested. Since the notices were posted throughout the Borough, a total of 5,066 persons had applied for baths, etc., as mentioned above.

The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee, viz. :— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 1st May, 1912. Sir, The Council has had under consideration your letters of the 16th and 18th ultimo, in which you call attention to the fact that certain inmates of a common lodging-house outside the 104 politan Borough of Poplar have applied to be cleansed of vermin, but could not produce an order authorising the Borough Council to cleanse them. With reference thereto, I have been directed to inform you that after careful consideration the Council is prepared so far as the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar is concerned, to adopt for six months, as an experiment, the under-mentioned variation of the scheme of cleansing hitherto in vogue :— The Borough Council to cleanse forthwith any applicant who claims to be an inmate of a common lodging-house and the Council will, on the receipt of a claim from the Borough Council, pay one shilling for each person cleansed who can be identified as coming from a common lodging-house situate outside the Borough; the names and addresses of the persons to be supplied to the Council immediately the cleansing has been carried out. I have to ask that the Council may be favoured with the views of the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council on this proposal. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, L. Gomme, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Committee recommended the Council that the proposals of the London County Council, as stated, be accepted. The agreement with the London County Council for the cleansing, at the Borough Council's Cleansing Station, of verminous inmates of common- lodging-houses, expired on the 22nd July, 1912, and the London County Council suggested its renewal for a period of three years. The agreement provided that the Council shall cleanse free of charge any inmate of a common lodging-house in the borough, and at a charge to the County Council of one shilling any inmate of a common lodginghouse outside the borough, sent to the Cleansing Station by the London County Council. 105 The arrangement had worked satisfactorily, and the Committee recommended the Council that the Agreement with the London County Council for cleansing verminous inmates of common lodging-houses be renewed for a period of three years. PORT SANITARY NOTICES. On 21st March a communication was received from the Medical Officer of Health, London County Council, that he had been informed by the Commandant of the Discharge Depot, Gosport, that five persons had arrived at that port, in apparently good health, by the Ex. H.T. " Dongola " from abroad, on which vessel a case of Small Pox occurred during the voyage, and that the persons mentioned were proceeding to addresses in Poplar. Four were found to be in good health, but one could not be traced at the address given. The Medical Officer of Health, London County Council, was duly informed of this by letter dated 25th March. On 4th April notices were received from the Port Medical Officer of Southampton of three persons proceeding to addresses in the borough from the s.s. H.T. " Plassy," and that a case of Small Pox had occurred on board and had been removed to Port Sanitary Hospital Ship on 2nd April. These persons were traced and reported to be in good health. On the 9th April notice was received from the Medical Officer of Health, London County Council, that a person was proceeding to an address in the borough from the H.T. " Plassy," and that a case of Small Pox had occurred during the voyage. Some difficulty was experienced in tracing this man, but he was eventually found and reported to have been unwell and to have been visited by a medical practitioner who diagnosed his complaint as Ague. On 1st July notice was received from the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London that three persons were proceeding to addresses in Poplar from the s.s. "Culna" from Bombay, and that a case of Small Pox had occurred on board the vessel on 20th June. The Sanitarv Inspector reported that the persons referred to were in good health and were going away on 3rd July. PLAGUE. No passengers from a plague stricken foreign port were reported as proceeding to the Poplar borough. 106 ANTHRAX†, GLANDERS, AND HYDROPHOBIA IN MAN.

The Public Health and Housing Committee on the 19th November, considered the question of the prevalence of Measles in the Borough, and the high mortality arising therefrom. Measles not being a compulsory notifiable infectious disease, information is generally received only in respect of cases occurring in connection with public Elementary Schools, in 32 of which, unprotected children had been recently excluded for periods of a fortnight owing to the occurrence of cases of measles. During six weeks, there had been 33 deaths from measles in the Borough and 339 premises infected with measles were reported. The Committee were of opinion the seriousness of measles is not generally recognised, and that if proper precautions were taken, the spread of the disease, and its fatal effects, might largely be prevented. The Committee considered it desirable the leaflet, which is always left (with other papers) at any house where a case of measles is discovered, should be circulated throughout the borough and recommended the Council that the leaflet on Measles above referred to, be printed and distributed from house to house throughout the borough. Order of Local Government Board—Admission of (Non-pauper and Pauper) cases into Hospitals of Metropolitan Asylums Board. One hundred and forty-two cases were removed to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board—45 Poplar, 70 Bromley, and 27 Bow. Milkshops. Three cases of measles occurred in connection with milkshops— one Poplar and two Bow. Disinfection and Outworkers. Four hundred and two rooms (383 houses) were disinfected by the Public Health Department (see page 91), and the remainder were disinfected by the tenants, medical practitioners giving certificates that disinfection had been satisfactorily carried out. Respecting outworkers and the articles disinfected by the Council see pages 82 and 91. 131 SPOTTED FEVER.

Johnson, and the sanitary conveniences were reported by him to be in order, and therefore there was no reason for the Council to raise any objection to the renewal of the licences. Mr. Johnson reported the premises were being inspected by the London County Council's Inspector at the times of his visits. CANAL BOATS. For the year ended 31st December, 1912, the inspections and reports of the Inspectors respecting registered canal boats and non-registered canal boats were as follow:— Registered. NonRegistered. *Mr. J. Johnson, West Combined Division Mr. J. Bullock, East Combined Division Mr. C. Foad, Poplar South Division Mr. H. J. Langley, Bromley North Division †Mr. R. E.

Registers and Inspections. Shops Act, 1912 (see page 196). Factory and Workshop Bill (H.L.). Factory and Workshop Bill (No. 2) (H.L.). Employment of Children Bill. Eight Hours Working Day Bill, Weekly Rest Day Bill, Daylight Saving Bill. Registers and Inspections. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 144 and 146. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,297, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 144, and Tables C and D, pages 148 and 149. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 241 and 242 and the Sanitary Inspector's reports, pages 200-240. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, 3ee page 82. * A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 148 to 151) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full 142 Factory and Workshop Bill. (H.L.) This Bill was a Bill intituled, an Act to repeal Section 157 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901. Section 157 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, provides that certain provisions of that Act shall not apply to men's workshops, i.e., workshops in which only men are employed. Amongst the provisions excluded by this section is Section 116, which provides for particulars of work and wages being given to piece workers. Section 116 applies in the first instance only to workers in textile factories, but by subs. (5) the Secretary of State is empowered by special order to extend the provisions of Section 116 (inter alia) to outworkers, and the Secretary of State has by order extended Section 116 to outworkers in various industries. It has, however, recently been held (19th January, 1912) in the case of Seal v. Alexander that the effect of Section 157, above alluded to, is to exclude from the provisions of section 116 piece-workers who receive their work from workshops in which only men are employed. It results from this decision that, while outworkers to whom work is given out from factories and other classes of workshops, and also outworkers to whom work is given out from shops, warehouses, or any other place which is not a men's workshop, receive particulars of their work and the rate of wage to be paid for the work, outworkers who get their work from men's workshops will not. and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where ivork is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops,* and even factories ; workshops may become factories ; and workplaces may become ivorkshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Table A, under " Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 9 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were " Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 143 The primary object of the present Bill is to reverse this decision as regards outworkers, and at the same time to extend the provisions of the particular section to the inworkers employed in men's workshops. The time has, however, been considered opportune for repealing Section 157 altogether. The effect of this will be to make the Act of 1901 applicable to men's workshops in like manner to other workshops. Among the provisions of the Act which would, as a consequence, become applicable to men's workshops may be specially mentioned those which require a reasonable temperature, adequate ventilation, provision of sanitary conveniences, provision of exhaust draught for removal of dangerous dust, provision of washing accommodation where poisonous substances are used, and the keeping of a general register with record of accidents and poisoning. Cases have recently been reported in which the occupiers of workshops employing men and boys, provided no proper means of warming but dismissed the boys during the cold weather. The repeal of Section 157 will not affect Parts II. and III. of the Factory Act, which relate to the hours and conditions of employment of women, young persons, and children, for although those Parts of the Act are amongst the Parts which are excluded by the operation of Section 157, they are in terms applied only to women, young persons, and children. Factory and Workshop (No. 2) Bill (H.L.). A Bill intituled an Act to amend the Factory and Workshops Acts of 1901 and 1907 in respect to Premises Underground used as Factories, Workshops, or Workplaces in which Persons of either sex are employed in certain Trades and Industries. Employment of Children Bill. The object of this Bill is to amend the Employment of Children Act, 1903, in certain particulars. The Act of 1903 empowers local authorities to regulate by bye-laws, subject to the confirmation of the Home Office, the employment in various industries of children below 14 years of age. In this Bill it is proposed by section 2 (a) to extend the age limit to 16. The Bill, however, deals mainly with the particular form of employment known as street trading, and endeavours to embody the chief recommendations contained in the reports [Cd. 5229] on the subject made in 1909 by the Departmental Committee, of which Sir John Simon, M.P., was chairman. It is proposed generally to prohibit employment in street 144 trading to girls under 18 and to boys under 17, with the exception that boys between 15 and 17, for whom better employment is not available, may be engaged in street trading if licensed by the local authorities. A Bill, upon which the present Bill is based, passed the House of Lords last session, but, owing to lack of time, failed to pass the House of Commons. Eight Hours Working Day Bill. A Bill to limit the Hours of Employment to Eight per Day. Weekly Rest-Day Bill. A Bill to secure one day's rest in seven for all workpeople ; to make the first day of May a Bank Holiday throughout the United Kingdom ; to secure a Week's Holiday for workpeople ; and to secure payment of wages for public holidays. Daylight Saving Bill. A Bill to promote the earlier use of daylight in certain months yearly ; and for other purposes relating thereto. The General Purposes Committee had under further consideration the Daylight Saving Bill, and recommended the Council that the Government be asked to afford facilities for consideration of the Day-light Saving Bill before next spring, and that private Members be asked to give the Bill their chances in the ballot for Private Member's Bills next Session.

Suggested Amendment of Clause 25. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 327 registered premises (including 13 cow-houses, 1 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 7 Bow) where milk is sold, 96 Poplar, 143 Bromley and 88 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspectors' reports pages, 200 to 240). Cleansing of premises was necessary in 19 instances. No other defects were discovered. 8 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 5 Poplar, 0 Bromley and 3 Bow. 41 Premises were on account of change of occupiers re-registered as milkshops, 10 Poplar, 15 Bromley and 16 Bow. The sale of milk was discontinued on 29 premises—12 Poplar, 9 Bromley and 8 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 82. 158 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. Part II. Sanitary Provisions. Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Register Names of Dairymen in certain circumstances. No circumstances arose during the year calling for the enforcement of the power given to the Sanitary Authority under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section (5). See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 200 to 240. Milk and Dairies Bill. A Bill to make better provision with respect to the Sale of Milk and the Regulation of Dairies was presented by Mr. Burns supported by Mr. Herbert Lewis. The main objects of this Bill are to provide for :— (1.) The more effective registration of dairies and dairymen. (2.) The inspection of dairies and the examination of cows therein. (3.) The prohibition of the supply of milk from a dairy where such a supply has caused or would be likely to cause infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. (4.) The prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk. (5.) The regulation of the importation of milk so as to prevent danger to public health arising thereform. (6.) The issue of regulations for securing the supply of pure and wholesome milk. (7.) The establishment by local authorities in populous places of milk depots for the sale of milk specially prepared for infants. 159 The provisions as to registration supersede the provisions as to the registration of dairies contained in the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts and the orders made thereunder. The provisions as to the inspection of dairies and the prohibition of the supply of milk are based on the provisions of the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897. The clause as to the prohibition of the sale of tuberculous milk is taken from the model milk clauses, which have been incorporated in many local Acts, but the scope of the enactment is somewhat extended. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries propose to issue an order under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, dealing with tuberculous cows, and providing for the payment of compensation in cases of slaughter by the local authority. The Treasury are prepared, subject to the assent of Parliament, to sanction the payment from the Exchequer of one-half of the net amount paid by way of compensation for a period of five years. Milk and Dairies Bill. Suggested Amendment of Clause 25. The Public Health and Housing Committee s attention was called by the Hammersmith Borough Council to Clause 25 of the Milk and Dairies Bill, 1912, which provides, as follows :— (1.) The provisions of this Act shall apply to London subject to such modifications as may be made by regulations of the Local Government Board, and such regulations may provide for any of the powers and duties of sanitary authorities and their medical officers of health under those provisions with respect to dairies being exercised and performed by the London County Council, and the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council. (2.) Section 53 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1907 (which confers power to require dairymen to furnish lists of sources of supply) shall apply to London as if it were herein re-enacted with the substitution of references to the London County Council and the administrative County of London for references to local authorities and the districts of local authorities and any penalties imposed by the said section as so applied shall be recoverable summarily. 160 (3.) Any provisions of the Public Health Act, 1875, applied by this Act shall, for the purposes for which they are so applied, extend to London. It was urged that it is undesirable that the application of the Act to London should be subject to modification by regulations of the Local Government Board, and especially undesirable that the Board should be enabled to transfer by regulation the duties and powers of Sanitary Authorities and their Medical Officer of Health to the London County Council. It is further desirable that the lists of sources of supply, referred to in Sub-section 2, should be forwarded to the Borough Councils as well as to the London County Council. The Committee recommended the Council that representations be made to H.M. Government urging amendment of the Bill by elimination of the words empowering the Local Government Board to transfer powers and duties of Sanitary Authorities to the London County Council, and by inclusion of Sanitary Authorities in Sub-Section 2 ; and that the local Members of Parliament be asked to support such representations. SMOKE NUISANCES. 54 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year :—21 Bow East, 6 Bow West, 5 North Bromley, 8 Bromley Central, 4 East combined, 6 West combined, and 4 Poplar South. 29 intimations and 12 statutory notices were served. No summonses were applied for. ICE CREAM. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, Sec. 43. About the middle of the year 1912 all the known premises within the Borough where ice-creams are manufactured were inspected. There are 124 such premises within the Borough, 55 Poplar, 42 Bromley and 27 Bow. (See Table A, page 144.) Cleansing of premises was necessary in 24 instances. 9 other nuisances were remedied. See Inspectors' reports, pages 200 to 240. 161 MOTOR VEHICLES. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards. Amending Order of Local Goverment Board re Noise of Exhaust Gases from any Motor Engine. The Works Committee and Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils re use of Mechanically Propelled Vehicles on unsafe or unsuitable Roads; Works Committee and Caution Notices to Motor Drivers near Schools. Motor Traffic (Street Noises) Bill. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards. From time to time the General Purposes Committee have considered the matter of the provision of proper splash guards on motor omnibuses (see Annual lieport, 1910, and 1912), and following up the subject during the year 1912, the General Purposes Committee reported to the Council:— The following letter was received and considered by the General Purposes Committee in reply to the resolution of the Council again urging that the provision of efficient splash-guards for motor omnibuses should be enforced by the Commissioner of Police, viz. :— New Scotland Yard, 23rd January, 1912. Re Splash Guards for Motor Omnibuses. Sir, With reference to your letter of the 19th instant, forwarding particulars of splash-guards which have been submitted to the Council, I am directed by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to acquaint you that, as previously intimated, he is prepared to allow a proprietor, if he so desires, to fit any form of splash guard which can be used without danger or inconvenience to the public, but he sees no reason to depart from the intention he has already expressed. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, C. W. HALLWARD, Acting Chief Clerk. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. 162 The General Purposes Committee reported to the Council that in addition to the resolutions already reported upon by the Works Committee, the recent Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils on the subject of Motor Omnibus Traffic in London adopted the following resolutions, viz.:— "That the Local Government Board be asked to take the necessary steps to allow of a much reduced speed limit being fixed for mechanically propelled vehicles in crowded and narrow streets, and be asked to arrange for the Commission of Police in consultation with the several Metropolitan Borough Councils, to draw up a list of the streets to which such lower speed should apply." ''That this Conference is strongly of opinion that the time has come when the Chief Commissioner of Police, or the Home Office Authorities, should prescribe remedial measures of a compulsory nature to compel the proprietors of Motor Omnibuses to provide efficient mudguards for the protection of ratepayers' properties on the various fines of route in the Metropolis, as the present damage to property has reached-such a serious point that in many instances it is resulting in property becoming for all practical purposes uninhabitable, and thus causing further charges on the local authorities by reason of increased losses in rates on empty premises." The General Purposes Committee recommended the Council that the resolutions referred to be approved, and communications urging that effect be given thereto be addressed to the Home Secretary, the President of the Local Government Board, the Chief Commissioner of Police, the London County Council, and the Members representing the Borough in Parliament. Amending Order of Local Government Board re Noise of Exhaust Gases from any Motor Engine. The Local Government Board made an Order amending Article IV. of the Motor Cars (Use and Construction) Order, 1904, as amended by the Motor Cars (Use and Construction) Amendment Order, 1909. The effect of the Order, which came into operation on the 31st March is to prohibit the use of any cut-out or other device which will allow the exhaust gases from any motor engine to escape into the atmosphere without passing through a silencer or other contrivance for reducing the noise which would otherwise be caused by the escape of such gases. 163 The Works Committee and Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils re use of Mechanically-Propelled Vehicles on Unsafe or Unsuitable Roads. At the Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils held on the 6th February, at which the Council was represented, the following resolutions were adopted, viz.:— "That the proprietors of mechanically-propelled vehicles using the main and other roads in the County of London should, by means of the Petrol Tax and other duties levied on each vehicle be brought under contribution for the repair and upkeep of the roads over which they travel in Metropolitan Boroughs. "That the Borough Councils should have a veto on the use of mechanically-propelled vehicles on roads which, in their opinion, were unsafe or otherwise unsuitable for such traffic." The Works Committee recommended the Council that the resolutions of the Conference be approved and supported. Works Committee and Caution Notices to Motor Drivers near Schools. The Works Committee considered suggestions made at a meeting of the Council that Caution Notices to Motor Drivers should be placed near Schools adjacent to roads used by motor traffic, and directed communications be addressed to the Motor Union, the Education Authority, and the Police on the subject. Motor Traffic (Street Noises) Bill. The object of this Bill is to give powers to make regulations defining the nature of the warning instruments which may be used on motor vehicles, and making obligatory during certain hours and in particular areas the use of certain descriptions of instrument. The regulations will be made under Section 6 of the Locomotives on Highways Act, 1896, under which there is power to confinc the application of any regulations to a particular area. l 164 FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.

An application was made for registration of premises in Hawgood Street, Bromley (being an extension of premises already registered), as a butter factory. The premises were entered on the register, of which fact the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries was informed, and the necessary certificate was furnished to the applicants. The Sale of Milk Regulations, 1912. Dated June 29, 1912. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, in exercise of the powers conferred on them by section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, made the following Regulations Where a sample of skimmed or separated milk (not being condensed milk) contains less than 8.7 per cent, of milk solids other than milk-fat, it shall be presumed for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine by reason of either the addition thereto of water, or the abstraction therefrom of milk-solids other than milk-fat. The Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912. The Local Government Board made an order under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, to secure that no preservative shall be added to milk (or to cream containing less than 35 per cent, by weight of milk fat) at any stage from the place of production to that of delivery to the purchaser. The Regulations are designed to secure that no preservative shall be added to milk, or to cream containing less than 35 per cent, by weight of milk fat, at any stage from the place of production to that of delivery to the purchaser. In the case of cream containing over 35 per cent, of milk fat, the addition of boric acid, borax or a mixture of these preservative substances, or of hydrogen peroxide, is not prohibited by the Regulations, but is subject to a system of declaration which is required to be followed by all persons dealing with such cream for the purpose of sale for human consumption. By this system (Part II. of the Regulations) it is intended that preserved cream as an article of commerce shall in all stages be differentiated from cream, to which no preservative has been added. Further, Article IV. (a) prohibits the addition of any thickening substance to cream or preserved cream. 170 In the case of any contravention of the Regulations steps should be taken to ascertain the circumstances in which the default has arisen with a view to any necessary action. Article VI. requires that before the local authority institute proceedings against any person for contravention of any of the Regulations in Part II. of the Order, the local authority shall afford him an opportunity of furnishing an explanation and shall consider such explanation and all the circumstances of the case. The Regulations as regards their main provisions took effect on and after October 1st next, as regards Article V. (1) on January 1st, 1913. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered an analysis of sample of potted preserved cream purchased in the Roman Road, and which contained 0.11 per cent, of boric acid. The pot was not labelled as containing boric acid as required by the Local Government Board Regulations of August 1st, 1912, made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907. In accordance with the Regulations an explanation was required from the vendor, and supplied. The Committee considered this, and in view of the offence being the first discovered in this Borough under the new Regulations, did not propose that legal proceedings should be taken in this case but directed that the vendor be cautioned. • Inadequate Penalties and the Home Secretary. The Council, in conjunction with other local authorities, recently made representations to the Local Government Board on the subject of the inadequate penalties inflicted in cases of offences under the sale of Food and Drugs Acts. In consequence of such representations the Home Secretary issued a circular to the justices through out the country calling attention to the matter and asking that special consideration should be given to the question whether the penalties imposed in cases coming before them are such as are likely to deter the offenders from repeating and other persons from committing offences under the Acts. Order in Council applying Section 5 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908 (8 Edw. 7, c. 55), to certain Liquid Preparations containing not more than 3 per cent, of Phenols. Whereas by Section 5 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908, it is enacted that— 171 "(1.) It shall not be lawful to sell any substance to which this section applies by retail, unless the box, bottle, vessel, wrapper, or cover in which the substance is contained is distinctly labelled with the name of the substance and the word ' Poisonous,' and with the name and address of the seller of the substance, and unless such other regulations as may be prescribed under this section by Order in Council are complied with ; and, if any person sells any such substance otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this section or of any Order in Council made thereunder, he shall, on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction Acts, be liable for each offence to a fine not exceeding five pounds. "(2.) The substances to which this section applies are sulphuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, soluble salts of oxalic acid, and such other substances as may for the time being be prescribed by Order in Council under this section." And whereas it is expedient that all liquid preparations sold as Carbolic, or Carbolic Acid, or Carbolic Substitutes, or Carbolic Disinfectant containing not more than 3 per cent, of phenols, should be prescribed as substances to which the said section applies. From the 1st day of May, 1913, all liquid preparations sold as Carbolic, or Carbolic Acid, or Carbolic Substitutes, or Carbolic Disinfectant containing not more than 3 per cent, of phenols, shall be substances to which Section 5 of the said recited enactment applies. RAG FLOCK ACT. Seven samples of Rag Flock were procured during the year and found to conform to the Regulations (see page 195). INSPECTION OF FOOD AND EXAMINATION OF UNSOUND FOOD AT WHARVES, Etc. Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc. ; Seizure of Tuberculous Meat and Removal of the Signs of the Disease ; Seizure of Unsound Tomatoes, and representations to the Local Government Board to secure adequate protection of the Public against the Sale of Unsound Food by Wholesale Vendors. Suggested appointment of Meat Inspector. Examination of Food Stuffs at Wharves, etc. With respect to the examination of food stuffs see Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 200 to 240. 172 Seizure or Unsound Tuberculous Meat and the Removal of the Signs of Evidence. The Stepney Borough Council called attention to tuberculous meat seized in that Borough, in which the signs of the disease had been purposely removed with the exception of slight indications capable of being easily overlooked. The Stepney Public Health Committee desired to institute proceedings against the wholesale dealer from whom the meat had been purchased, but were advised such proceedings were not likely to be successful as the sale by the wholesale dealer was completed outside the County of London, and the Public Health Acts in force outside the Metropolis do not contain any provision similar to Section 47 (3) of the Public Health (London) Act under which proceedings could have been taken had the sale been completed in the County of London. The Stepney Borough Council approached the Local Government Board urging legislation to amend the Acts operative outside London, so as to include therein provisions analogous to those of Section 47 (3) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the action of the Stepney Borough Council in this matter be supported . Seizure of Unsound Tomatoes and Representations to the Local Government Board to secure adequate protection of the Public against the Sale of Unsound Food by Wholesale Vendors. On the 18th May, 1911, 80 boxes of tomatoes were purchased from a firm at Covent Garden, by a local dealer ; two cases were opened in the presence of the purchaser and found to contain sound tomatoes, but on the remaining boxes being taken home and examined they were found to be wholly filled with utterly worthless and rotten tomatoes unfit for human food. The purchaser took them back to the wholesale vendors, who however, refused to accept return of more than 13 boxes, or refund the cost. The remaining 67 boxes of tomatoes were then brought to the Council Officers, who seized and took them before a Police Magistrate who condemned them. A prosecution by the Council of the wholesale vendors and their salesman followed, under Section 47 (3) of the Public Health (London) Act, which enacts that: "Where it is shown that any article liable to be seized under this section and found in the possession of any person was purchased by him from another person for the food of man, and when so 173 purchased was in such a condition as to he liable to be seized and condemned under this section, the person who sold the same shall be liable to the fine and imprisonment mentioned, unless he proves that at the time he sold the articles he did not know, and had.no reason to believe, that it was in such condition." The question of liability of a limited company under the section, in view of the alternative penalty of imprisonment, was raised, but defendant's counsel was told that unless he elected a trial by jury the case would be proceeded with. He elected trial by jury (under protest). A true bill was found by the Grand Jury at the Central Criminal Court, but on the question of liability of a limited company being again raised the case was removed under a writ of certiorari to the High Court. The case was ultimately heard in the High Court before Mr. Justice Rowlatt and a Common Jury. It was contended on behalf of the defendants that a Corporation was not indictable under the section. The Interpretation Act, 1889, enacts that " person includes a Corporation unless the contrary appears," and such contrary intention was urged inasmuch as the penalty provided for imprisonment. The Judge, however, over-ruled this contention on the ground that imprisonment in this case was only an alternative to a fine. It was then contented that the goods had never in fact been " seized " nor "found in possession" within the meaning of the Section, having been voluntarily taken by the purchaser to the Sanitary Inspector ; that they were not " liable to be seized " because at the time the Inspector took possession of them they were not intended by the local dealer for the food of man, nor had they been sold, exposed or deposited for sale or preparation for sale by the purchaser. The defendants also relied upon a notice alleged to have been put up in a conspicuous position at the warehouse to the effect that goods were sold subject to the condition that the buyers sort the contents and destroy the unsound portion before offering to the public, and that no allowance would be made for the destroyed portion. It was contended on behalf of the prosecution that such notice was not seen by the purchaser or the Council's Inspector. On cases cited the Judge expressed the view that he was bound by the decision of the Divisional Court interpreting a decision of the High Court, although from his decision an Appeal might go to a Court not bound by that interpretation. 174 In the result Mr. Justice Rowlatt decided there was no case to go to the jury, and instructed them to acquit the defendants. He said it was due to the prosecution that he should say why he thought they failed, especially as on the previous night he had, on a first view of the Authorities expressed the view that he could not stop the case. It was a difficult Statute to construe. The Section pointed to there being an article which was, physically speaking, liable to be seized, that was to say an article which was still at large, and had not been put out of commerce by condemnation or devotion to destruction in any way. In this case the article had been surrendered, and a consent order, practically, made for its condemnation. On application, on behalf of the defendants, for costs against the prosecutor or the County, the Judge refused to make an order. He said ; " My decision may be wrong. I cannot help feeling that your clients (the defendants) have been rather fortunate in getting a decision in their favour from which there is no appeal. If the prosecution could have appealed, I think they would have had a very fair chance." The case being a criminal one there was no appeal against an acquittal, but the defendants could have appealed against a conviction. While the original contention that criminal proceedings could not be effective against a limited company, where the penalty is imprisonment as an alternative to a fine, has been over-ruled, the decision in the case will prevent effective action being taken against wholesale vendors, except where goods have been seized by the Local Authorities on the premises or in the actual possession of the retailer, he having given no notice to the Authority that he had any unsound goods. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is important that the right of action against wholesale vendors of unsound food, which has been hitherto successfully acted upon, should be reestablished, and there being no right of appeal in this case, that efforts should be made to strengthen the law, to ensure conviction of " wholesale " offenders. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that representations be made to the President of the Local Government Board on this subject, urging such amendment of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, as may be necessary to secure adequate protection of the public against the sale of unsound food by wholesale vendors, and that the other Metropolitan Borough Councils be asked to support such representations. 175 Suggested Appointment of Meat Inspector. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the reference to them to advise the Council as to the desirability of the appointment of a Meat Inspector for the Borough. At present, inspections of meat in the market streets are made on Saturday nights and Sunday mornings by the staff of Sanitary Inspectors, and the seizure of meat unfit for human consumption exposed for sale in the Borough is included in their duties. It appeared to the Committee that the transference of this duty from the eight present Inspectors, acting within their respective districts, to one man specially appointed for the purpose and acting for the whole borough, would not secure more effective prevention of the sale of bad meat than at present. The Committee recommended the Council that the reference of the matter to them be discharged. FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE. Letter from the Local Government Board. A letter was received in July from the Local Government Board stating that they had been in communication with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries with regard to recent outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease in this country. The disease had in some cases been discovered among cattle slaughtered at abattoirs, and in certain parts of carcases exposed for sale. In view of the serious nature of the disease and its liability to spread, the Local Government Board considered it very desirable that specially strict supervision should be exercised by local authorities and their officers over the meat supply with a view to the detection of meat or offal showing signs of the disease. The parts which required specially careful examination were the heads, tongues and feet, and the letter stated that whenever lesions or signs suspicious of Foot and Mouth Disease are discovered the officer should communicate at once with the Inspector appointed under the Diseases of Animals Acts, and retain for inspection the suspected parts in order that any further action which may be considered necessary to trace the disease to its source may be taken. 176 ' HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY.

The dwelling-houses, Nos. -28, Rook Street, 147 and 149, Stebondale Street were represented to be in such a state as to be dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. The Council made Closing Orders on the 21st November prohibiting the use of such dwelling-houses for human habitation until in the judgment of the Council they were rendered fit for that purpose. Closing Orders were made on the 6th June, 1912, in respect of 61, 63 and 67, Bath Street.* Closing Orders were made on the 19th December, 1912, in respect of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, Victoria Cottages.

These premises having been rendered fit for human habitation, the Closing Order was determined by the Council. Closing Orders were made on 26th October and 7th December, 1911, in respect of 13, 15 and 17, Davey Road. These premises having been rendered fit for human habitation, the Closing Orders were determined by the Council. Regulations† as to Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places.

The Board asked for observations of the Borough Council on the application, and the matter being urgent, the Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion a housing scheme was unnecessary in the cases in question, and so informed the Local Government Board. Housing or the Working Classes Bill. This Bill amends and adds to the powers of the Local Government Board and those of local authorities under the Housing Acts. These Acts are already very complicated, and, until a consolidating enactment is passed, an amending Bill, drafted as it must be with reference to the existing Acts, cannot avoid adding to the complication. The Bill adopts the principle of the existing Acts, especially those of the principal Act of 1890, and, apart from some minor alterations, aims only at the better enforcement of those principles, in the view that, subject to minor alterations, existing legislation would be sufficient, if it were properly enforced. The main alterations proposed with a view to enforcing the Acts are— (a) A special department of the Local Government Board is to be formed which will be employed exclusively in the supervision of the operations of local authorities under the Housing Acts. This department will co-ordinate the work of the various officers of the Board already employed in the work. It will assist local authorities by advice and information, and will annually make a special report to Parliament on housing matters. Where a local authority is culpably neglecting its housing duties, the Local Government Board will be empowered, after application to the court, to deal with slums and to provide housing accommodation itself in place and at the cost of the local authority. (b) In some areas the failure to deal with the slum evil and to carry out housing schemes under Part III. of the principal Act arises not from any unwillingness on the part of the local authority, but from financial difficulties. It is therefore proposed by the Bill to provide a Parliamentary grant in aid of housing operations upon the analogy of the funds administered by the Road Board in aid of road improvement. M 180 Various other alterations of the existing Acts are proposed by the Bill with a view to lessening the cost of, and of facilitating in other ways the exercise by, local authorities of their housing functions. In particular, an amendment is proposed of the compensation sections of the Act of 1890 which aims at carrying the principles of these sections—at present often nugatory—into effect. Moveable Dwellings (H.L.). A Bill intituled an Act to provide for the Regulation of Moveable Dwellings. Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act (1909) Amendment Bill. A Bill to amend the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. Cheap Trains Bill. The purpose of this Bill is to remove some of the difficulties experienced in London and other large towns in housing the working classes, by making provision for an ample service of trains for workmen, so as to provide a cheaper means of communication between the central stations and the outer suburbs. " The Cheap Trains Act of 1883, 46 & 47 Vict. c. 34, by means of which a bargain was struck between the nation and the railway companies, requires all companies to provide proper and sufficient workmen's trains for workmen going to and returning from their work, at such fares and such times between six p.m. and eight a.m. as may appear to the Board of Trade to be reasonable." There has been no general legislation on this subject since 1883, when the Cheap Trains Act was passed, whereby the passenger duty was lemitted on all fares not exceeding the rate of one penny a mile, and a reduction from five to two per cent, of the duty on first and second class fares in certified urban districts, on condition that all railway companies should provide sufficient workmen's trains for workmen going to and returning from their work, at such fares and such times between six p.m. and eight a.m as may appear to the Board of Trade to be reasonable. The object of this Bill is to provide for a sufficient service of cheap trains, and to fix for passengers by all workmen's trains arriving at the various stations up to eight a.m. a maximum return fare between any central station and the outer suburbs up to 20 miles. The Royal Commission on the Housing of the Working Classes strongly urged the need for cheap workmen's trains to run up to eight o'clock in the morning. 181 By reference to the Board of Trade Return to Parliament 25th May, 1909, it will be seen that with a few exceptions there are no workmen's trains running up to eight o'clock in the morning—the time laid down by the Act of 1883. It is also shown by the same return that the fares charged by some of the companies are much higher than those proposed by this Bill. Housing of the Working Classes (No. 2) Bill. The object of this Bill is to enlarge the powers and stimulate the activities of voluntary associations and also of municipal authorities with a view to securing a better supply of housing and, to some extent, of shop accommodation for the working classes; and especially to enable State credit to be used with a view to enabling occupiers to become owners. The Bill proposes to do this in three ways :— (1) Section 67 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as amended by section 4 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, allows the Public Works Loan Commissioners to lend up to two-thirds of the amount required by voluntary associations who are undertaking the work of providing dwelling-houses for the working classes ; but there is no provision in these sections (which extend only to " dwellings for the working classes") to cover the case of small shops. In many poor class neighbourhoods it is desirable that power should be available for constructing a house and shop together. (2) Many members of the working classes, especially in the north of England, desire to acquire the ownership of their own houses. In Oldham, according to the Local Government Board Report of May, 1909, out of 33,000 inhabited houses, over 10,000, or about a third, are owned, or in course of being purchased by artisan proprietors. The Bill proposes to assist voluntary associations, whether friendly societies, building societies, co-operative societies, insurance societies, or similar bodies who are promoting this work of house purchase. The societies at present generally advance up to three-quarters or four-fifths of the purchase price of a house to their mem here, and then receive repayment of principal and interest over a period of years, the advance being secured, till paid off, by a mortgage on the house. m2 182 It is the experience of these societies that with money borrowed at, say, five per cent, (which is the usual rate), an occupier can by repayments spread over a period of fifteen to twenty years acquire the ownership of his house. These repayments generally do not exceed in amount, and in many cases are actually less than, the amount previously paid in rent. The Bill proposes to allow Government money to be advanced at a low rate of interest, say, three and a half per cent., to authorised societies up to two-thirds of the amount required ; with two-thirds of the capital required thus provided at a low rate of interest better terms could be offered by the societies to the purchasing tenant than at present. The society would be an intermediary between the purchasing owner and the State. Its active interest would be engaged by requiring that one-third of the capital necessary should be found by the society ; and, in addition, it would have to be authorised by the Local Government Board. Regulations would also be made requiring societies who obtained a loan to make proper provision for safeguarding the interest of purchasing owners, who would be in the position of mortgagors, while, at the same time, preventing the machinery of the Bill from being exploited by speculative builders. (3) The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act of 1899 was passed with a view of encouraging local authorities to assist artisans to purchase their own houses. Very little use has, however, been made of its provisions. The Bill, therefore, proposes, to relax some of these provisions with a view to encouraging local authorities to set the Act in operation. \ WATER. Water Certificates. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—Tredegar House, Bow Road ; 30, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52 and 54, Ridgdale Street; 183, Bow Road. 183 COMBINED DRAINAGE. Work Executed by Council. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. Sewers and Drains Bill. Work Executed by Council. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order:—16 to 36, Kerbey Street and 76, Grundy Street ; 209 to 219, St. Leonards Street; 70 to 78, St. Leonards Road ; 14 and 15, Ivy Cottages ; 72 to 75, Cadogan Terrace ; 34 to 36, Burcham Street and 69, Ida Street; 1, Cuba Street ; 185 and 187, Bow Road ; 27 to 33, Burdett Street; 173-5, Bow Road ; 162-6, Bow Road ; and 1 to 4, Iceland Road. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill.* The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee considered a proposal of Camberwell Borough Council that a Bill be promoted at the joint cost of the Borough Councils, by re-introduction of the Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill of 1908 as a private Bill. The Bill would provide that all means of drainage, other than a sewer approved by the proper Authority as a sewer, shall be a drain maintainable by the owners. The General Purposes Committee recommended the Council to agree to join in the promotion of the proposed Bill, and to contribute to the cost, provided a reasonable number of Metropolitan Boroughs also join therein. Public Health (Sewers and Drains) Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to amend the Public Health Acts with respect to sewers and drains, but this Bill does not relate to the Metropolis. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The Public Health and Housing Committee directed the attention of the Works Committee to the condition of the sewer from East India Dock Road to High Street, and serving Speedings Gardens, James Place, Reynolds Place, etc., owing to prevalence of rats. The Works Committee reported to the Council that the sewer was in a bad state of repair and very shallow, the crown in places being a few inches only below * This Bill was set out in extenso Annual Report, 1910, pages 210 and 217. 184 the surface. The levels precluded a cleansing flow, and the northern portion had a fall the reverse way to the outlet. The sewer was one of those taken over in 1855 from the Commissioners of Sewers, and the portion north of East India Dock Road was re-constructed in 1904. The Borough Surveyor submitted a plan for re-construction of the sewer in 12 in. pipes for 560 feet, and 6 in. pipes for the remaining 130 feet, at an estimated cost, including provision of 9 manholes and connection to London County Council Sewer, of £576. The Works Committee were of opinion re-construction was urgently necessary, and recommended the Council that the sewer between East India Dock Road and High Street, Poplar, serving Speedings Gardens, James Place, Reynolds Place, etc., be reconstructed by the Borough Surveyor. The Borough Surveyor reported to the Works Committee on the condition of Wade Street sewer. The sewer was an old brick barrel connected to the Black Ditch on the south side of High Street. The Surveyor stated it had an insufficient fall, and had been patched where it had collapsed in various places. It was desirable the sewer should be reconstructed before the lithofalt block paving of the street, approved by the Council, was proceeded with. The Works Committee recommended the Council that the Wade Street sewer be reconstructed in 12 in. stoneware pipes, in accordance with plan of the Borough Surveyor. Before proceeding with the paving of Guildford Road with lithofalt block paving the Borough Surveyor opened the sewer for examination. It was a 2 ft. by 2 ft. brick barrel in defective condition, with improper fall, and had been a source of trouble to the adjoining property, consequently it was proposed to re-construct the sewer in 9 in. pipes with two manholes. The Works Committee recommended the Council that Guildford Road sewer be reconstructed by the Borough Surveyor, as proposed. CONSTRUCTION OF WATER CLOSETS-PROPOSED NEW BYE-LAWS. The London County Council considered proposals that the builder and not the owner should be made liable to the penalties provided in the Byelaws made under the Public Health (London) Act, relating to the construction of water closets, etc., in the same way as the builder has been made responsible under the drainage Bye-laws and the Bye-laws as to 185 deposit of plans. The following proposed draft Bye-laws were submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee in accordance with the provisions of the Act for the observations of the Borough Council, viz. :— [Draft Bye-law.] " BYE-LAW made by the LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL in pursuance of the provisions of Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. " Notwithstanding anything contained in the Bye-laws made by the London County Council in pursuance of the provisions above-mentioned, in the case of the construction of any watercloset, earth-closet, privy, ashpit, cesspool, or receptacle for dung and the proper accessories thereof, the builder shall observe all the requirements contained in the said Bye-laws. Provided that this Bye-law shall not remove or interfere with any of the obligations which have been specifically imposed by the said Bye-laws upon the owner or occupier of any premises. " In this Bye-law ' builder ' means the builder, contractor or person actually carrying out the work, but does not include a workman in the employ of such builder, contractor or person." The Committee were of opinion it is desirable the proposed Bye-law should be adopted, and recommended the Council that the Bye-law as proposed be approved. In accordance with the provisions of Section 114 of the Public Health (London) Act, the London County Council submitted the following draft Bye-law for the observation of the Council, viz. :— Notwithstanding anything contained in the bye-laws made by the London County Council in pursuance of the provisions of Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the case of the construction of any water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ash-pit, cesspool, or receptacle for dung and the proper accessories thereof, the builder shall observe all the requirements contained in the said Bye-laws, and he shall be liable to the penalties provided for a breach of the said Bye-laws. Provided that this Bye-law shall not remove or interfere with any of the obligations which have been specifically imposed by the said Bye-laws upon the owner or occupier of any premises. 186 In this Bye-law "builder" means the builder, contractor, or person actually carrying out the work, but does not include a workman in the employ of such builder, contractor or person. The draft Bye-law was in accordance with requests made by the Poplar and other Borough Councils, and with the addition of the words "and he shall be liable to the penalties provided for a breach of the said Bye-laws" it is in the terms approved by the Council on the 25th April last. The Local Government Board intimated that it would not raise any objection to the principle of the proposed Bye-law. The builder has already been made responsible under the drainage Bye-laws and the Bye-laws requiring deposit of plans. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the Bye-law as proposed be approved. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1. Cap 8, Sect 26 (2).

Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the "Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are in such a state as to be a nuisance to health, and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons see pages 102-104. 187 When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. Forty-nine certificates had to be given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 264 rooms have been cleansed of vermin:— Poplar South Division 14 West Combined Division 19 East Combined Division 33 Bromley Central Division 25 Bromley North Division 20 Bow West Division 34 Bow East Division 16 Houses Let in Lodgings 103 No summonses were applied for. Licensed Premises Urinals. One notice was served under Section 22 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, calling upon the owner to provide a proper door to the urinal attached to his licensed premises.

Pans and Traps without Notice In Five cases where w.c. pans and traps were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders were written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings, which had been authorised by the Committee, would be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work is found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. 189 Poplar West East Bromley Bromley Bow Bote South. combined. combined.

Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting three cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 41 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 44 of overcrowding abated; no cases of overcrowding were found in workshops (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 241); 94 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, page 243). In two instances legal proceedings were instituted. General. 8,106 communications were received, and 984 complaints (including 54 smoke) as to nuisances were made. Increased Sanitary Accommodation at Public Health Offices. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the question of provision of sanitary accommodation for the three Lady Inspectors, for whom no such convenience existed at the Public Health Offices. The Borough Surveyor submitted a plan for affording the necessary accommodation, adjoining the Lady Inspectors' Office. The Agreement with Viscount Tredegar sanctioning the construction of lavatory accommodation for the Lady Inspectors at the Public Health Offices was submitted to the committee. The Council may, on demand, be required to re-instate the premises to their original state. Removal of House Refuse—Difficulties, etc. The Finsbury Borough Council addressed the following letter to the London County Council, viz.:— Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. The Town Hall, Rosebery Avenue, E.C. 23rd January, 1912. Removal of House Refuse. Sir, The Council have recently had under consideration the difficulties, inconvenience and delay frequently experienced in securing the removal of house refuse, particularly in the case of let-out premises—and more especially those of the warehouse type— 191 by the necessity for the scavengers to ascend high buildings in order to obtain each separate lot of refuse from the various rooms or floors, inasmuch as there is rarely provided, in connection with let-out warehouse buildings, a receptacle for common use Often too, the wareroom, workroom, etc., is inaccessible at the time of the ordinary collection owing to the absence of the occupier, and as a consequence either a renewed visit has to be made or the refuse left to accumulate until the next periodical collection. The County Council are of course aware that in the case of premises from which the refuse is removed daily, the Bye-Laws made by them under Section 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, require that the refuse shall be deposited by the occupiers on the footway or other conveniently accessible position The experience gained in connection with the daily collection so far carried out in the Borough leads the Borough Council to the opinion that the weekly collection could much more expeditiously be carried out—an important matter where streets are narrow and the traffic heavy—if in districts selected by the Borough Council, after written notice to the persons concerned, the occupiers were required to deposit the refuse for collecting purposes in such conveniently accessible position as the Borough Council might prescribe as is the case where a daily collection is in operation—and the Borough Council directs me respectfully to suggest that the requisite amendment of the Bye-Law in question be made. There is also experienced by the Borough Council some difficulty in securing the use of proper receptacles for placing the refuse on the kerb or other position required The Borough Council would accordingly point to the fact that whilst Clause 18 of the Bye-Laws made by the County Council under Section 39 (1) of the Act before mentioned, requires the provision of a receptacle fulfilling certain requirements, by Clause 6 of the Bye-Laws made under Section 16 (2) of the same Act, the use of a "movable receptacle" only is required The effect is that the refuse is placed on the footway in uncovered wooden boxes and other quite unsuitable receptacles, with the result that frequently their contents are scattered by the wind, to the public annoyance and danger to the public health The Borough Council venture to suggest the necessity of a further alteration of the Bye-Laws in this respect. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) G. W. PRESTON, The Clerk, Town Clerk. London County Council, Spring Gardens, S.W. 192 The Finsbury Borough Council asked for support to the representations made to the London County Council for amendment of the ByeLaws as proposed. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the action of the Finsbury Borough Council in the matter should be supported, and recommended the Council that representations be made to the London County Council to the effect stated. Suggested Revision of Bye-Laws Relating to Removal of House Refuse. The Bye-laws of the London County Council, made under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to removal of house refuse, which have not been revised for nearly 20 years, provide for weekly collection of house refuse The London Council considered the Bye-laws should approximate more nearly to present requirements, and the Committee concerned proposed in the first instance to recommend to the Council an amendment to provide that house refuse shall be collected more frequently than once a week. They desired to obtain the views of the Borough Councils on the subject. In Poplar house refuse is collected twice a week. The Works Committee recommended the Council that the London County Council be advised to amend the Bye-laws to provide for collection of house refuse twice a week. Cul de sac—Douglas Street. In June, 1911, the Council approved the making up of Douglas Street, a cul de sac at Cubitt Town, under similar circumstances to those relating to the cul de sac in Alpha Road. The work had, however, been deferred pending the coming into operation of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1911. The Borough Surveyor submitted an estimate for the necessary work to be apportioned on the respective owners, and the Works Committee recommended the Council to approve the Borough Surveyor's apportionment on owners for repair of Douglas Street. Cul de sac—Alpha Road. The Works Committee's attention was called by the Public Health and Housing Committee to the condition of a cul de sac between Nos. 33 and 35, Alpha Road, Millwall, and which, owing to the freeholders not being the "owners" within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, could not be dealt with under that Act. 193 It was proposed the cul de sac in question be made up at the cost of the owners under the provisions of Sec. 3 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1890, and Sec. 14 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1911, but that the street should not be taken over by the Council. The Borough Surveyor submitted estimate for the necessary work, apportioned on the respective owners and the Works Committee recommended the Council that the cul de sac between Nos. 33 and 35, Alpha Road be repaired as proposed, the street thereafter remaining repairable by the owners, and the apportionment of the Borough Surveyor be approved. Paving of Footways Forming Forecourts. The paving at back of footway and forming the forecourts of Nos. 186 to 196, Devons Road and Nos. 1 to 9, Guildford Road was reported to be in bad condition. The Works Committee recommended the Council that, subject to dedication of the forecourts to the public the necessary repairs be carried out by the Council. New Footway—West Ferry Road. In accordance with the arrangement made with the Council, the owners completed the construction, sewering and paving of a new 20 feet footway from West Ferry Road, to the river with new river steps. The new thoroughfare and steps replace the tortuous footpath on the marsh wall and dilapidated river steps now closed. Condition of Railway Carriages. The Public Health and Housing Committee communicated with the Railway Companies concerned with respect to complaints as to the dirty condition of the carriages on the Broad Street to Poplar service and the trains on the Blackwall line. The Traffic Superintendent of the North London Railway informed the Committee he had in hand the questtion of cleaning the carriages at more frequent intervals. The Great Eastern Railway Company had made arrangements to withdraw the existing stock on the Blackwall line and replace it with stock of a better character. Meanwhile daily attention is given to the matter of cleaning. 194 Police Court Proceedings. No. of Street or Name of Premises or Locality, &c. Nature of Complaint Date of Attendance at Police Court.

I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FredR.hm.Alegander. Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. March, 1913. 200 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division Public Health Department, December 31st, 1912. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my twenty-third Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ended 31st December, 1912, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 1,178 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 417 Do on house-to-house visitation 29 Do Canal Boats 38 Re-inspections 1,336 Making a total of 2,998 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,624 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 27.15 per cent. of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 441 written intimations, 292 statutory, and 27 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precede the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in no case was it found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings to ensure enforcement. Housing, Town Planning, etc, Act, 1909. 15 cases "Representations" were made, followed by "Closing Orders ":— Victoria Cottages, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18. 201 Rag Flock Act, 1911.

By your direction I have submitted 61 varied samples of food to the Public Analyst for Analyses, of which 1 butter was certified to have been adulterated with 45.7 per cent. of foreign fat. The Vendor was fined 20s. and 12s .6d. costs. Places where Food is Prepared. The 31 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food-stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. * Underground 9. 204 Unsound Food. The market places have been regularly inspected. In no instances was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. Factory and Workshop Acts. The workshops, workplaces and outworkers' premises on the Register have been visited, and the terms of the Acts relating to them have been required by notice, where necessary, to be complied with. No summonses were necessary, as the works were immediately executed on the service of intimation or notice. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM BOYCE, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Bow West Division. 205 Report of Inspector, Bow East Division. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. December 31st, 1912. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to report that during the year ended December 31st, 1912, the following inspections have been made in the Bow East Division:— Primary Inspection of Premises:— On Complaints of Nuisances 866 On Notifications of Infectious Diseases 268 On House-to-House Inspection 175 1,309 House-to-House Inspection in the Division was carried out in the following streets:— Trego Road Wansbeck Road Dace Road Rothbury Road Bakers Alley Taylor's Buildings Allanmouth Road Davey Road Old Ford Road Denbigh Road Comboss Road Iceland Road Walters Court Bream Street Douro Street Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. Under the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations 6 registered canal boats have been examined. The boats were found in fair condition and in compliance with the Acts and Regulations. One unregistered boat was found to be used as a canal boat dwelling by the steersman owner and his wife and did not comply with the requirements of the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. The steersman was cautioned to immediately register and the Registration authority communicated with. 206 The following unsound foods were dealt with during the year:— Two barrels of grapes, condemned, destroyed and certificates of unfitness for human food given. Housing Town Planning, etc. Act. 6 Houses have been permanently closed under the Act. Three houses were closed by closing order and reopened on the necessary repairs being executed. On the three houses being closed by order the freeholder immediately insisted on 18 other houses being put into a satisfactory condition. The houses were therefore closed and put in good order. Verminous Rooms. 16 verminous rooms have been cleansed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. Milkshops and Cowsheds. The milkshops and cowsheds have given no cause for complaint; the cowsheds were limewhited and cleansed twice during the year, in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds orders, and the milk vessels and measures of the various milk vendors were generally satisfactory. It is regrettable that with all the legislation in force and proposed for the purpose of securing a clean and wholesome milk supply, nothing is yet attempted in the direction of compelling the masses to provide clean and suitable utensils for the reception of the milk from the milkman's hand. A casual observation of the receptacles for milk used by the people in the poorer districts is sufficient to convince the observer of the futility of much of our work to secure a pure milk supply to the masses. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts fifty-one varied samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. On analysis one was found to be adulterated. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 5.8 per cent. Letter of caution to vendor as directed by Public Health Committee. 207 It is notable that during the past year the use of preservative in butter has ceased so far as the samples I have obtained. During the year 15 samples of butter were purchased and submitted for analysis. None contained preservatives. During the previous year of 13 samples analysed five contained boric acid preservative in quantities varying from 0.3 to 0.5 per cent. Pulmonary Tuberculosis Notification. During the twelve months 100 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis have been notified and dealt with. Unfortunately cases recommended for sanatorium treatment have been compelled to remain at home amidst insalubrious surroundings owing to the inadequacy of sanatoria accommodation. The effort to stamp out the white plague has therefore been considerably handicapped by this defect, particularly in respect of children affected only by the initial stages of the disease and to whom removal from their ill-conditioned homes may mean lives saved. It is to be hoped that early in the new year sanatoria may be available for all cases that may call for possible successful treatment at such Institutions. Of the 22 samples of milk analysed none contained boric acid or other preservative. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, ALFRED J FIELD, A.R.San.I., Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats. 208 Report of Inspector, Bromley North Division.

The undermentioned articles were purchased, viz.:— Milk, 24; butter, 16; cocoa, 1; margarine, 2; lard, 3; malt vinegar, 1; golden syrup, 1; rag flock, 1; arrowroot, 1. The results of the analyses of above samples showed that none of the articles were found to be adulterated. During the year 5 itinerant milk vendors were sampled in the streets and 5 Sunday samples were taken, the other samples were purchased at the shops. Factories, Workshops, Workplaces and Outworkers. During the year the premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected, and where necessary, for sanitary purposes, notices have been duly served upon the responsible persons, and the nuisances were abated thereon Milk Shops There are 54 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shopkeepers are all registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation of milking; I find that in all of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. Canal Boats. These boats are visited whenever lying alongside a wharf. 9 have been inspected during the year without causa of complaint 211 Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed slaughter houses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Ofttimes a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress, and the carcase is inspected. Killing is often carried out during the late evening hours. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are nine fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public. Bake-Houses. There are 17 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 20 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean. Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small scale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period frequent visits are made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored overnight is particularly investigated. Schools. There are 5 in the Bromley North District and these are visited twice a year re drinking water supply and w.c. accommodation. On each visit everything has been found in perfect order. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. O 212 Unsound Food. Large quantities of unsound food are received from outlying wharves and sent into the Bromley North Division for destruction; such food stuff is not allowed to be destroyed until the District Inspector has verified the amount and weight of each load sent from the wharf to his district. The goods are then destroyed under his supervision. The following quantities have been destroyed so as to prevent its reappearance on the market as a cheap food for the working class. The residue is used only for cattle food and manure. Total destroyed:— 5,445 tins of various meats. 80 tons wheat. 6 tons wheat. 5 cwts. 2 qrs. 18 lbs. (Panak). 25 cases oatmeal. 2 tons 3 cwts. 2 qrs. (Beef). Smoke Nuisances. A few smoke nuisances have been notified, but on the service of an intimation in each case the nuisance was abated. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive material is conveyed through the district. Only on two occasions were carriers cautioned, but the nuisances were very slight. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Cert. Sanitary Inspector Exam. Board (Lond.) also Cert.

The number of these premises now on the register is: cowsheds, 1; slaughterhouses, 3; one cowshed has been closed since my last Annual Report. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 57 varied samples have been taken and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. On analysis three were found to be adulterated. Summonses were issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples and results of legal proceedings are appended:— Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 50 per cent. Vendor fined £10 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 8.2 per cent. Vendor fined £3 and 23s. costs (second offence). Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 4.7 per cent. Vendor fined £2 and 23s. costs. Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with the London County Council's and Council's own bye-laws, as the nuisances were satisfactorily abated. p2 230 Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is stored and sold in the district with the object of enforcing the regulations of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of the measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, especially in respect to other articles kept for sale in close proximity to where milk is kept. Number of Milk Sellers registered 36 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 0 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 1 Number of Milk Sellers added to register 1 Overcrowding. During the year seven cases of overcrowding were dealt with; in each case the nuisance was abated after service of an intimation followed by a statutory notice, without recourse to legal proceedings. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, no case of overcrowding discovered, premises were found to be in a sanitary condition. Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection has been made of these premises during the past year; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register. At each inspection particular attention was paid to the food under preparation, and in no instance was there cause for complaint; in some cases it was necessary to serve intimations and statutory notices respecting cleansing of the kitchens, etc. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected, the sanitary conditions of the premises, cleanliness of the articles used in the business being carefully noted. In some few cases intimations were required to be served. Generally there is a marked improvement in these premises. 231 Factory and Workshops Acts. The workshops, domestic workshops, workplaces and domestic workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number engaged in each case being checked, particularly in respect to overcrowding; the terms of the Acts relating thereto have been met with in response to intimation and statutory notices when necessary, and in no instance was there occasion to take legal proceedings. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without any particular incident during the year. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. All the premises where ice creams are made have been inspected with the view of detecting nuisances, also any infringement of the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1902, Part viii. Each itinerant vendor's barrow and utensils have been inspected. In each case the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto, the ice cream and utensils were found to be satisfactory, and there was no cause for action to be taken. Smoke Nuisances. During the year the shafts throughout the district have been under careful observation, and in one instance only was a nuisance detected (which occurred during the Dock strike). Intimation and statutory notice were served, which had the desired effect of abating the nuisance. No recurrence of the nuisance has taken place, therefore there was no necessity to institute legal proceedings. Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected, and there has been no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-law under Public Health (London,) Act, Section 50). The cisterns of the undermentioned buildings have been inspected, and the usual cleansing has been carried out in accordance with the Bye-law:— 232 Adelaide Buildings 2, Baffin Buildings 2, Grosvenor Buildings 55, Hudson Buildings 2, Melbourne Buildings 4, Montreal Buildings 4, Ontario Buildings 4, Ottawa Buildings 4, Quebec Buildings 4, Council Buildings 5, St. Lawrence Cottages, Norfolk Street, 14, Sydney Buildings 4, Toronto Buildings 2, Winnipeg Buildings 4. Public House Urinals. The public house urinals in the district have been frequently inspected, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, strictly enforced (see tabulated list page 189). Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspections of these premises have been made during the year and change of ownership, etc. duly reported and noted in register. While inspecting these premises attention has been paid to the food in preparation for cooking. The premises have been cleansed where necessary and the conditions generally were found to be very satisfactory. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, etc. There is only one wharf in my district, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramornie Meat Co.), where food (all tinned) is landed, some of which is warehoused for various firms. The Ramornie Meat Co.'s Consignments are examined by an expert examiner employed by the firm before being sent out, either for home consumption or for exportation. A large amount is purchased for the Mercantile Service, all of which is again examined, specially labelled and passed by Board of Trade officials before leaving the premises. The following tinned foods were found, on examination by the consignees, to be unfit for human consumption and rejected, being set aside by the consignees in a separate building for the purpose of being sent to a fat boiler in the district to be rendered down for fat, precaution being taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose:— 233 January 26—534 tins of Beef, Mutton and Soups „ 29—401 „ „ ,, May 9—416 „ „ „ „ 16—65 „ „ „ June 18—312 „ „ „ „ 20—136 „ „ „ September 2—468 ,, ,, ,, ,, 3—500 „ ,, „ „ 11—904 „ 20—460 „ „ „ „ 24—788 ,, ,, ,, December 20—961 „ „ ,, 5,945 Public Elementary Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Public Elementary Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supplies and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main. The storage cisterns (which are used for supplying the sanitary conveniences only) are cleansed out every three months, the sanitary conveniences were found to be in a clean and satisfactory condition. In some cases the drinking cups were found to be missing but have since been reinstated. Places where Bread is Sold. With reference to a communication from the London County Council the shops in my district where bread is sold have been periodically inspected under Section 8 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which refers to the sanitary regulations of premises used for the sale of food for human consumption. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats, East Combined Division. 234 Report of Inspector, South Division of Poplar. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1912. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my Annual Summary of the sanitary work, executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1912, viz.:— The details of which were entered in my journal day by day and reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee month by month. Number of Inspections, special, periodical and on complaint of nuisances 1,145 ,, ,, Inspections re notifications of infectious diseases 153 ,, ,, Inspections, house-to-house visitations 128 ,, ,, Town Planning Act 23 Total Inspections 1,449 Re-inspections 2,533 House-to-House Inspections. House-to-House inspections were carried out as follows:— The whole of— Sections of— Chipka Street. Crew Street. Cuba Street. Newcastle Street. Samuda Street. Marshfield Street. Plevna Street. West Ferry Road. Manchester Road. Alpha Road. Glengall Road. East Ferry Road. Stebondale Street. 235 Of the total premises inspected 960 were found to be in fair condition; 34 per cent. required various works of sanitary improvement, which necessitated the service of 416 written intimations, 116 statutory notices, and 30 final notices, and one summons. Drains. During the year 36 drains were proved defective by the smoke and chemical tests, and in 253 instances the application of tests revealed no defects. Drainage construction and reconstruction, including means of access and ventilation, were carried out at the following premises:— West Ferry Road, 84a, 145, 147, 149, 425, 427. Sufferance Wharf, Glengall Wharf and Electrical Power Storage Works, West Ferry Road. Tooke Street, 12,14, 16,18, 20. Havannah Street, 22, 24, 26, 28 and St. Luke's Parish Hall, Malabar Street, 5, Marsh Street, 1 to 10. Chapel House Street, 6, 7, 8, 9. Cuba Street, Messrs. J. Stephens Smith's factory. Manchester Road, London Oil Storage Co.'s Works. Dudgeon's Wharf and 62, Manchester Road. Johnson Street Stables, G. E. R. Arches. British Street, Florentia Works. Wharf Road, Storer's Wharf. The drains of the undermentioned premises were reconstructed partially or wholly on the old lines, in most cases including the fixing of new w.c. pans, traps and yard gullies:— Manchester Road, 2, 239, 241, 243, 245, 197, 487. Stebondale Street, 81, 83, 114, Stewart Street, 21. Pier Street, 9. Castalia Street, 4. Newcastle Street, 2 to 10. Galbraith Street, 15. Chipka Street, 25. Havannah Street, 2 to 18. Mellish Street, 79, 103. Janet Street, 11. 236 Cahir Street, 13. Cuba Street, 28. Tooke Street, 9, 11, 42, 44. Deptford Ferry Road, 1, 2. Claude Street 11, 16. Maria Street, 1, 2. Powis Road, Cyclops Works. Glengall Road, Stuart's Works, and 6 to 22 even Nos. and 36, 38, 42, 52, 54. West Ferry Road, 61, 27, 94, 78, 251, 269, 413, Nelson Wharf, and Maconochie's Wharf. Where practicable the water test was applied to new work. Factories. Improved or additional sanitary accommodation for workmen has been provided at the following factories:— Electrical Powers Storage Factory, West Ferry Road. Florentia Works, British Street. Sufferance Wharf and Factory, West Ferry Road. Messrs. Stephens' Smith Engineers Factory, Cuba Street. London Oil Storage Co., Dudgeon's Wharf, Manchester Road. Union Lighterage Works, Stewart Street Cotton Seed Mills, Wharf Road. Stuart's Granolithic Works, Glengall Road. Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were inspected and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 41—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Booms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms were inspected and dealt with where necessary. In every case an antiseptic was in use. 237 Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. The sanitary condition of the lavatories, conveniences, water supplies, and fittings was satisfactory. Tuberculosis and Measles. In addition to the ordinary notifications of infectious diseases, in all cases of measles notified from schools and in cases of tuberculosis the homes of the patients were inspected and advice given re isolation and disinfection, to prevent the spread of infection and all insanitary conditions were dealt with. Public Health London Act, 1891. Prosecution. Complaint. Premises. Costs and Penalty No water supply for Sanitary 6, Marshfield Street £1 8s. or Domestic purposes. In the above case the water supply was reinstated at the date of the hearing of the summons The presiding magistrate, however, imposed a fine and costs for neglecting to comply with the Council's notice in the time specified thereon. 238 Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. The premises, 147,149, Stebondale Street, Cubitt Town, were reported to be dealt with under this Act, as unfit for human habitation and upon your representation to the Council closing orders were made—at the date of this report the premises are unoccupied and specifications have been prepared by the owner covering the work necessary to render these houses fit for reoccupation—which will be put in hand at an early date. Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises:— Bakehouses, 7. Slaughterhouses, 1. Tripe dressers and sausage makers, 9 Dailies and milk shops, 19. Ice cream vendors, 18. Coffee shops and dining rooms, 31. Fish shops, 12. In-all cases where cleansing, limewashing, or other works of sanitary improvements were necessary the matter was brought to the notice of the occupiers by written intimation, which in every case was complied with. The regularity of the periodical inspection of these premises has impressed upon the occupiers the necessity of cleanliness and limewashing, etc., of kitchens and places where food is prepared or stored This was proved by the amount of work already completed or in progress (without notice) at the time of my visits. Riverside Wharves and Food Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the undermentioned wharves and factories, and records were kept of all unsound foodstuffs and methods of destruction. Sufferance Wharf and Food Preserving Factory, West Ferry Road (for export only) 239 The tinned food stuff rejected and destroyed by this firm during the year amounted to 261 cases, each containing about 48 tins, which contained principally preserved fish. These cases were marked unsound and sealed and were put overboard at sea from the firm's boats. During the year two notices were received from the Port Sanitary Authority of returned tinned goods consigned to the above factory. In each case the goods were examined on delivery with results as follows:— 10 cases of jams containing 570 jars and tins—128 were unsound and destroyed. Quantity of assorted provisions and confectionery from barge sunk in Victoria Dock—all unsound food stuff disposed of by the above firm under a guarantee that it was to be used for cattle or pigs' food. Maconochie's Wharf and Food Preserving Factory, West Ferry Road. The total amount of food stuffs rejected as unsound by this firm and destroyed in the furnaces on the premises at the time of my visits during the past year was 1,496 tins, varying in weight from ¼lb. to 14lb., and consisting of meat, fish, poultry, fruit, and vegetables. Millwall Wharf, Manchester Road. In response to notice from the Port Sanitary Authority 160 bags (about 10 tons) of ginger were examined at this wharf. The contents of 64 bags were in mouldy condition, which after special treatment, washing, etc., were allowed to pass. The above were examined by yourself and the medical officer for the Port of London. No notice was received from H.M. Office of Customs under the regulations made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, of food stuff imported by water into this district during the past year, and no infringement of the Act was observed by me. Inspection of Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. 240 Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-two samples of food were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis as under:— Milk, 23; 9 of which were purchased from street vendors. Butter, 15. Margarine, 4. Lard, 2. Coffee, 2. Cocoa, 1. Pepper, 1. Vinegar, 1. Arrowroot, 1. Ground Rice, 1. Golden Syrup, 1. Of the samples taken one milk was certified to be deficient in fat to the extent of 40 per cent. Legal proceedings were instituted with the result that the vendor was fined £3 and 23s. costs. The remaining samples were certified to be genuine and to contain no preservative. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 241 Report of Lady Inspector (Miss Tattersall) Public Health Department, 31st December, 1912. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my thirteenth Annual Report which deals with the work done in factories, workshops, among outworkers, and other miscellaneous inspections during the year 1912. Verminous Children, Phthisis and Scabies. A large proportion of time has again been devoted to the inspection of the homes of children reported as attending school in a verminous condition. In many cases there is a great improvement but there will probably always be a number of children who are neglected and dirty, and a family of this description can easily infect a whole school. The prosecutions instituted by the L.C.C. (Education Department) have had a beneficial effect. The homes of children suffering from scabies (itch) have also been visited, leaflets left, advice given and frequently disinfection of bedding carried out. I have had under observation the homes of tuberculous patients attending the dispensary especially where shelters, bedsteads or bedding have been lent by the Committee. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation for the girls and infants in the 36 elementary schools in the Borough have been inspected and various defects remedied or reported to the London County Council (Education Department). 242 Outworkers and National Insurance Act. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 151 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 322 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 256 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. The operation of the National Insurance Act has caused a decrease in the number of outworkers, some employers having discharged old or inefficient workers who could only earn a few shillings weekly, but those who are employed have more work and it will probably be more regular. The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1912.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to hand you my ninth Annual Report and particulars of the work carried out; under the Bye-laws; Public Health (London) Act, 1891; and London County Council General Powers Acts, 1904 & 1907; for the year ended 31st December, 1912. Overcrowding Many inspections were made at night time in the areas which were known to be overcrowded. Cases were dealt with in the following streets, during the year:— Allanmouth Road. Mansfield Terrace. Arcadia Street. Old Ford Road. Bakers Alley. Park Street. Beachy Road. Perring Street. Broomfield Street. Ranwell Street. Box Street. Ricardo Street. Clifton Street. Rook Street. Eastward Street. Ruston Street. Elizabeth Cottages. Sabbarton Street. Davis Street. Silver Lion Court. Gale Street. Sophia Street. Hawgood Street. Tidey Street. Kerbey Street. Wyke Road. Milton Road. Whitethorn Street. Legal Proceedings Throughout the year legal proceedings were twice instituted, in order to secure the abatement of overcrowding. Case No. 1 Man, wife and three children occupied an underground room of 830 cubic feet, by day and night. The space required was 1,400 feet. Fined 10s. and 23s. costs. Q 244 Case No. 2 Man, wife and two children occupied a first floor room of 760 cubic feet, by day and night. Space required 1,200 feet. As the family had removed the day previous to the hearing, the magistrate suggested that the summons be withdrawn. Registration. During the year 13 houses were added to the Register, bringing up the total to 1,137. Vermin in Rooms. In many houses the gas pipes are fixed at the very top of the walls and touch the ceilings, thus affording a "run" for vermin, obviously making it difficult for tenants to get rid of them. Correspondence was opened on this matter with the Gas Company, suggesting that the pipes be fixed a few inches below the ceilings, to facilitate cleaning above them, but the Company replied that they thought such an arrangement would involve the risk of injury to the gas pipes. House to House Inspection. During the year 364 premises, situated in the streets set out below, were inspected and work of various descriptions was carried out. (See tabulated list.) Allanmouth Road Johnson Street. Alpha Road. Judkin Street. Arcadia Street. Kerbey Street. Bakers Alley. Knapp Road. Beachy Road. Mansfield Terrace. Brunswick Street. Manchester Road. Davis Street.

Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., January 1st, 1913 Sir,— I beg to present the fifth Annual Report of my work. I resigned my position as Organising Secretary to the Poplar Health Visiting Association on May 2nd, so shall be unable to give you as much information regarding the Association as in previous years. The number of visits paid by the Voluntary Helpers shows a decrease of only 465 compared with the previous year, when the Association employed a paid whole-time worker; during the last six months however, there has been a steady decline, the number of infants visited falling from 923 in the first half-year, to 468 in the second. With the exception of the Isle of Dogs each centre shows a decrease both in the number of visitors, and infants visited. During the first six months, the attendances at the Consultation Days showed an increase of 379 compared to the corresponding period of last year. Each Centre contributed to this, South Bromley heading the list with an increased average attendance of 171, North Bromley being lowest—an increase of 1.8. I organised a Baby Show for the Association, as a special effort during National Health week, the show being limited to those attending the Consultation Days. There were 200 entries, and the whole thing was a great success. The difficult task of judging was undertaken by the Hon. Medical Consultants from each Centre, and all the arrangements were carried out in a most admirable manner by the Voluntary Workers. The Mayoress of Poplar (Mrs. F. Sedgwick) declared the Show open and presided, Mrs. Sydney Buxton presented the Prizes. I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my sincere thanks to one and all. It is rather interesting to note that the Show was organised in exactly the same way as advocated by Dr. Eric Pritchard in the current number of "National Health." Four of the Voluntary Workers were appointed to official positions during the year. Each expressed gratitude to this Department for the help received. In making any comparison between the rates of mortality—Borough and infants visited, I beg to call your attention to the fact that the rate of mortality (115.62) given by me, refers to infants born in 1911—a year marked by record epidemics 248 —measles in the early part, diarrhoea during the exceedingly hot summer. The figures really come out better than I expected. The figures relating to the Consultation Days are only for the first six months of the year, as I ceased attending in July, when the new secretary was appointed. North Bromley Centre. Number of Visitors 7 „ Infants visited 151 South Bromley Centre. Number of Visitors 6 ,, Infants visited 115 Poplar Centre. Number of Visitors 5 „ Infants visited 56 Isle of Dogs Centre.

Mixed feeding 2.08 „ Hand-fed 2.60 „ Mothers who worked during pregnancy:— Home-work 7.27 per cent. Factory, workshop, charing, etc. 9.70 „ Families occupying:— 1 Room per family 13.34 per cent. 2 Rooms per family 17.67 „ Re-visits 2,114 Removed and not traced 92 Died 31 Mothers who worked after birth of child:— Home-work 6.93 per cent. Factory, workshop, charing, etc. 6.23 „ Consultation Days. There were 1,066 attendances at the Consultation Days during the first six months, an increase of 379 compared with the corresponding period of 1911, the average attendance at the various Centres being as follows:— St. Frideswides' Mission Room 45.6 Roman Road Baths 38.8 All Hallows' Schoolroom 35.0 Town Hall, Poplar 33.1 Vicarage Room, High Street 18.6 The average attendance of each infant, 3.2. 250 Vital Statistics. The figures appended refer to infants born in 1911, and kept under supervision for a year, they show an increase of 315 in the number kept under supervision, and an increase of 9.93 per thousand in the rate of mortality, as compared to 1910. Visited 1,846 Removed and not traced 419 Died 165 Rate of mortality per 1,000 visited 115.62 The feeding of the above infants during the first six months of life was as follows:— (1) Those alive at end of completed year (December, 1912):— Breast-fed 82.89 per cent. Mixed feeding 14.1 ,, Hand-fed 3.01 ,, (2) Those who died:— Breast-fed 57.57 per cent. Mixed feeding 29.63 „ Hand-fed 12.72 (3) Comparison of Rates of Mortality between Infants.

Notifications received 34 Visits paid 32 Revisits paid 48 Recovered 24 Died while under treatment 2 Sight of one eye destroyed 1 Did not wish to be. visited 1 Remaining under supervision 4 251 Two cases occurred in the Poplar Workhouse, one in the East End Mothers' Home, nine in the practice of medical practitioners, 22 in the practice of midwives. One patient was admitted into the Hospital, eight attended as outpatients, three were admitted into the Sick Asylum, the remainder were treated by private doctors.

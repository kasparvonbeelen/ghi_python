TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OP THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and Sanitary circumstances of the Borough during the year 1963. \^/) Population. The population rose by 490 to reach a total of 67,830. This is in keeping with the trend indicated in my report last year. It is estimated that there will be a small but steady increase in the years of redevelopment of this area. Births. Live births were 4% lower than last year totalling 1,345. Still births showed a threefold increase in the year and possible reasons for this are under investigation. Deaths. The peri-natal mortality rate also showed an increase of 35%. This situation is one of considerable concern and is the subject of investigation. Whilst death from lung cancer showed no material change, bronchitis still continued to show an upward trend being approximately 13% above 1962. Deaths from heart conditions, coronary disease and hypertension showed an approximate decrease of 11%. These may reflect a diminution in smoking habits but almost certainly is due to new drugs which are delaying the deaths of people with these conditions. Infectious Diseases. Although the number of cases of infectious diseases was more than double the total of last year the greater part was accounted for by childhood diseases, -measles, whooping cough and scarlet fever. There were, however, three confirmed cases of typhoid, the details of which are set out in the -6- body of my report. In each case a satisfactory result was obtained and measures were taken to prevent any spread of this unpleasant and contagious disease. It is one of the great difficulties in tracing the origin of infection that the patient and contacts often omit details, which to them seem insignificant but which, in reality, hold the key to the source of infection. Thus, often only by reiteration of questions and checking of statements can the necessary information be obtained. Housing and General. The year 1963 was ushered, in by a severe winter with sub-zero temperatures. Because of great distress caused by flooding due to burst pipes, the Disinfecting Station staff were placed on "instant call" duty to deal with wet bedding and clothing. The staff returned to duty in the evenings and at week-ends. In one part of the Borough arctic conditions brought chaos to a large block of privately owned buildings consisting of hundreds of dwellings, when underground drains froze and practically all soil pipes were frozen, and, as a result, many burst. During this prolonged cold spell a "red warning" was in operation by the Emergency Bed Service and hospital admissions were the highest since the period of fog and the influenza outbreak which followed it in the winter of 1952/53. Mobile Dwellings. During the year 221 licences were granted to the London County Council for the erection of mobile homes on various sites throughout the Borough. Not only are they providing many families with urgently needed accommodation but, at the same time, their erection has reduced the number of open sites which have occasioned so much nuisance and undesirable occupation by caravan trespassers in the past. Houses in Multiple Occupation. Work under this section of the Housing Act produced a number of problems. There was difficulty on many occasions in establishing not only the ownership of premises but also the occupation of individual rooms. The frequent changes of the tenancy of rooms made it necessary for regular re-visiting of all premises registered under this section of the Housing Act and, in many cases, this entailed inspection at night. As the survey of the Borough proceeded and more premises came under surveillance, it became apparent that in order for satisfactory progress to be maintained a separate section dealing full-time with the problems of -7- Multiple Occupation must be set up and this was made possible by the appointment of two temporary Public Health Inspectors in December. It is important that the practice of over-occupation of houses be stopped before it becomes out of control The law needs strengthening so that houses suitable for multiple occupation can be registered before re-occupation, as the nuisance is made worse by owners, many being recent immigrants, who purchase old property when vacant and proceed to let each room separately. Welfare. The Welfare Section of the department dealing with Old People's problems is now well established and nearly a 1,000 cases are registered with the department. The regular routine visiting and checking of living conditions and welfare is maintained. At the same time every effort is made to discover new cases where assistance is required. The auxiliary services of Home Bathing and Incontinent Laundry Service are being utilised to their full capacity. The Annual Holiday under the supervision of the Welfare Officer, arranged by the Mayor, was extremely successful and enjoyed immensely by the participants. Clean Air. The area of the Borough now under Clean Air Zones amounts to 428 acres. A further Order affecting 501 acres comes into operation on the 1st July, 1964, and, in addition, preparations are in hand for the survey and representation of further areas in 1965 which will bring the greater part of the Borough under Control. During the year Poplar Borough Council was one of the authorities cooperating with the College of General Practitioners in an endeavour to ascertain whether there was any correlation in varying levels of air pollution and the incidence of respiratory disease. The department was also able to participate in a special investigation in connection with crossinfection in hospital wards. During research carried out by the Hospital Group Pathologist vent lation studies were conducted, using an electrostatic precipitator, primarily with a view to eliminating bacteria. It was fortunate that the apparatus was working during the smog, the haze producing particles of which were completely eliminated by the precipitator, with tremendous advantage to patients with bad chests in the ward as compared with those in other parts of the hospital not treated. We were able to demonstrate with volumetric sulphur dioxide apparatus that in spite of the clinical advantage to chest patients this was achieved without removal of the sulphur dioxide as the level recorded inside the ward was, if anything, slightly higher than that outside. -8- Health Education. Greater consideration is being given by the department to increasing activity in the field of Health Education. There is a great need for a more strenuous policy by all authorities connected with public welfare; unnecessary infection, home accidents and injuries are brought about by carelessness, ignorance and failure to take elementary precautions. A vigorous campaign to spread knowledge is a matter of urgency. I would like to express my thanks to Members of the Council and, in particular, to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, for their help and encouragement. My thanks are also due to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for their assistance and co-operation at all times, and to my own staff for their loyal and ready support. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. C. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. -9- SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 595 and the home population estimated by the Registrar General to number 67,830 at the middle of the year shows an increase of 490 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was 19.82 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 20.84 for 1962. To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar General. Factors are supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 18.82 as compared with 18.2 for England and Wales. The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 23.04 as compared with 24.21 for the previous year. The figures for England and Wales are 20.9 and 21.4 respectively. The death rate in 1963 was 11.05 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 11.55 for 1962. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 13.48 as compared with 12.2 for England and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 13.05 and 11.9 respectively. The causes of death are shown in Table 1 in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from neoplasm of the lung show no appreciable change. It is worth noting that coronary disease, which has been increasing steadily over the past few years, has this year shown an appreciable decrease.

Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority The water supply to the Borough has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity during 1963. The water supply to the area is a mixture of River Thames-derived and River Lee-derived filtered water in varying and unpredictable proportions. A summary of the results of the chemical and bacteriological analyses of the water passing into supply from these two sources for the year 1963 is set out on page 16. The waters are not plumbo-solvent. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination revealed by inspection or analysis. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine and the water in them is checked as to its quality afterwards, before the structures are restored to service. All inhabited houses are supplied with a piped water supply direct to them, and no houses are permanently supplied by standpipe. There have been no new sources of supply or new important extensions of trunk mains in this area during the period under consideration, and there were no changes in the general scheme of supply. New mains were laid to the extent of 519 yards. Acknowledgements are due to Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, who supplied these facts and figures, Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in 182 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough, some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes, but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary -14- in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. (See overleaf for analysis of water supplies) SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. The District Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows, on page 17. CONDITION OF THE RIVER THAMES. From local observations the general condition of the river has continued to improve. Extract from the Annual Report of the Scientific Adviser of the London County Council: "A daily analysis is made of samples collected from midstream off both L.C.C. sewage outfall works. A survey of the analytical results shows that by comparison with conditions during the previous ten years, the condition of the river was considerably worse in the upper reaches, but there was an appreciable improvement in the middle river, off the outfalls and in the lower river. The incidence of sulphides in water devoid of oxygen was the lowest recorded since regular determinations of sulphide were started in 1953. Particularly in view of the exceptionally low upland flow, this can only have been due to the improved condition of the river. A greatly improved effluent will next year be discharged from the new Southern Outfall Plant and further improvement in the river condition is to be expected. It must, however, be recorded that there is a tendency for a greater pollution load to arrive at the Northern Outfall Works and without further purification plant deterioration in the quality of the effluent from this station is inevitable." -15- -16- AVERAGE RESULTS OF THE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLIED TO BOROUGH OF POPLAR 1963 MILLIGRAMMES PER LITRE (unless otherwise stated) description of the sample no. of samples ammon1a n1trogen albumino1d nitrogen nitrate nitrogen chlor1des as CL. oxygen abs. from Permanganate 4 hours at 27°c. turbidity units colour m,m, brown 2ft, tube Burgess's tintometer hardness (total) Lee Bridge (lee derived) 52 0.185 0.110 4.2 48 1.48 0.6 13 330 Thames derived South of river 156 0.20 0.079 3.8 32 1.18 0.3 10 266 description of the sample (cont.) hardness (non carbonate) PH Value phosphate as po. 4 sillicate as Si02 sulphate as s04 surface active material as manoxol natural fluoride magnesium as mg B.O.D. 5 days at 20°C. sod1um as Na potassium as K Electrical v1ty mlcromhos Lee Bridge (lee derived) 100 8.0 2.3 8 108 0.20 0.35 8 38 7.8 700 Thames derived south of river 66 7.8 1.3 11 62 0.08 0.25 5 25 5.2 550 METROPOLITAN WATER BOARD-WATER EXAMINATION DEPARTMENT BACTERIOLOGICAL RESULTS-YEARLY AVERAGES, 1963 AFTER TREATMENT agar plate count per ml. coliform count E.coli count source of supply number of samples 20-24 hours at 37°c. 3 days at 22°c. per cent samples negative in 100 ml. per cent samples negative in 100 ml.

During the year 184 plans of drainage works to new and existing buildings were submitted and approved. SEWAGE DISPOSAL AND SEWERAGE. The disposal of sewage in London is the responsibility of the London County Council, and the position as far as Poplar is concerned is generally satisfactory. OFFENSIVE TRADES. One Dresser of Furskins is established in the Borough. -22- COMMON LODGING HOUSES There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 244 males, in the Borough, 5 day inspections and 2 night inspections were made during the year. SEAMEN'S LODGING HOUSES There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 5. One was made at night and four during the day. Each year, when considering applications for renewal of licences for Common Lodging Houses and Seamen's Lodging Houses detailed inspections are made of the premises by: (a) Public Health Department (b) Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department This includes fire precautions. (c) London Electricity Board and a licence is issued subject to the requirements and recommendations of these Departments being met. PERSONAL CLEANSING As in recent years the arrangement was continued with Stepney Borough Council whereby persons requiring personal cleansing were treated where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. The number of persons cleansed during 1963 was as follows: Verminous Scabies TOTAL Adults 39 21 60 Children 2 2 4 TOTAL 41 23 64 -23- DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below: (a) Disinfection: Premises Articles Disinfected Disinfected Infectious Disease 22 200 Tuberculosis 48 353 Scabies 1 33 Miscellaneous 495 1,712 TOTALS 566 2,298 In addition 251 tons of waste paper, and 21 tons, 13 cwts of sterilised Rags were disinfected.

Great care is taken to ensure that baits are protected from domestic animals and non-responsible persons. The work of the section is divided into three main categories: (a) Sewer Maintenance Treatment (b) Business Premises (c) Dwelling Houses-complaints from occupiers -24- RODENT CONTROL IN SEWERS. Between 1943 and 1954 Rodent Control in Sewers was attempted with two treatments a year, using Zinc Phosphide or Arsenous Oxide. This method was considered to be adequate by the Pest Division of the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, but an examination of the results showed that over a number of years the rat population in the sewers appeared to be static. From 1954 treatments were increased to three a year This showed some improvement which may have been related to the change of bait to one including prepared "Warfarin". With this low level of treatment it appeared that the rat population was able to regain its natural level between treatments. In 1961 an experiment was begun using Sodium Fluoracetamide (1081) applied with six treatments in the year. The basis of the experiment was that a rat matures and is capable of reproduction at about two months and it was thought that if the rats could be killed before reaching maturity this was likely to be the most satisfactory way of reducing their numbers. The results are highly encouraging and it is now reported that several sections of the sewerage system have been freed of rats and have remained free. Table A shows the variation in results over a period of years and Table B shows the distribution of results over the borough. Allowing for certain infiltration from extensive dock and railway property and from adjoining boroughs, the improvement in the overall situation is regarded as being very satisfactory.

Following the inspection of commercial premises and industrial sites, the Owners are encouraged to join the scheme The charge for the service is based on the extent of infestation, the number of visits likely to be required, and the cost of labour and materials. In an area with nearly nine miles of river frontage to the Thames and Lea this enables the treatments to spread over a large number of premises and gives a very satisfactory measure of control. It is appreciated by the Commercial undertakers, and is a valuable part of rat repression work carried out in the Borough; The income derived from this scheme amounted to £5,034 during the year. DWELLING HOUSES 373 complaints relating to dwelling houses received during the year. No serious infestations were discovered. 26 DETAILS OF WORK CARRIED OUT UNDER THE PREVENTION OF DAMAGE BY PESTS ACT, 1949 DURING THE YEAR UNDER REVIEW TYPE OF PROPERTY LOCAL AUTHORITY DWELLING HOUSES INCLUDING COUNCIL HOUSES ALL OTHER (INCLUDING BUSINESS PREMISES) TOTAL NUMBER OF PROPERTIES IN BOROUGH 21 18,424 3,658 22,103 NUMBER OF PROPERTIES INSPECTED AS A RESULT OF: (A) NOTIFICATION 13 173 2,017 2,203 (B) SURVEY UNDER THE ACT - 10 13 23 (C) OTHERWISE - - - - TOTAL INSPECTIONS CARRIED OUT, INCLUDING RE-INSPECTIONS 68 1,596 11,590 13,254 NUMBER OF PROPERTIES INSPECTED WHICH WERE FOUND TO BE INFESTED BY: (A) COMMON RATS MAJOR - 4 18 22 MINOR 9 99 364 472 (B) SHIP RATS MAJOR - - - - MINOR - - 10 10 (C) MICE MAJOR 6 73 111 190 MINOR - 106 627 733 NUMBER OF INFESTED PROPERTIES TREATED 15 282 1 ,131 1 ,428 TOTAL TREATMENTS CARRIED OUT 36 1,194 2,241 3,471 NUMBER OF BLOCK CONTROL SCHEMES CARRIED OUT - - 151 151 -27- FACTORIES ACT, 1961 (TABLES IV, V & VI) TABLE IV INSPECTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH PREMISES NUMBER ON REGISTER NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS WRITTEN NOTICES OCCUPIERS PROSECUTED 1.

Prompt action as soon as illegal parking is reported is essential in order to curtail this nuisance. Once having established themselves it is extremely difficult to have them dislodged. Legal proceedings were instituted on sixteen occasions, and results are listed below. The only effective answer to illegal parking is the development of unused sites at the earliest possible moment, and in the event of this not being possible they should be enclosed on clearance.

Progress in Clean Air continued. During the year No.15 Order was submitted to the Minister for confirmation. This Order is the largest yet made and covers an area of some 501 acres in the south of the borough. It involved 3,600 residential properties in which the estimated total cost of adaptations is £63,000. The Minister fixed the date of operation as the 1st July, 1964. Smoke Control Orders. The first few Orders made by the Council consisted in large part of cleared sites and sites on which remained a few houses scheduled for almost immediate redevelopment which were excluded from the operation of these Orders. This was done so that Orders should be in operation before the tenants moved in, as it was felt that they should become accustomed to the use of smokeless appliances from the start. With these Orders completed attention was then turned to the making of Smoke Control Orders covering the rest of the borough. With the Completion of No.15 approximately two thirds of the borough is subject to Smoke Control and it is anticipated that if the present rate of progress is maintained the remaining one third of the borough should be covered in two further Orders at the time of the amalgamation of the three boroughs on April 1st, 1965. Smoke Abatement. During the year twenty five smoke nuisances were reported and thirty three were detected as a result of routine observations. A total of 198 visits and inspections were made in this connection. During the winter complaints continued regarding emission of grit and sooty particles from Power Stations. Representations were made on a number of occasions to the Central Electricity Generating Board and to Her Majesty's Alkali Inspector (responsible for the operation of the Clean Air Act in Power Stations). Brunswick Wharf Power Station, pulverised fuel fired, had trouble with an overload cut-out on the electrostatic precipitator. This caused periodic heavy emissions of dust. A number of sampling points were set up in the vicinity, and the resulting collection of grit, ash and sooty particles was submitted for analysis. The result of this investigation was passed to the Central Electricity Generating Board. Some improvement has been effected since the installation of new electronic equipment. At Watts Grove Power Station the principal factor giving rise to nuisance was the burning of solid fuel in furnaces primarily designed for pulverised fuel, with the result that combustion takes place in the lower portion of a comparatively large combustion space. This gives rise to -32- siderable cooling of the gases with the resultant emission of dark smoke and grit. This station is used solely to supplement peak load; sudden demands for steam on the boilers are often beyond their rated capacity which aggravates the position. Two plans and specifications of proposed new boiler installations were submitted for approval. Air Pollution. The Smoke and Sulphur Dioxide Recording Stations set up at the Town Hall and Poplar Technical College have remained in operation throughout the year, and a third Station was set up in Millwall Park. The Department has continued to co-operate fully with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. During periods of fog, when heavy pollution may be expected, special recordings are made. Hourly Smoke Study. Poplar was one of the boroughs co-operating with the College of General Practitioners in a special study which sought information on the possible correlation between any increase in respiratory disease and air pollution levels during smogs. A sequential smoke sampler is used, operating at three hourly or one hourly intervals. This type of experiment showed the interesting possibilities of co-operation between the General Practitioners and the Medical Officers of Health. Special Research-Air Pollution and Respiratory Disease. In connection with a Cross-Infection Study a small electrostatic precipitator was installed during research in ward ventilation. The apparatus was in operation during a period of smog; it was noted that all smoke haze had been eliminated from the ward; there was no grime deposit on the windows. Several cases with bad chests had been previously moved to this ward and it was noted that they suffered no inconvenience or respiratory distress during the smog as compared with similar patients in untreated wards. The Department was able to co-operate with the Bow Hospital Group Pathologist in this special study of air pollution in hospital wards. We were able to demonstrate that although the smoke had been filtered out during this period, there was no significant change in the sulphur dioxide content as between the air inside and outside the ward. These results were considered to be so encouraging that further experiments should be made with a view to the creation of at least two similarly air conditioned wards (one male - one female) in every hospital for this type of respiratory emergency. Trainee Public Health Inspectors. Pour Trainee Public Health Inspectors are on the establishment of the department, and each month two of them are seconded to the Section to assist the Clean Air Inspector. 33 CLEAN AIR ACT. 1956 ANNUAL STATISTICS 1st January to 31st December, 1963 Code No. Section Inspections and revisits Dark Smoke Nuisances 1 1 45 Other Smoke Nuisances 2 16 15 Grit and Dust Nuisances 3 5 13 Notification of New Furnaces 4 3(3) 2 Prior Approval - New Furnaces 5 3(2) 8 Prior Approval - Grit/Dust Equipment 6 6 - Industrial Smoke Control 7 11 153 Non-Industrial Smoke Control 8 11 54 Railway Engines 9 19 - Survey Smoke Control Area No. 15 10 11 716 Inspection of work in connection with adaptations 11 12 162 Crown Premises, etc. 12 22 - Alkali Acts 13 17 - Atmospheric Pollution Stations 14 25 40 Health Education 15 25 4 Legal Proceedings 16 29 - Industrial Plant Records 17 8 - Height of Chimneys 18 10 1 Miscellaneous Visits 19 - 178 Total Visits 1389 34 TABLE VII ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RECORDING TABLE CONSTITUENTS JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE WATER 12.77 MM.

NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47 NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951, SECTION 1. Once again it gives me great satisfaction to report that on no account was it necessary to resort to the powers of compulsory removal of any old person. 37 WELFARE OF THE AGED AND INFIRM. The appointment of an Assistant Welfare Officer in April, 1963, enabled the work of the Welfare Section to be expanded, and allowed a more detailed investigation and follow-up of the cases brought to the attention of the department. In all, a further 376 new cases were added to the register of old people under observation. There is a wide range of voluntary organisations which provide opportunities for social contacts and activities for old people in the Borough. Theircontribution to the well being of our old folk is of the highest importance. The co-ordination of their work through the Old People's Welfare Committee, and in conjunction with the services provided by the L.C.C., National Assistance Board, W. V. S. and other bodies, has made it possible for advice and assistance to be given speedily in a large number of cases of distress. DETAILS OF INSPECTIONS.

The number of Home Bathing visits more than doubled the total of the previous year, amounting to 1205 as compared with 532. It is anticipated that the need for this service will increase year by year. INCONTINENT LAUNDRY. The demand for this service, as in the case of Home Bathing, has shown a great increase. However, I am pleased to say that the staff were able to cope satisfactorily with the extra burden of work. 38 MORTUARY AND CORONER'S COURT. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court. It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-mortem room. In addition there is a viewing room a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the Pathologists and clerks. The total number of bodies received during 1963 was 709 (Residents 303 non-residents 406). Post-mortem examinations were made in 600 cases and inquests were held in 109 cases PUBLIC CLEANSING. The arrangements for collection removal and disposal of refuse are under the control of the Borough Engineer, who has supplied the following information : Refuse During the year 23,796 tons of house trade street gully, market and kitchen refuse were collected arid disposed of at the controlled tip In addition 15,013 tons of refuse from other Bdroughs were also dealt with at the Council's Refuse Disposal Depot Street Cleansing Two Mechanical/Sweeper/Collectors supplemented the work of the manual Road Sweepers, and as warranted by weather conditions two watering machines were used for washing and watering roads and street markets. Gaily Cleansing Three Gully/Emptying machines have carried out 5,558 gully cleansings and weekly emptyings of three cesspools. SHIMMING BATHS AND WASH HOUSES. The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent: Poplar Baths Vapour, Foam and Slipper baths, Swimming Pools Bow Baths Slipper Baths Aberfeldy Street Launderette PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS. There are two pools both situated at the main establishment. East India Dock Road, E 14 and I am indebted to the Chief Baths Superintendent for the information contained in the report which follows Large Pool Small Pool Length 100 ft. 64 ft. Width 39 6„ 25 ft Maximum depth 8 6„ 6 6" Minimum depth 3 6„ 3 ft, Capacity 150,000 galls 50,000 galls 39 The water to the pools is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a mixture from the Rivers Lea and Thames. Continuous filtration and chlorination of the water is carried out the whole period the pools are in use, the period of complete turnover of both pools being 3.5 hours. The pH value of the water is maintained between 7.6 and 7.8 while the chlorine content is maintained at 1.0 to 1.2 parts per million As soon as the last bather leaves the pool at the end of the day and for the week-end closure of the establishment, the chlorine content is increased to 1.5 (or even more) parts per million to ensure sterile water when the pool is re-opened. Wallace and Tiernam Chlorinators supply the chlorine to the water and the filtration equipment used is made by United Filters. Sulphate of Alumina is used in required quantities in the filtering of the water and soda ash, or similar, is used to assist in maintaining the necessary pH. value of the water. Hourly tests are made of both pools to see that the correct pH. and chlorine values are present. Periodical bacteriological examination of the water is carried out by visiting pathologists from the London County Council Public Health Department Pathological Services. The water is maintained in such sterile condition that it is not necessary to empty the pools. However, as the large pool is closed during the winter season, and has to be drained down, the contents of the small pool are used to thoroughly wash out the filters servicing this pool, and then, 50,000 gallons of water from the large pool is filtered through both sets of filters into the small pool. This, in effect, means that both pools are emptied down each year. While the pools are empty opportunity is taken to thoroughly scour all sections of the pool steps that are under water, and all glazed tiling cleaned down with an abrasive powder. 4C SECTION C HOUSING Details of new housing accommodation completed in Borough during 1963 are as follows Poplar Borough Council 42 dwellings London County Council 214 dwellings The number of families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 31st December, 1963 was as follows Type of dwelling No. of Let tings Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,058 Post-war Council houses and flats 1,734 Temporary bungalows 330 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 171 Acquired properties 153 Other properties 6 TOTAL PROPERTIES 3,452 41 BENT ACT, 1957.

UNSOUND FOOD. The Council's Food Inspector is called upon to pass judgement of fitness on great quantities of food. Frequently large and valuable stocks are involved. Among special lots of food examined during the year were the following: Detailed overleaf: 48 49 UNSOUND FOOD (Contd.)

The bulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned and destroyed by the Borough Engineer’ s refuse disposal service as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned, arrangements may be made under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch or manure making FOOD FOR EXPORT. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 53 inspections were made of foods exported from the district: 53 certificates of purity were issued FOOD POISONING - (See Infectious Diseases).

Od. 50 SECTION E INFECTIOUS DISEASE The total number of corrected notifications of Infectious diseases for 1963 was 1125 as compared with 418 for the previous year This increase was mainly due to the rise in the number of cases of measles notified. ANTHRAX, During the year a case of malignant pustule (cutaneous anthrax) occurred in a male dockside worker employed on a wharf handling general merchandise which included a variety of imported animal products - dried bones, hides, hooves and horns and bone meal A few days after handling bagged bone meal he developed a lesion on the right side of his neck, thought to be Erysipelas. In hospital anthrax was diagnosed, he became a very sick man but eventually made a complete recovery. It has long been considered that these animal products from certain countries were suspect in this respect Imports of these commodities are sporadic. It was ascertained that over a period of six months this particular wharf handled the cargoes from eleven ships from five countries, East Africa, India, Lebanon, Pakistan and Australia Some of the material from the last named was "sterilized bone flour". Material from the other countries was highly suspect. The breakdown and despatch of cargoes was quite haphazard and depended on sales by the importers - some was even advertised for sale in bulk,in a national gardening paper. With the co-operation of the Public Health Laboratory Service samples were taken of all cargoes and wharf sweepings over a period, but with negative result. DIPHTHERIA. There was no confirmed case of diphtheria in the Borough during the year. DYSENTERY. The total of confirmed cases of dysentery was 63. of which number43 were children of five years and under. The majority of cases were isolated outbreaks not connected. Only in a minority of cases was the source discovered. FOOD POISONING. 28 confirmed individual cases were notified during the year as compared with the total of 17 for 1962. There were no outbreaks. HANSEN"S DISEASE. The case reported last year, admitted to the Jordan Hospital, was discharged home in June, 51 During his stay he developed a Type I reaction following which his B. I. changed from 4+ to 2+ the bacilli now being all granular.He is to continue treatment as an out-patient at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. MEASLES. The cyclic nature of this disease is clearly illustrated by the totals for the past four years of cases notified 1963 797 1962 232 1961 1,333 1960 247 POLIOMYELITIS. There was one case of non-paralytic poliomyelitis notified to the Department during the year. TYPHOID. (1) A known carrier of typhoid phage type E. 1, an elderly woman previously known to have infected some of her grandchildren, was kept under surveillance. All results were posivitive. Two further grandchildren, a boy of 9 years and a girl of 2 years (a newly born baby at the time of the previous outbreak) were both infected; both made uneventful recoveries. (2) A married woman admitted to a local general hospital was discovered after one week, to be suffering from typhoid phage type Ell. As a result of the delay in receiving appropriate treatment until admission to an Infectious Diseases Hospital, she had a stormy passage with several relapses and ultimately became a carrier: fortunately there were no secondary cases in the first hospital. The source of infection was her husband who contracted typhoid during the period of, although not actually involved in, the Croydon Epidemic 1939. The husband is alleged to have told doctors that he had had typhoid in 1939 and that his wife's symptons were similar to his own! In the intervening period he had been unaware that he was a carrier. Had the husband's story been heeded, this woman should not have been admitted to a general hospital and would, in all probability, not have developed a carrier state. Both have been kept under surveillance and were found to continue to excrete the organism 52 TABLE IX TUBERCULOSIS - PRIMARY NOTIFICATIONS 0 YRS 1 YRS 2 YRS 5 YRS 10 YRS 15 YRS 20 YRS 25 YRS 35 YRS 45 YRS 55 YRS 65 YRS 75 YRS TOTAL RESPI RATORY MALES - - 2 - - 1 " 3 3 7 6 3 1 26 RESPlRATORY FEMALES - - 1 - - " 3 4 3 5 - 1 - 17 NON-RESPIRATORY MALES - - 1 - " 1 1 1 - 1 " - 5 NON-RESP i RATORY FEMALES • " ~ ~ - 1 - 1 2 - - - - 4 In addition 57 other cases were added to the register as a result of information received from the following sources: Transfers from other areas 57 During the year 8 deaths were certified as due to tuberculosis.

The distribution of health education literature and information on a wide variety of subjects continued throughout the year. Each month 1,000 copies of Better Health", the journal of the Central Council for Health Education, was distributed among old people" s clubs, youth clubs and voluntary organisations, while copies were available to the general public at libraries and other council establishments, free of charge. Constant check by Public Health Inspectors was kept of food premises and market stalls which displayed food, and from which food was sold. Zdvice and assistance was given on hygiene matters, and from time to time circulars were sent to various sections of the food trades, bringing to their notice matters which were of interest and importance to public health, Health Education posters were on all public buildings and notice boards, and many voluntary organisations exhibited posters on their premises. “Poplar News”, the Council's public relations magazine, provided a valuable means of communication to the general public, and use of its columns was made for such items as prevention of accidents in the home, immunisation against infectious disease, anti-smoking campaign. Particular emphasis was laid on smoking and its danger to health, and it is pleasing to record that considerable help in this matter has been forthcoming from youth clubs and other organisations. The Public Health staff gave lectures and talks on public health topics, and their services were available to organisations in the Borough. NEW LEGISLATION.

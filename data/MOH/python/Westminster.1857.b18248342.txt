Metropolis Local Mangement Art. BOARD OF WORKS FOR THE WESTMINSTER DISTRICT. THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THIS BOARD. Westminter. W. BLANCHARD & SONS, PRINTERS, 62, MILLBANK STREET. 1857. REPORT. 1. The Board, in making its first Annual Report, in pursuance of the 198th Section of the "Metropolis Local Management Act," desires to draw attention to the large expenditure of time and labour, necessarily involved in the preliminary arrangements for enabling it effectually to conduct the public business. These arrangements comprised the choice and fitting up of Offices; the selection and appointment of Officers: the preparation of Bye Laws for regulating the business and proceedings of the Board, the business and duties of the several Committees, and the duties of the various Officers; for the regulation of House Drainage, &c.: the ascertaining the outstanding Assets and Liabilities of the late Paving Commissioners, and the Trustees of Tothill Fields; arranging the mode of keeping the Accounts of the Board, and many other similar matters. 2. "With a view to acquire a perfect acquaintance with all the circumstances of the District placed under its control, the Board has also expended much time and labour in making careful general surveys of the whole of the Parishes, looking carefully into all matters connected with the Sewerage, House Drainage, Paving, Lighting, Cleansing, Scavenging, Street Watering, and other public and sanitary arrangements of the several localities visited ; and, still further to facilitate its proceedings, the Board has caused to be prepared by the Surveyor a Return showing the name of each street or place in the District, the length of each street and place, the superficial contents of carriage-way paved, the superficial contents of carriage-way not paved, the superficial contents of footway paved, the superficial contents of footway not paved; also B 4 the length of each street or place, or portions of each street or place, not provided with sewers, and the dimensions of the sewer or pipe drain where either of these exist. From this Return it appears, that on the 31st December, 1856, the Board had under its control more than 18¾ miles of brick and pipe sewers, about 6¾ miles of streets and places not provided with sewers; a total length of streets and places of about 25½ miles, containing 102,381 square yards of paved carriage-way, 152,624 square yards of ' carriage-way unpaved, 138,927 square yards of paved footway, and 25,390 square yards of footway unpaved. Sewerage and House Drainage. 3. Although so great a length of streets and places as 6¾ miles was found unprovided with sewers, the Board has not thought it expedient to incur any great cost in the construction of new sewers during the past year; nor will it probably do so during the ensuing year, as from the low-lying level of the greater part of the District, it is more than likely that such expenditure would be found to have been wasted, when the new main lines of Drainage for the Metropolis shall be laid down. The Board has, however, paid much attention to improvements in the Drainage of courts and small streets, among which they would instance— Parker Street, Elizabeth Place, Queen Street, Ann's Place, Tothill Court, Hugh Place, Pool Place, Carey Place, Bell Court, Church Court, in all of which new 12-inch pipe sewers have been laid down. With a view to facilitate entrance to the sewers, for flushing and cleansing purposes, the Board has caused to be constructed four new side entrances, viz.— 1 in Rochester Row, 1 in Francis Street, 1 in Bessborough Street, 1 in Ennismore Mews; 5 and with a view to the improvement of Surface Drainage, the Board has caused to be constructed 23 new gully drains. The whole of the above works, together with ordinary repairs and small works, have been executed under Contracts, at schedules of prices obtained by public competition. The Board found, after a very short experience, that the flushing and cleansing of sewers and the cleansing of gully drains would be best carried out by men in its own employ; and it has taken this important part of the Sewerage works under its own immediate control; the change of system, after a trial of nearly twelve months having fully answered its expectations. The Board has also paid much attention to the question of House Drainage, and has already caused no less than 376 houses and premises, formerly without any efficient drainage, to be properly connected with the public sewers, under the direction of its Surveyor. New Buildings sanctioned. 4. The Act of Parliament imposes upon the Board the supervision of all new buildings erected within the District, so far as the foundation levels of the lowest floors are concerned; and 29 plans for such buildings have been sanctioned by the Board, and their erection superintended by the Surveyor. Public Urinals. 5. The Board has given much attention to the question of Public Urinals and Conveniences, and has caused to be erected in the Broadway and on Knightsbridge Green, three patent cast-iron Urinals, of a design which it was hoped would be so far unobjectionable as to admit of their being placed in the most public thoroughfares. This hope has not altogether been realized; and the Board has since, in conjunction with the Burial Board of St. Margaret and St. John, caused to be erected in Great Chapel Street, adjoining the Broadway Burying Ground, another form of Urinal, upon the principle of adapting the design to the immediate requirements of the locality,—a principle which the Board believes will, in this instance at all events, be successful. 6 The Board also caused to be prepared by the Surveyor plans for a system of Public Urinals and Conveniences to be erected in the Broad Sanctuary, which would have combined, with the accommodation required gratuitously by the public, the convenience of a Dressing Room and other appliances for such persons as were willing to pay a small fee for the same; but the Board much regrets that this scheme had to be abandoned, in consequence of the conditions imposed by the Magistrates of the County of Middlesex, to whom the site in question belongs. Street Paving and Road Repairs. 6. In addition to the periodical coatings required for the macadamized roads, and the ordinary repairs and small works, the Board has chiefly devoted its attention to the flagging of courts, no less than 28 of which have been newly paved, viz.— Bridge Court, Windsor Court, Bond Court, Caroline Place, Eliza Place, Brunswick Place, George's Place, Chapter Place, Union Court, Carey Place, Causton Court, Hugh Place, Henry's Place, Pool Place, Carpenter's Buildings, Bell Place, St. Bride's ditto, Bentinck Place, Elizabeth Place, Cottage Place, Kine Court, New Court, Amelia Place, Ann's Place, Bond Court, Phoenix Court, Adams Buildings, Clark's Cottages. The value of these works, and those of Drainage before mentioned, can only be appreciated by those who were acquainted with the previous condition of these courts and places, and who have attended to the vast improvements effected in a physical and sanitary point of view. The Board has also caused the greater part of the carriageway and footways of King Street to be relaid, replacing the defective materials with new. 7 In conjunction with the Metropolis Roads Commissioners, the Board has also made a considerable improvement at the cab-stand at Knightsbridge Green. The whole of the above works, like the Sewerage Works, have been executed by Contract, at schedules of prices obtained • in public competition. Works in progress in this Department. The repaying of the carriage-way and footways in Strutton Ground, from Great Peter Street to Pear Street, the materials for the carriage-way being taken from the Broad Sanctuary. The macadamizing of Grey Coat Place, from Great Peter Street to Rochester Row. The newly paving the footpaths, and macadamizing the roadway, of Johnson Street, from the Horseferry Road to Holywell Street. The macadamizing the roadway of Kensington Place; and The macadamizing a portion of the Broad Sanctuary, near the Westminster Hospital and the Sessions House; this work having been long much needed, on account of the serious inconvenience experienced by the Patients in the Hospital from the noise of the paved carriage-way. Gas Lighting. 7. Both as a matter of Police and of public convenience, the Board has found it necessary already to increase the number of Gas Lights in the District, by the erection of 69 additional lamps, namely— 1 in Ponsonby Place, 1 in Chapter Street, 1 „ New Court, Tothill Street, 1 „ Gardener's Lane, 2 „ Urinals at Broadway, 1 „ Cottage Place, 2 „ Garden Street, 1 „ Isabella Row, 1 „ Causton Street, 1 „ Bond Court, 1 „ Francis Street, 1 „ Devonshire Place, 1 „ Little George Street, 1 „ Eliza Place, 8 1 in Henry Place, 1 in Taylor's Buildings, 2 „ Carpenter's Buildings, 1 „ Tothill Court, 1 „ St. Bride's Buildings, 1 „ William's Place, 1 „ Duke's Court, 1 „ Windsor Court, 1 ,, Palmer's Passage, 2 „ St.Margaret's Churchyard, 1 „ York Place, 1 „ Bell Place, 3 „ Mann's Cottages, 1 „ Gulston's Cottages, 1 „ Elizabeth Place, 2 „ Ponsonby Terrace, 1 „ Kine Court, 1 „ Lack's Cottages, 1 „ Parkins' Cottages, 1 „ Kensington Place, Ken1 „ Pound Court, sington, 1 „ Garden Place, 1 „ Bentinck Street, 4 „ Rochester Row, 3 „ Upper Tachbrook Street, 6 „ Cabstand, Knightsbridge 2 „ Ann's Place, Green, 1 „ Emery's Cottages, 1 „ Deane's Place, 1 „ Union Court, 1 „ Adam's Buildings, 2 „ Cobourg Row, 1 „ Brewer's Row, 1 „ Church Street, 1 „ Pump Court, 1 „ James Street. New Contracts have been entered into with the London Gas Company for lighting those portions of the District known respectively as the late " Crown Estate" and " Tothill Fields District." Works in progress in this Department. The Board finding that, notwithstanding the erection of the above-mentioned additional Lamps, numerous applications were still made for new lights, has determined, after a careful survey, with a view to disposing of all reasonable ground of complaint under this head, to erect a further number of 54 Standard and 56 Bracket Lamps, which will have the effect of placing the lighting of the District on a thoroughly efficient footing. Street Cleansing, and Removal of House Refuse. 8. The Board, feeling convinced that any system of Street Scavenging short of a daily removal of the surface refuse would be inefficient, has now entered into a Contract for these services, by which the whole of the streets and places under its control are to be cleansed daily: which plan, with a reasonable amount of 9 co-operation from the Inhabitants, will tend to improve the sanitary state of the District, while adding to the convenience and comfort of the Public. Street Watering. 9. The Board, being strongly impressed with the desirableness of Street Watering during hot and dry weather, on sanitary and economical grounds to the Inhabitants, as well as on those of convenience to the Public, took advantage at the earliest opportunity of the powers afforded by the " Metropolis Local Management Act" to change the system of partial Watering formerly in force, for one of general and thorough Watering throughout the District: a change which the Board believes to be fully appreciated by the Inhabitants. The Board having found that, by entering into separate Contracts for the supply of water and for the furnishing of horses, carts, and labour, a considerable saving in this branch of the public service could be effected, has entered into such separate Contracts accordingly—the first by agreement with the Chelsea Water Works Company, the latter by open public competition. Sanitary Measnres, and Removal of Nuisances. 10. As the Act provides that the Reports of the Officer of Health are to be annexed to this Report, the Board considers it unnecessary to allude here to the matters reported upon by him, but desires to draw particular attention to the Report itself. By the "Smithfield Market Removal Act," 14 and 15 Victoria, cap. 61, sec. 30; and the "Metropolis Local Management Act," sec. 131, the duty is imposed on the Board of showing cause, before the Court of Quarter Sessions, against the grant of licenses to such Slaughter-houses as, in the opinion of the Board, shall be unfit for the purpose. The Board, in pursuance of such powers, having received 45 notices of intended applications, determined to oppose 17, out of which number 16 were refused by the Court. In this proceeding the Board incurred some considerable expense, as it was necessary to oppose such applications at the Court of Quarter 10 Sessions—an expense which might be avoided, if the applications for such licenses were made to the Justices in Special Sessions. Under notices and proceedings by the Board, independently of those which have been effected by private parties without the action of the Board, 859 cesspools have been emptied and filled up. 295 new waterclosets have been constructed. 594 closets, hitherto unsupplied with water, have had water laid on to them. 425 dustbins have been constructed. 307 private yards to dwelling-houses have been paved and repaired. 357 houses have been whitewashed and cleansed. 150 new waterbutts and cisterns have been fixed. A great number of pigs have been removed, as well as numerous accumulations of filth; in several instances, unwholesome meat exposed for sale has been seized and destroyed, by order of the Magistrates; numerous foul drains and privies have been cleansed, and other nuisances abated which similarly affect the public health. Partly through the intervention of the Board, and partly through the good feeling of the owners, 37 houses, of a class nearly if not quite unfit for occupation, have been pulled down. 11. While, on the whole, the Board has to congratulate itself upon the ready co-operation it has met with from the Inhabitants of the District, in carrying out the requirements of the Act, it has to regret the necessity that has arisen for placing itself, to a certain extent, in a hostile position with two parties—viz., the Chartered Gas Company and Messrs. Broadwood. In the case of the Chartered Gas Company, the Board considered it necessary to apply to the Court of Queen's Bench for a mandamus, the object of 11 which was to restrain the Company from laying down, without the consent of the Board, a new main from the Gas Works in the Horseferry Road to a newly erected gas holder in the rear of Holywell Street. This application, however, failed, from the circumstance of the Police Magistrate before whom it was necessary first to carry the matter having given his decision (as the Board believes, unintentionally) in such a form as to deprive the Board of an appeal to the superior Court. In Messrs. Broadwood's case, as proceedings are still pending, the Board will only observe that it is not without hopes that some means may still be found for amicably adjusting this matter. The 198th Section of the Act provides that the Account in Abstract and summary Statement for the preceding year, together with a copy of the Report of the Officer of Health during the preceding year, and a list of the names and addresses of the Members of the Board, and of their Officers, shall be furnished with this Report; the Appendices, containing such information, are therefore hereto annexed, and marked respectively A, B, C. 19th June, 1857.

Sir: Twelve months having elapsed since you did me the honour to elect me your Medical Officer of Health, it is incumbent upon me to furnish you with this my first Annual Report; and I trust its perusal will satisfy you no exertions have been spared on my part in endeavouring to effect a considerable improvement in the sanitary condition of the Parishes. In an appointment entailing so much in reference to the health of the inhabitants, the procedure must be necessarily varied in accordance with the pressing necessities; and although there are yet numerous important objects to effect, which will necessitate a much more extended field of operations, yet pure air, pure water, wholesome food, cleanliness, and freedom from damp and noxious emanations, must be classed amongst the most pressing requirements; and it will be seen, that up to the present period my whole time has been occupied in endeavouring to remedy the existing defects. Upon my first initiation into sanitary improvements, I was somewhat appalled at the generally inefficient state of the drainage; and speedily became aware, that to secure that measure of health the localities were capable of affording, a house-to-house visitation would be necessary— first inspecting those situations where cholera, fever, or epidemics, had been most prevalent: and when I inform you that 164 streets and 1,165 houses have been inspected, that 410 cesspools have been emptied, 456 waterclosets constructed, 361 dustbins erected, and in 357 instances the pavements have been repaired, you will see what has been already accomplished, and have some faint idea of the influence such accumulations of soil and its emanations were likely to have on the public health. In houses surrounded by an atmosphere of deadly gases, imperfectly ventilated, badly supplied with water, damp, and dirty, it was not a matter of surprise death should have made such ravages; and although the human organism is capable of existing under the most trying circumstances, yet the influence of these poisonous exhalations has yet to be appreciated in the determination of how far they may originate the development of consumption, scrofula, cancer, and other diseases, from which a large number of our fellow parishioners annually die. To remedy this evil as much as possible, great efforts have been made to convert all open privies into waterclosets; to have all cesspools emptied and filled in; and to construct impermeable drainage, so that the exhalation from the main sewers should be as limited as possible: b 2 20 and I am happy to add, that although magisterial interference has been necessary in some, yet in the majority of cases the directions of your Board have been cheerfully complied with. During my visits, frequent complaints have been made to me that, while the owners of property are put to great expense in the construction of drains, the gullies and openings in the streets emit gases of a more deadly and offensive nature than any which can possibly escape from individual property—resulting from the present very inefficient method of ventilating and flushing the sewers; and as it is probable the individual observations of the several Metropolitan Officers of Health may draw the attention of the Legislature to this crying evil, I venture to offer a few remarks upon the subject. The present gigantic scheme to rid the Thames of its impurities, and carry the soil of London to the sea, has reference only to an outlet for the present sewage, and will not meet the existing evil of decomposing soil detained in the sewers for an indefinite period, giving rise to those unhealthy emanations previously referred to. To remedy this, various plans have been proposed—one, by shafts to convey the effluvium to the summit of the houses; another, by the construction of furnaces at different outlets, whereby, the air being rarefied, a direct current would be induced towards the furnace; and a third, by deodorization. Although the first would relieve the basements, and permit, when the atmosphere was in brisk movement, a more rapid dilution and dissemination, yet I fear the canopy of smoke and generally dense state of the atmosphere would retain a considerable amount of impurity. The second would secure a rapid current of fresh air, and allow the several gullies to be trapped; while the third, or that of deodorization, is only applicable to depots of soil. Thus, in neither instance would the most desirable object be secured—namely, that of keeping the sewers empty, and thus preventing decomposition of soil. To effect such a measure, an enormous quantity of water would be required; and whether this could be abstracted from the Thames during certain portions of the tide, or, as proposed by Mr. Francis Fuller, from the sea, must form the subject of future inquiry. There can be little doubt that water exercises a marked influence in health and disease; and a reference to the recently published Report to the Board of Health by their Medical Officer, Mr. Simon, offers a striking illustration of its effects, when impure. Mr. Simon has instituted inquiries in reference to the influence of water in cholera, and his deductions clearly point to the alarming increase in that dreadful disease as unquestionably depending upon the impurity of the then water supply. Mr. Simon says, " in the 24,854 houses supplied by the Lambeth Com"pany, comprising a population of about 166,906 persons, there occurred "611 cholera deaths, being at the rate of 37 to every 10,000 living. "In the 39,726 houses supplied by the Southwark and Vauxhall Com"pany, comprising a population of about 268,171 persons, there occurred "3,746 deaths, being at the rate of 130 in every 10,000 living. The "population drinking dirty water accordingly appears to have suffered " 3½ times as much mortality as the population drinking other water. 21 "Perhaps the real significance of these totals is best shown by an "examination of the details embodied in them; and, for a convenient "instance of this kind, there has been prepared a table which illustrates, "in respect of 45 streets, the method and materials of comparison. In "every one of these details the mains of the rival Companies run side "by side, each supplying its own proportion of houses; so that, although "in any one street the number of houses may be unequally divided "among the Companies, the respective totals are equal—1,517 houses "supplied by Lambeth, 1,517 by the Southwark and Vauxhall. "Here then are 3,034 houses, with about 20,000 inmates, divisible "as it were into two populations, each the exact counterpart of the "other except in the one particular of water supply; one of these popu"lations lost 57 persons by cholera, the other 164." The foregoing truthful remarks are sufficient to throw considerable doubt on the previously entertained opinions, that the course of cholera was influenced by some inexplicable miasma; and while it cannot be denied that impure air and other adjuncts may materially influence its severity, yet it must be admitted that more fatalities are attributable to effects produced by the imbibition of that which becomes a part and parcel of ourselves, than by any external agencies. These remarks arc not simply applicable to cholera, but refer equally to the influence of impure water, both in apparent health and general disease. Although the inhabitants generally are now supplied with water from a much purer source, yet the poorer portion of the Parishes do not at present reap the advantage they otherwise would do, from the absence of covers and taps to the waterbutts, and the frequently rotten state of the butts themselves. Water being a rapid absorbent, it speedily becomes impregnated with the impurities incidental to noxious gases and aerial contaminations; and so, among the dwellings of the poor, water is and must always be contaminated, until more fitting receptacles are provided them. The method of supply is, in many instances, very objectionable, as, from the absence of any receptacle, the inhabitants are obliged to catch their daily supply in any convenient vessel—which, being stored in the already too closely packed apartments, speedily becomes tainted and unfit for drink. Although it would probably entail too much upon the owners of property to fix proper water tanks to each house, yet, where there is not any receptacle, a proper slate cistern should be erected for the use of each set of houses. The supply, which during the previous six months has been irregular and insufficient, is now, from the better arrangements of the Water Companies, ample, always presuming the duties of the turncock are faithfully carried out. The influence of foul air upon health is too well known to require much comment: it is recognized in the prevalence of fever, cholera, ague, &c., &c., in inefficiently drained localities; and when it is remembered our daily consumption averages 2,000 gallons, it must be at once apparent that all sources likely to add to its impurities must also add materially to the mortality of the district. 22 Various places have been already reported upon, where the ventilation was most imperfect and utterly at variance with health; as an example I may mention, the smaller houses in the courts and alleys are without any means of securing the duo admission of air, which, if properly effected, would add materially to the local health. This might be readily obtained, and at a small cost, by the introduction of Arnot's ventilators in the chimneys, and the substitution of a perforated plate over each outer entrance, which would thus avail for the double purpose of light and ventilation. One of the greatest evils in reference to this subject consists in the overcrowded state of the houses and their several apartments. In many instances, the air (which is breathed over and over again) is so contaminated by the odours arising from this source, together with the fumes of tobacco, &c., as to be almost irrespirable; and did I not fear to occupy your time too long, I could detail scenes of which the more wealthy portion of the Parishes have little idea. Irrespective of the wretchedness incidental to poverty; fever, small pox, and other communicable diseases, are propagated with fearful rapidity, the vitiated atmosphere and crowded room offering but little chance to the medical practitioner to arrest the course of these fatal disorders. I trust the period may yet arrive, when the size of the room shall regulate the number of its recipients. In Duck Yard, St. Ermin's Hill, and other portions of the Parishes, the houses were found to be so utterly unfit for human habitations as to necessitate their either being closed or pulled down; and the leases of others, in the neighbourhood of Pye Street, having nearly expired, a further clearance will shortly be made. I feel bound to acknowledge, which I do most thankfully, the assistance I have derived from the generality of my local professional brethren, in the information afforded me of any outbreak or prevalence of disease; and I am happy to add my belief, that in most instances it has been arrested by the prompt removal of that which appeared to be its source. At the termination of this Report I have appended tables illustrating the number of deaths in reference to age and disease, and a comparison with the previous year and the average of the previous ten years: and I am happy to find, that while in 1855 the number of deaths were 1,785, and the average of the previous ten years 1,999, in 1856 the deaths only amounted to 1,629, being 156 less than 1855, and 370 less than the average before mentioned; and as I believe this will be found to be the case in the majority of the Parishes iu London, I cannot but think it affords some proof that the general adoption of stringent sanitary measures has had its attendant results. Having during the past year given fortnightly reports in reference to everything appertaining to my appointment, I feel it would be a work of supererogation were I to reiterate all that has been accomplished in the examination of sewers, slaughter-houses, factories, schools, and places where noxious trades were carried on—examinations of food, attendances at Police Courts, the maintainance of death registration, &c. &c.—much too numerous to mention. 23 In conclusion I may perhaps be permitted to suggest, without in the least desiring to exercise any control over any Officer appointed by your Board, or in any manner interfering with the directing power of the Board itself, but solely to prevent the necessity of nearly duplicate reports emanating from your Medical Officer and the Sanitary Inspectors, that while the Sanitary Inspectors should, as heretofore, keep records of inspections and requirements open to the examination of your Committees, that they should report weekly to your Medical Officer everything which may require alteration, such requirements to be embodied in his Report to the Board. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, BARNARD HOLT. ANNUAL RETURN OF DEATHS, SIGNIFYING THE DISEASES ACCORDING TO AGE. ST. MARGARET'S, 1856. Deaths. Ages. Numbers. Measles. Small Pox.

To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the City of Westminster. My Lord and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to vou my Annual Report on the Health and Sanitary Condition of the City of Westminster during the year 1905. It is drawn up in accordance with the instructions of the Local Government Board, and contains a record of the work of the Department. Returns required by the Local Government Board, and particulars relating to Factories and Workshops required by the Home Office, are incorporated. The year 1905 was characterised by a low death-rate. In the City of Westminster the death-rates show a continuous decline in each of the last three years, As there is an increase in the number of births recorded, it is highly probable that the population has increased rather than declined during 1905 ; if this be so, then the death-rate would work out at a lower figure still. It is particularly gratifying to be able to show that the infantile death-rate has fallen during the year to 105 per 1,000 infants born, a reduction of 25 per cent. on the average of the previous ten years. In London as a whole there has also been a reduction in 1905 equal to 15 per cent., and a part of it was due to the 2 more favourable climatic conditions which obtained, but credit must also be given to the attention which is now being concentrated on the great waste of infant life which has been allowed in the past. In Westminster the improvement is greater than that for London, and it is of interest to note that this saving of 115 lives coincides with the adoption of the system of obtaining from the Registrars each week a list of births, so that the homes of mothers can be visited and advice given. It seems to be thought by some that people resent such instruction; the contrary, however, is the case, and, with lew exceptions, mothers express their thanks for the advice given to them. Births need not be registered for six weeks, and therefore the information comes somewhat late; earlier notification is required, but meanwhile, through the arrangements of the Westminster Health Society with various societies and the hospitals, earlier information is obtained with respect to their maternity cases. I take this opportunity of again expressing how much the City is indebted to the work carried out by the Westminster Health Society. One of the chief causes of death which showed an improvement was Diarrhoea, but Measles and Whooping Cough were prevalent, and a number of deaths occurred from these causes. Deaths from these diseases occur almost entirely among the poorer classes, and are due in a great measure to the want of appreciation of the dangerous character of these complaints. It is chiefly through the schools that information reaches me when outbreaks occur, but so far as can be managed each case is visited by one of the Women Inspectors, who advises the parents with regard to the danger. In many instances no medical advice is sought until pneumonia or inflammation of the bowels has set in (from improper exposure of the child), and little can be done to save the child's life. St. John's Ward is again at the bottom of the list with the highest death-rate. During the year several large buildings, housing at least 500 persons, have been closed in connection with the Millbank Improvement Scheme, and this has, to some extent, led to an increase in the number of persons in adjoining streets. The effect of a large number of common lodging houses in this Ward is to increase the death-rate to a marked extent, but, after making allowance for these the rate is still excessive. Dr. Frank Robinson, at my request, has examined the death returns of this Ward for four years, 1901-4, and has prepared a long and interesting report thereon, from which the extracts subjoined are taken. He states that, were common lodging house deaths excluded, the average rate would have been at least 3 per 1,000 lower. After deducting these deaths, it appears that Sub-districts 3, 4, 5, and 12 (see map in previous 3 Annual Eeport) yield rates over 20 per 1,000; Sub-district 5 being the highest. St. John's Ward.

The numbers in that column placed in brackets include large blocks of model dwellings. District No. 3.—This includes parts of Wood Street, Smith Square, Church Street, Horseferry Eoad, Carpenter Street, Marsham Street, Tufton Street, Eomney Street, with 10 courts. Census population, 2,841, but after deduction for common lodging houses, the mortality rates are estimated on a population of 2,750. The high death-rates from all selected causes arrests attention, the district being only second to No. 5 in this respect. There are a few small shops, but the inhabitants of the district generally are of the poorest class. The whole of the property within the area is old, and generally in poor condition. Much, though at present habitable, will in a few years become worn-out. As yet there have been practically no houses pulled down, and the high death-rate continues almost unabated, having been 23.5 in 1904 against 24.2 in 1901. 4 All Causes. Phthisis. Other Respiratory. Diarrhœa. District No. 3 23.7 3.6 5.4 1.8 St. John's Ward 18.3 2.4 3.7 l.0 City 14.6 1.7 3.0 0.5 The high rates under all headings will be noticed readily. There is a number of small, confined yards, but which do not appear to contribute disproportionately to the mortality. Certain streets, however, such as Wood Street (south side), are prominent in their worn-out state, while special attention may with advantage be called to St. John's Chambers (Smith Square), Tufton Street, and Marsham Street. The east side of the latter street is within this district and the west side in District No. 5, and the street will be considered as a whole in connection with the latter district. St. John's Chambers consists of two large blocks of old tenements situated on the west side of Smith Square, which has afforded accommodation for an average population of 400. As it has been recently closed by the County Council, it is only interesting now as a recent factor influencing the death-rate of the area in which it is situated. All Causes. Phthisis. Other Respiratory. Diarrhœa. St. John's Chambers 21.8 3.1 4.3 1.25 City 14.6 1.7 3.0 0.5 It will be seen that the death-rates from all causes exceeds that of the City by 50 per cent., while the phthisis and diarrhoea rates are about doubled. As in Tufton Street, next to be considered, there is little doubt that these figures fall far short of indicating the actual disease engendered, as the class of inhabitant is such as would drift to common lodging houses and workhouses, and their deaths fail to be attributed to their correct source. These buildings, moreover, showed a marked tendency to increase in mortality rates, the latter being 17'5 in 1901 and 25.0 in 1904, an increase of 42.5 per. cent. High as these figures are, they are not so unsatisfactory as those for this district as a whole, which are largely swelled by the deaths in Tufton Street, where the condition of property generally and the resulting mortality rates call for serious consideration. Lyon's Buildings, Tufton Street (now closed), a dark, ill-ventilated block of tenements, was a particularly bad feature of this street. Excluding common lodging houses, the average number of deaths per 5 annum lor District No. 3 has been 65 25, occurring in 209 houses, or 31 deaths per 100 houses. For the whole of Tufton Street 29 deaths in 54 houses per annum give an annual rate of 53 deaths per 100 houses, and, if Lyon's Buildings be excluded, the figures are 22 deaths occurring in 53 houses, or 41 deaths per 100 houses each year. This may be represented in tabular form as follows:— Deaths per annum per 100 Houses. Deaths per annum per 1,000 Population. Sub-District No. 3 31 23.7 Tufton Street, excluding Lyon's Buildings 41 31.6 Tufton Street, including Lyon's Buildings 53 40.9 These figures would appear to sufficiently indicate the desirability of active measure being taken with regard especially to this street. It is satisfactory to note that Lyon's Buildings have been partly closed in 1903 and 1904, its former population of 197 having been reduced by about half, giving an average population for the four years of about 148. Taking this into account, the death-rates for 1901-04 have been estimated as follows:— All Causes. Phthisis. Other Respiratory. Diarrhœa. Lyon's Buildings 47.3 11.8 11.8 1.6 City 14.6 1.7 3.0 0.5 This table speaks too eloquently to require much comment, but it should be stated that mortality in these buildings has fallen from 55.8 per 1,000 in 1901-02 to 30.6 in 1903-04, a result which may, perhaps, partly be accounted for by the diminished crowding of population on area, and partly by the closure of the worst parts of the buildings. The same observation which was made regarding St. John's Chambers is probably of equal force in this instance, viz., that as such buildings largely contribute to workhouse, hospitals, &c., the figures do not represent the full extent of the mischief wrought by them. Before leaving the consideration of this district, attention may be directed to the high proportion of tenements with less than five rooms to separate families. There are 668 separate families and 616 of such tenements, so that 92'2 per cent. of the families are residing in less than five rooms. District No. 4.—Census population, 735. With the exception of Regency and Vincent Houses, small fiats in Regent Place, the dwelling- 6 houses in this district are mostly of two and three storeys, old, hut apparently in fair condition. There are also a few shops, some works and offices. The social status of the inhabitants appears to be that of the respectable working classes, and there is some letting of apartments. All Causes. Phthisis. Other Respiratory. Diarrhœa. District No. 4 23.1 2.0 5.4 0.3 St. John's 18.3 2.4 3.7 l.0 City 14.6 1.7 3.0 0.5 It is not obvious why the average death-rates from all causes and respiratory diseases should be so high, very little short of District No. 3, where there are obviously insanitary conditions present. The individual rates from all causes for each year from 1901 are 21.7, 28.5, 19.0, and 231 per 1,000. The exceptionally high rate for 1902 contributes largely to this high average. The 1904 rate, 23.1, is identical with the average for the four years, so that conditions here cannot be said to be improving. In Page Street a few houses have been pulled down, and the number of deaths has been greatly reduced (none in 1904), but in Johnson Street the deaths remain at a high level. The mortality in Horseferry Road also contributes largely to the total, and especially in respiratory diseases and all tubercular diseases, which together constitute 11 out of 24 deaths for the period of four years. The demolition of property in this area has been on so small a scale that the death-rate is not likely to have been much affected by displacement of population. What seems more probable is that the extensive house closure in the immediately adjacent area has resulted in an influx of population, and that there is scope for inquiry as to overcrowding, which may have had some influence in the direction of increased mortality. The fact that this is one of the few districts in the Ward which contain an open space, St. Mary's Becreation Ground, should tell in the direction of lowered death-rates. District No. 5.—This district includes Great Peter Street, Chadwick Street, Monck Street, part of Marsham Street, Medway Street, Arneway Street, Laundry Yard, Blue Anchor Court, part of Horseferry Road, Anne's place, Bull's Head Court, and Monck Court. By deducting the common lodging house inmates (461) from the census estimate of 2,379, a population of 1,918 is arrived at. In spite of a population of young adults at the Westminster Training College, which should tend to lower the average mortality, the rates for all the selected causes are by far the highest in the whole ward. Within this district are three streets of small shops, of which some in Great Peter 7 Street and Horseferry Road are still in good condition, though all are old property, hut Marsham Street will be specially considered. The hulk of the people in this district are of the poorer working-classes, dwelling in old property throughout. There is a number of " Courts " and " Places," of which Blue Anchor Court consists of about a dozen dwellings of a worn-out character, which suggest strong doubts as to the possibility of a longer service as human habitations. It is satisfactory to notice that there has been a decided reduction in the number of deaths occurring in several of the streets during 1904, a reduction which has materially affected the death-rate of the district as a whole. The rates for the four years have been 43.7, 43.2, 43.7, and 27.7 respectively. Laundry Yard has an average of 5 deaths per annum, but several of the houses therein have now been closed. Marsham Street is situated in both Districts 3 and 5. The west side (in District 5) has an average of 6.5 deaths yearly, occurring in 33 houses, while on the east side (in District 3) the annual number of deaths in 34 houses is 9"25, or a total for the whole street of 16.75 deaths annually in 67 houses. If the average number of persons per house in District 5 (excluding Chadwick Street), viz., 7'5, be applied to Marsham Street, a population of 502 is arrived at, giving a mortality rate of 33.3. The houses, however, in this street are of 3 storeys, while about half in District 5 are only of 2 storeys, so that the population is probably somewhat underestimated. Still, after allowing for this, the rate must be excessive, probably nearer 30 than 20 per 1,000. The street is a very old one, and narrow, for the height of the houses. But by far the worst street in this district is Chadwick Street, which consists of 2 and 3 storey houses. The population, which is of a low class, numbers 592 in 41 houses, i.e., 14.4 persons per house, or nearly double the average for the rest of the district. Population. Houses. Persons per House. Chadwick Street 592 41 14.4 Rest of District 1,390 183 7.5 The houses are much the same size as the rest of the district. A comparison of the mortality rates give the following results:— All Causes. Phthisis. Other Respiratory. Diarrhœa. Chadwick Street 43.9 14.3 8.0 1.6 Best of District 3 32.7 3.9 5.7 1.9 St. John's Ward 18.3 2.4 3.7 1.0 City 14.6 1.7 3.0 0.5 8 In addition to structural conditions is the question of overcrowding. There are in this street 218 tenants in 41 houses, or an average of 5.3 to the family, as compared with 44 for the City. With but one exception, the whole of the lettings contain less than 5 rooms as compared with 64.6 per cent. for the City, and the one-roomed tenements actually amount to 91.6 of the total lettings. To put it in another way, of a total of 592 persons, 495, i.e., 83.6 per cent., live in single-roomed tenements. Apart from sanitation, the low standard of morality, practically unavoidable, which is implied by this state of affairs, is sufficiently obvious. There has been as yet no demolition within District 5. District No. 12.—Census population, 2,202. There are no block dwellings except Brabazon House flats. There are some shops in Yauxhall Bridge Boad and Tachbrook Street, but the bulk of the population is of the respectable working-class type, dwelling in such typical streets as Lillington and Tachbrook Streets. In Dorset Street (now Bampayne Street) and Garden Street are new two-storey cottages of a good type. In Bessborough Street and Gardens and in Yauxhall Bridge Boad a better class are housed; many houses are let in apartments. The streets are wide generally, and there are no courts except two mews of no great size, which do not contribute appreciably to the death-rates. All Causes. Phthisis. Other Respiratory. Diarrhœa. District 12 21.1 1.7 3.5 1.1 St. John's Ward 18.3 2.4 3.7 l.0 City 14.6 1.7 3.0 0.5 The total mortality is decidedly high as compared with rates for the ward and the City, but the phthisis and respiratory rates are fairly satisfactory. The rate for all causes was 24.9 in 1902 as compared with an average of 19.7 for the other three years of the period, the excess of deaths occurring in Dorset Street (now Bampayne Steeet) and Billington Street. This contributes largely to the high rate of 21.1. I find that during 1905 no less than 350 notices were served with reference to sanitary defects in Districts 3, 4, and 5 (Chadwick Street having had 46, Tufton Street and Place 34, Marsham Street 27, Begency Street and Great Beter Street 24 each, Bomney Street 22, Bage Street 20, Wood Street 18, Baundry Yard 16); that is to say, that two-thirds of the time of a male and a female Inspector have been taken up in dealing with the insanitary conditions which seem constantly to cling about parts of this area. 9 It would not be difficult to schedule several parts of St. John's Ward under the Housing Act, but in view of the extensive clearances which have already taken place and are in progress, and the extreme difficulty in finding accommodation for those persons already displaced, it has been the object of the Public Health Committee to induce property owners to render their houses more sanitary, and to endeavour to keep them up to a higher standard than had previously obtained. Under existing conditions, it is no doubt difficult to do so, but, with one or two exceptions, the owners have endeavoured to comply. A scheme is now being prepared by a syndicate to acquire, if Parliamentary sanction can be obtained, an additional area to that dealt with by the County Council in their Millbank Improvement, and the syndicate purposes to take over on lease the ground acquired by the Council. They would thus be enabled to deal with an area bounded by Wood Street on the north, Marsham Street on the west, Horseferry Road on the south, and Millbank on the east. These schemes will remove several of the sub-districts above-mentioned. The alterations consequent upon the passing of regulations by the Council with respect to the duties of the staff of the Department have been satisfactorily completed during the year. The only change in the Inspectional staff was the appointment of Miss A. M. Dick, Assistant Sanitary Inspector at Paisley, in place of Miss Byrne, resigned. Miss Dick holds the certificates as a qualified Sanitary Inspector of the Local Government Board Examination Board (London) and of the Sanitary Association of Scotland. The work of the women inspectors was at first somewhat resented by persons whose premises it is their duty to inspect, but their work has been appreciated by female workers, and applications for advice from employers are now not infrequently received. I have the honour to be, My Lord and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FRANCIS J. ALLAN, Medical Officer of Health. 13th March, 1906. 11 PART I. A. Population. The resident population of the City of Westminster has been calculated by the Registrar-General at 175,606 for the year 1905. At the census, 1901, the number was 183,011. This is arrived at by a calculation based on the assumption that the rate of decrease ascertained at the census taken in 1901 as having taken place since the census taken in 1891 is still continuing. In Westminster, where improvement schemes on a large scale are in progress, it is obvious that the risk of error may be considerable. From the remarkable increase in the number of births recorded there is strong probability that in certain Wards an increase, rather than a decrease, in population has taken place. There are, moreover, a large number of persons resident in Poor Law establishments beyond the boundaries of the City whose deaths are allocated to the City, hence these people should be added in as part of the resident population. To counterbalance this there are many persons in hospitals and hotels in the City who are only temporary residents, and in order to be exact these should be excluded. For the purpose of obtaining approximately exact figures for the Wards, I have added paupers to the various Wards in the proportion in which they were found in the Workhouses and Infirmaries at the time of the census, and deducted a proportion of the persons in hospitals and hotels, with the result that the following figures are arrived at:— Conduit Ward 5,600 Grosvenor Ward 14,900 Knightsbridge St. George Ward 14,800 Victoria Ward 39,500 Hamlet of Knightsbridge Ward 7,560 St. Margaret Ward 13,200 St. John Ward 30,496 St. Anne Ward 11,000 Great Marlborough Ward 7,000 Pall Mall Ward 3,000 Regent Ward 9,400 Charing Cross Ward 4,250 Covent Garden Ward 8,500 Strand Ward 6,400 12 There are estimated to be 81,481 males and 94,125 females in the City. For the purpose of the Equalisation of Rates Act, the RegistrarGeneral has to estimate the population of the City in another way This he does by calculating the number of persons per inhabited house at the time of the census, and applying such to the number of houses found on the rate books in May of each year. The City Comptroller has been good enough to supply me with a copy of the figures sent to the Local Government Board in 1902, 1903, 1904, and 1905, and I append them so that comparisons may be made:— 1 2 3 4 5 6 Number of Houses as defined in Local Government Board Schedule.

Probably they are both below the correct population. Births. 2,940 births were registered in the City in the 52 weeks ending December 30th, 1905. On examination, 29 births were found to be referable to other districts. Through the courtesy of the Committees of Management of Endell Street, York Boad, and the Queen Charlotte Lying-in Institutions, of the Master of the Strand Workhouse at Edmonton, and the Steward of St. George's Workhouse, Fulham Eoad, and of other Medical Officers, I have ascertained that 209 children were born the home address of whose mothers was in Westminster. The net number of births was, therefore, 3,120, as compared with 3,054 in 1904; the birth-rate, uncorrected, was 16-3, corrected 17'7 per 1,000 persons. The birth-rate for the County of London for 1905 was 27'1, the rate during the ten preceding years averaged 294 per 1,000. The birth-rate in England and Wales was 27'2, the average of the preceding ten years being 29T. It is to be noted that the number of births in Westminster has increased, which looks as if the population of the City had also increased instead of decreasing. The increase took place in Victoria, St. John, St. Anne, Eegent, and Pall Mall Wards, while the others, especially the Strand Ward, decreased. Consequent upon differences in sex and age distribution, and the proportion of married and unmarried persons in the various Wards of the City, the rates vary widely. b 14 Table I.—Showing the number of Births in the City of Westminster and its Wards (corrected by distributing Institution Births).

After deducting 1,035 deaths of non.citizens in public institutions in the City, and adding those of 837 citizens who died in other districts, the corrected total is 2,347, and is equivalent to an annual rate of 133 per 1,000 persons. The London death.rate for the same period was 15.1, and for England and Wales 15.2. The rates were in each instance below the average of the preceding ten years to the following extent: The City 2.9 per 1,000, London 2.6 per 1,000, and England and Wales 1.8 per 1,000. The following comparative statement shows at a glance the death. rates per 1,000 persons estimated to be living at certain age.periods during each of the last five years:— Age.Period. 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905.

A Factor for Correction of Death-rates, whereby differences in the age and sex constitution of the population may be removed, is arrived at by obtaining the age and sex distribution of the population of a district at the last census; after ascertaining the death.rate for each sex, at each age-period in England and Wales during the last ten years, a calculation is made of the number of deaths which would have occurred in the district had similar rates been obtained; thus a "standard" death-rate is obtained. The difference between this rate and that for England and Wales is, on the above assumption, due to differences in the age and sex constitution on the population of the district, and dividing the latter by the former a factor is obtained for correcting the crude death-rate of the district. Applying such factors (L05107 for London, 113926 for Westminster) to the 1905 rates, the figures are:— b 2 16 Standard death.rate. Recorded death.rate. Corrected death.rate. Comparative mortality figure. England and Wales 18.19 15.2 15.2 1,000 County of London 17.31 15.1 15.8 1,039 City of Westminster 16.22 13.3 15.1 993 For the four previous years, 1901.04, the comparative mortality figures were for the County 1,065, 1,100, 1,032, and 1042, and for the City 1,100, 1,082, 1,025, and 940. Table II., in the form required by the Local Government Board, shows the vital statistics of the City and five groups of districts from 1891 to 1905. I have made out this table in such a way as to maintain as far as possible, consequent on alteration of areas, a comparison of statistics for the old divisions of the City, and in Table III. I have calculated out the rates therefrom. Table IV. shows where citizens were at the time of their death, distributed according to their respective Wards. The number of public institution deaths in London was 38 per cent. of the total, in the City 46 per cent. Both these rates, as well as that for the country generally, are above the average. Quarterly Rates.—These are shown in Table VII. for the City and its several Wards, the Comity of London, England and Wales, and the United Kingdom. Deaths of Males and Females are also shown in Table VII. for the same areas. Deaths under one year of age.—In Table V. the rate at which infants died, calculated in relation to the number of corrected births, is set out for the City and its Wards. In Tables II. and III. the rates are calculated on the uncorrected births, viz., only those registered in the City, for the City and its old divisions, as formerly allowance was not made for births taking place outside the area of the division. (See comparison of corrected and uncorrected rates above, page 14.) The uncorrected rate for the City was 111 deaths per 1,000 births, as compared with 148, the average of the previous ten years. The corrected rate was 105. The London rate for 1905 was 129, the average being 153. The infantile death.rate in England and Wales was 128, being 18 per 1,000 below that in 1904, and is lower than the rate in any other year on record. A new table (X.) required by the Local Government Board (p. 30) shows in detail the ages and causes of death. Inquiries have been made into the circumstances of many of these infantile deaths, and in a good number of cases improper feeding has contributed largely to the death.rate. As nearly all the deaths 17 in children are due to causes which are preventible, it is to be hoped that the steps which will be taken in coming years will do much to prevent this waste of infant life. The provision of addresses where children are born enables visits to be made with a view to giving instructions and advice where these are required. A leaflet has been prepared by the Westminster Health Society on the subject, and several of the Eegistrars kindly distribute copies to parents; various maternity societies and similar departments of hospitals also co-operate. An examination of the particulars ascertained in 140 cases of infantile deaths shows that there had been 542 births in the same families, and that nearly half (48.1 per cent.) of the children had died.

The distribution of the infantile deaths in the City is shown in Table V., together with the rates per 1,000 corrected births. The rates are above the average (105) in Conduit with 200, St. John's with 129, and Covent Garden Ward with 149. 18 Twenty-four deaths were those of illegitimate infants.

Under most of the headings there is a decrease over the previous year, but there is an increase in the number of deaths from measles, scarlet fever, whooping cough, puerperal fever, and other septic conditions ; syphilis, premature births, digestive diseases, and various forms of violence. Cancer.—During the five years 1901-05 there have been 881 deaths from various forms of malignant growth. Divided out into age periods, they group themselves as follows:— Age Period. Number of Deaths. Rate per 1,000 Living at the Age Period. 0—25 years 8 0.02 25—65 years 563 1.18 65 and upwards 310 8.82 Occupational Mortality. In Table XI. are shown the causes of death among males and females engaged in occupation. For males the list is fairly reliable, but for women it is not so, as the occupation may not be stated in the death certificate, but wherever it has been given it has been recorded. 19 Table II (Required by Local Government Board).— Vital Statistics of Separate Localities in 1905 and 14 Previous Years.

Communicable Diseases. (1) Compulsorily Notifiable Diseases. The details respecting the 666 notifications of infectious disease received by me are set out in the Local Government Board's Return (Table XII.), which also shows the number treated in hospital as well as the number of deaths. The number of cases of each disease notified in London since 1890 are shown in Table XIII., together with cases notified during the same period in the different divisions which, with some modifications, now form the City. These figures are exclusive of duplicate notifications. The chart on p. 39 indicates the number of notifications of scarlet fever, diphtheria, enteric fever, and erysipelas in each week. A number of doubtful cases were seen by me in consultation with the medical attendant. One medical man was prosecuted for failing to notify a case of scarlet fever forthwith. The patient had been allowed to travel by rail to his home in Essex without any precautions. Small-pox.—There were 74 notifications of this disease in London in 1905; two of these were in Westminster, but one turned out not to be small-pox. The total number of persons notified as having been in contact with cases of small-pox elsewhere than in the City numbered 194, and these were kept under observation. Several persons suspected to be suffering from small-pox were seen by me at the request of their medical attendants. Vaccination.—The Vaccination Officers have supplied me with the following particulars for 1904:— Vaccination Statistics. 1904. Union. Births. Died Unvaccinated. Successfully Vaccinated.

Scarlet Fever.—There were about 7,000 more cases notified in 1904 than in 1905 in London. In the City of Westminster the number was 370, as compared with 313 in 1904, 352 in 1903, and 475 in each of the two previous years. Eight cases notified as scarlet fever were afterwards said not to be so, but, as I have mentioned in previous reports, many mild cases escaped recognition. Two outbreaks occurred in Westminster through the nature of the disease not being identified until late in the course of the complaint. In one instance a child of a tailor was found to be recovering from an attack, and other children in the house contracted the disease, and twenty-three other cases were directly or indirectly traceable thereto; probably there were many others in which the connection was not traced. The schools were in vacation at the time, but the children had frequent opportunities of meeting and playing together. In the other group the immediate cases were fewer in number, about a dozen. Scarlet fever occurred in one instance in a dairyman's house, which was separate from the shop. The sale of milk was stopped until the child recovered. The table on the next page shows how the cases were distributed, with the attack rate and mortalitv. The number of deaths per 100 cases works out at 2.8 for the county, but for the City the rate, 4'05, was higher than it has been in the previous four years. 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905.

There were 5 deaths, equal to a mortality of only 4.2 per 100 cases. The London rate was 8.6 per 100 cases (see below). Before the introduction of antitoxin, the average death-rate was 22 in every 100 cases. Notification of Diphtheria Cases Received in each Month of the Years 1901, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905. January.

Examination was made of the children in the Junior Class which was affected, and several children with suspicious throats were excluded; some old trough closets were done away with, and proper accommodation provided. Bacteriological examination was made, at the Council's expense, in 102 instances. In 24 the results were positive, in 78 negative (but in 5 of the latter a pseudo-diphtheria germ was found). In 21 instances the examination was made of material taken from persons who had been in contact with actual cases (not including those examined by Dr. Kerr at Brompton School); in two instances the organism was found. In one of these the Metropolitan Asylums Board bacteriologist was subsequently unable to find that the organism was pathogenic to animals, and so the patient was sent home together with hexsister who had been sent independently from a general hospital, to the fever hospital. Considerable difficulty appears to exist with reference to the diagnosis of diphtheria. A patient may yield pure cultures of the organism one day, and for several days, even two or three weeks after, they cannot be discovered; after a day or two at home they may turn up again. Fortunately, this is not the usual course, but the sudden disappearance of organisms in many cases doubless leads to the statement being made when the patient is sent from hospital, that he had not been found to be suffering from diphtheria, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board chronicle it in their Annual Report as a case of "mistaken diagnosis." Both the medical man and the medical officer of the hospital in the case mentioned above had acted properly, in notifying the children as suffering from diphtheria. It does not appear to be a general rule in the Board's hospitals to examine discharges from the noses and throats bacteriologically before sending them home, and in one instance a child came home, and a few days afterwards her mother was found to be suffering from diphtheria. The child was then sent on to friends at Acton, where the Medical Officer of Health at my request saw her, and had examined by the Lister Institute swabbings from the nose and throat; that from the 41 nose contained diphtheria organisms, and the child was taken into hospital there. As diphtheria is spread, almost, if not entirely, by contact of one person with another, the systematic examination of children at schools and of persons who have been in contact with cases ought to check its spread very materially. In this way the co-operation of Dr. Kerr, the Medical Officer of the Education Committee, has been very helpful with regard to scholars. He finds that when a school becomes a source of infection, it is generally among children between the ages of 5 and 8. Such children seem to have the power of partial resistance to the onslaught of diphtheria bacilli, and thus have a mild attack which does not prevent them continuing attendance at School. They are thus more dangerous to the community than serious cases, the nurture of which is early recognised. Typhoid Fever.—Forty-one notifications were received, but four of the persons were afterwards stated to be suffering from some other disease. As may be seen from the table on p. 38, this number is lower than has occurred in any previous year, and I have to point out, as I have done on previous occasions, that in the majority of cases the infection has not been contracted in Westminster. No history of any kind was discoverable in eight cases; in twenty-one instances the persons came home or to stay in the City from abroad or from other parts of England; of the remaining eight cases, one was infected while nursing a typhoid patient in hospital, and seven may have contracted infection through articles of food. The marked decrease in the number of cases during the last few years may be taken as evidence of the greater care which is being taken to prevent the consumption of sewage-polluted food. Bacteriological examination of the blood was made in twenty-two instances, in ten the result was negative, in twelve positive; but in two of these the cases were afterwards decided to be appendicitis and some other form of intestinal affection, both of which were possibly due to some organism derived from sewage. In one case cockles had been eaten shortly before the appearance of the symptoms. The distribution of the cases according to wards are shown in Table XII. There were five deaths. Puerperal Fever.—Twelve notifications were received, seven emanating from Victoria Ward. The average number of cases hitherto has been five. In addition, there was a fatal case from Eegent Ward, not discovered until after death; five of the other cases were fatal. The cases were distributed evenly throughout the year. The women in each case were attended by different doctors, midwives and nurses. 42 Disinfection was carried out after each, including the clothing, &c., of those in attendance. In four instances there were insanitary conditions existing. Two of the cases might properly be excluded from the list, as the illness was not the result of the condition ; in one case it arose from an accident fourteen days after confinement. In London as a whole there was a slight increase in the number of cases. Mistaken Diagnosis of Cases of Infectious Diseases. This question has arisen from a statement reported to have been made on the presentation of the Annual Report of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, to the effect that nearly 2,000 cases of mistaken diagnosis had been admitted during the year, that the consequent expenditure, which never ought to have been incurred, was £12,000 for the year, and that the cases ought never have to come into the hospitals. The report of the Board shows that 10.7 per cent, of the total admissions were found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the certificates upon which they were removed to hospital, the percentages being. 6.7 on the total scarlet fever cases, 16T on the diphtheria, and 25.9 on the typhoid fever cases. Examination of the reports of the previous years show that 10 per cent, has been the usual amount of error. It is a matter for regret that such errors should occur, but it should be understood that in the majority of instances every care has been taken in making the diagnosis by the general practitioner. Take, for example, diphtheria. It is of the utmost consequence to the patient that appropriate treatment be given at the earliest possible moment; yet diphtheria if not always easy to diagnose. There are several conditions of the throat of an infectious nature which look like diphtheria, and it is only by exhaustive bacteriological examination that the difference can be detected. Under such circumstances it is surely better that the sufferers should be removed at once to hospital rather than that they should be detained in their own homes, where, in the majority of cases, they would be a source of danger to others. A medical man may have strong suspicions that the complaint for which he is called in is of an infectious character, but it may be some days before the eruption appears. In the houses of the well-to-do he may take preventive measures and isolate the patients until he can definitely decide, but in the houses of the poor this is impossible, and the only alternative to keeping the patient at home is to have him removed as early as possible. 43 With typhoid fever the difficulties are greater than with scarlet fever, for several weeks may elapse before the diagnosis can be made, and it is impossible for many families to stand the expense or supply the necessary attention which a long illness demands. As a matter of fact, with few exceptions, all the cases admitted as typhoid fever, which eventually proved not to be so, were illnesses of a serious nature (nearly 25 per cent, of them proving fatal in the hospital), and they would have had to be treated in some hospital or infirmary at the public expense had they not been admitted to the Metropolitan Asylums Board hospitals. The suggestion that cases should be kept at home until the diagnosis is indisputable would, if carried out, result in a much larger expenditure of public money than is now incurred. Another suggestion is that in doubtful cases the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health should be taken. While there is no legal obligation for the Medical Officer of Health to visit doubtful cases, and the time at his disposal for so doing is very limited, it has always been my practice to render such assistance as was in my power, but in many instances it is impossible for any one to make an absolute statement at the time and the question,resolves itself into one of expediency. I find that in 1903 one of the medical officers of the Board stated that of 735 cases certified as scarlet fever, 538 were diagnosed as such in the receiving room (one of these afterwards turning out to be a mistake) and 197 were regarded as doubtful. Eventually 158 were found to have been properly diagnosed by the outside medical man in the first instance. Similarly with diphtheria. Very little mischief appears to have been done to patients thus sent in, but it would appear that what is wanted is the better provision of rooms in which doubtful cases can be placed until the diagnosis is made. The Metropolitan Asylums Board have recognised the need for this in regard to smallpox; let them see to it more thoroughly for other diseases. 44 (2) Voluntary Notifiable Diseases. Tubercular Disease.—Deaths from tuberculosis have teen decreasing in numbers since 1901. The figures for the last five years are set forth below:— The City of Westhinsteb. Year. Pulmonary. Abdominal.

For purposes of comparison with the whole of London, differences in the number of males and females, and their relative ages, have to be taken into account. This may be effected by multiplying the rates by a factor (0.89205). The figures are then:— 45 Year. Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Total Tubercular Rates. County. City. County. City. 1901 165 167 229 202 1902 161 159 223 199 1903 155 154 213 178 1904 162 136 — 171 1905 141 131 — 168 The tubercular rates per 100,000 for each ward are:— l 2 3 4 5 G 7 The City. Conduit.

I have added the figures to the tables published in my last report, showing the ages and occupations of persons who have died, and also its incidence on males and females at various ages. The death-rate for males from tubercular disease was 249 in 1904 per 100,000 male inhabitants, the average of the previous three years being 291. For females, the 1904 rate was 143, the average being 153, so that apparently the rate among males is improving more rapidly than among females. Notification.—One hundred and twelve cases were notified during 1905, at a cost of £4 10s.; in 1903, 123 cases, and in 1904, 148 cases were notified. This is a very small proportion of the actual number D 46 of cases, and in view of the valuable results which have accrued, it is a matter for regret that more cases have not been reported. The County Council have considered the desirability of taking more active measures in connection with phthisis, and have submitted two questions for the opinion of the City and Borough Councils (1) Should phthisis be declared under the Public Health (London) Act to be a notifiable disease ; or (2) Should steps be taken to make the system of voluntary cation general throughout London. The County Medical Officer thinks the second of these should be attempted, and suggests that the hospitals and dispensaries might be induced to notify their cases. I have reported as follows:— "From the experience of voluntary notification during the past three years, I am of opinion that phthisis should be compulsorily notifiable. The reasons which have led me to this conclusion are:— "(a) That the various hospitals and dispensaries in the City have agreed to notify their cases, yet the total number of notifications which have been received have been only 123 in 1903,148 in 1904, and 112 in 1905, a very small proportion of the total cases. "(h) The valuable results (removal of insanitary conditions, prevention of infection, the provision of sanatorium treatment, of more suitable occupation and assistance to patients' families, &c.), which have been obtained from a knowledge of these cases lead to a desire to extend the benefits to all cases. (c) The prevention of consumption is a matter of extreme social importance (large numbers of the working classes being reduced to poverty by this disease), and local authorities should not have to depend for information with regard to it upon a voluntary system which limits very considerably attempts to deal satisfactorily with it. "(d) The London County Council has the power itself, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, to make phthisis a compulsorily notifiable disease, but cannot do more than suggest to the Borough Councils that they should adopt a system of voluntary notification. This has already been clone by the Conference of Bepresentatives of Metropolitan Boroughs convened by the London County Council in July, 1904, but eleven Borough Councils have not yet adopted it. Possibly they have not done so on account of the inadequacy cf the method. 47 "I beg to recommend that this Council ask the London County Council to take steps to make phthisis a compulsorily notifiable disease, it being understood that only those sections of the Public Health (London) Act be applied which require notification and disinfection, and that there would be no interference with the movements of the patient. "Much assistance in dealing with consumptive cases has been given by the Westminster Health Society, and through the instrumentality of the Mayor (Lord Cheylesmore), who is also Chairman of the Governors of Brompton Hospital, arrangements have been made whereby patients attending that hospital may be visited at their homes in order to see that the conditions there existing are not inimical to the treatment they are undergoing. "Disinfection by steam and spraying of rooms was done in 49 cases; but in the majority of the. cases steps were taken to see that the rooms occupied by the patients were thoroughly scrubbed out, walls re-coloured or papered, and articles of bedding, &c., washed." Out of 62 cases in which it was possible to obtain the family history, in 25 there was a distinct history of phthisis, either in parents or other members of the family. Of these 11 had been associated with one or more ot the previous cases in the family, and 1 had been associated with a friend suffering from the disease. In addition, in 10 cases where there was no history of phthisis in the family, there was evidence of infection from association with a previous case of the disease. In 2 cases there was evidence that a previous case had existed in the rooms before. The places of death were as follows:— Pulmonary Consumption. Other Forms. Total.

Measles.—Forty-four deaths (47 in 1903, 23 in 1904) were attributed to this cause in 1905 in the City. During the year only 412 cases came to my knowledge, 390 having been notified by school teachers, 22 by medical men and others, chiefly in May, June, and July. The deaths calculated on the total population were:— 1901. 1902. 1903. 1901. 1905. City of Westminster 0.32 0.23 0.26 0.13 0.25 County of London 0 .43 0.51 0.44 0.49 0.37 As 42 of the deaths in Westminster, and the bulk of those in London, occurred in children under five years of age, it affords a better comparison to calculate the deaths on the number of children estimated to be living under five years of age:— 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. City of Westminster 4.6 3.3 3.7 1.8 3.5 County of London 3.7 4.6 4.0 4.4 3.3 The deaths were distributed as follows:—28 in St. John's, 8 in Victoria, 3 in St. Margaret's, and 1 each in Grosvenor, Knightsbridge, Great Marlborough, Regent, and St. Anne Wards. Disinfection was carried out after 36 cases of measles, but there does not appear to be the same risk of infection being retained in rooms or on articles of clothing as in scarlet fever. All the cases coming to my knowledge were visited chiefly by the Women Inspectors. Very little care appears to be given by parents to children suffering from measles or whooping cough, and generally no medical man had been called in until pneumonia or some other serious complication had supervened. Where it can be managed, it is preferable to exclude non-protected children only, rather than close a department. By this method no interruptions need take place in the studies of the elder children even if there is measles among the younger members of the family. 52 Measles. Whooping Cough. Measles.

Children coming from houses where measles exists, but who are not themselves suffering with the disease, should be dealt with as follows A child attending other than an infants' school who has had measles need not be excluded from attendance at school. A child attending other than an infants' school who has not had measles must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the first case. A child attending an infants' school, whether or not it has had measles, must be excluded from attendance at school until the Monday following the expiration of 14 days from the occurrence of the last case. Whooping Cough.—This complaint was responsible for 35 deaths (33 in 1903, 17 in 1904), all of them of children under five years of age. It was most prevalent in the fii-st part of the year, and was a continuation of an outbreak which began in the autumn of 1904, and 210 cases were notified from schools (see page 54). The fatal cases were distributed in the Wards thus:—Grosvenor, 2; Victoria, 9; Hamlet, 2; St. Margaret's, 1; St. John's, 16; Great Marlborough, 2; Eegent, 2; and St. Anne, 1.

In the latter case the husband stated that his wife frequently went into the stable and fed four horses, one of which had been slaughtered and was found affected with glanders. In the former case proceedings were subsequently taken in the Police Court by the County Council against the owners of the stables for failing to give notice that they had in their possession a horse suffering from glanders, and against their manager for having caused the animal to be led along a highway. The magistrate dismissed the summons against the owners, but fined the manager £2, with £3 5s. costs. Usually the horse is the chief sufferer from glanders, which is due to a specific microbe. The nasal discharges of diseased animals are the chief means by which other animals are infected. Fortunately, it is not common in man, but when it does occur takes the form of an acute general infection, in addition to the nasal and cutaneous lesions which characterise the disease. 56 In view of the possible risk of infection to human beings, it would seem desirable that cases coming to the knowledge of the County Council should be notified by that body to the Borough Councils, in order that persons who have been exposed to the danger may be kept under observation by the Medical Officer of Health of the district, while the veterinary surgeon is looking after the horses and stables. 1,718 cases in horses were notified in London in 12 months ending March 31st, 1905. Plague.—Notifications were received with reference to seventeen persons arrived from ports declared to be infected. They were all found and kept under observation ; they remained in good health. Cholera.—In view of the outbreak of this disease during the autumn among persons employed on the rivers and canals of East and West Prussia, and especially on the Vistula, which forms the boundary between the Austrian province of Galicia and Russian Poland, passing afterwards by Warsaw through Prussia to the Baltic, into which it falls near Dantzic, I issued the following letter to medical men in parts of the City to which persons from these countries are likely to come:— “Cholera having broken out in parts of Russia, and of East and West Prussia, bordering on the Baltic, it is possible that persons affected with the disease may come to London from these districts, there being a large Russian and Polish colony in the Soho part of Westminster, a number of peisons arriving there from time to time. “I beg, therefore, to inform you that the Metropolitan Asylums Board have made arrangements for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from cholera, and of persons who, being known to have been exposed to the infection of cholera, have developed suspicious symptoms. Application for the removal of such cases must be made to the Metropolitan Asylums Board by the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which a case occurs. “I shall be obliged if you will inform me at once (by telephone or messenger) should you be called to any person with suspicious symptoms of cholera, so that steps may be taken with a view to obtain official verification of the diagnosis without delay, and to prevent the spread of infection.” The Sanitary Authorities at British ports were warned by the Local Government Board to take all necessary steps with regard to ships coming from the Baltic ports, and in consequence notice was received from the London Port Sanitary Authority of 90 persons who had arrived from such ports, apparently in good health, and who had given an 57 address in Westminster, to which they stated they were proceeding, nine persons were also notified from other Metropolitan Boroughs These addresses have been visited by me; in eleven instances (18 persons) the persons were not found at the address given, but three of these were eventually traced to other addresses, and kept under observation. In addition, two families (6 persons) newly arrived vid Hamburg were discovered. One came from New York, and had merely changed boats there; the other came from Poland, and a child, who had been suffering from diarrhoea for a fortnight, died on the day after their arrival. As all deaths of infants are inquired into, the facts were discovered within four days of the arrival of the family. The infant's body had been buried by that time. No one else in the family had» been ill, but, as a precautionary measure, I had the premises, &c. disinfected. The ports were declared free from infection about the middle of November, but it is more than likely that cholera will re-appear in the spring. Regulations of the Local Government Board.—The system whereby a person coming from an infected port is allowed to land on giving an address to which he states he is going is not at all satisfactory. In the case of many of the persons notified as intending to proceed to Westminster, it turns out on inquiry that the address given is that of some neighbour who has settled here, and who, it is hoped, may be able to take them in, or it may be an address that they have heard some one else was going to. In the result they may possibly get a bed for a night, even if they are unknown; in other cases they never turn up at the address given. As it takes several days to come from the Baltic ports, addresses might be ascertained before embarkation and forwarded to the Port Sanitary Authority, who could communicate with the various local authorities, and have the addresses confirmed by the time the passengers arrived in port. This matter came before the Council by reason of a communication from the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Greenwich, dated the 6th May, 1905, stating that that Council have had under consideration the circumstances arising out of a case of small-pox which had occurred in that borough. From inquiries made in respect thereof it was found that the patient came from the West Coast of Africa by the s.s. "Nile;" that during the voyage at least one case of small-pox occurred on the ship, one person having died from the disease; that on the arrival of the vessel at Southampton the names and addresses of the passengers were taken as is customary, and the person referred to gave to the Port Medical Officer of Health an address at Bermondsey, which proved to be 58 misleading inasmuch as he subsequently proceeded to the Borough of Greenwich, and that it was therefore impossible to keep observation on him until after the disease had developed and was notified in the usual course; that that Council are of opinion that under such circumstances a great risk of spreading the disease arises which might possibly occasion an epidemic; that they think the matter is so serious as to warrant a representation being made to the Local Government Board ; that they have, therefore, addressed a communication to the Board urging them to promote legislation in order to make it a penal offence for a person to give a false address in similar circumstances to those above related, and expressing the hope that the City Council will see their way to take similar action. In July, 1903, I communicated with the Local Government Board on the subject of persons arriving at ports in infected ships, or coming from infected ports, and pointed out that in a large proportion of the cases of such persons reported to me as proceeding to the City, I had been unable to trace the persons at the addresses given; that very often the address was simply a bank or a club, and sometimes a Government office was given as an address; that probably in the majority of instances no harm resulted, but that in the event of their being any real danger I thought it should be brought to the Board's attention that the system as carried out was extremely defective, and that if relied upon as part of the first line of defence against the importation of infectious disease it might be a positive danger. The Board's reply directed attention to the Board's General Order dealing with the matter, and stated that it was open to the City Council to take proceedings against persons found to have wilfully neglected to comply with Article 15 of the Order. In the course of my reply to the Board's letter, I expressed the opinion that the want of knowledge of the address of such persons would debar the Council from taking any proceedings, and- I concluded by stating that I understood that certain of the Port Sanitary Authorities hand the passengers a card on which the terms of the Board's General Order were prominently displayed, and suggested that if all the Port Sanitary Authorities did not follow that practice they should be instructed to do so. In view of the fact that the difficulty of tracing such passengers from the addresses given by them still continues, the Council wrote calling the Local Government Board's attention to the facts contained in the correspondence above referred to. The total number of notifications received from Port Sanitary Authorities in 1905 was, smallpox, 194; plague, 17; cholera, 90. 59 Bacteriological Laboratory. During the year 132 examinations have been made at the Lister Institute in 100 suspected cases of diphtheria, 22 of typhoid fever, and 8 of pulmonary tuberculosis, at a cost of £20 12s. 8d. At the general hospitals bacteriological examinations are made in the laboratories of the medical schools attached thereto. The result of the 132 examinations were as follows:— Diphtheria 24 positive 78 negative. (In 4 cases Hoffman's pseudo - diphtheria was recognised.) Typhoid fever 12 positive 10 negative. Tuberculosis 1 positive 7 negative. The report of the bacteriologist is of very considerable value in assisting medical men in forming a correct diagnosis in doubtful cases, and may thereby prevent persons not suffering from an infectious disease being sent to a fever hospital. Disinfection. During 1905,1,177 rooms in 667 houses were disinfected by the Staff of the Department, 34,703 articles were subjected to steam disinfection in the City Disinfecting Stations. In addition, a number of rooms and their contents were disinfected to the satisfaction of medical men by private firms. 151 articles were destroyed by fire at the request of the owners. Disinfection was carried out after all cases of the notifiable diseases, except as regards erysipelas (in which disinfection was only performed when the circumstances of the case required it), and also after 36 cases of measles, 3 German measles, 7 chicken-pox, 1 whooping cough, 15 cancer, 3 influenza, 1 glanders, 1 Mediterranean fever, 1 cholera (suspicious), 1 mumps, and 49 phthisis. Fifty-two books were disinfected. Books belonging to the public libraries are, as a rule, treated by the librarians, a copy of each certificate of infectious disease being sent to the Chief Librarian. Shelters.—Six persons were admitted to the temporary shelters (Horseferry Boad and Dufour's Place) during 1905. One nurse had her clothing disinfected and received a bath at one of the shelters after attendance on a case of puerperal fever. The following table gives a comparative statement of the above work during the past five years:— 60 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. Houses 834 1,097 709 581 667 Booms 1,287 1,836 1,039 935 1,177 Articles disinfected 32,218 39,965 27,766 29,107 34,703 Articles destroyed 58 37 126 52 151 Books 95 24 16 10 52 Number admitted to shelters 13 20 19 39 6 Cleansing of Persons.—Under the provisions of this Act seven persons received a free bath and had their verminous clothing disinfected. Since the closing of the Denzell Street premises there has been no accommodation for this work, but provision is to be made at the new central station, and as it will probably be in the vicinity of most of the common lodging-houses, it is likely that greater use will be made of it. The Guardians have dealt with frequenters of their Casual Wards at their own establishments. Verminous Houses.—Twenty-two rooms in nine houses were fumigated with burning sulphur, and 385 articles were passed through the disinfecting apparatus. Mortuakies. The number of bodies removed to the public mortuaries in the City during 1905 was 370; 344 were taken to Horseferry Eoad, 13 to Dufour's Place. 11 to Drury Lane, and 2 to Ebury Bridge. There were 313 inquests held, all being at Horseferry Eoad, where the Coroner's Court is situated; 15 adjourned inquests were held. The number of inquests was 12 per cent, of the deaths registered in the City. Post-mortem examinations were made at Horseferry Eoad in 204 instances, and at Dufour's Place in 12 instances. Sixty-one bodies were removed to mortuaries to await burial, 35 being taken to Horseferry Eoad Mortuary, the remainder to the "other mortuaries specified above. A petition signed by over forty influential citizens of Westminster, alleging the urgent need for a public mortuary for the reception of bodies awaiting burial in the City, apart from the one already existing and attached to the Coroner's Court, Horseferry Eoad, was presented to the Mayor, and referred to the Public Health Committee, who reported to the Council as follows:— "From a report submitted to us by the Medical Officer of Health, we have ascertained that there are five public mortuaries in the City (viz., in Horseferry Eoad, Mount Street, Drury Lane, Dufour's Place and Ebury Bridge, and two private mortuaries, 61 one in connection with St. Matthew's Church, Great Peter Street, and the other with the Church of St. Barnabas, Pimlico. The mortuary in connection with St. Matthew's Church is free to all persons living within the ecclesiastical parish of St. Matthew who are entitled to Christian burial, and for those who have been regular communicants at the church, although they may not have been living within the borders of the ecclesiastical parish. Bodies are also admitted to this mortuary at any hour of the day on notice being given, restrictions being made in cases of persons having died from certain diseases. "The mortuary in connection with St. Barnabas Church is not available for public use, being primarily for the use of the poor in the ecclesiastical parish of St. Barnabas, other persons being granted leave to have their dead placed there, application to deposit a body in this mortuary having to be made to the Sister in Charge, The Mission House, 17, Pimlico Eoad. No fees are charged to parishioners, and not less than 2s. 6d. to a nonparishioner in respect of this mortuary. "We have also ascertained that there is a mortuary in connection with St. Mark's Church, North Audley Street, but that this is no longer available. "After very careful consideration, we are of opinion that the mortuary accommodation provided in the City is sufficient. "We consider, however, that certain decorative works and refurnishing are desirable at the premises at Ebury Bridge, Mount Street, Drury Lane, and Dufour's Place, with a view to adding a more comfortable and suitable appearance to the mortuaries, and thus encourage relatives of deceased persons to have bodies placed there whilst awaiting burial. "We are also of opinion that the existence of these mortuaries should be made more generally known throughout the City." 62 PART II. C. House Inspection, &c. Below is a list of details of the work done in connection with insanitary conditions in dwelling-houses. In many cases some of the work specified was in premises part of which was occupied as workshops :— 1905. 1905.

Dirty and uncovered cistern Order made for abatement of nuisance within 10 days, and 6s. costs. Removal of Offensive Refuse.—Three persons were cautioned and three were prosecuted for infringement of the by-laws with respect thereto. The latter were summoned for removing the refuse during prohibited hours, and had been cautioned on a previous occasion. Date. Name and Address of Defendant.

Fined £1 and 2s. costs. 24th October Henry Davison, 3, Princes Road, Mitcham Fined £2 and 2s. costs. Do. There was an additional summons in this case for not using a properly constructed carriage, on which he was fined 1s. and 2s. costs. Removal of Manure.—Four hundred and seventy notices were served requiring the removal of accumulations of manure. Difficulty is frequently experienced by horse owners to have the dung removed regularly. At one time market gardeners were glad to take it away, but conditions are now altered, and payment has to be made to effect its removal. The number of horses fluctuates with the season, especially in the better-class residential districts, and this also adds to the difficulty. The Public Health Committee suggested to the Highways Committee that the latter body should consider a scheme for securing the systematic removal by the Council of manure in the City. Pending the consideration of the question, the Assistant City Engineer was instructed to remove, at the cost of the owner, any small quantities of manure in cases where the owner has a difficulty in obtaining the removal. Proceedings were taken for infringement of the by-laws relating to receptacles for manure, which was shot into a cart kept standing on the public way. The Magistrate (Mr. Plowden) held that the cart was not E2 64 a “receptacle” within the meaning of the by-laws; however, the nuisance, which was a serious one to persons employed in workshops within a few feet of the cart, was removed as the result of a summons on a statutory notice heard on the same date. Plans of Drainage.—All plans resulting from notices served by the Public Health Department, and plans of all proposed water-closets, whether in old or new buildings, are submitted to the Public Health Committee, and reported upon by me. During the year 673 sets of plitns were dealt with; in 535 the work was carried out under the supervision of this Department, in the remainder under that of the City Engineer. In about a quarter of the total number amendments are required. A good deal of complaint continues to be made that the regulations of the Council are so complicated that it is almost impossible for the public to know which subject comes under the Works Department and which under that of Public Health. In almost every case, even of new buildings, the sanction of the Public Health Committee is eventually required not only as to position of waterclosets, but on many other points, and to enable certificates to be given under the Public Health Act, the Revenue Act, &c. The Public Health Committee have had the matter under consideration, but until an alteration in the law is effected, it does not appear likely that satisfactory arrangements can be made. Testing Drains.—Three hundred and twelve drainage systems were specially tested by smoke or water by the men of the disinfecting staff, in addition to those in which the test was made directly by the Sanitary Inspector or under his supervision by builders. Complaint had again to be made with reference to the discharge of inflammable fluids into drains chiefly at motor garages, and a good deal of trouble is also caused by the obstruction of traps in garages by dirt and grease. It would obviate both these conditions were these waste matters run into a sump unconnected with the drainage system. Houses Infested with Vermin.—Intimation notices have been served in respect of premises in which there were rooms infested with vermin, under the London County Council General Powers Act, 1904. The Council fumigated 22 rooms in 9 houses on account of vermin. Watek Supply. Taking the average amount of organic impurity in a given volume of the Kent Company's water during the 9 years ending December, 1876, as unity, the proportional amount contained in an equal volume of water supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board during each month of 1905 is shown in the following table, extracted from the monthly reports of the Analyst (Prof. Thorpe) of the Local Government Board:— 65 Proportional Amount of Organic Impurities in Waters. Kent. New River. Lambeth. South wark. Grand Junction. West Middlesex. East London. Chelsea. January 16th and 17th 0.8 1.7 3.7 3.3 3.3 4.0 2.6 3.9 February 6th 1.0 1.3 3.1 2.8 2.8 3.6 2.7 3.2 March 13th 0.9 1.7 2.7 3.1 2.6 2.6 2.8 2.6 April 10th 1.1 1.5 3.9 3.1 3.3 3 5 4.1 4.2 May 10th 0.9 1 '3 2.7 2.9 2.4 3.4 2.8 3.6 June 6th 0.8 1.2 2.7 2.7 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.4 July 3rd 0.7 1.1 3.6 3.3 3.0 3.5 2.8 3.7 August 9th 0.7 1.1 2.9 2.7 2.5 2.8 2.8 2.9 September 20th 0.7 1.2 2.8 3.0 3.2 2.5 2.6 2.4 October 16th 1 .1 0.8 2.4 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.5 2.4 November 20th 1.0 1.4 5.2 5.2 4.0 3.2 5.0 3.4 December 11th 0.9 1.7 4.5 4.4 3.9 4.2 3.8 4.4 A comparison of the above figures with those of previous years shows that the quality of the water supplied to London is becoming more uniform in quality by reason of the interchange which takes place, and also on account of the more extensive use of stored water during times of flood. There are yet startling differences in the water supplied to some districts, although all the Thames supplies are taken from the river within a very short distance of one another, but doubtless these differences will disappear as the Water Board gets into proper working order. During the winter months the average proportion of organic matter was fairly high in the West Middlesex and Chelsea waters, but Prof. Thorpe thinks on the whole the general quality of the water was good for the time of year. The year 1905 was exceptionally dry, but the geographical distribution of the rainfall was not uniform; in London the amount which fell was about 90 per cent, of the average, in the Thames and Lea Valleys about 80 per cent.; 22'9 inches fell in London (Camden Square), the average of the previous 30 years being 25T6. The total at the Westminster station (Victoria Street) was 2244. March, June, and November were the wettest months, while February and December were the driest. were the driest. The rainfall recorded in Westminster in each month was:— January 1.15 inches May 1.10 inches September 1.49 inches February 0.70 „ June 4.61 „ October 1.41 „ March 3.27 „ July 1.15 „ November 3.08 „ April 1.55 „ August 2.51 „ December 0.74 „ Applications were received for 11 certificates that the water supply of 15 new buildings was sufficient, and were granted in each instance; 214 notices of the withdrawal of water supply were received from the Water Companies, and in 76 instances it was reinstated. A closing order was made in respect of one house in consequence of the absence of water supply. 66 Common Lodging-houses. Ninety-seven deaths occurred in 1905 in the common lodging-houses in the City. Forty-six of these were attributed to St. John's Ward, 22 to the Strand, 17 to Covent Garden, 8 to Regent, and 4 to St. Anne's Ward. Eighty-seven were men, and the causes of death were—consumption 32, respiratory diseases 13, cancer 11, heart disease 9, kidney diseases 3, small-pox 1, and other complaints 15. Ten were women, and death was due to—consumption 2, respiratory disease 3, other causes 2. The accommodation in this class of dwelling is for 2,118 men and 75 women. The following report presented by me may be included here:— "Night Inspection of London.—On the night of the 17th February 1 made an inspection of parts of the City of Westminster between midnight and 4.30 a.m. This was done as part of a scheme initiated by the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council to ascertain the number of homeless persons throughout London, in which the various Borough Officers were invited to co-operate. With the assistance of Dr. Frank Bobinson and several of the County Council inspectors, a considerable portion of Westminster was examined with the above object, but in the Strand, Covent Garden, Cliaring Cross, Begent, Great Marlborough, and St. Anne's Wards I was able also to make an examination of a number of houses with respect to which complaints have been made from time to time, that the staircases were used at night as sleeping places. On a previous occasion when I made a similar inspection I found a few persons, but this time no one was found in such places. On the former occasion many tailors were found at work, but none were discovered on this inspection. Although a fine night, the streets were remarkably clear of persons, only 57 men and 3 women being noted. No one was found on the Embankment between 2 and 3 a.m. We visited the Salvation Army Shelter in Wych Street, and found 827 men and 39 women receiving food, and the Church Army Tents in Clare Market, in which were 300 men, who were, or had been, chopping wood. These latter receive one meal on entering and another on leaving, and were given tickets for beds in Common Lodging Houses on the following night. Sixty-four of the men who were receiving food from the Salvation Army Shelter were subsequently admitted to their lodging-house in Millbank Street. "Sir Shirley Murphy informs me that in the whole of London 1,869 men and 312 women were found, and of these 1,212 men and 51 women were in the City of Westminster. A large number of those were recognised as regular Common Lodging House customers, and a few were not homeless, but, being in destitute circumstances, were 67 attracted by the chance of a free meal. We were permitted to interview 318 men, and elicited that 277 were Londoners, but very few had been born or lived in Westminster, except in Common Lodging Houses. They were evidently drawn from all parts of London. The majority were able to work, and a considerable proportion appeared desirous of obtaining it. "During the same night there were 21,611 men, 2,045 women, and 34 children in Common Lodging Houses and Shelters in the whole of London; 1,600 of these had been given tickets for their lodging by the Church Army, so that during that week there were probably about 3,700 homeless persons. There were, however, vacancies on this night for 4,672 men and 918 women in the Common Lodging Houses and Shelters, so there was ample accommodation for all the persons found out of doors, had they possessed the means; 988 had applied for admission, but were refused in 742 instances for want of money, but there was vacant accommodation on the same night for 337 men, 213 women, and 117 women and children in Casual Wards." Houses Let in Lodgings. The demolition of property which continues, especially in St. John's Ward, continues to reduce the number of houses on the register. At the end of 1904 the number was 1,659, 12 were added in 1905, and 30 removed, leaving 1,641 at the end of the year. 1,578 visits were paid, nearly all by the women Inspectors. Revenue Act. Applications have been received by me in respect of 19 sets of premises, including in them 141 separate tenements. These have been inspected by me, with the result that the certificate was granted in each instance (in 7 of these the granting of the certificate was deferred until various works were carried out). The premises in which the tenements are situated for which application was made are as follows:— 83, Vincent Square. Savoy Court. 18, Maddox Street. 7, Ingest re Place. St. James' Dwellings. Carlton Chambers, Regent Street. Estiil House, Mercer Street. 3 and 4, King Street, W.C. Westminster Mansions. 9, Henrietta Street. Albany Chambers. Queen's Mansions, W.C. Morpeth Mansions. Carlisle Mansions. Edinburgh Mansions. Ashley Gardens. Lyric Chambers. St. Stephen's Mansions, Smith Square. 36, Eomney Street. 63 and 66, St. James' Eesidences. 68 Smoke Prevention. The City is divided into two parts for purposes of smoke inspection, under Inspectors McNair and Williams. The following is a summary of the work done in connection therewith:— North District.

Section 132 of the Factory and Workshops Act directs that " The Medical Officer of Health of every District Council shall in his annual report to them report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State," and forms have been supplied giving a summary of what is required. It is, however, a matter of difficulty to apportion work, especially as workshops and dwellings are so intermingled. The following shows the state of the registers at the end of 1905:— Number. Number of Inspections. Laundries 30 62 Bakehouses 98 249 Other workshops 2,357 1,555 Places where food is prepared for sale 666 1,500 Other work places 10 30 3,161 3,396 There are undoubtedly many more workshops in the City; they are gradually being discovered, but at the same time the occupation of places already on the register is constantly changing. This is especially true with regard to home workers' premises. An idea of the nature of the workshops in which women are employed may be gathered from the following list of 837 places which came under the attentioivof the women sanitary inspectors in 1905:— Dressmakers' and milliners 395 Fancy leather goods 7 Dress agencies 3 Silver workers 2 Tailoring 190 Cigaret te workers 9 Furriers 19 Diamond polishers 2 Lingerie 3 Die stamping 2 Shirtmakers 14 Black bordering paper 1 Weaving 1 Printers 22 Oorset-makers 16 Bookbinding 3 Embroideries 8 Lamp shade maker 1 Lace menders 4 Sticks and umbrellas 4 Hats and caps 7 Upholstery 1 Feathers and plumes 4 Metal workers 3 Laundries 30 Various trades 34 Hairdressers and costumiers 35 70 Since the appointment of two Women Inspectors by the Council, it has been possible to overtake the work of supervision required by t'ne Factory and Workshops Acts to a considerable extent and with much beneficial effect. From the Table below it will be seen the defects which have been found and remedied during the year; but this is not a complete list, as many defects in connection with houses in which work-places are situate have been included in the list given under "House Inspections." 97 complaints with regard to 134 matters were notified by the Home Office, but in a certain proportion the subject was already receiving attention, and in a few cases the conditions complained of were not found to exist at the time of the Sanitary Inspector's visit.

Inspectors 97 Protected persons 3 Other 4 Number of workshops measured 357 Outworkers.—Firms giving out work in certain trades are required to send in a list of those they employ twice a year. Outworkers are constantly changing their addresses and their employers, so that it is difficult to maintain a correct register. A new Order was issued by the Home Office on 15th August, 1905, making Section 107 of the Factory and Workshop Act (relating to lists of outworkers) and Section 108 (relating to employment in unwholesome premises) apply to the following classes of work:— (a) The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing, and repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto. (b) The making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace and of lace curtains and nets. (c) Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work. (d) The making of electro-plate. (e) The making of files. (f) Fur-pulling. (g) The making of iron and steel cables and chains. (h) The making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels. (i) The making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gear buckles, mulliu bits, hooks, and attachments of all kinds. (j) The making of locks, latches, and keys. (k) The making of covers for, and the covering, finishing, altering, or repairing of, umbrellas, sunshades, parasols, and articles of a similar character, and any work incidental thereto. (l) The making of paper bags and of paper boxes, (m) Brushmaking, and (n) The making of stuffed toys. 72 A list must be kept in the form and with the particulars specified . . . in the factory or workshop or place from which the work is given out, and must be open to inspection by H.M. Inspectors and the officers of the local authority; and a copy of the list signed and dated and corrected rip to that date must be forwarded to the local authority of the district on or before the first day of February and the first day of August in each year. Section 110 of the list, which prohibits home work in places where there is infectious disease, is made to apply to the above, with the exception of (d), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j). The following table gives particulars of the outworkers whose addresses were received in 1905:— Nature of Employment. Number of Employers who sent Lists. Number of Outworkers. Addresses of Outworkers. Number of Residents in the City. Sent to other Authorities. Received from other Authorities. Tailoring 124 1,620 418 188 1,390 Dressmakers 37 327 177 49 198 Theatrical costumiers 1 19 13 — 6 Waterproof makers 1 8 3 — 5 Church furnishers 1 17 12 — 5 Gold lace makers 1 8 6 — 2 Shirt makers 9 27 11 12 39 furriers 5 16 2 3 19 Hat and cap makers 2 10 — 14 24 Brace and belt makers — — — 10 10 Feather cleaners — — — 7 7 181 2,052 642 283 1,705 The total number of lists received was 312, giving 2,921 addresses some employers only sent in one list in the year instead of two. These figures must refer to a proportion only of the outworkers employed. Very few of the employers send in the lists without being reminded of their duty in the matter. It might be of use if the Home Office called attention to the matter by advertisements in the public press just before the dates appointed for the returns to be made. Army Clothing Factory, Pimlico.—As a result of a conference last summer between the Home Office and the War Office, instructions were given for the preparation of plans of an improved system of ventilation, but apparently steps have not yet been taken to carry out the scheme. Hair-Dressers' and Barbers' Saloons.—The Council received a letter from the Incorporated Guild of Hair-dressers, Wig-makers, and Barbers, dated the 22nd December, 1904, stating that the Guild has for a long time past been actively considering the question bf sanitation in respect of the saloons of hair-dressers and barbers, with the result that a set of 73 regulations and recommendations has been prepared and agreed upon by the Court of the Guild and by the Common Council of the City of London; further stating that the City of London have been good enough to arrange that their Medical Officer of Health shall make inspections and give to the Guild certificates in respect of the premises of all hair-dressers and barbers within their district who apply for registration, and the Guild are anxious to make similar arrangements, if possible, with other authorities throughout the country. The modus operandi proposed is that when a tradesman applies for the Guild's certificate, the Guild shall send him a form of certificate as to the suitability of his premises, to be signed by the Local Medical Officer of Health or some other approved authority. The Council agreed to the proposal contained in the letter, subject to each applicant for a certificate of the sanitary fitness of his premises paying a sum of 5s. for each certificate given by the Medical Officer of Health, and also to the certificate being subject to annual renewal. JSTo one has applied yet. Offensive Trades.—None are now carried on, but in 3 instances effluvium nuisances arose from business carried on in the City:— (1) In connection with motor-tyre works from benzine and ammonium sulphide. This was in the report for 1904. Further improvements have been made in the means of ventilation. (2) In connection with cork-hat making from the use of benzine. (3) In connection with a newly-established fried-fish shop. This arose from the smell rising to the upper part of the house from the basement along two chases or channels in the wall. One of these contained a rainwater pipe and the other a soil pipe. In the upper part of the house is conducted the business of embroidering uniforms. The complaint was that the smell not only made the workpeople ill, but that it impregnated the clothes which they wore and those upon which they worked, so that the wearers of them and the customers strongly objected. The matter came before Mr. Justice Kekewich in the Chancery Division, and an undertaking was given to abate the nuisance within a fortnight, failing which an injunction was ordered. The fried-fish business was subsequently discontinued. E.—Food Supply. The food exposed for sale in shops and on stalls in the street markets has been regularly inspected every day (including Sundays). The following list shows the quantity of food condemned and destroyed during the year. The bulk of it was submitted by the owners or purchasers for the opinion of your officers:— 74 Articles of Food Submitted. Tons. Cwts. Lbs. Tons. Cwts. Lbs. Apples 0 9 0 Grapes 0 9 96 Bananas 32 3 34 Greengages 0 0 56 Beans 1 10 0 Mangoes 0 1 0 Cabbages 1 0 0 Onions 0 1 0 Capsicums 0 6 0 Oranges 9 14 0 Cauliflowers 0 2 0 Pears 3 10 98 Cherries 3 6 93 Plums 0 3 28 Cranberries 0 0 60 Potatoes 0 2 0 Currants, Black 4 7 32 Tomatoes 6 8 18 Damsons 0 10 56 Walnuts 0 0 56 Gooseberries 0 0 28 Herrings 14 lbs. Mackerel 2 cwt. Skate 3 ewts. Fish (various) 144 tins. Potted Meat 2,727 1-oz. tins; 389 2-oz. tins. Machine Skimmed Milk 37 tins. Articles of Food Seized. Pears, 14½ sieves 196 lbs.) Fined £25 and £1 costs. Pears, 14 lbs. Fined £2 and 9s. 6d. costs. Strawberries, 1 ton, 2 cwt., 78 lbs. Cautioned. Bloaters, 30 Haddocks, 18 Crabs, 35 Fined £5 and £2 2s. costs. (The crabs were examined bacteriologically and found to contain large numbers of organisms derived from sewage.) Beef, 9 lbs. in an unsound condition Fined £5 and £3 3s. costs. Pig's Head, Tuberculous Fined £20 and £5 costs. Pig's Head, Tuberculous No fine, £3 3s. costs. Pig's Carcase, Tuberculous Case dismissed. When Magistrate was about to impose penalty, defendant's counsel entered an objection that defendant had not been offered the opportunity of being tried by a jury. Walnuts.—A quantity of French walnuts submitted for inspection were examined by one of the Public Analysts for the City, Mr. C. H. Cribb. The walnuts in bulk gave off a decided smell of sulphurous acid, and the interior of several nuts gave a perceptibly acid taste. Mr. Cribb found that 011 the shells there was 0.036 per cent, of sulphurous acid (H2 S03), inside in the kernels there was 0.056 per cent. A person eating 12 kernels would be taking 1.106 grains of the acid, the maximum dose of which is 3½ grains, therefore it might be quite possible for anyone to get acid enough to produce medicinal effects. On exposure some of the sulphurous acid would disappear, while some would be converted into sulphuric acid. It is probable that after the peeling of the nuts they had been soaked in water and afterwards 75 exposed to the fumes of burning sulphur in order to give the shells a better colour—a mode of treatment not unknown in this country for other kinds of nuts, but there is nothing to show that with these the contents are at all affected by the gas. Tuberculous Pork.—In cattle it is possible that tubercle may be localised, and that, as a rule, only the part affected may be destroyed ; but in swine the tubercle extends more rapidly throughout the body. In certain cases where only the head was found, and only one gland was visibly affected, it was thought desirable to have a bacteriological examination made of the other glands, which presented a sound appearance to the naked eye. This was done by Prof. E. Tanner Hewlett, of King's College, who reported that as the result of his examination he had no doubt that these glands were also tuberculous. This supports the view taken by the Royal Commission in their report (1898), and disposes of a contention which is not infrequently urged before the Magistrate, that the affection is slight and of no serious import. In one case in 1904 and in one in 1905, Meat Inspectors from the Central Meat Market were brought forward as witnesses for the defence, but admitted that, as a rule, they examined only such carcases as the butchers might specially ask them to do. No examination had been made by the dealer, the defendants' buyer, the defendants or their servants. The Magistrate, Mr. Kennedy, commented very strongly on the want of care which had been exhibited; " every one," he said, "seemed to rely on some one else, and what examination there had been at the Central Meat Market or elsewhere had proved perfectly worthless." A large number of pigs are imported from Holland, and about 70 per cent, are submitted for examination to the Dutch Government Inspectors; if satisfactory, a label is affixed to the carcase.* Butchers' Shops—There are in the City 98 butchers' shops (at 39 of which pork is sold), 7 pork butchers, and 20 provision dealers who sell pork. There are also a good many stalls in the street markets at which meat is sold; these are generally in connection with a shop. There are 2 large pork pie and sausage factories, and 2 other places where preserved meat in various forms are prepared. These places are regularly visited by Inspectors McNair and Williams. Slaughter-houses.—There is one (14, Regency Street), which is used occasionally. It was visited 11 times. *A Report by Dr. G. S. Buchanan to the Local Government Board on the administration in London with regard to meat of pigs affected by tuberculosis has just been issued (No. 225). 76 Cow-houses.—Two cow-houses now remain in Westminster, viz., at 7, Arthur Street, Knights bridge (12 cows), and 13, Marsham Street (19 cows). The use of 28, Winchester Terrace, as a cow-shed (3 cows) has been given up. 34 visits were paid during the year. Milk-shops.—Eighty-three visits were made by the District Inspectors to milk-shops, in addition to visits at regular intervals by the Food Inspectors. The number on the register at the end of 1904 was 289, at the end of 1905, 299. In 3 instances the sale of milk was discontinued; 13 new names were entered on the register. In several instances the Council has refused to register persons applying, as they consider the premises unsuitable, and in each case the applicant has accepted the decision. The sale of milk was stopped at one shop on account of a case of scarlet fever in the family of the owner. Bakehouses. At the end of 1904 there were 97 bakehouses in the City, of which 80 were underground. During the year 2 have been built above ground (12, Broad Street and 114, Wardour Street), and 1 (76, Wardour Street) has been demolished. There are therefore at the end of 1905, 98 bakehouses, of which 19 are above and 79 below ground, but 3 of these are not being used as bakehouses. Seven owners failed to carry out the necessary cleansing work required by law, but they complied after being warned by the Public Health Committee. The Council have adapted that part of the regulations relating to the certification of underground bakehouses, which apply generally to bakehouses, for use in connection with bakehouses above ground in respect of which applications for voluntary certificates may be made. Ice-Cream Makers. Premises where ice-creams are manufactured or sold were frequently inspected during the year; there are 108 premises other than hotels and restaurants where ice-cream is manufactured and sold. In 3 cases notices were served for non-compliance with the London County Council General Powers Act, 1902; 2 referred to the storage in places where the ice-cream was liable to contamination, and 1 to the manufacture of ice-cream in a bedroom. In each instance the offender 77 was a foreigner (2 Polish Jews, 1 Italian), and on the requirements being explained at once complied. Street vendors of ice-cream were also looked after, and no infringements of the law were discovered. Licensed Premises. In compliance with a request of the Justices, the Public Health Committee decided that all licensed premises in the City where drink is sold for consumption on the premises should be specially inspected. Of these, there are 654 under 7 groups of Magistrates, viz., St. George, Hanover Square, St. Margaret, St. James, Strand, Kensington, Holborn, and the Board of Green Cloth. In addition, there are 80 off-licenses, besides many clubs. During the last 10 years the number of licensed premises has been reduced by 130, about one-third being due to the action of the London County Council in connection with Kingsway and Millbank improvements, but in a number of instances the reduction is due to the inclusion of two or more licenses under one name. Two hundred and seventy-eight notices to remedy detects had to be served as a result of the inspection of the 654 houses. In a few instances re-construction of the premises was carried out; in 60 instances re-drainage was necessary. The defects found may be tabulated thus:— Drains, defective construction 129 W.C.s, defective construction 51 W.C.s, defective ventilation 61 Urinals, defective construction 27 Urinals, defective or no flush 40 Drinking-water cisterns, dirty or defective 31 Kitchens (for public catering)— Requiring cleansing 61 Requiring ventilation 30 Cellars, defective paving 36 Basements requiring cleansing 44 Other parts of house requiring cleansing 12 Absence of dust-bins, &c. 8 Sanitary Accommodation for Customers—In 78 instances no such accommodation was provided; in 7 there was some partial provision. In 13 houses good and in 5 partial accommodation has been provided. Doubtless in several of the houses further provision will be required by the Magistrates. In 4 instances notices were served under the London County Council General Powers Act, 1904, where sanitary conveniences accessible from the street were held to be a nuisance or offensive to public decency. In one instance the structure was closed. Restaurants and Eating Houses. Four hundred and thirty-six visits were paid to hotels, restaurants, and eating-houses; 103 intimation notices and 7 statutory notices were served to remedy defects; in one case an eating-house was closed on account of the defective drains, &c. F 78 For several years the Council has had under consideration the question as to how best the condition of restaurants and eating-houses could be improved. It was hoped that the repeated requests of this Council and of that of other boroughs would have induced the County Council to take steps to procure adequate legislation, but as that body failed to do so, this Council once more resumed consideration of the subject. In my report for 1904, I mentioned that the Public Health Committee had recommended the Council to undertake the voluntary certification of hotels and restaurants. During 1905 the Council decided to do so, and eventually, as a guide to applicants, a list of requirements was drawn up (Minutes, page 570). It is based on that adopted by the Corporation of the City of London, but the certificates are only granted for a period of twelve months, and must be returned at that time it' not renewed. Certificates are also liable to revocation at any time, should the conditions be found to be unsatisfactory, after due notice has been given to those responsible to remedy the defects. An annual charge of 5s. is made for each certificate. The following is a list of the requirements referred to:— Kitchens of Hotels, Restaurants, &c.—Standard of Requirements for Voluntary Certificates. A. Construction. "(1) The kitchen shall be of a minimum capacity of 1,000 cubic feet, shall have a floor space of at least 100 square feet, and shall be in every part thereof at least 8 feet high, measured from the floor to the ceiling. "(2) The ceilings and walls shall be smooth and impervious throughout. "(3) The floor shall be of smooth and impervious material throughout, and where practicable be laid to proper falls, and be drained by suitable channels leading to a gully outside the building. "(4) Any drain under the premises shall be constructed of gas and water-tight pipes. No gully shall be within the kitchen, unless the drain connected therewith be made to discharge into a trapped inlet outside the kitchen or other room where food is prepared or stored. "(5) No drain or pipe for carrying off fœcal or sewage matter to have any opening within the kitchen or other rooms used for the preparation or storage of food. "(6) No water closet, earth closet or privy, urinal, ashpit or ashbin, to be within or communicate directly with the kitchen or room in which food is prepared or stored. "(7) Drain inspection chambers inside the building to be provided with double covers, efficiently sealed. 79 "(8) Suitable w.c. accommodation to be provided for the employees of each sex. "(9) Lavatory basins to be provided in a suitable position for each sex, outside the kitchen if possible, for the use of the employees. "(10) Provision to be made for hanging the employees' wearing apparel in a suitable place outside the kitchen. "(11) There shall not be in direct communication with the kitchen or other place where food is prepared or stored any coal or other cellar room, unpaved yard or area, which may be a nuisance or cause contamination by foul air, dust or dirt. Coals and coke for immediate use should be stored in a suitable bin with close cover. "(12) It is desirable there should be elsewhere than in the kitchen:— "(a) Provision for the storage of food. "(b) A scullery (with all necessary drainage, racks for plates, shelves for saucepans, &c.). "(13) No place on the same level with a kitchen or other room used for the storage or preparation of food, and forming part of the same building, to be used as a sleeping place, unless it is constructed as follows, that is to say:— "(a) is effectually separated from the kitchen by a partition extended from the floor to the ceiling; "(b) has an external glazed window of at least 9 superficial feet in area, of which, at the least, 4½ superficial feet are made to open for ventilation; and unless such sleeping room (if separately occupied) comply with the requirements as to underground rooms, of Section 96 of the Public Health (London) Act. B. Ventilation. "(14) The kitchen shall be properly and effectually ventilated by permanent inlets and outlets, communicating directly with the open air, in such a way, and at such a height above the street level, as to prevent the entrance of street dust and dirt. Where natural ventilation is not effective or insufficient to ensure proper ventilation without producing draughts, fans or other artificial means should be provided. "(15) Hoods to be placed over gas or other stoves or ranges, to carry off the fumes and heat, such hoods to be in direct communication with the external air by means of shafts or flues. C. Lighting. "(16) Where practicable, natural light should be utilised. Where gas is used, means of carrying off the products of combustion should be provided. F 2 80 D. Generally. "(17) No food to be prepared or stored in any place where it may be exposed to infection or contamination of any kind. "(18) Proper enamelled stoneware sinks to be provided in which to wash vegetables, &c. "(19) All tables, benches, &c., to be provided with castors or wheels where necessary, to render them easily moveable. "(20) Shelves necessary should be fitted 2 inches away from walls, and all unnecessary woodwork to be removed from walls. "(21) All requirements of the Public Health (London) Act, the Factory and Workshop Act, the by-laws of the County Council and of the City Council, and the provisions of the General Powers Act, 1902, as to ice-creams, must be fulfilled. "(22) Certificates are only issued for one year, and must be returned unless renewed at the end of twelve months from its date, and are to be liable to revocation by the Council at any time the conditions are found to be unsatisfactory, after due opportunity has been given to those responsible to remedy the defects. "That a uniform charge of five shillings (5s.) be made in respect of each certificate granted annually." These requirements are now being brought to the notice of those interested, and one certificate has been granted. The completion of the special inspection of licensed premises, many of which have a restaurant business, will now free the staff for the examination of hotels and restaurants not holding licences. The result of the inspection of licensed premises has been to bring out strongly the advantage which the power to withhold or grant a license gives to enforce improvements in the conduct of a business, and shows how beneficial it would he to require all places where food is sold to be licensed annually if found suitable. The need for control over the kitchens of those who cater for the public is far more necessary than in the case of bakehouses. 81 Sale ok Food and Drugs Acts.

Other Infringements of the Food and Drugs Acts.—In addition to the proceedings included in the above summary, summonses were also heard for refusal to sell in one instance (fine £5 and £3 3s. costs), and for absence of name and address on milk cans (3 cases, fines in each amounting in all to 18s., and 6s. costs); for giving false warranty in respect of dried milk. The net amount of penalties and costs accruing to the Council after deduction of costs paid in cases dismissed was £190 3s. Seventy-five per cent. of the samples were purchased by the Inspectors by means of agents. Milk.—831 samples of ordinary milk were taken during the year. Of these 92 (11.07 per cent.) were reported by the Analysts to he below the standard of the Board of Agriculture, but 63 samples were just on the border line, making a total of 18.6 per cent. of the samples. The percentage of adulterated is slightly below the average (11*3 per cent.), but there is a considerable reduction in the number of inferior samples, viz., 7'5 per cent., as compared with 215 per cent. in 1904, and 12 per cent. in 1903. The Analysts have graded the samples submitted to them into four groups:—Good quality, in which the fat was over 3.8 per cent.; fair quality, in which the fat was between 33 and 3.8 per cent.; and poor or inferior quality, in which the fat was between 3 per cent. (the official standard) and 3.3 per cent., or in which the non-fatty solids were between 8.5 and 8.6 (if the fat was also below 3.8). Adulterated are below the standard. The official standard is 3 per cent. for fat and 8.5 for solids not fat. District. Total. Good Quality. Fair Quality. Poor Quality. Adulterated. No. Percent. No. Pereent. No. Per cent. No. Per cent.

As proceedings, however, are not, as a rule, instituted unless the adulteration amounts to 5 per cent. it would be of considerable advantage to the public were the standard raised as regards the fat content from 3 to 3.5 per cent. Preservatives.—Two vendors were prosecuted for selling milk containing boric acid, 41 and 53 grains to the gallon respectively. Several vendors were cautioned for selling milk with smaller amounts of boric acid, varying from 7 to 23 grains per gallon. An ingenious penny-in-tbe-slot apparatus for supplying milk, invented by a Westminster tradesman, who has fitted one up so that the public may obtain milk when the shop is closed. At first, however, it did not mix the milk properly, with the result that a sample taken was found to be short of cream (19 per cent. of fat was absent). The extended use of similar apparatus will add some further difficulties to the work of checking adulteration. Sunday Samples—One hundred and two samples of milk were taken for analysis on Sundays, and of these 15 (14.6 per cent.) were found to be adulterated and 4 inferior (3.9 per cent). It had been usual to take samples on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings, but during the last month of the year the practice of taking samples on Sunday evenings was adopted, and a large proportion of such samples have been found adulterated. Milk at Railway Stations.—Sixty samples of milk were taken on arrival at Victoria and Charing Cross Railway Stations; 56 were reported of good quality, 1 inferior, and 4 adulterated (6.6 per cent.). Separated Milk.—A considerable quantity of separated milk is consigned to dealers in this City, some of whom state that they sell it to bakers. I have no doubt that in some instances it is used to mix with milk of good quality to reduce it down to the Board of Agriculture's standard. Samples of milk taken at the time of delivery at certain retailers have been found of good quality, while the milk sold by the retailers in question is always just a little above or a little below the standard—just sufficiently below to escape prosecution. As this reduced milk is sold at the same price as good quality milk, the public who buy it are being defrauded. On three occasions separated milk was taken at railway stations, and two of the samples; were found to contain large quantities of boracic acid. Penalties were obtained. Dried Milk.—The means whereby the water can be driven off and only the solids of the milk left has lately been adopted by several firms. The resulting product is sold under various names, and several samples were purchased for analysis, which revealed the fact that in some of 84 them a portion of the fat had been removed. It was disclosed at the hearing of the cases that three grades of dried milk are prepared— "full cream," "half cream," and "separated." Dried milk appears to be a preparation likely to be useful under various circumstances. Butter and Margarine.—A case is mentioned below in which two analysts found margarine in a sample submitted them, while another two pronounced the part left with the vendor to be pure butter, and the Somerset House Analyst came to the same conclusion on analysis of the third portion. Similar conditions have been noticed before by the City Analysts, and in some instances they have found that part of a roll was pure butter and another part margarine, hence if such a roll was cut up into three parts the analysis of each part would differ. It is quite possible for an assistant who is weighing up parts or rolls of butter to make a mistake and accidentally add a piece of margarine in place of butter, unless precautions are taken to have no margarine near at the time. It is not at all unusual to find lumps of butter and of margarine on the same slab at one time, and the addition of a piece of one to the other in the process of selling must be some times inevitable. Dealers ought to be required to keep butter and margarine distinct. Cheese.—Among the samples of cheese examined, certain samples of "Dutch cheese" were found to be markedly deficient in fat (see below). Up to recent years "Dutch cheese" contained a good proportion of fat, but now the cheapest qualities are evidently made from skimmed milk, and are therefore inferior. As this kind of cheese is consumed by the poorer classes, the Council thought it might be desirable to obtain the opinion of the Courts on the subject. As it was not possible to prove that there was a standard for "Dutch cheese," the Magistrate had no option but to dismiss the case. The Solicitors, in reporting on it, pointed out that the possibility of getting a conviction in cases where the Board of Agriculture have the power to make a standard and do not do so is very great. This opinion was communicated to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, who replied stating that the Board have not laid down a presumptive standard for fat, moisture, or other constituents of cheese, as the different varieties of genuine cheese necessarily contain very different amounts of fat, water and other ingredients, according to the method of manufacture employed to produce certain distinct characteristics in the finished article; that with regard to the question of whether a standard could be fixed for each variety of cheese, the Board apprehend that this course would be open to numerous scientific, administrative, and practical objections, and that it may also be 85 observed that there does not appear to be any generally expressed desire that such standards should be fixed. With regard to the sale of dried milk, the Board state they are of opinion that it might be held that such milk is "condensed milk," in which case it would be included in Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. Golden Syrup.—One sample sold as "Refined syrup" contained at least 80 per cent. of starch glucose syrup. On account of the label affixed proceedings could not be taken, but the facts of the ease were forwarded to the Local Government Board, with a suggestion that they should consider the desirability of fixing a standard for this and other articles. Olive Oil.—One sample contained twenty parts of cotton seed oil and sixty parts of Arachis oil, the analysis being confirmed by Somerset House. The other adulterated sample consisted entirely of sesame oil, but the vendor got off on the strength of a foreign warranty. Rice.—It having been reported to the Public Health Committee that rice was treated with a mixture of talc, glycerine, and wax, the Committee ordered 27 samples to be taken. On examination 11 of these were found to contain an excess of insoluble mineral matter in crystallised form. In order to give rice a glossy white appearance, some importers have it polished by shaking it up with certain powders; by this means some of the outer part of the rice grain is removed and some of the powder adheres. The City Analysts are still investigating the subject, and meanwhile, in view of the possible danger to health from consuming these minute insoluble crystals, the Council has issued a notice to traders on the subject. It is also understood that barley is similarly treated. Lime Juice.—The adulteration referred to in 5 of the 8 samples taken was the addition of salicylic acid, varying in amount per pint from 0.656 to 2.97 grains. Tinned or Bottled Peas.—Forty-nine samples were taken, and 12 were reported as free from any addition, while in 32 the amount of copper sulphate did not exceed 2 grains per pound, in most instances being below 1 grain. In the remaining 5 cases the amount varied from 2.34 to 3.04. Tinned or Bottled Spinach.—Out of 16 samples taken, all were found to contain sulphate of copper in proportions varying from 1.38 to 7.59 grains per pound. It is evident that if the smaller amount produces the effect desired, the larger must have been largely in excess. The 86 object in adding a colouring matter to spinach is not at first obvious, for the vegetable contains a large amount of colouring naturally; apparently the object is to produce a uniform colour. One of the Magistrates pointed out that as fresh spinach was obtainable in London all the year round, there is no occasion to import this tinned stuff, but apparently the cooks in some of the hotels, clubs, and restaurants find it saves them trouble to use tinned vegetables, even in summer time. In one instance (see below) a notice was affixed to the tin, stating that a small quantity of sulphate of copper had been added in order to retain the colour; but where an article of food is mixed with an ingredient injurious to health, a label is no protection. Food Standards.—In several of the American States laws have been passed requiring various articles of food to conform to certain standards, and the State purchases samples of articles and publishes the analysis with the manufacturers' name, so that retail dealers may know what they may safely purchase. Since those Acts have been passed, a marked improvement has taken place in the grade of stock. Shortly, the requirements are:— "All foods not essentially mixtures must contain no other added substances, the obvious use of which is to adulterate, cheapen, dilute, misrepresent, or otherwise modify the true character of the article in question. The word 'Compound' is not recognised as sufficient. Notice of the character of a mixture, except in the case of goods sold to the consumer in the original passage, and bearing a true formula on the front in type of a settled size. The addition of foreign colouring matter of any kind whatever, or the use of any preserving materials (except sugar, salt, vinegar, spices, saltpetre, or wood smoke) is prohibited, this regardless of whether the fact of such addition may be stated on the label." Each month a bulletin is issued, and contains, amongst other things, a list of goods examined during the month. Such an Act would be of considerable benefit here. At present it is difficult for a shopkeeper to know what adulterant, if any, is contained in the numerous tinned and bottled goods which he requires to keep. Were such a system adopted in this country, the Local Government Board, and other Government Departments having health matters under their care, might combine to issue a monthly bulletin, in which copies of new "Orders," memoranda and warnings, which find little publicity even amongst those directly interested in them, might appear, together with reports on the classes of foods sold in sealed bottles or tins which dealers cannot examine directly themselves. 87 As a result of the persistent complaints of this Council and other local authorities, the Local Government Board during 1905 set aside one of their Inspectors to inquire into the question of food inspection and food adulteration, with special attention to the "warranty" question, and it is possible therefore that something may he done to strengthen the Acts dealing with pure food, and at the same time give protection to the honest tradesman. 83 Date of Hearing.

They further stated that they had given instructions to their packers that care was to be taken that the milk was put into the proper boxes, and that this was the only complaint or proceedings instituted during the nine months they had been trading. The Magistrate, in view of these facts, thought the defendants had reasonable grounds to believe that the statements contained in the warranty were true. 22nd May Bow Street (Mr. Marsham) William Owen, 4i7, Strand, W.C.

Summons dismissed.* * With regard to this case, the City Solicitors stated that it transpired during the hearing that the defendants did not open their premises until 8 o'clock or a little after in the morning, and that the milk churn was left standing at the front door from the time of its delivery until the shop was open, probably two hours; that the churn was merely fastened with string, and, if the string was untied or cut, the milk could have been tampered with by anybody who chose to do so ; that it was further admitted by the defendants' witnesses that the milk was not stirred before sale, as it was not the defendants' custom to sell milk, and that the milk was used for making cakes. The City Solicitors urged, under the circumstances, that it was impossible for the defendants to satisfy the Court that they sold the milk in the same state as they purchased it, as there was nothing to show what had happened to the milk whilst it was standing at the front door; that the Magistrate, however, said that he was satisfied that there had been no abstraction, and dismissed the summons. The City Solicitors state that they mention these facts to show the difficulty there is in getting a Magistrate to convict when there is a warranty. 3rd November Westminster (Mr. Curtis Bennett) Zappeloni Bros., 7, Wilton Road, S.W.

The Magistrate was of opinion that as two portions of the butter seemed undoubtedly to have been genuine, he should dismiss the case, which he accordingly did, giving the defendant seven guineas costs, but at the same time, after having heard Mr. Cassal's evidence, apparently accepted his analysis and figures as correct. 24th November Marlborough Street (Mr. Kennedy) John Brooks, 22, Great Windmill Street Selling butter containing 72 per cent, of foreign fat Fined £2 and 12s. 6d. costs. 95 1906. 5th January Westminster (Mr. Curtis Bennett) Thomas Francis, 23, Moreton Street Selling butter which contained 81 per cent. of foreign fat Fined £3 and 12s. 6d. costs. 19th January Westminster (Mr. Curtis Bennett) Thomas Francis, 23, Moreton Street 82 per cent. of fat other than butter fat Fined £5 and £2 2s. costs. 26th.

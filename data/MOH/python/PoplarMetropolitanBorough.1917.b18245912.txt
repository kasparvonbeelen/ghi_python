Deaths. In the 52 weeks 2,812 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 517 deaths having occurred in the Sub.District of Poplar, 2,030 in Bromley, and 265 in Bow; from the 517 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 66 deaths of non.residents, and to the remainder must be added 464 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 915 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 2,030 registered deaths in Bromley in a similar manner, viz., deducting 1,278 deaths of non.parishioners and adding 211 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub.district will be found to be 963. From the 265 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 4 nonresidents and add 278 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 539 deaths. In dealing separately with the sub.districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II., and III., that in considering the deaths of non.residents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub.districts have to be made in respect of them. / 8 selves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2,812 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 901 deaths of actual non.residents, and 506 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2,417 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 915 deaths in Poplar included 8 illegitimate children, 6 male and 2 female; the 963 deaths in Bromley included 13 illegitimate children, 7 male and 6 female; the 539 Bowr deaths included 7 illegitimate children, 5 male and 2 female, making a total for the Borough of 28 deaths of illegitimate children.

The College, under Miss MacQueen's direction, had carried out a large amount of valuable and successful work under the Maternity and Child.Welfare Scheme since its inception, and the Public Health and Housing Committee felt that the Council would desire to record its high appreciation of Miss MacQueen's services to the Borough and its sense of the great loss sustained by her death and recommended the * For Tables of Infantile Mortality, see Tables XIV'., XV., XV'I. and XVII., pages 47.50. t The 352 deaths of infants under one year of age include deaths in outlying institutions and allow for deductions of non.residents. ** See Health Visitor's Report (page 171). Mortality rate among infants visited was 78 07 per 1,000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough, and the rate refers to those born in 1916. In 1910 and 1911 the rates were 105.69 and 115.62, because diarrhoea was prevalent in 1911. The infantile mortality rate is based on deaths occurring in any one year and births occurring in that and the preceding year. The rate of mortality amongst infants visited by Health Visitors is calculated upon births occurring in one particular year and deaths in that and the following year. The children born in 1910 and dying during 1910.11 are shown in the rate for 1910, so that the diarrhoea months June, July, August and September of 1911 affected not only the children born in 1911, but also those born in 1910 who had not yet reached one year of age, hence the higher rates amongst infants visited during the "t.vo years 1910 and 1911. 1908 .. ..

The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— " Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 1. April 5th, 1917. Sir, I am directed by the President of the Local Government Board to state that he has had before him a proposal from the Central Council for District Nursing in London that they should undertake the work of co-ordinating the arrangements made for the nursing of cases of measles and ophthalmia neonatorum by District Nursing Associations throughout London. The Board understand that the Central Council are prepared to arrange for competent nurses to be available throughout London for the nursing of these cases if the Metropolitan Borough Councils will undertake to utilise the Nurses for the nursing of such cases as need this assistance. As the Board have stated in their previous letters and circulars, they regard it as very important that provision should be made for the nursing of cases of measles and ophthalmia neonatorum selected by the Medical Officer of Health, and the Board would remind the Council that their grant is available in respect of expenditure on this subject. The Board suggest that the Borough Council, if it has not already done so, should make arrangements with District Nursing Associations in or near its District, which should preferably be affiliated to the Central Council, for the nursing of such cases cf measles and ophthalmia neonatorum. The Board would be glad to be informed of the decision of the Borough Council in this matter, and to receive particulars of any arrangements made with District Nursing Associations, including the names of the Associations, and the terms on which the Council have agreed with them to provide Nurses. I am, Your obedient Servant, H. O. STUTCHBURY, for Assistant Secretary." 13 Hitherto the Council's Health Visitors had visited cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum occurring in the Borough, and where necessary had called in a nurse from one of the Nursing Associations, whose services have been given without charge. In cases of Measles which could not receive proper attention at home, removal to the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board has been effected where possible, but difficulty arises at times owing to lack of accommodasion at the Hospitals. In view of the letter of the Local Government Board and of the necessities of the case it was desirable definite arrangements should be made for nursing at home, where necessary, in cases of Measles and Ophthalmia Neonatorum. The Nursing Societies operating in the Borough comprise the East London Nursing Society, the Ranvard Nurses, the Millwall and Cubitt Town District Nursing Association and the Nursing Sisters of St. John the Divine, all of which were willing to carry out the necessary nursing in their visiting areas at a fee of 8d. per visit, half of which would be refunded by the Locai Government Board and the Committee recommended the Council that arrangements be completed with Local Nursing Societies for nursing cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum and Measles, when required to do so by the Medical Officer of Health, at a fee of 8d. per visit. Arrangements were completed for the work to be done on the following terms and conditions:— Contracts to be yearly and three months' notice on the part of either party terminable at any Quarter Day. (In the case of the Ranvard Nurses, one month's notice to be substituted for three months). Diseases to be nursed—Measles and Ophthalmia Neonatorum, cases to be notified by the Medieal Officer of Health to the Society's Matron or Secretary or to stich other officer of the Association at such address as may be arranged. When an evening visit is required, notice of same to be given by 3 p.m. of the same day. Nurses will attend cases during the usual working hours and their work will be under the sole direction of the Society's Matron and the Medical Man who has charge of the particular case to be attended. No case to be nursed without a Doctor. The Borough Council to pay 8d. per head per visit, payments to be made quarterly. The Society to send monthly reports of the work done; no case to be charged for unless required to be nursed by the Medical Officer of Health. Necessitous Women and Childbirth—Payment of Doctors' Fees when Called in by Midwives. The London County Council called attention to difficulties experienced by certified Midwives in obtaining medical aid in cases of emergency. 14 The Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915, enables Metropolitan Borough Councils to provide the services of a Doctor when called in by a Midwife, and the Local Government Board is prepared to make a grant of half of the amount of fees paid by Local Authorities to Doctors attending cases of necessitous women. The Council was urged to make suitable arrangements of the character indicated. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion arrangements should be made, and directed the Medical Officer to ascertain the conditions under which local medical practit'oners would be prepared to attend when required in case of emergency. The Committee, however, thought the whole cost of Doctors' fees in such cases should be refunded by the Local Government Board and recommended the Council that necessary arrangements be made for payment of the fees of doctors called in by midwives in an emergency in necessitous cases, and that the Local Government Board be urged to refund the whole of the amount of such fees. The Committee agreed to a scale of fees to Medical Practitionrs called in by a Midwife in case of emergency in necessitous cases. Notification of Births Act, 1907.

In Column 12 are entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence—e.g., casuals—are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths :—- (1) Persons dying in institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (6) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurre, if known; and (d)failing this , to the district where the boby was found.

Bacteriological Examinations. Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of typhoid fever and also sputum from suspected tuberculous patients bacteriologically examined. (See pages 85, 82 and 23). Positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the medical officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals at the time when the patients are removed or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. 66 Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. Two cases of infectious disease were connected with milkshops in Poplar ; five in Broniley and one in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.* Thirty-six premises with outworkers were f connected with infectious cases notified. 7 in Poplar, 11 in Bromley and 18 in Bow— 27 measles and 9 other infeotious diseases. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Twenty-seven cases of measles were connected with out-workers' premises—4 Poplar, 7 Bromley, and 16 Bow. Civil and Military Sanitary Services Co-operation. Daily lists of cases of infectious diseases were forwarded to the various commanding officers of troops in this Borough. Billets were regularly inspected by the inspectors, disinfectants frequently supplied, and disinfection of bedding, etc., carried out when desired. Since the co-operation of the civil and military sanitary services when the Medical Officer was appointed military sanitary supervisor for the Borough under the Deputy-Director of Medical Services (London District), R.A.M.C. (T.), Horse Guards, guard rooms, etc., where soldiers are on duty and houses where soldiers are billeted, within the Borough of Poplar, were inspected as to the sanitary conditions existing and weekly reports were made to the Deputy Director of Medical Services. Blankets and beds at certain guard rooms had been disinfected; every facility of disinfection and bathing was afforded to soldiers billeted within the * Borough. Soldiers and sailors reported in connection with infected premises in each case immediate telephonic or telegraphic communication was made with the Officer commanding the particular regiment or company, eto., which was confirmed by letter. Daily lists of cases of infectious disease were also forwarded to the Deputy Director of Medical Services as well as to the Commanding Officers. Places where Army (War and Canteen) rations are prepared were under constant supervision by the sanitary inspectors. *See page 120. †Sea pagj 109i 67 DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT.

Making a total of 127,549 articles. In addition 22 articles were destroyed Suggested Additional Cleansing and Disinfesting Accommodation. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a report of the Medical Officer of Health on proposals for providing additional accommodation, in the northern part of the Borough, for cleansing and disinfesting, especially having regard to the number of cases of Itch, arising out of War conditions. The disinfesting station of the Council is midway between the northern and southern extremes of the Borough,and is adequate to deal with cases arising in Poplar. The distance is not excessive, seeing that children suffering from more serious ailments are taken much greater distances for hospital treatment. Neither Stepney nor Bethnal Grreen Boroughs have provided any disinfesting station, and the Committee were of opinion that if further provision be needed, the London County Corncil should either provide A3078 g 68 its own station for school children in North Bow, or arrange with Stepney or Bethnal Green to provide a station accessible to that district. The Committee were not prepared to recommend the Council to incur the capital expenditure and maintenance charges involved in providing additional accommodation, and recommended that the Council concur in the view expressed by the Committee, and the London County Council be so informed.

For the Fluid supplied to the Works Department a charge of id per gallon is made; the Public Health Department is credited with this amount although no actual monetary transaction takes place. As applicants now usually bring their own receptacles to the depots, there is also a very appreciable saving in the expense on bottles alone. From October, 1915, for Electrolytic Disinfectant supplied to manufacturers and trading concerns, a charge of 8d. per gallon is to be made through the Electricity Department, the Electricity Undertaking being allowed an amount of 10 per cent, for establishment charges. *See "Comments on Adverse Criticism," Annual Report, 1911. †On page f»8 it will be seen that the fluid is made of greater strength and afterwards broken down to half strength for distribution, more electrical current being used.

LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1907, CHILDREN ACT, 1908. Number of Verminous Children Bathed ; Itch Cases. Number of Verminous Children Bathed A Committee of the London County Council suggested that with a view to simplification of accounts, payment should be made by he County Council to the Borough Council, at the rate of Is. per bath, instead of 2s. per child cleansed (irrespective of the number of baths), for cleansing of verminous children. The amount of Is. per bath is the present approximate average cost throughout London. The Public Health and Housing Committee had no objection to a make to the proposal, and recommended the Council that the Agreement with the London County Council for cleansing verminous children be revised as proposed.

On 1st November a list of seamen's lodging houses was received from the London County Council in regard to which applications for licences and renewal of licences would be considered by the Public Health Committee of the London County Council on 29th November, 1917, at 108 County Hall, Spring Gardens, at 11 a.m. Inspections of the premises in Poplar were made and it was reported that there were no objections to be made to the granting or renewal of licences, so far as the Poplar Public Health Department was concerned. CANAL BOATS. For the year ended 31st December, 1917, the inspections and reports of the Inspectors respecting registered canal boats and non-registered canal boats were as follows :— Registered NonRegistered. §Mr. J. Bullock, East Combined Division .. — — *Mr. J. Johnson, West Combined Division.. — — §Mr. C. Foad, Poplar South Division — — Mr. H. J. Langley, Bromley North Division — ‡Mr. Wm.

Registers and Inspections. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 110 and 111. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. * Mr. J. Johnson reported that on each occasion when passing the portion of canal, in his district, no canal boats have been observed. † Mr. Field reported that one registered boat was visited three times. † Mr. Wm. Johnson reported that one registered canal boat was dirty and neglected. It was sent to the Wharf for repairs. § No canal in Sub-division ; deputises when necessary for other Inspectors. ¶ See Footnote, page 109. 109 The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 980, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 110 and Tables C and D, pages 113 and 114. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 165 and 166 and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 138-164. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 66. * A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 113—116) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested io give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note-books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops,* and even factories ; workshops may become factories ; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Talle A, under " Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 5 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. no TABLE A.

Totals 5 ... 3 1 126 Suggested Power to Examine Food and Seize Unfit Food Delivered to Public Institutions. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum urging that the Borough Council Inspectors should have power to examine, and if necessary, condemn food found unfit for human consumption both at the place where prepared and where delivered. The Councils' Officers may seize unfit food where prepared or offered for sale, but appear to have no power to enter an institution where it has been delivered, for inspection or seizure. The Committee recommended the Council that the Local Government Board be urged to insert clause in one of their Bills, to empower Public Health Officers to enter Public Institutions to examine food delivered, and to seize unfit food. Suggested Necessity for the Abolition of the Warranty. The Camberwell Borough Council again called attention to the necessity for amending legislation in regard to warranties under the sale of Food and Drugs, and requested the Local Government Board and the Food Controller to make such Orders under the Defence of the Realm Regulations as will preclude persons against whom proceedings have been instituted in respect of offences under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act from relying upon a warranty as a defence. The necessity for the abolition of the warranty as a defence in prosecutions under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts has been repeatedly urged bv the Council, and the Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the action of the Cambewrell Borough Council in this matter be supported. RAG FLOCK ACT. There was no reason to believe that genuine rag flock was not being used ; therefore there was no necessity to procure samples for analysis.

The work of repairing and cleansing of premises is under constant supervision, and cases of overcrowding are dealt with as they are discovered. HOUSING. TOWN PLANNING, ETC., ACT, 1909.

Nine premises were inspected under Section 17 (1) of the Housing and Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, and in the first place, as a rule, intimations and statutory notices were served upon owners under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in order that the defects might be remedied and thereby prevent " Representations " under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act., 1909, which would be followed by the Council making " Closing Orders." The following is a list of dwelling-houses inspected, and the work executed ; but in seven cases " Representations " were made followed by " Closing Orders " :— Premises Inspected.

On 16th November, 1916, the Council made Closing Orders under the Housing and Town Planning Act in respect of Nos. 313, 315, 317, 319 and 323, West Ferry Road, and the premises not having been made fit for human habitation, the owners were invited to attend before the Public Health and Housing Committee to show cause why Demolition Orders should not be made. The leaseholder did not appear and the Freeholders consented to the Orders. The Committee recommended the Council that Demolition Orders be sealed in respect of Nos. 3 13, 315 317, 319 and 323, West Ferry Road, and that the operation of such Orders be suspended for a period of six months. Demolition Orders were made on the 16th November last in respect of Nos. 311 and 335, West Ferry Road and suspended for six months which expired. The premises had not been made fit for human habitation, but the Committee considered to enforce demolition should be deferred until demolition orders in respect of adjoining premises mature. Provision of Houses for the Working Classes at the Conclusion of the War. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered circular letter from the President of the Local Government Board on the subject of the provision of houses for the Working Classes at the conclusion of the war. The President is of opinion that for the years immediately following the war it will be necessary to rely far more than in the past upon Local Authorities to provide the houses required, with road, water and drainage accompaniments. The Government recognises that it will be necessary to afford substantial financial assistance from public funds to those Local Authorities who are prepared to carry through, without delay, at the conclusion of the war, a programme of housing for the Working Classes which is approved by the Local Government Board. The Committee were of opinion the housing accommodation in the Borough is insufficient to meet existing demands, but practically the only land available suitable for an extensive housing scheme, other than by replacement of existing dwellings, is on the Isle of Dogs, where there is a considerable shortage of dwelling accommodation. The Committee were further of opinion it is undesirable for the Council to embark upon a Housing Scheme for the Borough, but that the London County Council, as the Housing Authority for London, should prepare a scheme for the whole of London. The Committee recommended the Council to concur in these opinions, and the Local Government Board be so informed. 130 WATER. Water Certificates . No water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Work Executed by Council.

Verminous Rooms.* Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the '' Intimations " which are followed, if necessary, by " Statutory Notices," more especially. as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are " in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons, see pages 73-75. 131 defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. During the year 154 Intimation Notices were served in respect of verminous rooms :— Poplar South Division 8 West Combined Division 19 East Combined Division 21 Bromley Central Division 10 Bromley North Division 10 Bow West Division 25 Bow East Division 12 Houses Let in Lodgings 49 No summonses were applied for.

Where w.c. pans and traps are fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders are written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings will be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work is found to have been executed and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. Overcrowding. Sixty cases of overcrowding were abated. No cases of overcrowding were found in workshops (see Miss Tattersall'a report, page 166) ; 111 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with bouses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Tibbatts's report, page 167), Legal proceedings were instituted in no instance. General. 6,944 communications were received, and 1,148 complaints (including 19 smoke) as to nuisances were made. 3,435 communications were despatched. Again I am deeply indebted to Mr. Shillinglaw, the principal Clerk in the Town Clerk's Department, for the valuable assistance which at all times he has so willingly rendered, adding efficiency to the working of the Public Health Department. Mr. Shillinglaw acts as clerk to the Public Health and Housing Committee, and recorded the resolutions, recommendations and reports of the Committee. I am, Sir, Madam and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. June, 1918. 138 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1917. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to lay before you my twenty-eighth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ended 31st December, 1917, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 928 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 576 Do. Canal Boats 37 Re-inspections 990 Making a total of 2,531 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,504 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 28.9 per cent of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 436 written intimations, 156 statutory, and 32 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases preceded the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable. In only two cases was it found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings to ensure enforcement. Drainage Reconstructions. Whole and partial reconstruction on old lines:— Clark's Place, 3 ; Driffield Road, 78 ; Eglington Road. 65 ; Lefevre Road, 42 and 76 ; Ranwell Street, 5 ; Roman Road. 249, 264 and 266 ; St. Stephen's Road, 18 ; Sutherland Road, 47 and 49 ; Usher Road, 130 ; Vernon Road, 16 and 51. 139 The following have also received constant attention throughout the year:— *Bakehouses 20 Registered Milksellers 32 Public House Urinals 20 Marine Store Dealers 5 Butchers' Shops 13 Fishmongers' Shops 13 Fruiterers' Shops 8 Ice Cream Shops 6 Hairdressers' Shops 14 Offensive Trade (Fat Melter) 1 Butter Blender 1 Sausage and Brawn Factories 5 Piggery 1 • Underground, 9. Food, and Drug Acta. By your direction I have submitted 102 varied samples of food and drugs to the Public Analyst for Analyses. Of the milks submitted, 49 were certified to be genuine but varied from very poor to very good quality ; 11 of the butters and 9 of the margarines contained boric acid in varying small proportions, ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 per cent., and 1 sausage contained 0.3 per cent. One of the milks was certified to be deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 3.4 per cent. The Vendor was cautioned. One sample of mixed drugs submitted was insufficient to complete analysis. The remaining articles were all genuine. 140 Places where Food is prepared. The 15 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food-stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Unsound Food. The market places have been regularly inspected. In no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a, condition as to justify seizure. Factory and Workshop Acts. The workshops, workplaces and outworkers' premises on the Register have been visited, and the terms of the Act relating to them have been required by notice, where necessary, to be complied with. No summonses were necessary, as the works were immediately executed on the service of intimation or notice. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM BOYCE Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats, Bow West Division. 141 Addendum to Annual Report, 1917. Sir, The Local Authorities (Food Control) Order No. 1, 1917. Since undertaking additional duties imposed by the Borough Council under seal on the 17th May, 1917, under the above Order, much time and unremitting attention has necessarily been devoted in an endeavour to satisfactorily discharge the duties imposed by the ever increasing complex and varied Orders which are from time to time issued, the imposition of which has gradually become a severe tax and most difficult to cope with. I trust this matter will be given due consideration should I be re-appointed. Many inquiries and test purchases have been made entailing much correspondence and special journeys both within and outside the District. Legal Proceedings. The Jam (Prices) Order No. 824. One Summons issued. Defendants fined £2 and £2 2s. costs. The Bread Order No. 189. Two Summonses issued. Defendant fined £35 and £4 4s. costs. The Beans, Peas and Pulse (Retail Prices) Order No. 511. Two Summonses issued. Defendant fined £2 and £2 2s. costs. The Oats and Maize Products (Retail Prices) Order No. 429. Two summonses issued, one of the Defendants was fined £13 and £2 2s. costs, and the other £1 5s., and £1 5s. costs. The Potatoes Main Crop (Prices) Order No. 179. One summons issued, at second hearing withdrawn, the Police having secured a conviction in the same case under " The Seed Potatoes (Prices) Order 179." 142 The Beans, Peas and Pulse (Retail Prices) Order, No. 511.

Inst. ; 1875 Act; Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Canal Boats Act, Bromley North Division. 145 Report of Inspector, Bow East Division. To the Medical Officer of Heath. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, December 31st, 1917. Sir, During the past year difficulty with the execution of sanitary work has considerably increased owing to the further steady decline in labour and restricted supply of material whereby the footprints of the world eruption are becoming more and more impressed and pronounced on the housing conditions of the Division. In the past two decades sanitary legislation and administration had been making marked progress, as evidenced by the continually increasing improvement in the housing and feeding of the masses and the returns of vital statistics, but the present belligerent interruption appears unfortunately to have reduced the general conditions of the housing of the people to a position somewhat analogous to that of about fifteen years ago—the period when sanitary administration was beginning to make itself felt and when very marked progress was made, particularly in the direction of drainage reconstruction and amendment. Undoubtedly the substantial work of that period has had a determining effect on the maintenance of the good general health of the people during the present crisis and leaves mainly defects of a more or less minor character to be dealt with. This, from a public health point of view, is of happy momen, owing to the great difficulty experienced in these days in dealing with any constructional work. House to house inspection has consequently had to be greatly curtailed and closer attention given in other directions, notably Food Inspection under the Public Health (London Acts), Food and Drugs Acts, and Orders of the Food Ministry. Inspections, etc. (See Table, page 132). During the year 1,059 primary inspections have been made, mostly in response to notifications of Infectious Diseases and complaints. Unde. 146 the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, ninety-five samples were procured and submitted to the public analyst. Five (milk) were certified to be adulterated, necessitating legal proceedings being taken against the vendors. Places where food is prepared for human consumption, including coffee houses, milkshops, and cowsheds have been kept under observa tion and periodic inspection. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ALFRED J. FIELD, A.R. San. I., M.S.I.A, Sanitary Inspector. 147 Report of Inspector, Bromley Central Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1917. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit to you my fourteenth Annual Report of the Sanitary Works executed for the remedying of defects and abatement of nuisances which have existed in the Central Division of the Sub-District of Bromley of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar for the year ended 30th December, 1917. I Inspection of District. Of the 991 premises inspected, 489 were found to be in a fair sanitary condition, whilst in 502 premises (the remainder) defects and nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated sanitary repairs (see tabulated statement, page 132). In the supervision of same 3,978 re-inspections were made, also added to this report is a summary of various duties carried out during year. Drains Tested. The drains of 183 premises were tested by means of the "rocket" smoke test. Two were proved defective, not gastight, whilst in 181 cases the result was negative. All drainage found to be defective was repaired or re-constructed on modern lines. Several new W.C.'s, lavatories, etc., were erected at various business premises in the division. House-to-House Inspections. Sections of Streets, Etc. Chadbourne Street, Coventry Cross, Marner Street, St. Leonards Street, Spey Street. A3078 M 148 Five Public Elementary Schools. Inspections were made of the five public elementary schools, and in three cases the sanitary office fittings required attention. The water supplies for drinking purposes were drawn direct from main. Storage tanks used for supply of closets and lavatories, etc., were well-covered. Drains were periodically cleansed by means of discharge of storage water. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907, Margarine Act, 1887, Butler and Margarine Act, 1909, the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1912, the Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912. During the year 107 varied samples of food, etc., etc., were obtained, and submitted for analysis. Of that number, 55 were samples of milk, 7 were taken on delivery, under contract, at Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, 11 purchased of itinerant vendors on Sunday, and the rest were from shops, etc., itinerant vendors and other institutions. The Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885. The 47 milk sellers' and purveyors' premises were from time to time visited. Registers at Public Health Office corrected in the cases of those found non-registered or through change of occupancy, etc., etc. The persons in question were supplied with forms which in each case was duly signed for the required alteration. Attention was given to enforcement of regulations relating to cleanliness of utensils, more particularly regarding the sanitary conditions under which milk was retailed, in compliance with "order." In 3 cases, very old and worn measures were replaced by new ones. Factory and Workshops Act, 1901—Bakehouses. In accordance with your instructions periodical inspections of 9 bakehouses were carried out, and where required, extract copies of above act, "intimations," notices, etc., were served, all of which received attention in every case, the necessary cleansing and limewhiting work being done and defects remedied. 149 During the year periodical inspections were made at factories, workshops, ice cream shops, hairdressers' shops, coffee shops, fried fish shops, and bakehouses, and a large amount of work and cleansing, etc., was done to keep pace with the various Bye-Laws. Most of the public house urinals were cleansed in the Spring of the year. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM JOHNSON, A.R. San. I., Cert. San. Insp. Examn. Board (Loud.) Cert.

Public Health Department, 31st December, 1917. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my seventeenth Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith in the West Combined District during the past year, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. Inspection of Division. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds, 1,694 houses or other premises have been visited, necessitating 2,899 re-inspections, 576 of these visits being on account of infectious diseases. In addition to these a large number of pulmonary tuberculosis notifications and notifications of tuberculosis in neck and legs have been attended to, and dealt with as circumstances required. The jump from last year in the number of infectious cases notified is mainly due to measles being notifiable. House-to-House Inspections. These visits were carried out under the Public Health (London) and Housing and Town Planning Acts as opportunity offered in various localities, and any works requiring attention were put in hand. Drain Reconstructions. The drains of a number of premises have been taken out and reconstructed in compliance with the bye-laws of the London County Council and Borough Council, they have been intercepted, ventilated, and provided with proper means of access for clearing in times of stoppages, the whole work being thoroughly tested before being passed. The drains of a number of premises have also been amended where found necessary. 151 Coffee and Eating Houses. These premises have been periodically inspected during the year; alterations in tenancy and new shops opened have been registered, ar.d the register brought up to date. While inspecting these places, so far as possible attention has been paid to the food. The premises have been cleansed when found necessary. Food Inspection at Wharves, etc At Aberdeen Wharf, where food of different kinds is landed for transit inspections have been made from time to time, and everything found in first-class condition. The food nearly all comes from Scotland. The butchers' premises and stalls in Chrisp Street Market were inspected at night times and at week-ends, and once at least every day. In each place where sausages and brawn are made, special attentio,e has been given. These premises are registered, and the businesses ary conducted in a clean and proper manner, and the premises are regularln cleansed. Odd consignments of damaged wheat, rice and barley, etc., have been received into the district from the docks to be made up into poultry food. These consignments have been properly dealt with. Factories and Workshops. These places have been visited periodically, and where necessary cleansing "Notices" have been served and complied with. New workshops opened have been placed on the register and duly inspected. 152 Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited at intervals. Changes of address have been noted and registered, and where necessary, cleansing work has been carried out. In cases where infectious disease has occurred at these premises the work has been disinfected before its return to the factories. Bakehouses. The occupied bakehouses have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily, and the places kept in very good order. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops. These places were regularly visited as necessary during the year. All dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness and have, generally speaking, been kept as clean as possible. In some cases, where infectious disease has occurred at any milkshop, the milk on the premises has been destroyed and the utensils disinfected before milk has been allowed to be sold again. No case has been " nursed " at home where milk was sold. Smoke Nuisance. No complaints from outside quarters have been received. No legal proceedings have been necessary, all " Notices," whether verbal or statutory, having been attended to. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. During the year various samples of food and drugs have been purchased for analysis and only in one case, viz., a sample of milk taken at the Relief Stores, Upper North Street, on behalf of the Guardians, were legal proceedings found necessary—this sample was a very bad one, being 5 3 per cent, deficient in solids not fat and 26 6 per cent, deficient in solids fat. The defendants produced a warranty and the summons was dismissed. 153 Food Control Orders Summonses. Defendant sold potatoes at a price exceeding that stated in Potatoes Order. Fined £3, costs, £2 2s. Defendant failed to display a list of prices as required by the Potatoes Order, after twice being cautioned. Fined, £2, costs £1 1s. Defendant failed to display a list of prices as required by the Meat (Prices) Order. Fined £3, costs £2 2s. Public Health Act (London), 1891. In one case of extremely bad overcrowding the occupier of the room was summoned and in lieu of a fine went to prison over the week and till the premises were emptied and nailed up. When requested, I have visited the places, together with a representative of the Local Government Board and inspected the foodstuffs and Army rations being dealt with and found everything very satisfactory. The factories and workers were exceptionally clean, and the conditions under which work was carried on were very healthy. Tuberculosis. Very many premises were visited in connection with cases of tuberculosis notified and precautionary measures advised. Where patients had removed the new addresses were in most cases found and the places vacated were disinfected. Measles. All cases of measles notified have been followed up as required. Fried Fish Shops. These premises have been inspected periodically as required, and where necessary cleansing put in hand. 154 Ice Cream Regulations. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice cream is made have been inspected, and attention given to the utensils used. They have been kept in a most cleanly and satisfactory condition. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Under this Act 19 rooms have been freed from vermin, all walls being thoroughly stripped and crevices and cracks raked out and properly filled in afterwards to prevent recurrence of the nuisance.

I have, as instructed, made periodical inspections of the bakehouses, sixteen in number. Three of the bakehouses are underground, and, where required, I served extracts of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, for the necessary work of cleansing, etc., and "intimations," "notices," etc., for the remedying of sanitary defects and nuisances at such premises. Three now unoccupied. Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses. Four notices were received for renewal of licences. The premises were duly inspected regarding the cleansing, limewashing and general sanitary conditions in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds Order. Any defects found to exist were remedied, and limewashing done before renewals of the licences were granted. The slaughterhouses have been frequently visited, often when killing was in progress, and everything found satisfactory. Limewashing in each case has been done in compliance with the London County Council Bye-laws The number of these premises now on the register is—cowsheds, 1; slaughterhouses, 3. One unoccupied. 157 Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Metropolis Local Management Acts, London County Council (General Powers) Acts, Bye-laws, and Council's Bye-laws. In two cases it was necessary to take legal proceedings, the terms of the "Intimations" and "Notices" authorised to be served by the Council not being complied with within the period specified in each csae. Seven days abatement order and 27s. costs in each case. Factory and, Workshops Act. The workshops, domestic workshops, workplaces and domestic workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number of employees engaged in each case being checked, particularly in respect to overcrowding, the terms of the Acts relating thereto have been met with in response to intimation and statutory notices when served. In no instance has there been occasion to take legal proceedings. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without any particular incident during the year. lce-Cream Regulations. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice-cream is made have been inspected and attention given to all the utensils used, which were found to be clean and in a satisfactory condition. Each itinerant vendor's barrow and utensils have been inspected, in each case the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 104 varied samples have been taken and submitted for analysis. Three were found to be adulterated. Summonses were issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples, and results of legal proceedings, are as under :— Milk.—Deficient in fat, to the extent of 6 6 per cent. Vendor fined 20s. and 21s. costs. 158 Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat to tho extent ot 6 per cent. Vendor fined 40s. and 21s. costs. Lard.—Contained at least 30 per cent, of vegetable matter.

Milk Shops and Milk Sellers; I have, by your instructions, made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is stored and sold in the district with the object of enforcing the regulations of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of the measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, especially from other articles kept for sale in close proximity to where milk is kept. Number of Milk Sellers registered 36 Number of Milk Sellers, discontinued selling Milk 12 Overcrowding. During the year seven cases of overcrowding were dealt with: in each case the nuisance was abated after service of an intimation followed by a statutory notice, without recourse to legal proceedings. * Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, no case of overcrowding discovered, premises were found to be in a sanitary condition. Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection has been made of these premises during the past year ; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register. At each 159 inspection particular attention was paid to the food under preparation, and in no instance was there cause for complaint; in some cases it was necessary to serve intimations and statutory notices respecting cleansing of the kitchens, etc. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected, the sanitary conditions of the premises, and cleanliness of the articles used in the business being carefully noted. In some few cases intimations were required to be served. Generally there is a marked improvement in these premises. Smoke Nuisances. During the year the furnace shafts throughout the district have been under observation, and in no instance was any serious nuisance observed that could be dealt with. Unsound, Food, Shops ami Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected, there has been no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-law under Public Health (London) Act, Section 50).

Public House Urinals. The public house urinals in the district have been frequently inspected, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, strictly enforced (see tabulated list, page 133). 160 Public Elementary Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Elementary Publio Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supplies and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main. The storage cisterns (which are used for supplying the sanitary conveniences only) are cleansed out every three months; the sanitary conveniences were found to be in a clean and satisfactory condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, East Combined Division. 161 Report of Inspector, South Division of Poplar. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1917. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to present my twenty-eighth Annual Summary of the sanitary work, executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1917, viz. :— The details of which were entered in my journal day by day and reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee month by month. Number of Inspections, special, periodical, and on complaint of nuisances 1,193 ,, Inspections re notifications of infectious diseases 284 Inspections, house-to-house visitations — Total Inspections 1,482 Re-inspections 2,284 Drains. During the year 23 drains were proved defective by the smoke and chemical tests, and in 133 instances the application of tests revealed no defects. Twenty-nine drains were reconstructed wholly or partially on the old lines—or repaired, in most cases including the fixing of new traps and pans and yard gullies. Factories. Improved additional sanitary accommodation has been provided at nine factories in this Division. The increase in employment of female labour was principally the cause of the extra amount of work entailed in furnishing extra accommodation for male and female employees. Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were inspected and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations. 162 Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 34—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Rooms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms were inspected and dealt with where necessary. In every case an antiseptic was in use. Public Health (London) Act Prosecution. The owner of 327, West Ferry Road, 68d and 72c and 72d, Mellish Street was summoned for neglecting to comply with sanitary notices,, requiring the amendment of defective roofs. The magistrate made orders to abate the nuisance within 30 days with 16s. 6d. costs in each of the four cases. Prosecution for disobeying Magistrate's Order. A further summons was issued against the owner of 72c, Mellish Street for neglecting to comply with the magistrate's order, which resulted in a penalty of £4 17s. 6d. and £2 2s. costs. Inspection of Schools. The schools in my Division number 8, each of which was inspected during the year, with no ground for complaint. Tuberculosis and Measles. In addition to the ordinary notification of infectious diseases, in all cases of measles notified from schools and in cases of tuberculosis the homes of the patients were inspected and advice given re isolation and disinfection, to prevent the spread of infection and all insanitary conditions were dealt with. 163 Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. The premises, 3, Ingelheim Cottages, West Ferry Road, closed as unfit for human habitation by an order of the Council under the above Act have been put in habitable repair and are now occupied Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale Periodical inspections were made of the following premises :— Bakehouses, 7. Slaughterhouses, 1. Tiipe dressers and sausage makers, 8. Dairies and milk shops, 20. Ice cream vendors, 19. Coffee shops and dining rooms, 28. Fish shops, 9. In all cases where cleansing, limewashing, or other works of sanitary improvements were necessary the matter was brought to the notice of the occupiers by written intimation, which in every case was complied with. The regularity of the periodical inspection of these premises has impressed upon the occupiers the necessity of cleanliness and limewashing, etc., of kitchens and places where food is prepared or stored. This was proved by the amount of work already completed or in progress (without notice) at the time of my visits. Riverside Wharves and Food Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the wharves and factories, and records were kept of all unsound foodstuffs and methods of destruction. Food Preserving Factories. Army Rations.—During the year, as far as practicable, a daily visitation has been made to the factories in Millwall where Army rations are manufactured in large quantities as follows:— Meat and Vegetable Rations in tins. Roast Fowl „ Rabbit „ Sausages ,, Jams and Marmalade ,, A3078 n 164 The meat, poultry, fruit and vegetables used have been inspected daily, in the meat stores, cutting, filling and weighing rooms and kitchens, and were sound and of good quality. Samples of finished rations were taken from time to time—the tins opened and contents examined with no cause for complaint. The benches, utensils and floors were washed down daily, and the walls of meat stores and meat cutting room relimewashed when and where necessary. Inspection of Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Sale of Food and Drugs Act. One hundred and one samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of 43 milk samples taken two were so adulterated that legal proceedings were taken against the vendors. In each case fines and penalties were inflicted, viz., £15 and £2 2s. costs, and £2 2s. and lis. 6d. costs. 16 of the milk samples were purchased of itinerant vendors, 10 of which were obtained on Sunday mornings. Of 24 samples of butter taken, 13 contained boric acid preservative, but not exceeding 0 3 per cent. Of 12 samples of margarine 8 contained a similar preservative and were certified genuine. The remaining samples of various foods and drugs were certified genuine and free from preservative., I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar Sovth Division. 165 Report of Lady Sanitary Inspector. Public Health Department. 31st December, 1917. Sir,— I beg to present my eighteenth Annual Report, which deals with the work done in factories and workshops, among out-workers, and other miscellaneous inspections during 1917. Verminous Children, Scabies and Phthisis. The homes of children reported as attending school in a verminous condition have again received attention. A large number of children have been excluded from school suffering from scabies, many of them have been bathed and the clothing and bedding disinfected at the cleansing station. I have also visited cases of phthisis attending the Dispensary W orkshops. The number of workshops on the register again shows a decrease, this is caused by some having become factories and also small employers have given up their workshops and are now employed in large factories where the work is more regular and more remunerative. An unusually large number of sanitary conveniences have been erected in factories, necessary for the increased number of females employed. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation in the 38 elementary schools in the Borough has been inspected and various defects remedied. Outworkers. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 114 lists have been received from emplovers in the Borough; 176 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar. Two hundred and three lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar.

January lst, 1918. Sir, I beg to present the tenth Annual Report of my work, the third under the Local Government Board's extended scheme for the Prevention of Infantile Mortality. Arrangements are now in working order for (1) the payment of Nurses for visiting cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum and measles when required; (2) payment of the Doctor's fee when called to assist a midwife in the delivery of a necessitous mother; (3) sale of dried milk at cost price. The death of Miss Macqueen, Principal of the Royal College of St. Katharine's, was a great loss to the Borough, but the work, as far as this department is concerned, was carried on ably under Miss Buckle. The visiting areas remain as before :— Poplar Infant Welfare Association. Undertake all the work south of the first bridges. The Royal College of St. Katharine. Undertake all the work between the first bridges and Bow Road. The Public Health Department. Undertake all the work north of Bow Roac. The working arrangement between the above bodies and this department has proceeded smoothly and harmoniously. 172 Temporary Health Visitor.

We had to discontinue giving cups of tea to the mothers, owing to difficulty in obtaining funds. The Mayor (Councillor A. H. Warren, J.P.) later on very generously gave a further £5, but as I thought it inadvisable to start the teas again, the Mayor kindly consented to the money being used for other purposes connected with the welfare of mothers and babies. Dr. Banham officiated at the Clinic during the absence of Dr. Dobson, who returned in August from military service abroad. Thanks are due to Mrs. Foster, superintendent of Bow Baths, for weighing the babies while the Assistant Health Visitor was on holiday. The clinic was closed on two Thursdays during the year.

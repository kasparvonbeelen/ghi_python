Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with "The Sanitary Officer's (London) Order 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my ninth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1901 and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Assistant Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS, or OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. VITAL STATISTICS. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1901, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 168,826:— Registration Poplar. Bromley. Bow. London. 4, 544,983 58,563 68,253 42,010 2 being 60.6 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 72.3 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 53.1 per acre in Poplar parish, 112.2 in Bromley, and 74.6 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1901. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports, they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Parish of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three parishes might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. The births during the 52 weeks were :— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 1044 1037 2081 Bromley 1203 1144 2347 Bow 700 693 1393 Totals 2947 2874 5821 Of these births 81 were illegitimate in Poplar, 41 males and 40 females. In Bromley there were 44 illegitimate births 22 males and 22 females. In Bow there were 5 illegitimate births, 1 male and 4 females, making a total of 130 in the Borough. Of the 2081 births registered in Poplar, 55 occurred in the Poplar Union Workhouse, and of the 2347 registered in Bromley, 1 occurred in the Sick Asylum and 29 in the Stepney Union Workhouse, and 1 in the City of London Union Infirmary. * These figures are calculated upon the acreage of the district including the water area, but exclusive of area covered by water they are:—93.3 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 99.9 for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley combined, and 77.7 for Bow. County of London 62.9 (no account being taken of tidal water and foreshore). 3 The annual birth rate per 1000living being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. Poplar 33.3 34.7 35.1 32.8 34.3 33.7 33.7 35.5 Bromley 36.3 37.9 37.4 36.1 36.6 35.6 35.7 34.3 Bow 32.6 34.0 324 34.6 31.9 34.3 34.0 33.1 The birth rate of the Borough of Poplar was 34.4, that of the County of London being 29.0. During the year the marriages of 3370 persons were registered in the Borough, giving an annual rate of 19.9 per 1000 of the estimated population, the rate for England and Wales being 15.9 and for London 17.6. The annual marriage rate per 1000 living being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899. 1900. 1901. Poplar and _ 14.07 13.7 16.0 16.92 17.92 17.90 18.36 18.7 Bromley Bow 23.6 In the 52 weeks 3490 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar. 925 deaths having occurred in the parish of Poplar, 1936 in Bromley, and 629 in Bow; from the 925 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 69 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 354 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1210 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1936 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 812 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 212 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1336. From the 629 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 29 non-residents and added 216 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 816 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II and III that in considering the deaths of 4 non-residents and those from outlying institutions, that certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 3490 deaths which were registered there must be subtracted 563 deaths of actual non-residents and 435 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 3362, upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1210 deaths in Poplar included 19 illegitimate children, 7 male and 12 female, the 1336 deaths in Bromley included 18 illegitimate children, n male and 7 female; the 816 Bow deaths included 2 illegitimate children, 1 male and 1 female, making a total for the Borough of 39 illegitimate deaths. Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 653 557 1210 Bromley 689 647 1336 Bow 435 381 816 Totals 1777 1585 3362 The excess of births was as follows:— Males. Females. Total gain. Poplar 391 480 871 Bromley 514 497 1011 Bow 265 312 577 Totals 1170 1289 2459 The male births in the Borough exceeded those of the female by 73, but the male deaths exceeded those of the female by 192, which makes a gain of 119 females. At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley 5 The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 17 years:—(See page 2*.)

The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected. Notices of 33 passengers had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities (see pages 48, 49 and 50). Four outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified, 2 in Poplar and 2 in Bromley. The usual notice was given. Difficulty was experienced in obtaining the removal of scarlet fever and diphtheria cases, this was due to the loss of beds at the Gore Farm Hospital, which were being prepared for the reception of small pox convalescent patients, and also on account of certain accommodation which was held in reserve for a possible outbreak of plague. On the 5th October, four scarlet fever patients were waiting to be admitted into the Asylums Board's Hospitals. One case had been waiting six days, two cases three days, and one case two days, On the 2nd November, four patients were waiting to be admitted into the Asylums Board's Hospital; one case had been waiting five days and three cases one day each. On account of the delay parents called at the Public Health Offices and stated they would keep the patients at home ; this no doubt, was due to the primary acute stage being over and the patients appearing better, but the danger from peeling then commences, not only to the patients by their incurring the liability of complications, but to the public at large by the risk of the disease spreading. There was not so much difficulty in obtaining the removal of diphtheria patients. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT. The following figures give the number of premises disinfected, and the number of times the Board's apparatus was used for the three parishes, some thousands of articles being disinfected. 31 Private premises. Board's apparatus Poplar 480 440 Bromley 750 766 Bow 172* 146* 1402 1352 * Last three-quarters of the year 1901. In July I reported that "since the Dust Destructor had been shu down the new disinfecting apparatus had not been able to be used. "The present boiler in the disinfecting house is incapable of supplying both apparatus at one time with steam. The boiler is registered to blow off at 60 lbs., and will not even work the new apparatus when used alone." It was pointed out to the Committee in case of an epidemic "having to rely upon the Dust Destructor for steam to work the new apparatus, the disinfecting work of the Borough is seriously interfered with when the Dust Destructor is shut down. Even though the Dust Destructor be at work there is not sufficient steam to work the new apparatus when the fires are being cleaned, which happens between the hours cf 10 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m." The Committee considered the matter. An endeavour was made to work the two machines from the then existing boiler by re-adjusting the safety valve, but it was found that the two apparatus could not be worked at the same time even with an increase of 10 lbs. pressure. The Committee thereupon viewed the site of the disinfecting apparatus and directed that prices for a new boiler should be obtained. At the time of writing this Report the new boiler has been fixed and appears to be working satisfactorily. A letter was received from the Local Government Board, enclosing 32 a copy of an order made by the Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, approving a resolution passed by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, that liquid preparations of carbolic acid and its homologues containing more than three per cent. of those substances should, except in certain cases connected with agriculture and horticulture, be deemed poisons within the meaning of the Pharmacy Act. 1868, and the second part of Schedule A to that Act. The communication from the Local Government Board stated:— "They desire to take this opportunity therefore of pointing out that whenever the disinfectant employed is carbolic acid . . . only bottles similar to those prescribed by the Regulations adopted by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain and approved by an order of the Lords of the Council, dated 31st January 1899, should be used to contain it." The approved Regulation referred to above, is:— (3) That in the dispensing and selling of poisons, all liniments, embrocations, and lotions containing poison be sent out in bottles rendered distinguishable by touch from ordinary medicine bottles, and that there also be affixed to each such bottle (in addition to the name of the article, and to any particular instructions for its use) a label giving notice that the contents of the bottle are not to be taken internally. The Committee approved a sample bottle, and gave directions that only bottles of the pattern selected be used in future. SMALL POX. During the year 71 cases of small-pox were notified in the Borough: 33 Poplar, 33 Bromley, and 5 Bow. No deductions have been made for 12 cases (see page 12), which 33 were certified by the Medical Superintendent of the South Wharf as not suffering from small-pox. The first case which occurred in connection with the Borough was notified to me by the Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth. The patient had been in Paris from 21st to the 24th July, and from there he returned on the 24th July to a house in the West Ferry Road, where he was engaged in the shop. On the 3rd August he went to Wandsworth, and was taken ill; the rash appeared on the 6th August, and the patient was at once removed to the Small Pox Hospital. The room in which the patient slept in the West Ferry Road, was disinfected, stripped, and limewhited, and the patient's clothes were disinfected. The Vaccination Officer was communicated with. The inmates of the house were induced to be vaccinated and kept under observation. The next case notified was from the Old Ford Road on the 23rd September. No further remarks will be made now respecting the outbreak of small-pox which has extended well into the year 1902, and the work caused by endeavouring to combat with the loathsome disease has delayed the making up of this report, but I hope to find time later on to write a history of the outbreak, and give various charts. Of the 59 persons attacked with small-pox, 10 died, 4 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 1 Bow. During the time that small-pox was beginning to prevail, a large number of cases of chicken-pox were notified from various schools in the district. In several instances when the Sanitary Inspectors called at the premises notified they were informed that no doctor had been in attendance. I then went and asked to examine the patients; this was most important, as during the outbreak of small-pox in London it had been reported that cases had occurred in people who had been in houses where supposed chicken-pox existed. C 34 A circular letter was sent to all the Medical Practitioners requesting them to be good enough when notifying cases of small-pox to write upon the notification condition as to vaccination. Practitioners were at the same time informed that they could after visiting cases of small-pox, in order to prevent the spread of disease, have their clothes disinfected at the Council's steam disinfecting apparatus. As it is well known that small-pox is spread by tramps the Committee asked the Guardians to have examined upon admission and discharge all the casuals at the wards in St. Leonard's Street. On the 22nd November I reported to the Committee that:— "During the stripping and limewhiting of infected rooms the "inmates of infected premises have been put to an immense "amount of inconvenience." "I would point out that there is no 'shelter' in this Borough. "There is no question that the existence of a 'shelter' during "the present epidemic would greatly help to prevent the spread of "the disease, as people could be properly housed while their "rooms are being disinfected, and at the same time all their "clothing could be disinfected (more especially the clothing "which they wear, and no doubt has been in contact with the "patient), for if they are in a shelter, they can have baths, and "while they are being bathed, the clothes which they have been "wearing can be disinfected." "The section referred to is section 60 (1.) (4)." "The Sanitary Authority shall provide, free of charge, temporary "shelter or house accommodation, with any necessary attendants, "for the members of any family in which any dangerous infectious "disease has appeared, who have been compelled to leave their "dwellings, for the purpose of enabling such dwellings to be dis"infected by the Sanitary Authority." 35 As a matter of urgency the Public Health Committee directed:— "That the house at Bromley Depot be fitted up as a temporary "shelter for accommodation of persons who have been in contact "with small-pox cases, during disinfection of their dwellings, "clothing and effects (for a period not exceeding 48 hours in each "case) where such disinfection cannot conveniently be carried out "without such removal; and that the Council bear the expense of "maintenance and attendance until such persons are allowed to "return to their own homes." It was further contemplated that necessity might arise for other buildings at the Depot being also used for this purpose. The Council approved the action of the Committee. Mr. Hitchins, the Vaccination Officer, has kindly furnished me with the following statistics, which are copied from those forwarded to the Local Government Board:— 1900.—January to June.

Green, Esq., and Mr. Councillor Randall, was served upon the Managers of the school, requiting them with a view to preventing the spread of the disease to forthwith close the school, and keep the school closed for three weeks and to exclude for two weeks from the Boys' Department, National School, High Street, and from the Girls Department, Bow Lane School, any scholars coming from the homes of children who attended in the Infants' and Babies Departments Newby Place Church Schools. 42 In April it was reported that a large number of cases of measles were occurring in connection with the Infants' Department of the Smeed Road Board School, Bow. The Medical Officer of the School Board for London was communicated with respecting the prevalence of measles at the school, and also at the Atley Road Board Schools. At the Smeed Road school one of the class rooms was closed for a period of three weeks. In July measles was very prevalent in the Borough. The whole of the Infants' Department in the Knapp Road Board School had to be closed. An outbreak of measles occurred in November in connection with the Glengall Road Board School, Cubitt Town, and was brought to my notice by a telephonic message from the Medical Officer of the School Board for London. No notices had been received by me from the teachers of the school respecting the existence of measles, as should have been done under Article 148 (ii.) of the Code of Regulations and Instructions of the School Board. I immediately visited the schools, interviewed the head teachers and asked for returns of cases from the various class-rooms. I placed myself in communication with the Medical Officer of the School Board for London, advising that the Infants' Department should be closed until after the Christmas holidays, and that the closed class-rooms should be disinfected. The return for the Infants' Department of the Medical Officer of the School Board, dated the 27th November, gave number on Roll 465, number in attendance 287, total number of cases of measles 63. In December on account of the number of cases of measles 43 ring in connection with the Infants' Department of the British Street Board School, Millwall, I communicated with the Medical Officer of the School Board for London, with the result that during the Christmas holidajs the above department was disinfected.

When reporting to the Public Health Committee upon the outbreak of measles at the Newby Place Church Schools, I stated:— " It is a pity that the authorities of the Church Schools do not " inform me immediately when children are excluded from schools " with any disease which is not notifiable, such as measles. "Under the code of regulations and instructions issued by the " School Board for London for the guidance of managers, corres" pondents, and teachers, Regulation 148 (2) . . . The Medical " Officer of Health for the District must also at the same time be " informed of the child's exclusion, and furnished with the name and " address of the child, and the reason for its exclusion, on a form " with which the teachers will be supplied by the Head Office. 51 " The fact of an outbreak of measles comes to my knowledge " either through an anonymous communication, or by the teacher " writing to me that a large number of cases have occurred. " If the Medical Officer of Health knew immediately that cases " were occurring through notices sent to him, as is done by the " Board Schools, he would be able to act sooner, and thus prevent " the spread of disease. " I would suggest that the attention of the Education Department " be called to this matter." The Committee directed that the Education Department should be communicated with respecting the matter. Acting upon the suggestion of the Board of Education the Committee directed that communications be sent to the authorities of the voluntary schools in the district, with a view to their adopting the same system of notifying the Council of cases of infectious disease occurring in connection with the schools, as is in operation in the case of Board Schools. A circular letter was sent to all the voluntary school managers of the borough, asking the managers to be good enough to adopt the same practice as is adopted by the School Board for London in furnishing the Medical Officer of Health with the name and address of any child who is excluded by reason of such infectious and contagious complaint, as the Medical Officer is not required by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to forward a notification certificate. There are 27 known voluntary schools in the borough. A form of notice was drafted and adopted by the Committee and each school was supplied with a book. The sanitary appliances of the Board Schools throughout the borough were inspected. See reports of the Sanitary Inspectors. 52 ICE CREAMS. At the meeting of the Public Health Committee on the 21st June, it was reported that samples of ice cream had been submitted to the public analyst. For the information of the Public Health Committee I repeated the report upon the subject of " ice cream " which I made on the 25th February, 1895, to the then Sanitary Committee. The Committee directed that a copy of the report should be forwarded to the London County Council and recommended that body be urged to make bye-laws for the registration of premises where " ice cream " " and lemon water ice " are made and of the vendors of such articles. At a subsequent meeting, the Public Health Committee further considered the question of the danger arising from the unrestricted sale of ice cream, and directed that a circular letter be sent to the schools in the borough suggesting that the children be warned of the risks they incur by buying ice creams from itinerant vendors, and also directed a communication to be made to the police urging the moving on of such vendors. As directed by the Public Health Committee, the following circular letter was forwarded to the school authorities calling attention to the grave danger to which children are exposed by eating ice cream and taking iced drinks during the hot weather. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, Bow, E. ( Corner of Fairfield Road). 1891. To the Head Teacher, Board School. Dear Sir, or Madam, re—ICE CREAM, AND ICE DRINKS. I am directed by my Public Health Committee, to call the attention of the School Authorities to the grave danger to which children 53 are exposed by eating Ice Cream, and taking iced drinks during the hot weather. Serious epidemics of typhoid fever have been traced to this source. It has been reported to the Public Health Committee that Ice Cream is often manufactured in places, the surroundings of which are most insanitary, and it has also been reported that in many instances Ice Cream has been found to contain disease germs, the presence of which, is doubtless due to the uncleanly surroundings and habits of the individuals manufacturing same. My Committee feel it to be of the utmost importance to ask the teachers to be good enough to warn children against the dangers of eating Ice Cream, the origin of which is unknown. More especially it is important that children should be warned against eating ice cream purchased from itinerant vendors in the streets. Apart from the fact that ice cream may contain disease germs, it is important to remember that it is dangerous to eat such substances when children are overheated or fatigued. I am, Dear Sir, or Madam, Yours faithfully, FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER. Medical Officer of Health. A letter was received from the London County Council, dated 17th July, enclosing a report of the Public Health Committee on the subject of proposed legislation with regard to the sale of ice creams. The Council hoped that the Metropolitan Borough Councils would support the proposals contained in the report, and any suggestions of the Borough Councils would receive careful consideration. Dr. Hamer, Assistant Medical Officer to the London County Council, who was instructed to enquire as to the conditions existing in London, showed: 54 "There certainly would be advantage if Sanitary Authorities had the power to require the removal from places in which food was prepared for sale, of conditions which might be regarded as exposing such food to risk of contamination. With respect to places where ice cream was prepared, the fact that outbreaks of disease had occurred from the consumption of this commodity justified a claim for more complete control than could be shown in the case of other articles of food." The London County Council limited their proposals with the addition of certain words to the Liverpool provisions, and to the requirement that every itinerant vendor should exhibit on his barrow a notice showing the name and address of the person from whom he obtains his ice creams. The provisions are to be administered by the Metropolitan Borough Councils. The Liverpool, Corporation Act of 1898 contains the following provisions, which the London County Council were desirous should also apply to London, with the addition of the words which are underlined :— (1) Any person being a manufacturer of, or merchant or dealer in, ice creams or other similar commodity, who, within the city, (a) Causes or permits ice creams or any similar commodity to be manufactured, sold or stored in any cellar or room in which there is an inlet or opening to a drain, or which is used as a living or sleeping room ; or, (b) In the manufacture, sale, or storage of any such com modity, does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination, or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination; or, (c) Omits on the outbreak of any infectious or contagious 55 disease amongst persons employed in his business, to give notice thereof to the Medical Officer of Health for the City: shall be liable for every such offence on a summary conviction to penalty not exceeding forty shillings. A number of boroughs have obtained by local acts, powers similar to those of Liverpool, but the great difficulty has been as regards registration. Bills containing such a provision were rejected by Committees of Parliament, apparently for the reason that such registration would apply to the numerous confectioners, hotels, &c., so that the London County Council did not seek to have a registration provision inserted in the proposed Bill. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. In July I presented a special report to the Public Health Committee upon the subject of enforcing the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings. The Committee were asked to appoint a special inspector, and it was suggested that the appointment be of a temporary nature at first, in order to see how matters shaped in respect of the working of the bye-laws. In October Mr. Herbert J. Langley was appointed for a period of twelve months, his duties being to measure up the rooms of houses on the register and to enter such measurements in the new register, to serve documents upon the landlords, the inspection of houses placed under the bye-laws, and to make visits at night time. Mr. Langley commenced his duties in November, and on page 109 will be found a report as to the work carried out by him to the end of the year. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. " Unhealthy Area." I made a " representation " to the London County Council under part I. section 5 (2) of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 56 1890, of an unhealthy area, comprising Providence Cottages, certain houses in Emmett Street and Arnold Buildings, in all 122 dwelling houses, if Arnold Buildings be considered as no tenements. CANAL BOATS. During the year, 59 registered canal boats, and no non-registered canal boats were inspected : registered non-registered. Mr. Johnson. West Combined Division 13 9 Mr. Anthony. Bromley North Division - 5 Mr. Miners. Bromley Central Division 5 32 Mr. Field. Bow East Division 36 19 Mr. Boyce. Bow West Division 5 45 59 no On the 30th September, Mr. Johnson found whilst inspecting a non-registered boat " Praed," the cabin to be in a very dirty and damp state, the bilge water not having been removed. The occupant was cautioned; the water was at once removed by pumping, the cabin cleaned up and made in a habitable condition. Mr. Field reported on the 15th July that whilst inspecting the registered canal boat " Ann," the sides of the boat were leaky, admitting water into the cabin, the seams of the cabin head open and skylight broken. A letter was sent to the owner. On the 17th May a summons was heard at the Thames Police Court, under the Canal Boats Act, against the owners of the barge " Emily '' for not having the barge registered as a " dwelling." The Magistrate, after hearing the evidence of the Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Watermen and Lightermen of the river Thames, the man in charge, and myself, decided that the vessel in question was a "canal boat " within the meaning of the Act, but the summons must be dismissed since there was no " substantial user " of the barge 57 as a dwelling. He gave no costs against the Council as he considered the action had been rightly taken in the interest of the public. BAKEHOUSES. During the year the bakehouses were twice inspected and the notices as to lime-whiting,&c., were served in those cases considered necessary. At the time of the last inspection there were in the Borough of Poplar 113 premises used as bakehouses, and 13 either unoccupied or not used. SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND COWHOUSES. The slaughterhouses and cowhouses were specially inspected previous to the occupiers applying to the London County Council for the renewal of their licenses. Since the London Government Act came into operation, the Metropolitan Borough Councils have to inspect these premises and enforce the bye-laws. Within the Borough there are 20 licensed slaughterhouses and 17 licensed cowhouses, 8 Poplar, 5 Bromley, and 7 Bow, slaughterhouses, 3 Poplar, 6 Bromley, and 8 Bow, cowhouses. MILKSHOPS. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 407 registered premises where milk is sold, 135 Poplar, 170 Bromley, and 102 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation. SMOKE NUISANCES. 251 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year—56 Bow East, 16 Bow West, 53 North Bromley, 11 Bromley central, 17 East combined, 39 West combined, and 59 Poplar South. SEWERS, HACKNEY WICK. Complaints were received about smells emanating from the sewers in the neighbourhood of Smeed Road. In order to prevent the 58 re-opening of the surface ventilators, the London County Council wished to erect shafts against the neighbouring buildings, opposition and restrictions were made by firms against the erection of such shafts upon their premises. In July I presented to the Public Health Committee a "Special Report" upon the condition of the sewers in Hackney Wick. I was satisfied that chemicals were being illegally discharged into the sewers. I stated that a most alarming and dangerous state of affairs existed, and owners of factories ought to afford the London County Council every assistance to erect shafts against buildings, so that another explosion might be obviated and serious loss of life and damage to property prevented. It is well known that some weeks after writing this "Special Report" during a severe storm a very disastrous and fatal explosion took place in the neighbourhood of White Post Lane. In the " Special Report" it was stated— " It is not generally known what the London County Council have done, and are doing in respect of sewer work, which no doubt will benefit the health of the inhabitants of Poplar and West Ham. " I understand that a million pounds, if not more, will be spent for a scheme which will probably take five years to complete, in order to improve the existing system of main drainage on the North side of the Thames. Two 9 foot barrel sewers are being constructed from Barking to Old Ford, and these two sewers will be continued on as one 10 foot sewer between the high and middle level sewers to Paddington, or as far as will relieve by gravitation, this will prevent flooding and overflows into the River Lee at Old Ford. " The two new sewers will come over the present ventilating 59 gratings on the sewer embankment at the back of the Britannia Box Co.'s Works, just before the Smeed Road sewer passes under the high and middle level sewers, so that the London County Council cannot possibly, at present, under the circumstances, erect a permanent brick shaft (like the one in Violet Road, Bromley) over these gratings as suggested. " A new 6 foot sewer has been constructed from the Lee Valley sewer in Gainsborough Road, picking up the Wick Road sewer at White Post Lane, and running down Wick Lane and Old Ford Road to the Abbey Mills, at which point it is almost completed, this will also prevent flooding and overflow into the River Lee, but the risk of an explosion will be increased as the volume of water in each sewer will be diminished, and the chemicals will remain in the sewers." SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Where w.c, pans and traps had been fixed without notice to the Clerk, under clause 14 of the London County Council bye-laws, section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Committee, in every case brought under their notice, directed that the builder be written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise he would be prosecuted for infringing the bye-law. During the year 11 cases were brought under the notice of the Committee. In four instances, after the ground had been opened, the drains were found defective. Under section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, certificates were authorised to be signed that there were proper and sufficient water supplies at the following newly-erected premises :— 90, 92, 94, 96 and 98 Mellish Street; "Steam Packet" (b.-h.), Orchard Place; 26 and 28 High Street, Poplar; 227a, 227b and 60 227c West Ferry Road; New Wing of the Poplar Hospital Artisan's Dwellings, Bow Road; Toronto and Montreal Buildings, Cotton Street; and Adelaide Buildings, Ann Street. On the nth February, at the Westminster Guildhall, the Local Government Board opened the enquiry upon the proposed Water Companies' Regulations I attended in order to give evidence upon the evils of storage cisterns for drinking water, and the two gallon flush to w.cs. The enquiry was held on five days. As a result of the first day's proceedings the Companies amended their proposed regulations. The enquiry was adjourned until Thursday, 28th February, in order that the Companies might in the meantime formulate the amendments which they were prepared to make in the proposed regulations, and that the London County Council might have an opportunity of considering the amendments. Certificates were given under section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting 2 cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served ; 69 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses 71 cases of overcrowding abated ; 11 cases of overcrowding were abated in workrooms (see Miss Tattersall's report page 107), 20 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with Houses let in Lodgings, or occupied by Members of more than one family (see Mr. Langley's report page 109). 4971 communications were received, and 1330 complaints as to nuisances were made. 6i List of Sanitary Works carried out in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar from the 1st fanuary, 1901, to 31 st December, 1901 Popular South.

Sir,— I beg to lav before you my twelftn Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending December 31st, 1901, as follows :— Inspections on complaint of nuisances 556 Do on notifications of infectious diseases 127 Do. on house-to-house visitation 630 Do. Canal Boats 50 Re-inspections 2260 Making a total of 3623 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the " Public Health (London) Act," 1891. Of the total number (1313 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that 42.6 per cent, of the premises thus inspected various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out—requiring the service of 568 intimations and 365 notices. In many of these cases on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 1 case it was found necessary to nave recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating 3 attendances at the police-court to ensure enforcment. 65 The details and nature of Sanitary Works executed in thu West Division during the year are as follows :— Walls and ceilings of houses cleansed throughout 14 partially 62 Drains opened and cleansed 103 Defective drains repaired 69 Inlets to drains properly trapped 12 Sink waste pipes properly disconnected from drains 0 Rainwater pipes do. do. 0 Water-closets re-constructed 8 Water laid on to soil pans of W.C.'s 60 Ventilation of W.C.'s improved 1 New soil pans provided where broken or unsuitable 16 Foul soil pans cleansed 15 Yards, areas, and forecourts, paved 27 Yards and areas drained 6 Nuisances from dampness remedied 55 Roofs made watertight 93 Eaves guttering of roofs and rainwater pipes repaired 92 Water supplies to houses reinstated 29 Water services for domestic purposes altered or improved 3 Water service fittings repaired 2 Public House urinals repaired and cleansed 6 Animals improperly kept (removed) 2 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 20 Bye-laws enforced 4 Other nuisances remedied, chiefly dilapidations 102 Overcrowding abated 6 Drains tested* by the application of the smoke drain test, of which 15.9 per cent, were proved defective 433 ^Primary tests only.

High Street. Rothbury Buildings. Caxton Street. Comboss Road. Kelday Road. Blondin Street. Clayhall Road. Rothbury Road. Lawrence Road. Rippoth Road. Trego Road. BAKEHOUSES. The bakehouses throughout the district have been periodically visited, and the conditions in some instances necessitating intimation service from dirty walls and flooring accumulations, of sweepings or ashes beneath the troughs, and the bi-annual cleansing not carried out at the stated periods. With two exceptions the bakehouses of the district are conducted on the ground level. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS, AND OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. The milkshops numbering 31 on the register, and offensive businesses in the district have been periodically visited. In no instance has it been necessary to report infringements. An intimation in the case of offensive business being sufficient to secure amendment. CANAL BOATS. Fifty-seven boats have been examined; of the registered boats, one only was found in an unsatisfactory condition. Of the unregistered barges, the majority of cabins are totally unfit for use as habitations, for which it is feared many of them are at times improperly used. 74 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP INSPECTIONS. Nuisances arising within the several factories and workshops have been satisfactorily dealt with, and the systems of drainage in the newly built factories have been subjected to severe water test before approval has been granted. SMOKE NUISANCES. The smoke nuisances arising within and without the district have received much attention, and those within the district have been reduced almost to a minimum. In the matter of smoke nuisances arising without the district little improvement is perceptible, and, unfortunately, an abatement is almost impossible with the existing legal difficulties, as in a district of this description nuisances are hard to prove. FLOODING. On July 25th and 27th very heavy rains were the cause of flooding in the low-lying portion of Hackney Wick, by which 71 houses and other premises in the district were rendered temporarily unfit for habitation. The water gaining access to the underground tanks of a mineral oil works, conveyed the oil to the street, when by some means it became ignited and further damage to houses in White Post Lane, occasioned by fire, resulting in deaths. This part of the district seems to suffer on the occurrence of heavy rains, by which the houses are rendered very damp, the water passing beneath the flooring and allowed to soak away through the ground, which must eventually lead to serious results. In this instance, with the consent of owners and occupiers, the floor boards of ground floor rooms were taken up by the Council's workmen and the ground beneath treated with lime and peat powder. In a few cases where objection was raised, disinfectants were left at the premises and the flooring undisturbed. No unusual number of cases of infectious diseases have occurred at these premises. 75 PARISH OF BOW (East Division). List of Summonses taken out at Police Courts, with Results. Situation of Premises.

F 82 31st December, 1901. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my (twelfth) Annual Report of the Sanitary works executed and nuisances abated in the South Division up to date, 26th March, 1901. Since then, on the re-arrangement of districts, the Central Division of the Parish of Bromley under the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1901. I have inspected 1,578 premises, 922 in response to complaints of nuisances, 287 on account of infectious diseases, notified, and 369 house-to-house inspections, were made. Of the 1,578 premises 313 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the remainder 1,265 nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated list) and 5,394 re-inspections were made in the supervision of same.

Summons dismissed on failure of proof that the person who appeared was liable, or the owner of premises. Rescindment of Closing Order. I was summoned to attend the Thames Police Court on the 16th January to shew cause why the owner of the premises, No. 59, Tetley Street should not be released from "closing order" made dated 8th November, 1900. The premises had been put into habitable repair to your satisfaction, no objection was made, and the order was cancelled. The market places and stalls have been regularly inspected throughout the year. I have on several occasions, upon tradesmen's application, examined the articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found to be unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for food, I saw the same destroyed and dealt with as trade refuse, and I have given the necessary certificates to that effect, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visit in such a condition as to justify seizure. I have by your direction made the periodical inspection of bakehouses, served "intimations," and, where required, notices for the necessary work of cleansing and repairs to be carried out. The register of dairies, milk shops and milk purveyors, has been corrected from time to time. Those found to be non-registered had signed forms of application in compliance with your instructions and had their names inserted in the register. Constant attention had been given to the enforcement of the regulations, but in no case had an infringement been discovered. 87 I have visited 33 non-registered barges and 5 registered sailing barges; the cabins were in a fairly clean condition. Where a nuisance had occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney belonging to a factory, either on complaint or from personal observation, "intimations" and notices had been served, anil the nuisances had been abated for the time being. Fifty-two samples of food have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst (Mr. W. C. Young) for analysis. 6 were found to be so much adulterated that legal proceedings were taken, the nature of articles, extent of adulteration, result of prosecution being as follows :— Lime Water. —Deficient in lime to the extent of 76 per cent. Summons dismissed, no proof of extraction. Butter.— Adulterated with 75 per cent. of foreign fat. Vendor fined £6 and £13s. od. costs. Cheese.— Adulterated with 12 per cent. of foreign fat. 2 Summonses taken out under Margarine Act. (1) Vendor fined £3 and £13s. od. costs for having sold same in an unstamped wrapper.

Vendor fined for added water £2 and 2s. costs. Butter.— Adulterated with 6.3 of water, and 0.2 per cent. of boric acid. Summons dismissed, upon written warranty produced. Milk.— Deficient in cream to the extent of 33 per cent. Vendor fined £3 and 33s. costs. 88 By your direction, special inspections were made of the schools in my district, all of which were found to be in fair sanitary condition. One notice of intention to apply for renewal of cowhouse license was received from my district. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS Sanitary Inspector, Bromley Central Division. F. W.

The shops and market stalls in my district have been systematically inspected with a view of discovering any unsound or unwholesome foodstuffs, and in several instances I have caused to be destroyed bad fruit and small portions of fish which were exposed for sale, the vendors in each case being cautioned. In only one case was it necessary to take Police Court proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in respect of reconstructing bad drains, viz., against the owner of the houses in Bentley Terrace, Chrisp Street. The summons was withdrawn on the work being commenced forthwith. A summons was taken out in August against the proprietor of 92 "Pioneer Wharf," Bloomfield Street, for having a very large accumu. lation of "refuse" on his premises, in contravention of the London County Council's bye-laws. After an adjourned hearing, the defendant was fined £3 and 23s. costs, and a forthwith abatement order issued. The refuse was then moved with all dispatch. The whole of the bakehouses in the district (31) have been periodically inspected, and, where necessary, intimations and notices have been served to have the premises cleansed according to the Act. These have been complied with in a ready manner. The milkshops, dairies, and cowhouses in the district, since being taken over by the Borough Council from the L.C.C. have been regularly inspected and the register revised and brought up to date, the utensils, &c. being kept under careful observation, and the regulations enforced as to the proper limewashing and cleansing. The slaughter-houses have been specially inspected just previous to the renewal of licenses, verbal intimations being sufficient to cause them to be put into a cleanly condition. The number of above at present on the register is as under :— Cow-houses 2 Slaughter-houses 3 Dairies and Milk Shops 79 Canal Boats Inspection. The inspection of canal boats to the number of 22 has been carried out as opportunities offered. In some instances (in non-registered boats) the occupants have had to be cautioned as to the dirty and neglected condition of the cabins. The registered boats were found without exception to be in a very clean and wholesome condition, and the hand pumps, bulkheads and all important parts of the boats in good order. The "Certificates" of registration were at 93 times examined. Since the outbreak of small-pox the occupants have been closely scrutinized and questioned as to any case of illness on board, but no case of illness was found to exist. Factory and Workshops Act. All cases of complaints of "black smoke" from shafts and chimneys in the district, have been investigated with satisfactory results. On several occasions during the year I had to personally caution a firm of Engineers, in Garford Street (since removed to the country) about the great quantity of black smoke issuing from the shaft on their premises. Printed notices were also served by hand, but without effect, and I was compelled to ask for authority to take legal proceedings against the firm. The magistrate at the Thames Police Court after warning the Managing Director that it would prove a costly business for the firm if the nuisance was not abated, inflicted fines amounting to £10 and £2 6s. costs. In some cases where there was no separate w.c. accommodation for each sex, notices were served, and the necessary alterations carried out without delay, also whitewashing and cleansing of walls as required. Food and drugs Acts. 39 samples of food and drugs have been purchased and submitted to the public analyst for analysis. 4 were proved to be adulterated, and legal proceedings were instituted in 3 cases. The nature of sample and extent of adulteration, with result of legal proceedings are set out below. Milk Adulterated with 25 per cent. of added water Vendor fined £10 and £3s. costs (first offence). Milk Deficient in cream to the extent of 33 per cent. Vendor fined £10 and £1 3s. costs (second offence). 94 Whisky Adulterated with 46.4 of water. No action. Milk Deficient in cream to the extent of 20 per cent. Vendor fined £2 and £1 3s. costs (first offence). The whole of the Board Schools and National Schools in my district have been inspected, and where necessary notices were served to cleanse, or make good sanitary defects In the case of Ricardo Street Board School, the School Board have asked for the notice which was served to be held over, as the building is about to be entirely redrained. In some cases where the bye-laws as to fixing new drainwork have been infringed by no notice being sent to the Clerk of the Council in writing, I have had the ground opened again and found defects to exist, these were in each case readily made good. Smallpox. In accordance with the Committee's instructions, where cases of smallpox have occurred in my district, I have (in nearly all cases) had the occupants of the several houses isolated indoors, and had food, &c., conveyed to them as required, with a view of preventing the spread of the disease by their not being able to mix with the public. In most cases the instructions given were honestly observed, in some they were not in spite of frequent visitation. In many cases the value of the isolation was strikingly proved by other occupants of the house breaking out with the disease during the period of quarantine, these cases were at once noticed and removed to the ships whereas if such persons had been out and about much evil must have resulted therefrom. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH JOHNSON R.P.C. Assoc. San. Inst. Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale ana Food and Drugs and Canal Boats Acts. 95 31st December, 1901. To the Medical Officer of Health.

The shops and stalls in my district have been regularly inspected with a view to detecting unsound and unwholesome food, and in many cases quantities of fish, fruit, meat, &c., have been destroyed with the consent of the vendors. In several instances during my rounds I have caused parcels of fruit and fish to be destroyed, which were being offered for sale by itinerant vendors who were cautioned. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Police Court proceedings have been instituted against the owners of the undermentioned premises for disobeying the authority of the Council with the following result:— 56 Cotton Street, defective drain; 7 days abatement order, £1 7s. costs, 51 samples of food have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis; 4 were found to be adulterated, and legal 99 proceedings instituted, the nature of article, extent of adulteration, and result of proceedings being as follows :— Milk.—Deficient in cream to the extent of 40 per cent. Vendor fined £2 (previous conviction). Milk.—Containing 0.042 percent. of Formaldehyd, equal to .01 per cent. of Formalin. Costs were given against the Council, 12s. 6d., as the number of the sample was omitted on the certificate. Cocoa.— Adulterated with 80 per cent. of arrowroot and sugar, Vendor fined 20s. and 23s. costs (first offence). Butter.— Adulterated with 83.5 per cent. of foreign fat. Vendor fined £4 and 23s. costs (first offence). Special Proceedings. On the 9th of November notice was received from the Poplar Hospital stating that several poisoning cases were being treated there alleged to be caused through eating cheese, which was bought at a grocer's shop in Orchard Place. Acting on the instructions of the Medical Officer of Health, I went to the said shop and found that the vendor had heard of a number of people being ill after eating the cheese and the day before my visit, had sent the unsold portion back to the wholesale people from whom he had purchased the cheese. The wholesale people's premises are situated in the Borough of Southwark. I immediately went over to see Dr. Millsom, Medical Officer of Health for the Borough, and gave him all particulars of the case so that he might examine the cheese on their premises and deal with it as he thought fit. I have by your direction made a periodical inspection of the whole of the Bakehouses in my district and found that 61 per cent required cleansing and also sanitary defects existed. Notices were served, and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. 100 The Dairies and Milkshops have been periodically inspected and in several cases I found they had not been registered through change of proprietorship, but I furnished the occupiers with the necessary forms to fill so that their names could be entered on the register; in no case have I found the milk utensils other than clean, and so situated as to be practically free from contamination. Five notices have been received for the renewal of licenses for slaughter-houses and cow-houses. The premises were duly inspected, and where found insanitary, through want of cleansing, or a proper water supply, or through bad ventilation, or defective drains and inlets, &c., notices were served and the nuisances remedied before the licenses were granted. The Board and private schools in my district have been periodically inspected, and where nuisances existed either from want of proper cleansing or defective water fittings, or other defects, notices were served and the work done, with only one exception, which school is about to be re-drained thoughout. I have by your directions examined the water supply cisterns in Grosvenor Buildings, and have had the whole of them (110) cleansed and where the covers were found to be defective they have been repaired. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, East Combined Division. 101 To the Medical Officer of Health, Poplar. 31st December, 1901. Sir,— I beg leave to submit to you my annual summary of the sanitary work executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1901.

Of that total, 491 premises were found to be in fair condition, and 66 per cent. required various works of sanitary improvement. 129 drains were proved defective by the smoke or chemical tests, while in 834 instances their application revealed no defects. 102 During the year the drains of the under-mentioned premises were reconstructed on the old lines :— Manchester Road, 86, 88, 90, 92, 358, 360, 362, 137, 139, 521.

In 25 instances plans were submitted in accordance with the Council's drain regulations. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Police court proceedings were taken in pursuance of the Council's Orders of Authorization against the owners of the undermentioned premises for disregarding statutory notices, with the results indicated. Abatement Orders. 587, Manchester Road, defective drain. In this case it was decided that the alleged drain was a sewer repairable by the Council. The magistrate dismissed the summons, each party paying their own costs. 33, Marshfield Street, defective drain, 7 day abatement order, £2 2s. costs. 73, Stebondale Street, dampness and dilapidations, 14 day abatement order, £1 10s. costs. 67, Glengall Road, dampness and dilapidations, 14 day abatement order, £1 7s. 33, Marshfield Street, disobeying magistrate's order. In this case no attempt had been made to comply with the magistrate order at the expiration of the time allowed thereon, viz., 7 days. Another summons was issued and the magistrate inflicted a penalty of £1 12s. costs. 104 Closing Orders. 79, Stebondale Street, dampness and dilapidations, closed as unfit for human habitation, 7s. costs. 36, Marshfield Street, absence of water supply, closed as unfit for human habitation, £1 7s. costs. Inspector summoned in order that "closing order" might be rescinded. I was summoned to the Police Court on the 21st of June, to shew cause why the owner of the premises 36, Marshfield Street, should not be released from the magistrate's order, of January last, closing the house as unfit for human habitation. By your direction, on account of various insanitary conditions still existing at the premises, and the non-payment of 27s. costs allowed with the order, I attended the Police Court and opposed the application. The case was then adjourned to 4th July. Prior to the adjourned hearing of this application, with myself you had visited the premises and found that the nuisances still existed. The w.c. pan was not fixed, and the costs were still unpaid. You attended the Court and, with myself, again opposed the application, with the result that the summons was dismissed with 21s. costs against the owner. On the 22nd July I received a similar second summons to attend at the Thames Police Court on the 25th of that month. As the premises at that date had been put into habitable repair to your satisfaction, no further opposition was offered and the closing order was rescinded. During the year, additional and improved workmen's w.c. accommodation has been furnished at the following factories :— Messrs. Maconochie's factory, West Ferry Road. Eight ranges of automatically-flushed isolation closets. 105 Messrs. Morton's jam factory. Four ranges isolation closets, with automatic flush. Messrs. Hodges, Union Works, West Ferry Road. Range isolation closets, automatic flush. Glengall Iron Works, as above. Range of isolation closets with automatic flush. United Horse Shoe and Nail Company. Two ranges of isolation closets with automatic flush. Messrs. Coubro & Scrutton, Engineering Works, West Ferry Road. Range of isolation closets. Smoke. At the following works and factories special smoke consuming apparatus has been fitted to furnaces to prevent nuisance from smoke :— United Horse Shoe and Nail Company's Factory, Wharf Road. Westwood and Bailie's Works, West Ferry Road. Capewell Horse Shoe and Nail Company's Works, Glengall Road. Lock, Lancaster & W. W. Johnson's Factory, West Ferry Road. By your direction I have obtained 52 samples of food and drugs or analysis. Legal proceedings were instituted against 3 vendors and convictions obtained as follows:— Milk Deficient in cream to the extent of 36 per cent. Fined £4 and £1 3s. costs Butter ... Adulterated with 84 per cent. of foreign fat. Fined £l and £1 3s. costs. Cocoa Adulterated with 77 percent. of a mixture of potato starch and sugar. Fined £3 and £1 3s. costs. 106 Prosecution for Refusing to Serve. On the 28th of November a summons was issued under section 17 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, against a street milk vendor, for refusing to serve milk from the can from which he was selling milk in the West Ferry Road. I refused to accept milk from a particular can, and insisted on being supplied from the ordinary large can; this was determinedly refused. The summons resulted in a penalty of £5 and £1 3s. costs, or a month's imprisonment. By your direction special inspection was made of all the schools in this Division, and various nuisances were abated on the service of a written intimation. Periodical inspections were made of the bake-houses, cow-houses, dairies and milk shops. The results of these inspections were reported in detail to the Public Health Committee. The shops, food stores and stalls have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting diseased and unwholesome food, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such condition as to justify seizure. A notification from the Port Sanitary Authority was received in October last, stating that two tons of bad dates were lying at the docks. The dates were removed to a firm of Cattle Food Manufacturers, in the West Ferry Road, to be prepared as food for cattle, where I examined the contents of the case and was satisfied they were not sold for human consumption.

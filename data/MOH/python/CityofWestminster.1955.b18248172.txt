During the year notifications were received of 19 cases of Poliomyelitis; the diagnosis was subsequently confirmed in 15 cases and in the remaining four cases poliomyelitis was excluded. Of the confirmed cases, 11 patients had paralysis and 4 had none. The recent trend for the disease to attack the older age groups was noticeable, 8 of these patients were 20 years of age or over and 4 under the age of 10 years. The advice of the Medical Officer of Health was sought by several hospitals in regard to problems arising in connection with this disease, such for example, as the need for curtailing the work of the Ear, Nose and Throat departments. Smallpox. The Medical Officer of Health was called in to investigate a suspected case of smallpox at the request of the medical staff of a hospital. Fortunately, smallpox was excluded. International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Arrangements continued during the year for the authentication by the Medical Officer of Health of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation completed by medical practitioners in Westminster. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad from this country and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Some 3,288 certificates were authenticated during the year. 13 Deaths, 1955. Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life in the City. Years of Age. Causes of Deaths. Sex.

Westminster Old People's Welfare Association. This voluntary Association, whose members include representatives of various bodies interested in the welfare of old people, continued its (6091) A 5 16 activities in the City during the year. These activities include the organisation in various parts of the City of Darby and Joan Clubs, where light refreshments and recreation are provided; arranging holidays at seaside resorts, summer outings, Christmas parties, and other entertainments. Special outings and parties were organised during the year for handicapped old people, who by reason of their infirmities had not been outside their homes for long periods. The distribution of gift food parcels was arranged; and also the visiting by voluntary helpers of the ailing and lonely in their homes. The Association also provides a chiropody service for the elderly. Treatment can be obtained at two clinics in the City, or at home. The charge is Is. per foot per treatment; the balance of cost, which varies from 3s. to 6s. per treatment, is borne by the Association. The Association have also been instrumental in placing a few old people in part-time employment. The City Council, under powers conferred by the National Assistance Act, 1948, make an annual contribution to the funds of the Association. British Red Cross Society—Mobile Meals Service. The Westminster Division of the British Red Cross Society has continued the service which it established in the City in 1945 for the delivery to their homes of hot mid-day meals to aged people who are unable themselves to prepare meals at home. The service is operated with two vans provided by the City Council and loaned to the Society. The Council also makes an annual grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the running costs of the vans. The meals are obtained from a firm of caterers, and are placed in individual containers and kept in heated chambers on the vans until delivered at the homes of the old people. The meals cost Is. 6d. each, and consist of meat, two vegetables and a sweet, or lighter diets for those requiring them. The old people pay 10d. for the meal and the London County Council bear the difference of 8d. Some 9,932 meals were delivered by this service during the year, with the assistance of the Society's voluntary workers. This invaluable help is very much appreciated by all concerned. Aged Persons in Need of Care and Attention. Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, a Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply to the Courts for an order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place, of persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from others, proper care and attention. Fortunately it has not been found necessary to invoke these powers during the year. 17 Aged and Infirm Persons. Number of aged and infirm persons visited by the Council's officers during the year 176 Total number of inspections made with regard to these 871 Primary 155 Re-inspections 716 Cases of aged and infirmed persons brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health during 1955 155 In dealing with these cases, the co-operation of the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association, the London County Council's Home Help Service, both of which are accommodated in the Public Health Department, and the " Meals on Wheels " service of the British Red Cross Society has been of great value. Mobile Library Service. The City Council provides a library service for the aged, and books are issued to them at Darby and Joan Clubs. For those who are unable to leave their homes, delivery is made there. Bathing Facilities. The City Council has made available to old age pensioners facilities whereby they can have hot baths at the Council's public baths at reduced charges. Cleansing of Bed Linen of Elderly and Infirm. Facilities have also been made available by the Council for the cleansing of bed linen of elderly and infirm people when it has become fouled and unwholesome. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933—Slaughterman's Licences. The Council during the year granted Slaughterman's licences to 20 men who had been accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to act as their inspectors in different parts of the country. These licences are required to be held by the pupils while undergoing training in humane slaughtering as part of the course for appointment as inspectors of the R.S.P.C.A. 18 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

The resident population of 97,630 in some '27,300 dwellings received water from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains or from deep wells. Eighty-seven deep wells were in use at 31st December, 1955, compared with eighty-eight at the same time in 1954. In eighty-four of these wells, the water is used for domestic purposes. In the remainder, one supply is used for cooling purposes, one for supplying boilers and one as a stand by in case of fire. Satisfactory reports were received of 54 bacteriological examinations and 51 chemical analyses of water from these wells. 38 One well, where bacteriological examination showed 90 faecal coli per 100 ml. in 1954 after a period proved satisfactory. Chlorinating equipment has, however, been installed as a further safeguard. The well in adjacent premises which showed 18 coliform bacilli per 100 ml. and its use discontinued at the same time, had not, at 31st December, 1955, been brought back into use.

Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the duty of the City Council as a Sanitary Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or is found dead in the area, where no other arrangements have been made for the disposal of the body. The Council is empowered to recover the cost of burial from the estate of the deceased, and is eligible to receive payments in respect of the cost of such burial from death grants payable under the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946. 39 Where persons without known relatives die in the City, it is frequently necessary not only to arrange for their burial, but to dispose ot the contents of their homes. This is done in consultation with the Treasury Solicitor. Such action is necessary to enable the proceeds to be applied towards the cost of burial and also to avoid rent accruing and to release the accommodation for housing purposes as early as possible. During the year 41 burials were undertaken by the City Council in its cemetery at Hanwell, the requests for such burials being received from the following sources :— H.M. Coroner's Officer 23 Relatives of the deceased 9 Friends of the deceased — Hospitals in the City 9 41 Coroner's Court and Mortuary. During 1955, 332 bodies were received in the Mortuary on Coroner's Warrants, etc. Seven bodies were admitted to await burial. Number of Cases.

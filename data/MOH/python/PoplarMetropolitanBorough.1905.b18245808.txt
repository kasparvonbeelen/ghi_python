To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with "The Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my thirteenth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1905, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. vital statistics. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1905, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 169,744 :— Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,684,794 59,654 67,499 42,591 a 2 being 62.6 (see footnote) inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 72 94 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 5116 per acre in Poplar Parish, 111.5 in Bromley, and 76.74 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1905. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports ; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Parish of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three parishes might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., and VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. During the year 1905, 20 births were forwarded—16 by the Medical Officer of Stepney and 1 by the Medical Officer of Finsbury. 14 of the Stepney births occurred in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road, and 2 in the London Hospital. The 4 births in Finsbury took place in the City of London Lying-in Hospital. Mothers' Home, Commercial Road. poplar. bromley. bow. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male.

"Other births might have occurred within the jurisdiction of the Poplar " Sanitary Authority, which did not belong to the Borough, and now such " information could only be ascertained after great trouble, but these births " could readily have been made known to the Medical Officer of Health if the " Registrars had made weekly returns according to the approval of the " Registrar-General. " If returns of births are received weekly from the Registrars, those births " not belonging to the Borough can be reported to the various Medical Officers "of Health, and 'Hints regarding the Management of Infants' can be " immediately posted off to the mothers of children belonging to Poplar." * The three births which occurred in the City of London Union Infirmary and forwarded to the Medical Officer of the City of London were births of illegitimate children, not included in these figures (06). Of the 24 births which occurred in the Stepney Union Workhouse, 13 were illegitimate births (9 male and 4 female), not included in the 106. 5 During the year the marriages of 2846 persons were registered in the Borough, giving an annual rate of 16.7 per 1000 of the estimated population, the rate for England and Wales being 15.3 and for London 16.9. The annual marriage rate per 1000 living being :— Poplar and Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

Treating the 1791 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 778 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 209 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1222. From the 456 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 29 non-residents and added 267 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 694 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III. that in considering the deaths 6 of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, that certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 3045 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 479 deaths of actual non-residents and 427 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2993. upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1077 deaths in Poplar included 14 illegitimate children, 5 male and 9 female; the 1222 deaths in Bromley included 13 illegitimate children, 7 male and 6 female; the 694 Bow deaths included 7 illegitimate children, 4 male and 3 female, making a total for the Borough of 34 deaths of illegitimate children.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the years 1901-1904, females also exceeded the males. 7 The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 21 years (see page 2):— Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

A Conference on the Prevention of Infantile Mortality, and the "Welfare of Nursing Mothers and Suckling Infants, was held at the Town Hall, Pancras Road, N.W., on Monday, the 5th day of June, 1905. * For Tables of Infantile Mortality, see Tables XIII., XIV., XV. and XVI., pages 39-42. 11 resolutions . A.—Mothers. 1. That it is desirable that every encouragement should be given to prospective mothers to seek advice as to the management of their health, so that they may endow their offspring with good constitutions and prepare themselves to suckle their infants when born. 2. That it is desirable that all efforts should be exhausted upon improving the health of suckling mothers before devoting attention solely to their infants. B.—Breast-feeding of Infants. 1. That it is desirable that births should be registered within five days of their occurrence, as is required in the case of deaths by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, and be not delayed for six weeks and longer as now by law permitted. 2. That it is desirable that the municipal authority should obtain weekly returns of births from the Registrars. 3. That it is desirable that the municipal authority should send to the addresses of all mothers, furnished in the weekly returns, cards or leaflets of advice, laying greatest stress on the improvement of ante-natal conditions, on the preparation for and maintenance of breast-feeding of infants during the first nine months of life, and strongly advising mothers not to wean their infants prematurely except upon medical advice. 4. That it is desirable that women inspectors should bo appointed with a view to the prevention of infantile mortality by selecting from the weekly returns suitable cases amongst the poor for inquiry, affording general information in the hygiene of nursing, and directing the necessitous poor where to apply for such advice and assistance as may be urgently required in order to maintain breast-feeding. 12 5. That it is desirable that medical practitioners, midwives and nurses, the staffs of hospitals and dispensaries, and the religious, charitable and social organisations should co-operate with the municipal authority in endeavouring to encourage breast-feeding and to diminish the infantile mortality. 6. That it is desirable that any suggestions or arrangements made by medical practitioners or by the medical charities for the purpose of advising nursing mothers with a view to preventing infantile mortality should be communicated to the municipal authority in order that they may be made known through the women inspectors. 7. That it is desirable that the information should be spread broadcast that breast-feeding is the most economical, easy and safe mode of feeding infants under nine months of age, with a view to reducing the number of hand-fed sucklings to the smallest proportion possible. C.—Premature Weaning. 1. That it is undesirable that a suckling mother should be separated from her infant, or the infant from the mother, except for reasons of ill-health and under medical advice. 2. That it is desirable that a suckling mother if obliged to work at a trade should work at home as an outworker, rather than in a workplace away from home vjhich may necessitate weaning, and that to facilitate the fetching and returning of work materials by outworkers, rapid and cheap means of transit radiating from business centres are necessary. [This resolution was withdrawn, on account of the strong opposition of a representative of the Trades Unionism, which Is seeking to abolish home work altogether.] 3. That it is desirable that when a woman inspector has reason to believe that a suckling mother is in a necessitous condition and unprovided with sufficient food to enable her to maintain her own 13 strength and suckle her infant as well, she should endeavour to prevent weaning by reporting the case to the charitable organisation most appropriate to deal with the circumstances. 4. That it is desirable that when a woman inspector finds that a suckling mother has insufficient nourishment, due to the husband being out of work, she should report the case to the labour bureau. 5. That it is desirable that mothers should be urged not to wean their infants until the ninth month of age except upon medical advice. 6. That it is desirable that mothers should be warned that the hand-feeding of infants is expensive, troublesome and unsatisfactory, risky at all times, and, in summer, dangerous and often fatal, 7. That with a view not to encourage premature weaning, it is desirable that milk for the hand feeding of infants provided privately or publicly by milk depots at or below cost should be distributed upon the orders of medical practitioners. D.—Hand-feeding of Infants. 1. That, having reduced the number of sucklings required to be hand-fed to the smallest proportion possible, menus should be devised for providing suitable milk for the remainder. 2. That it is undesirable to encourage the use of pasteurised or sterili.sed milk for the use of hand-fed infants who unfortunately cannot be fed from the breast. 3. That it is desirable that cow's milk intended for hand-fed infants should be milked, transported and distributed under special precautions. 4. That the special precautions required in the production of cow's milk for infants should include not only care in the selection, testing and feeding of the cows, but also care in their pasturing, sheltering and tending, not only extreme cleanliness in milking, but also rigid aseptic precautions, accompanied by immediate 14 refrigeration, maintained during transport, and by prompt dispatch so that the number of micro-organisms and the lactic acid in the milk may be reduced to a minimum at the time of delivery instead of the hundreds of thousands and millions of organisms and excess of lactic acid now to be found in so-called fresh milk. 5. That in order to prevent the pollution of infants' milk in distribution and in the home, it is desirable that it should be protected iu stoppered bottles ready for feeding, and not be transferred to other bottles. 6. That on account of the facilities that hand-feeding affords for the over-feeding and under-feeding of infants, due to want of knowledge, especially amongst the poor, it is desirable that the quantity and quality of milk required for each feed at the particular age should be distributed in a separate stoppered bottle, and that each basket or crate of bottles for use should be accompanied by instructions as to the frequency and manner of feeding. 7.—That the provision of cow's milk produced under aseptic conditions accompanied by extreme cleanliness, refrigeration and dispatch, so diluted and enriched and put up in stoppered bottles in such quantities, to be administered at specified intervals suitable for suckling infants, should be regarded not only as ordinary food, but in the nature of medical assistance. 8.—That for the special protection of hand-fed infants it is desirable that Municipal Authorities should not only ascertain the quality of milk intended for infants by chemical analysis, and receive from the public analyst a statement of the percentage composition of each sample of milk submitted, as to fat, solids not fat, and total solids, and the absence of chemical preservatives, but also by bacteriological examination, and receive from a bacteriologist a statement in regard to each sample of milk submitted as to the number of micro-organisms per cubic centimetre and the proportion of lactic acid per cent., these being the best existing teste of cleanliness and freshness of the milk. 15 Municipal Creches. At the meeting of the County Council held on 25th July, the scheme for establishing municipal créches was withdrawn. Milk Depôts (London) Bill. The Committee had under consideration the Milk Depots (London) Bill, which provides that Metropolitan Borough Councils may establish and maintain Milk Depots. In December, 1903, the Council referred it to the Committee to consider the desirability of making the necessary arrangements for establishing a municipal milk supply for the Borough, on lines similar to those at present in operation at Battersea and St. Helen's, and the Committee submitted a full report on the subject, and informed the Couucil that in the present state of the law the Council had no power to establish a sterilized humanized Milk Depôt. The Committee were of opinion the powers sought to be conferred by the Bill are desirable with a view to the reduction of infantile mortality, and recommended the Council that the Milk Depots (London) Bill be approved, and the members representing the Borough in Parliament urged to support the meaauie. The object of this Bill, presented by Mr. T. Lough, and supported by Sir Charles Dilke among others, is to legalise action already taken by some of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and to authorise the others to take similar action, in establishing depots for the sale of pure and sterilized milk for the use of infants. In the memorandum prefixed to the Bill it is stated that the expenditure involved is very small; but that ''in the absence of legal power to carry on their depots the expenditure is surcharged by the Local Government Board auditor. The Board has, however, 16 each year, remitted the surcharge at Battersea, and has intimated that it will do so in the case of Lambeth. It is the object of this Bill to remove that difficulty, and to confer power upon such councils as wish to adopt this Act to maintain milk depots free from the fear of surcharge." There are three operative clauses. The first gives power to the Council to establish milk depots; the second enacts that the expenses shall be paid out of the general rate, and the third defines a milk depot to mean " an establishment for the purification, improvement, preservation, sterilization, and sale of milk and cream." It will be remembered that at the Conference of Representatives of the Metropolitan Borough Councils held at the County Hall at Spring Gardens in July, 1904, a resolution in favour of such power as the Bill proposes being conferred on the Borough Councils, was unanimously adopted in the following terms : — Municipal Milk Depots—That, having regard to the declining birth-rate and the high rate of infantile mortality in the metropolis, it is desirable that the Metropolitan Borough Councils should be empowered, at their discretion, to provide in their respective districts depots for the preparation and sale of sterilized and humanized milk for the food of infants, and that the London County Council be requested to insert a clause in their General Powers Bill for the Session of 1905 to confer such power upon the said Borough Councils." age mortality.

Together with Mr. Councillor Bacon, I attended at the Offices of the Charity Organisation Society a Conference respecting "The need of Sanatoria for persons suffering from Consumption, and how it may be supplied." The resolutions passed at the Conference were as follows: — "That it is of urgent importance that further and more complete public provision be made for cases of phthisis. "That it is desirable that provision be made by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for persons suffering from Phthisis who are or may from time to time become chargeable to the poor rates. "That the Council of the Charity Organisation Society approach the following societies with a view to those or similar resolutions being submitted to the Local Government Board jointly, viz., the Society of Medical Officers of Health, the National Association for the Prevention of Consumption, the National Health Society, the Royal Sanitary Institute. "The last resolution was carried on the understanding that the words 'amongst others' should be inserted after the words 'the following societies.' " The General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board had under consideration a memorial from the Metropolitan Branch of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health urging the provision by the Board of Sanatoria for Consumptives. It was stated— (1) That between 7,000 and 8,000 persons (of whom the large majority are adults in the prime of life) die every year in London from pulmonary phthisis (consumption), the 21 mortality in the male sex being some 40 per cent. greater than in the female sex, and that a much larger number of persons (also chiefly adults) suffer from ill-health arising from the same. (2) That great loss accrues to the community from these deaths and this morbidity from pulmonary phthisis (consumption), and many deaths and much illness and suffering might be prevented were hospitals provided for the treatment of this disease. (3) That persons suffering from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) may be divided roughly into two classes (1) those in the primary stage of the disease, which is curable and not specially infectious; and (2) those in the chronic stage of the disease, which is incurable and very infectious. (4) That for those in the primary stage of the disease hospitals are required, wherein the patients may be treated with a view to cure, and for those in the chronic stage refuges, wherein the patients may be isolated, so as to be provented from spreading the disease to others. (5) That the present (existing) provision of hospitals for pulmonary phthisis (consumption) in London is totally inadequate, and that, in connection with such provision as there is, great difficulty (and consequent delay) is experienced in obtaining admittance thereto, more especially when, as usually is the case, the "letter" system prevails, rendering it necessary for patients not only to have to wait long for their turn, and so lose the advantage of special and valuable treatment in the early stage of the disease, but also to find that, when admitted, they are rarely kept in hospital long enough to obtain a cure. 22 (6) That the pressing need for the moment is the provision of a hospital or hospitals in the country for the treatment of persona in the acute and curable stage of the disease. (7) That, having regard to the provision now made, or which could be made, in separate wards at the various Poor Law infirmaries, the chronic cases might, for the present at any rate, be kept in town, where they could be visited by iheir friends. (8) That the need for sanatoria arises from the fact that it is practically impossible to treat poor persons in their own homes or in Poor Law infirmaries, in London, with any reasonable hope of cure. (9) That the great bulk of the cases occur amongst the poor and the poorest classes of the people, who are unable to make any contribution towards the expenses incident to sanatorium treatment. [N.B.—In 1899 (the only year for which reliable statistics are available) a third of the deaths in London from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) occurred in Poor Law Institutions. Many of these sufferers might have been cured, could they have obtained sanatorium treatment at the beginning of their illnesses, and a large amount of poverty and charge on the rates have been thereby avoided. It is well known that many persons reduced by consumption to a state of poverty drift into the Workhouse and become a permanent charge upon the rates, often leaving widows and orphans in a state of destitution, whereas many such persons might be cured if sanatorium treatment were made available for them in the early stages of their diseases.] 23 (10) That whilst the deaths in London in 1904 from the diseases admissible to the Board's hospitals (small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria and fever) aggregated only 1,415, of which 1,094 were due to scarlet fever and diphtheria (upwards of 90 per cent. being deaths of children under the age of five years), the deaths from pulmonary phthisis (consumption) alone, and exclusive of all other tubercular diseases, were 7,738 in number, and of these a vast proportion were deaths of adult men and women (more especially men in the prime of life). (11) That the money value to the community of the lives lost every year from this preventable and curable disease is enormous, and immensely transcends any possible cost to the rates by sanatorium provision. The proceedings suggested by the Metropolitan Asylums Board were— (1) That an Order of the Local Government Board be obtained to make Section 5 of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, applicable to the case of "poor persons" suffering from pulmonory phthisis (consumption); and, if necessary, (2) That an Act be obtained to make the provisions of Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, applicable to pulmonary phthisis (consumption) as if such disease were therein mentioned as well as "fever, small pox, or diphtheria." The General Purposes Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board asked for any observations of the Council on these proposals. The Council had already adopted resolutions urging the Metropolitan Asylums Board to take the necessary steps for the provision of sanatoria for consumptives, and, notwithstanding the expenditure involved, the Public Health and Housing Committee were of 24 opinion it is urgently necessary such provision should he made, and recommended the Council endorse this opinion, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board be so informed. SPITTING AND PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION. Respecting spitting, except into proper receptacles, the Public Health and Housing Committee considered it desirable, with a view to the prevention of consumption, that public notices should be issued cautioning persons against spitting in the public thoroughfares, and recommended the Council that notices against public spitting be posted throughout the Borough. In aid of the prevention of consumption and other diseases, large bills requesting the public not to spit on the footways or public thoroughfares were posted about the district. Cards made to hang up respecting spitting as mentioned above were sent to all the public institutions in the Borough, viz., Public Baths. Libraries, Sick Asylum, City of London Union Infirmary, Stepney Union Workhouse, Poplar Hospital and institutions belonging to the Guardians. Cards were also left by the Sanitary Inspectors at factories, workshops and work-places, with the request that they might be exhibited about the works. Cards were also distributed at the common lodging-houses and the seamon's lodging-houses. PHYSICAL DETERIORATION AND ALCOHOLISM. The Committee considered the reference from the Council on the subject of the desirability of posting throughout the Borough a bill on Physical Deterioration and Alcoholism. 25 The Committee recommended the Council that the following placard be approved and circulated.— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR. PHYSICAL DETERIORATION AND ALCOHOLISM. The Report of the Committee, presented to Parliament by command of His Majesty, states that: The abuse of alcoholic stimulants is a most potent and deadly agent of Physical Deterioration; Alcoholic persons are specially liable to tuberculosis and all inflammatory disorders; Evidence was placed before the Committee showing that in abstinence is to be sought the source of muscular vigour and activity; The lunacy figures show a large and increasing number of admissions of both sexes, which are due to drink. The following facts recognised by the Medical Profession are published in order to bring home to men and women the fatal effects of alcohol on physical efficiency: (1) ALCOHOLISM IS A CHRONIC POISONING, resulting from the habitual use of alcohol (whether as spirits, wine or beer), which may never go as far as drunkenness. (2) It is a mistake to say those doing hard work require stimulants. As a fact NO ONE REQUIRES ALCOHOL AS EITHER FOOD OR TONIC. (3) Alcohol is really a narcotic, dulling the nerves like laudanum or opium; its first effect is to weaken a man's self-control while his passions are excited, hence the number of CRIMES which OCCUR UNDER ITS INFLUENCE. (4) SPIRITS, as usually taken, rapidly PRODUCE ALCOHOLISM, but MILDER ALCOHOLIC DRINKS, as beer, and even cider, drunk repeatedly everyday, PRODUCE, after a time, ALCOHOLIC POISONING, with equal certainty. (5) THE HABIT OF DRINKING leads to the RUIN OF FAMILIES, the neglect of social duties, disgust for work, MISERY, THEST and CRIME. It leads also to the hospital, for ALCOHOL PRODUCES the most various and the most FATAL DISEASES, including paralysis, insanity, diseases of the stomach and liver, and dropsy. It also paves the way to consumption, and frequenters of public-houses furnish a large proportion of the victims of this disease. It complicates and aggravates all acute dissases: typhoid fever, pneumonia, and erysipelas, are much more fatal in the subject of alcoholism. (6) THE SINS OF ALCOHOLIC PARENTS ARE VISITED ON THE CHILDREN; if these survive infancy, they are threatened with idiocy or epilepsy, and many are carried away by tuberculosis, meningitis, or consumption. (7) In short, ALCOHOLISM IS THE MUST TERRIBLE ENEMY TO PERSONAL HEALTH, TO FAMILY HAPPINESS, and TO NATIONAL PROSPERITY. council Officers, High Street, Poplar, 2nd November, 1905. By Order, LEONARD POTTS, Town Clerk. 26 The bill on "Physical Deterioration and Alcoholism," together with the cards against public spitting with a view to the prevention of consumption, were forwarded to a number of occupiers of factories and workshops in the Borough and likewise to clergymen. The bill and cards were enclosed with a letter, stating that if permission were granted for the bill and cards to be exhibited in any premises within this Borough with which the above-mentioned occupiers and clergymen were connected, varnished copies on cardboard would be furnished. A small handbill on "Physical Deterioration and Alcoholism " was also enclosed. Colonel Long's Committee asked for the appointment of a representative of the Council on a deputation to the Prime Minister or other member of the Government to urge effect be given to the recommendation of the Inter-departmental Committee on Physical Deterioration, that an enquiry be held into the question of venereal diseases. The Council had already approved the request for an enquiry, and the Committee appointed Mr. Councillor A. G. Smith to attend the deputation. 27 TABLE I.

Arrangements have been made with the Metropolitan Asylums Board that where bacteriological examinations have been carried out the results, instead of being telephoned to the Board's Central Offices as in the past, shall be intimated to the Medical Superintendents as soon as possible, either in writing, upon the removal orders, if such orders come through the Public Health Offices, or by letters as soon as notices of admissions to the hospitals are received at the Public Health Offices. 56 BOW.

The percentage on the total scarlet fever cases was 1.51, diphtheria cases 6.31, and enteric fever cases 34.37. Amongst the 15 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 3 of erythema, 2 of tonsillitis, 1 of rotheln, 1 of varicella, 1 of pneumonia and 1 of scalds. Amongst the 31 cases wrongly certified 58 as diphtheria were 11 of tonsillitis, 1 of pneumonia, 1 of pharyngeal abscess, 1 of measles, 1 of coryza, 1 of stomatitis and 1 of influenza. Amongst the 11 cases wrongly certified as enteric fever were 7 of pneumonia, 1 of gastritis, 1 of enteritis, 1 of diarrhoea, and 1 of general tuberculosis. In the course of the year 1904 no fewer than 1,993 patients against 1,913 in 1903 and 2,108 in 1902, or a percentage on the total admissions of 10 7 in 1904, 10 4 in 1903 and 8.6 in 1902 were, after admission at the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certi6cates upon which they were removed to hospital. The number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar and London for the years 1899—1905, and removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals, have been as follow— Percentage of mistakes in total admissions.

It was suggested a Conference should be held between the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Borough Councils, with a view to discussing remedies for the state of affairs referred to. 59 The Committee were of opinion a Conference was desirable, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the Holbora Borough Council be informed the Council would be prepared to appoint representatives in the event of a Conference being convened as proposed. Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbingg from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever bacteriologically examined. Arrangements are made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. One case of measles and three of scarlet fever were connected with milkshops in Poplar. One case of diphtheria, five of scarlet fever, three of measles and two of typhoid fever were connected with milkshops in Bromley. One case of scarlet fever, five of diphtheria and one of measles were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.‡ For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 79. Fifty-six premises with outworkers* were connected with infectious cases notified, 13 in Poplar, 20 in Bromley, and 23 in Bow —33 scarlet fever, 17 diphtheria, 1 typhoid fever, 5 erysipelas. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Nineteen cases of measles * * (4 Poplar, 8 Bromley, and 7 Bow) were also connected with out- ‡ See page 125. * See pages 119 and 166. * * See page 104. 60 workers' premises, and where work was found on the premises, it was disinfected before being returned if there were any likelihood of infection, but there is no power to prevent work being executed on outworkers' premises where measles exists. The Lambeth Borough Council called attention to a case of infectious disease occurring at a post office. The Sanitary Officers were notified they had no right of inspection, the premises being Crown property ; but they were permitted to make an inspection, which revealed serious sanitary defects, and disinfection was carried out also on sufferance. The Lambeth Council requested the London County Council to take such action as might be necessary to authorise Government property being inspected and dealt with under the Public Health Acts by Sanitary Authorities, and asked that other Borough Councils would support its action. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the action of the Lambeth Borough Council be supported. In response to a communication from the London County Council on the subject of the danger of infection in public parks from children suffering from infectious diseases or who have been in contact with persons so suffering, the Committee approved the issue of the following notice, viz.:— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OK POPLAR. Public Health Department, Bow Road (corner of Fairfield Road). PREVENTION of the SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. For the good of the Public, in order to prevent the spread of Infectious Diseases, Parents and Guardians are requested not to allow Children from an Infected House to MIX with other Children in the Parks and Open Spaces until the Premises where the Infectious Disease exists or existed have been Disinfected and are free from Infection. FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health. Copy of the above notice is left at each house when an Infectious Disease is notified and where a case of Measles is known to exist. 61 The Committee had under consideration a report of the Medical Officer of Health for Woolwich on the subject of "Return Cases" and Fever Hospitals as a source of Infection, and the recommendations contained therein, which had been approved by the Woolwich Borough Council and submitted to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, such recommendations being as follow :— (1) That, as far as possible, means should be taken by which Fever Hospitals could be correlated to special Boroughs (e.g., by the allotment of special wards to each Borough.) (2) That each Medical Officer of Health should receive a weekly statement as to the patients of his Borough, shewing— (a) Any alteration in diagnosis. (b) Any new infectious disease supervening during the the week. (3) That on discharge a full Statement of the condition of the patient should be sent to the Medical Officer of Health. (4) That all scarlet fever patients should be examined bacteriologioally for diphtheria on admission and on discharge, and those giving a positive result should be isolated in a special ward. (5) That no diphtheria patients should be discharged until two successive bacteriological examinations of the throat and nostrils have shown the absence of diphtheria bacilli. (6) That more isolation wards should be provided by reducing the period of detention in scarlet fever, where such detention is on account of desquamation only. (7) That the hot bath immediately before discharge should be discontinued. 62 (8) That Dr. Cameron's Report on Return Cases of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever, with his recommendations, be published forthwith. The Asylums Board, as a result of Dr. Simpson's Report, three years ago, appointed Dr. Cameron to investigate the same subject. His report was presented some time ago, but so far the Board has not given it the light of publicity. The Committee were of opinion these proposals, so far as they were not already in operation, should be adopted, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the Metropolitan Asylums Board be so informed, " Return" cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria. ("Lancet," November 18, 1905.) "In all the hospitals which are set apart for the treatment of individuals suffering from infectious diseases every care is naturally taken to prevent discharged convalescent patients from being sources of infection to others. It is a fact, however, that not infrequently when such a patient (particularly if a child) has been at home for a varying period of time one or more individuals in the same house develop the disease. This occurrence takes place more particularly in the case of scarlet fever or of diphtheria. In order to ascertain the circumstances which determine the incidence of these ''return'' cases the Hospitals Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board resolved that a full investigation should be conducted. Dr. A. G. E. Cameron was requested to undertake the inquiry, and his report has recently been published. His instructions were to follow the lines adopted by Professor W. J. R, Simpson in his investigation, which extended from October, 1898, to March, 1899. Dr. Cameron commenced his work on July 1st, 1901, and terminated it at the end of July, 1903. The period covered by the report extends from July 1st, 1901, to July 31st, 1902. The first portion deals with "return" cases of scarlet fever and the second with those of diphtheria. The total number of inquiries made 63 (luring the 13 months amounted to nearly 900, of which about 800 were in connexion with "return" cases of the two diseases which have been named above. In order to avoid confusion Dr. Cameron, in the first place, very wisely defines certain terms which are used in the report, as the term "return" case is frequently applied both to the patient who returns from hospital and to the individual whom he infects after his return. Any patient who in discharge from hospital infects, or is alleged to have infected another, is referred to as the "infecting" case and the person infected, or alleged to have been infected, as the "return" case. Cases occurring in a home at intervals after the outbreak of the disease, that is, after the illness of the first case, are called "secondary" cases. This term, therefore, is not synonymous with "return" caae. It would be well if this phraseology could be adhered to in future communications on this subject. The report is a lengthy one, and it is only possible for us to consider certain points contained in it. We deal, therefore, on this occasion solely with that portion which refers to scarlet fever. As a general rule in this disease the cessation of infection is coincident with the termination of certain clinical signs and morbid manifestations of the disease and to a great extent the period of detention of the patients in the hospital must depend on the duration of these symptoms. As Dr. Cameron observes, however, their presence is not always an indication that the patient is still infectious and, unfortunately, their absence is not a proof to the contrary. Nor can too much reliance be placed on the duration of the illness, for, as the tables in the report show, after many weeks of detention the patient may still be infectious. Each case, therefore, has to be decided on its own merits, and in the circumstances it is not surprising that at times it is most difficult, if not impossible, to say when a patient has ceased to be infectious. In studying the report one fact remains predominant and that is the "infecting" cases' which retain their infection longest, are those which suffer from secondary complications. The complication most frequently present 64 after discharge from the hospital is a morbid condition of the nose. Such cases apparently may continue to be infectious long after removal from the hospital environment. Consequently separate isolation of these patients for a period of ten days before leaving the hospital, if efficacious at all, can only be so to a limited extent. It is further pointed out in the report that patients may continue to be infectious for some time after the objective signs of the complications have disappeared. A child, therefore, may be sent home apparently quite free from infection, and yet within a short period recurrence of the nasal discharge may take place. This is liable to be attended by what appears to be a recrudescence of infection and similarly the occurrence after discharge of other complications, such as tonsillitis, may be followed by "return'' cases. It is worthy of notice that patients discharged suffering from otorrhcea are but seldom associated with the occurrence of "return " cases except when a morbid condition of the nose co-exists. Dr. Cameron considers that the discharge from the nose is not necessarily infectious per se, but in a very large proportion of cases its presence, especially when purulent, is an almost certain indication that the patient is infectious. An impression has prevailed that the duration of infectivity of scarlet fever in any particular instance might be judged by watching the desquamation of the skin; as long as "peeling" was taking place so long was the patient capable of conveying the disease to others. Dr. Cameron states definitely, however, that late desquamation cannot be regarded as evidence of infectiousness. He concludes that in the majority of instances the occurrence of "return" cases appears to be due to a delay in the process of elimination of infection in the " infecting ' cases, and consequently "return" cases may be said to be due to premature discharge. On referring to the tables, however, it will be found that in point of time the proportions of " infecting cases " and "all cases" discharged under eight weeks are the same. He believes that the direct cause of the retardation is probably due 65 to infection by sepsigenic organisms to which aggregation of individuals predisposes. The remedy by which "return" cases may be prevented seems difficult to find. In fact, Dr. Cameron states that under the present conditions of hospital treatment it is impossible to avoid their occurrence. He believes that in the case of patients predisposed to, or who have suffered from, mucous discharges in the hospital the omission in the winter months of the warm bath immediately before discharge and the substitution of one on the previous evening would tend to lessen the number of "return" cases. He also urges that more extended measures of isolation should be provided, and that every means should be employed to assure asepsis in every detail. This rather gloomy view is shared in by the medical superintendents of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's fever hospitals, who add to the report some criticisms which are well worthy of study. They make the significant remark that " in the present state of our knowledge it is difficult to see how the occurrence of return cases can be prevented either in home-treated or hospital-treated patients." In view of such a statement, which cannot but be considered as highly unsatisfactory, we think that at least the measures recommended by Dr. Cameron should be given a trial. But beyond this it seems imperative that further investigations should be made into a matter which so deeply concerns the welfare of the community." METROPOLITAN ASYLUMS BOARD. NOTICE TO THE FRIENDS OF PATIENTS DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL AFTER SUFFERING FROM SCARLET FEVER. It ia recommended— 1. That for three weeks after leaving hospital, the patient should not sleep in the same bed (or, if possible, the same room) as children who have not had scarlet fever. 2. That during this period articles used by the patient (such as cup, plate, spoon, handkerchiefs, towels and toys) should be kept distinct from those used by other children. 3. That the patient should not attend school for three weeks. The above precautions are specially important in the case of those patients who suffer from Discharge from either Nose or Ears.

Under date 3rd July, the General Purposes Committee of the London County Council presented a report on the 25th July, recommending— "That the scheme for the establishment of an ambulance service for London to deal with street accidents within a threemile radius of Charing Cross, and providing for (1) the erection and maintenance of a principal ambulance station and seven district stations, (2) motor ambulances worked by electricity, and (3) a method of giving calls by means of street call-posts fitted with telephones, be approved." The Finance Committee of the County Council reported adversely, on financial grounds, to the recommendation of the General Purposes Committee; but the Council resolved— " That the scheme for an ambulance service for London, set out in the report of the General Purposes Committee, be generally approved, and that it be referred to the General Purposes Committee to report further upon the questions raised by the Finance Committee." 76 DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT.

The Public Health and Housing Committee considered two reports suggesting the manufacture of electrolysed salt water for disinfecting purposes, as a substitute for the disinfectants used in the Borough. The reports were submitted to the Council, and the Council resolved that a plant should be erected in Poplar. Previous to the second report being submitted to the Council the works of M. Hermite at Rolleville, near Havre, France, were visited by Councillor A. G. Smith, the then Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee; Councillor John Bussey, then Chairman of the Electricity Committee; Councillor F. Thorne, then Chairman of the Works Committee; Mr. Bowden, the Electrical Engineer; Mr. McClelland, representative of Messrs. Geipel and Lange, M. Hermite's agents in this country, and myself.* THE CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. The Cleansing of Persons Act provides that:— 1. Any local authority shall have the power, when in their discretion they shall see fit, to permit any person who shall apply to the said authority, on the ground that he is infested with vermin, to have the use, free of charge, of the apparatus (if any) which the authority possess for cleansing the person and his clothing from * Whilst this report is being written a plant has been erected at the Electricity Works Glaucus Street. The fluid is being supplied to the various Depots for distribution to the public, and is also being delivered to the Works Department for watering roads, etc. 78 vermin. The use of such apparatus shall not be considered to be parochial relief or charitable alowance to the person using the same, or to the parent of such person, and no such person or parent shall by reason thereof be deprived of any right or privilege or be subject to any disqualification or disability. Local authorities may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances, and attendants that may be required for the carrying out of this Act, and any expenses for these purposes may be defrayed out of any rate or fund applicable by the authority for general sanitary purposes, or for the relief of the poor. 2. In this Act "local authority" means in England the council of any county borough, the district council of any district, any board of guardians, and in the county of London any sanitary authority as defined in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. It will be noted that the Act is a permissive Act. There is no obligation on the local authority to make any provision for the cleansing and disinfection of verminous persons. The Committee considered a circular from the London County Council on the administration of the Cleansing of Persons Act, and recommended the Council— "That public novices be issued directing attention to the facilities provided at the Disinfecting Station and Shelters for cleansing persons and their clothing from vermin, under the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897." Small bills were posted about the district informing verminous persons where they could be bathed and have their clothes disinfected. The small bills were also left at the common lodginghouses and the seamen's lodging-houses in the Borough. Since the posting of the bills 427 persons applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfected. 79 NOTICES PORT SANITARY AUTHORITIES.

Anxiety was felt that owing to the general diffusion of Cholera in certain parts abroad, the disease might be introduced into this country. Accordingly, the Medical Officers of the different English 85 ports ascertained the addresses of each passenger arriving from an infected port, and these addresses were duly forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health for the several districts. PUERPERAL FEVER. Eight cases of Puerperal Fever were notified, one Poplar, six Bromley, and one Bow. Of the Bromley cases one case was treated in the Sick Asylum and three in the London Hospital. Two deaths occurred from Puerperal Fever. One Bromley and one Bow. The London County Council called attention to a rule of the Central Midwives Board that in certain circumstances a midwife must decline to attend alone and must advise that a medical practitioner be sent for. The London County Council pointed out that in the majority of such cases the husband of the patient is too poor to pay a reasonable fee, and difficulty is experienced in speedily obtaining medical assistance. The Poor Law Guardians have powers to pay for medical and other assistance in cases of accident, bodily casualty, and sudden illness; and Borough Councils may, under the Public Health (London) Act, with the consent of the Local Government Board, provide a temporary supply of medicine and medical assistance to the poorer inhabitants of the Borough. The London County Council had addressed the Guardians and the Borough Councils enquiring whether they would be prepared, under the powers referred to, to pay fees of medical practitioners summoned by a midwife in cases of difficulty or emergency and are unable to obtain payment of their fees. 86 The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion provision should be made for the payment of the fees in such cases, and thought it desirable this should be done by the Guardians rather than by the Borough Councils. The Committee recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the London County Council be so informed. The following letter was addressed to all the Clergymen, Ministers and Nursing Institutions in the Borough of Poplar:— Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. 11th October, 1905. Dear Sir or Madam, Loaned Maternity Outfits —Disinfection. If you are connected in any way with any institution in the Borough of Poplar, which lends out maternity outfits to women, will you kindly make it known at the institution that such articles will be disinfected free of charge upon application being made at these offices ? The disinfection of articles every time immediately after use and in lying-in cases again before lending will reduce risk of infection from child-bed fever. I am, dear Sir or Madam, Yours faithfully, Medical Officer of Health. 87 SMALL POX. No case of Small-pox was notified within the Borough during the year. 74 cases were notified in the Metropolitan Boroughs, as follows*:— London 74 WEST DISTRICTS. EAST DISTRICTS. Paddington 2 Shoreditch 2 Kensington — Bethnal Green 4 Hammersmith — Stepney 13 Fulham — Poplar — Chelsea — City of Westminster 2 SOUTH DISTRICTS. NORTH DISTRICTS.

Greenwich 4 Holborn 1 Lewisham 9 Finsbury 1 Woolwich 7 City of London — Port of London 2 The Greenwich Borough Council called attention to a case of Small-pox which had occurred in the Borough, the patient having come from the West Coast of Africa on a steamship on which Small-pox had occurred. * Extract from "Lancet." 88 On arrival at Southampton the person referred to gave an address at Bermondsey, but proceeded to Greenwich. It was therefore impossible to keep observation on him until the disease had developed and been notified. The Greenwich Borough Council suggested that legislation be promoted to make it a penal offence to give a false address in similar circumstances, and addressed the Local Government Board with that object. The Committee were of opinion the action of the Greenwich Borough Council should be supported, and recommended the Council that the Local Government Board be urged to promote legislation as suggested. VACCINATION.

The Committee were of opinion the action taken by the Camberwell Borough Council should be supported, and recommended the Council that a representation on the subject be addressed to the Local Government Board, and the Members representing Poplar in Parliament be asked to urge on the Board the desirability of the destruction of these carcases as suggested. The Committee considered the reply made by the President of the Local Government Board to a question put by Mr. Sydney 90 Buxton, M.P., on the subject of the sale for food in London of the carcases of calves inoculated for lymph at the Local Government Board Vaccine Stations, to the effect that there was no evidence the carcases of animals used for the purposes referred to were thereby rendered unfit for food; that their destruction would involve an additional charge on the Exchequer of £4,000 a year; and he was therefore not prepared to order the destruction of the carcases as suggested. The Committee recommended the Council to reiterate its protest against the disgusting practice of the sale for food of the carcases of calves inoculated for lymph at the Local Government Board Vaccine Stations. The Committee considered a resolution of the Camberwell Borough Council on the subject of vaccine veal to the effect that, having regard to the additional charge upon the Exchequer (£4,000) if the calves used for the production of lymph be destroyed, the Local Government Board be urged to charge the Local Authorities one penny for the lymph for each vaccination, such charge being sufficient to cover the loss to the Local Government Board of destroying the carcases instead of returning them to the contractor to be sold for food in London. In view of the fact the loss to the Exchequer was advanced by the Government as a reason for their refusal to order the destruction of the carcases referred to, the Committee were of opinion the proposal of the Camberwell Borough Council should be supported, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the Local Government Board be urged to give effect to the proposal. The following communication was received from the Hackney Borough Council:— 91 BOROUGH OF HACKNEY. Town Half, Hackney, N.E. 4th October, 1905. Vaccination as a Preventive of Small Pox. Sir, I am directed by the Borough Council of Hackney to forward you copy of resolutions adopted by the Council, at their last meeting, upon the above subject, as follows:— 1.—That in the opinion of this Council the time has now arrived for the Government to institute a thorough enquiry into the general question of vaccination as a preventive of Small-pox, having regard to the advance of medical science, and the public rejection of vaccination by so many medical men, since the last Report of the Royal Commission on this question. The enquiry to embrace:— (a) The supply of pure lymph and the danger to the public of vaccinated calves being sold for food. (b) The administration of the various Vaccination Acts with special regard to the cost to the Ratepayers. (c) The hardships inflicted upon poor conscientious jectors, who apply for exemption certificates under the Act of 1898, by the unwillingness of many Justices of the Peace and Stipendiary Magistrates to grant certificates of exemption in compliance with the spirit of the Act. (d) The closing of Government departments and other works to conscientious objectors, or the children of 92 conscientious objectors, whose qualifications may be otherwise excellent, notwithstanding the above mentioned Act, and the refusal of the Education Department to allow winners of the London County Council scholarships to take them up unless they submit to vaccination. (e) The refusal of the Metropolitan Asylums Board during the winter of 1904-5 to employ unemployed workmen sent to them by the Hackney Labour Bureau, unless they submitted to vaccination or re-vaccination. 2.—That a copy of this resolution be sent to the Prime Minister, the President of the Local Government Board, the President of the Board of Education, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, the Right Hon. Sir H. CampbellBannerman, M.P., the London County Council, the Corporation of the City of London, the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils and Boards of Guardians. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, W. A. WILLIAMS. Town Clerk. The Committee were of opinion it was desirable an enquiry in the general question of vaccination should be held, and recommended the Council that the action of Hackney Borough Council in endeavouring to secure a Government enquiry on the subject of vaccination be supported. 93 SCARLET FEVER.

Seventy cases of Diphtheria and 3 cases of Membranous Croup were notified in Poplar, 138 cases of Diphtheria and 2 cases of Membranous Croup were notified in Bromley, and 278 cases of Diphtheria and no cases of Membranous Croup were notified in Bow, making a total of 486 cases of Diphtheria and 5 cases of Membranous Croup for the whole Borough. * The Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine upon being communicated with respecting "feeble widal reactions," Dr. Allan Macfayden, the Acting Director, answered: "It is our rule to regard cases which give a feeble reaction as doubtful and to ask the practitioner for a fresh sample, in order that the blood examination may be repeated at a later stage of the illness with a more decisive result. There are also cases not clinically Typhoid, as well as cases in which there has been a previous attack of this disease, where widal reactions of the above character may be obtained. This, however, does not lessen the real substantial value of the widal reaction, if properly carried out on the lines indicated." 99 Cases notified:— Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

At the end of the year there were 1,100 entries in the Measles Register (374 Poplar, 401 Bromley, and 325 Bow), representing the number of premises where Measles had been stated to have occurred. Upon enquiry 5 cases were stated to have recovered, 105 were found not to be cases, but 106 of these cases were stated to be suffering from a different disease other than the one notified, 57 wrong addresses and unknown were given, 18 belonged to other Boroughs (one to Bethnal Green, and 17 died in Sick Asylum belonging to Stepney Borough), and 16 moved away before enquiries could be made. So that practically as far as is known 798 cases of Measles occurred in the Borough. One case of Measles occurred in connection with milk shops. 390 rooms were disinfected by the Public Health Department, and the remainder were disinfected by the tenants, medical practitioners giving certificates that disinfection had been satisfactorily carried out. Respecting outworkers and the articles disinfected by the Council, see pages 59 and 76. On account of the large number of cases of Measles reported from the Infants' Department of the Roman Road School, the Medical Officer of the London County Council Educational Department was communicated with; he was informed classroom E was particularly affected, there being 43 scholars on the roll and only 13 present. It was suggested that the classroom be disinfected on Saturday, 4th March. The Medical Officer replied that he had arranged for classroom E to be cleansed on that date. A letter was received on the 26th May from the Medical Officer (Education) London County Council, stating that owing to the 105 prevalence of Measles in the Infants' Department of the St. Luke's School, West Ferry Road, he had advised the closure of classroom C until the 4th June. As this letter was the first intimation of the prevalence of Measles at this school, the Medical Officer (Education) was asked to kindly instruct the teachers to give notice respecting the exclusion of scholars to the Public Health Department, the same as the teachers of other schools do under the regulations. The classroom was disinfected by the Public Health Department. DIARRHŒA.* Deaths from Diarrhœa for the past thirteen years were as follows:— Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

A letter was received, dated 24th August, 1905, from the Secretary of the Local Government Board, stating that he was directed "by the Local Government Board to state that they have reason to believe that the fact that Cerebro-Spinal Fever has recently been somewhat extensively prevalent in Central Europe and in America has given rise in some quarters to a doubt whether the disease in question may not have newly extended to or have been developing in this country. "The Board think it desirable, therefore, to state that, as far as they have been able to ascertain, there is no ground for such apprehension. It appears, in fact, to be probable that Cerebrospinal Fever is at the present time not more prevalent in this. country than it has been from time to time during the last quarter of a century. "Nevertheless, the Board consider that Sanitary Authorities should be on the alert to detect the presence of the disease in their districts, or to satisfy themselves as to its absence; and to this end the Board have issued a memorandum, which has been prepared by their Medical Officer, dealing generally with the characteristic symptoms of the disease, and especially with its minor and anomalous manifestations. Copies of this memorandum are enclosed, and I am to request that one of the copies, together with a copy of this circular, may be given to the Medical Officer of Health for his information. "In the event of the discovery in any district of groups of cases of illness which might possibly be of the nature of Cerebrospinal Fever, it would, of course, be important that the facts 107 should be made the subject of a special report to the Sanitary Authority by the Medical Officer of Health for the district, and that a copy of such report should at the same time be forwarded to the Board. Should such a report be received, the Board would be prepared to render the Sanitary Authority such advice or assistance as, in the circumstances, might appear to be necessary. In the event of the Sanitary Authority desiring, in view of any special circumstances, that cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever should be made compulsorily notifiable in their district, tne Board would be prepared to consider an application for their approval to a resolution of the Authority extending the provisions of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, to that disease for a limited period." Memorandum on Cerebro-Spinal Fever. "Cerebro-Spinal Fever, known also as epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, Spotted Fever, and by many other less frequently used names, has recently attracted renewed attention in this country by reason of the serious mortality occasioned by disease of this class in New York and in certain localities on the Continent of Europe. Interest in this malady has been further stimulated by the public notice which has been taken of the recent identification of a case in the neighbourhood of London, and of several cases, four of which terminated fatally, at Irthlingborough in Northamptonshire. Cerebro-Spinal Fever is not of rare occurrence in the United Kingdom. In the course of the last forty years this malady is known to have been prevalent in a considerable number of different localities in England and Wales, several of these local outbreaks having taken place in recent years. In some instances they have formed the subject of investigation by a medical Inspector of the 108 Local Government Board, whose report has usually been made public. Occurrences of Cerebro-spinal Fever have also been observed in Scotland and in Ireland. There is indeed, as will appear later, reason for belief that this disease is even less uncommon in this country than the foregoing particulars would seem to indicate." The late Mr. Netten Radcliffe defined Cerebro-Spinal Fever as "an acute, epidemic disease, characterised by profound disturbances of the central nervous system, indicated at the onset chiefly by shivering, intense headache or vertigo, or both, and persistent vomiting: subsequently by delirium, often violent, alternating with somnolence or a state of apathy or stupor: an acutely painful condition with spasm—sometimes tetanoid—of certain groups of muscles, especially the posterior muscles of the neck, occasioning retraction of the head; and an increased sensitiveness of the surface of the body. Throughout the disease there is marked depression of the vital powers; not unfrequently collapse: and in its course an eruption of vesicles, petechial, or purpuric spots, or mottling of the skin, is apt to occur. If the disease tend to recovery, the symptoms gradually subside without any critical phenomena, and convalescence is protracted: if to a fatal termination, death is almost invariably preceded by coma. After death the enveloping membranes of the brain and spinal cord are found in a morbid state, of which the most notable signs are engorgement of the blood vessels, usually excessive, and an effusion of sero-purulent matter into the meshes of the pia mater and beneath the arachnoid." A copy of the Memorandum in extenso was sent to each Medical Practitioner in the Borough. 109 INQUESTS AND DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE.

"Two certificates of repairs were endorsed and forwarded, as requested, to Urban Authorities after inspection of the work done to the boats. h 114 "A dozen or more non-registered boats have been boarded for inspection, but no persons were found on board and the cabins were found to be locked up. "Of the nine registered boats inspected, this includes four visits to one boat, and two visits to another." † Mr. Langley's 54 inspections of non-registered boats include two visits to each of two boats. ‡ Mr. R. E. Miners reported:— " Of the 42 inspections of non-registered boats made, 2 boats were visited twice, 1 boat three times, and 1 boat four times. There was no evidence of contravention." ** Mr. A. J, Field reported:— "In one instance the change of master was not notified in this district, and no certificate was aboard boat. The master said he had run the boat temporarily with an odd freight. Letters to owner and Registration Authority, Uxbridge." Of the 22 inspections made by Mr. Field of registered boats, 4 boats were visited twice. § Mr. Boyce's 5 inspections of registered boats, 1 boat was visited twice; and of the 50 non-registered boats inspected by him, 2 boats were visited twice. WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES AND OUTWORKERS. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 116 and 117. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. 115 A register of bakehouses is also kept. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 870, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table D, pages 119, 120 and 121. The places where the outworkers are employed were inspected all of them twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 235 and 236, and the Sanitary Inspector's reports, pages 181, 194, 199, 206, 213, 224 and 232. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 59. A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see page 119) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops, and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. h 2 116 TABLE A.

Summonses were applied for in four instances, see pages 162-165. A Conference on Smoke Abatement was convened by the Royal Sanitary Institute in conjunction with the Coal Smoke Abatement Society, and was held in London on 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th December, 1905. Delegates were sent from the Public Health and Housing Committee.

Town Hall, Walworth Road, S.E. 13th November, 1905. Food and Drugs Acts, 187o-1899—Warranties. Dear Sir, The Borough Council at their last meeting had under consideration a report from the Public Analyst drawing attention to proceedings recently instituted against a milk dealer with 134 regard to a sample of milk containing 20 per cent. added water. The case was dismissed by the Police Magistrate because the milk had been warranted by a large Dairy Company. The Borough Council are informed that if the case was taken to Appeal there would be little or no chance of reversing the Magistrate's decision, and the Council are unable to proceed against the Warrantor because the warranty is dated September, 1904, or more than six months ago. The result is that milk is being sold in the Borough containing 20 per cent. of added water, and it is absolutely impossible to fix the responsibility. The Borough Council are informed that this is by no means an isolated experience: thus with regard to proceedings with respect to adulterated milk samples for the six months ending 30th September, 1905, it appears that of 20 samples in which police court proceedings have been instituted, six cases have been dismissed owing to a warranty being proved; that is to say, in 30 per cent., or nearly a third, of the cases summoned for milk adulteration, no one is brought to account. The Borough Council are of opinion that the facts as disclosed by the above report shew a very unsatisfactory condition of affairs and one which demands immediate attention. The Borough Council approached the County Council some little time ago on the matter, but no action has, up to the present, been taken by that Body. I am now instructed to point out the urgent necessity for each of the Borough Councils to approach the Local Government Board and the London County Council with a view of 135 impressing upon these Bodies the desirability of proceeding to initiate legislation to obviate the anomalies complained of at the earliest possible moment. I am also desired to enquire whether, in the event of the Borough Council convening a Conference on the question, your Council would be prepared to send representatives to such a Conference. Yours faithfully, J. A. JOHNSON, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, Borough of Poplar. Similar cases to those quoted had occurred in the Poplar Borough, and the attention of the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture had been called to the abuses arising from these warranties. The Committee recommended the Council— That further representations be made to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture, urging legislation on the subject; and that the Council do agree to take part in the proposed Conference if convened. The sale of Whisky Bill was submitted to the Committee. The object of the Bill is to secure the purchasers of whisky a clear statement whether it is a whisky made in a pot still from pure malt, or of malt and corn, or is in part a spirit made in a patent still from unmalted grain. To carry out this object, the Bill proposes to enact that all whisky shall, from the time of 136 leaving the distillery till sold to the consumer, be described by a mark or label on the cask or bottle as "whisky" or "blend of whisky and patent still spirit," as the case may be. Provision is made for similar information being given to persons purchasing whisky on draught. Power to prosecute for offences against the Bill is given to officers of Inland Revenue and to officers of Local Authorities executing the laws relating to Food and Drugs. The Committee recommended the Council— That the Bill be approved and the members representing the Borough in Parliament requested to give it their support. The following communication was submitted to the Committee: — BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM. Town Hall, Catford, S.E. 14th July, 1905. Sir, I beg to inform you that this Council have had under consideration the question of the steps to be taken to stop the supply of milk from a farm at which a case of infectious disease has occurred. It has been pointed out to the Council that, should it at any time be deemed necessary to stop the supply of milk from any particular dairy where there was evidence that the consumption of milk from such dairy was likely to cause any infectious disease to any person residing in the district, considerable difficulty would be met with and delay occasioned, 137 as under the existing provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Medical Officer of Health would first have to obtain an order of a Justice having jurisdiction in the place where the dairy was situate to inspect the dairy, and if then of opinion that any infectious disease was caused from consumption of the milk supplied would report the same to the Sanitary Authority, who would have to serve on the dairyman not less than 24 hours' notice to appear before them to show cause why an order should not be made requiring him not to supply any milk therefrom within the district until the order had been withdrawn. This Council are of opinion that in view of the danger of the spread of infection whilst these proceedings are being taken it it very desirable, in the interests of the public health, that greater faculties should be given to Sanitary Authorities in order that the supply of milk from any dairy within or without their district may be stopped where there was reason to believe that the consumption of such milk would be likely to cause any infectious disease, and they suggest that the powers given to Sanitary Authorities under Section 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, would be of greater value if an order to inspect the dairy, and where necessary for the cessation of the supply of milk, were made by a Magistrate presiding in the district in which the milk was distributed. In accordance with the directions of this Council I have addressed a communication to the Local Government Board urging that they will be good enough to consider the matter with a view to steps being taken to promote legislation for 138 giving effect to the above suggestion, and I have been directed to ask that the Poplar Borough Council will support the action of this Council. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, EDWARD WRIGHT, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Committee recommended the Council— That the action of the Lewisham Borough Council be supported. UNSOUND FOOD AND EXAMINATION OF FOOD STUFFS AT WHARVES, &c. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee: — METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF STEPNEY. Municipal Offices, 15, Great Alie Street, Whitechapel, E. 26th January, 1905. Dear Sir, This Council's attention has been called to what they consider a very serious defect in the law relating to unsound food. The Medical Officer of Health has pointed out to them that at the present time, if a person in the country sells to a butcher in town carcases of diseased animals, and the butcher, acting 139 in a straightforward manner, and before he tries to sell the meat, requests the Sanitary Authority to examine it, and such meat is condemned, the Sanitary Authority cannot successfully institute legal proceedings against the original vendor of the meat, because at the time of its surrender the meat is not "exposed for sale or deposited in any place for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale." Proceedings cannot be successfully taken if the meat be seized in transit, as it is not then exposed or deposited for sale as human food, and therefore the original vendor cannot be proceeded against. Again, after delivery to the consignee has actually taken place, it is sometimes ascertained that the latter is a cats'-meat purveyor who is used by the original vendor as a medium for the distribution of the meat for human consumption. Here again, it is impossible to obtain a conviction against the original vendor. This Council has decided, therefore, to ask the! Local Government Board to take steps to amend the law so as to enable Sanitary Authorities to take legal proceedings against the original vendor in such cases, and I am directed to invite your Council to take similar action. Faithfully yours, GEO. W. CLARKE, The Town Clerk of Poplar. Town Clerk. The following is the copy of my report which was presented to the Public Health and Housing Committee upon the subject: — "Respecting the letter dated 26th January (copy of which is enclosed) received from the Town Clerk of the Metropolitan 140 Borough of Stepney, calling attention to what his Council considers a very serious defect in the law relating to unsound food, and stating that his Council has decided to ask the Local Government Board to take steps to amend the law, and inviting the Poplar Borough Council to take similar action, the Medical Officer makes the following remarks as to the state of the law at the present time: — "The section, with its sub-sections, as given below, are not quite clear, but it appears that: "(1) If A sends unsound food to B, and B has not purchased the same but calls in the officers of the Sanitary Authority, then A is liable. "(2) If A sends unsound food to B, who has purchased the same, and the officers of the Sanitary Authority are not called in by B, then B is liable under sub-section 2 and A is liable under subsection 3. "(3) If B purchases unsound food from A, and if B sells the unsound food to C, but the same remains on B's premises, then C, B and A can be proceeded against. "(4) If A sends unsound food to' B, who has purchased the same, and B has paid his money to A, and B calls in the officers of the Sanitary Authority, then no action can take place against either A or B. "It is to deal with the last instance that an amendment of the law is required, inasmuch as a person who sends unsound 141 food to a second person, whether that second person has purchased it or not, should be made liable. "Again, with respect to the letter from Stepney stating that 'proceedings cannot be successfully taken if the meat be seized in transit, as it is not then exposed or deposited for sale as human food, and therefore the original vendor cannot be proceeded against,' the Medical Officer of Health thinks proceedings can be taken, as it was held that diseased meat, placed upon a cart, when passing through the streets of the City of Dublin from the slaughter-house to a place for the manufacture of preserved meats, was properly seized. (Daly v. Webb.) "With respect to the remarks concerning cats'-meat in the correspondence of the Town Clerk of Stepney, the Medical Officer thinks that some of the suggestions in his report to the Public Health and Housing Committee on 'Horse-flesh,' dated the 6th May, 1904, could be made to apply to Cats'-meat, viz.: — Registration of Wholesale Dealers; Inspection of Registers by officers of Local Authorities; and the labelling of all consignments. "PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. ''Section 47.—(1) Any Medical Officer of Health or Sanitary Inspector may at all reasonable times enter any premises and inspect and examine: — "(a) Any animal intended for the food of man which is exposed for sale, or deposited in any place for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale, and "(b) Any article, whether solid or liquid, intended for the food of man, and sold or exposed for sale or deposited 142 in any place for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale, the proof that the same was not exposed or deposited for any such purpose or was. not intended for the food of man, resting with the person charged; and if any such animal or article appears to such Medical Officer or Inspector to be diseased, or unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit for the food of man, he may seize and carry away the same himself or by an assistant, in order to have the same dealt with by a Justice. "(2) If it appears to a Justice that any animal or article which has been seized or is liable to be seized under this section is diseased, or unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit for the food of man, he shall condemn the same, and order it to be destroyed or so disposed of as to prevent it from being exposed for sale or used for the food of man; and the person to whom the same belongs or did belong at the time of sale or exposure for sale, or deposit for the purpose of sale or of preparation for sale, or in whose possession or on whose premises the same was found, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50 for every animal, or article, or if the article consists of fruit, vegetables, corn, bread or flour, for every parcel thereof so condemned, or, at the discretion of the court, without the infliction of a fine, to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, with or without hard labour. "(3) Where it is shown that any article liable to be seized under this section, and found in the possession of any person was purchased by him from another person for the food of man, and when so purchased was in such a condition as to be liable to be seized and condemned under this section, the person who 143 so sold the same shall be liable to the line and imprisonment above mentioned, unless he proves that at the time he sold the said article he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that it was in such condition." The Committee considered it desirable the law should be amended to enable original vendors of unsound food to be proceeded against. It was also suggested that proposals approved by me Council with regard to sale of horse-flesh, viz.: —Registration of Wholesale Dealers; Inspection of Registers by officers of Local Authorities, and labelling of all consignments should be applicable to other meat intended for sale as cats'-meat. The Committee recommended the Council— That the application of the Stepney Borough Council to the Local Government Board be supported, and the Medical Officer's proposals in respect of cats'-meat be also submitted. It has been considered that it is the duty of an Inspector, not having received a written request, to seize unsound food as soon as he finds it, whatever the verbal statement to him may be. This mode of procedure would be clearly wrong, for if a butcher should send for an officer of the Sanitary Authority to inspect bad food which he has put on one side, it is perfectly evident the butcher does not intend it for the food of man at the time he calls in the Inspector, and the officer would not then be justified in seizing it, but if the butcher did not intend taking proper precautions in having it removed, as laid down in section 47, subsection 8, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or in having the article disposed of so as to prevent any risk of it being used for the food of man, then the Inspector might seize the article, 144 and it is apparent the law provides for its condemnation although it is not liable to be seized, for, by section 47, sub-section 2, the Magistrate can deal with an article of food so brought before him: — (2) If it appears to a Justice that any animal or article which has been seized or is liable to be seized under this section shall condemn the same. But it appears that the fact is lost sight of that under sub-section 3 the article must be "liable to be seized," and an article is only liable to be seized when it is intended for the food of man, etc., at the time of the officer's visit; but if B, having received bad food from A, has put the bad food on one side and calls in the officer of the Sanitary Authority it is evident at the time of the calling in of the officer of the Local Authority the article is not liable to be seized, as it is not exposed for sale or deposited in any place for the purpose of sale or preparation for sale. The necessary amendment of the law is to deal with any person (A) who sends unsound food to another person (B), whether that person (B) has paid for it or not, and this is a most important point and would no doubt prevent bad food being put on the market. With respect to the examination of food stuffs see Sanitary Inspector's reports, pages 181, 183-188, 199, 205, 213, 227 and 233. Also, with respect to the examination of food stuffs at wharves, see Inspector's reports, pages 212, 228 and 233. 145 HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. Conference on the London Housing Problem, Unhealthy Areas. The following resolutions were adopted by the Conference on the London Housing Problem convened by the Workmen's National Housing Council, viz.:— 1. That this Conference of delegates from working-class organisations of London and surrounding districts, protests against the existing high rents for house accommodation, the tendency to build houses and rooms of small dimensions, the continued existence of slums and the protracted shortage of house room, with the consequent unhealthy crowding. That as the above conditions directly tend to continue the abnormally high infantile mortality and have a direct bearing on the alarming increase of deaths in Asylums, Workhouses, and Hospitals, this Conference declares these evils to be no longer bearable, and calls upon the Government to provide improved financial facilities for carrying out of Municipal Housing Schemes by either or all of the following methods: — (a) By empowering Local Authorities to issue non-interest bearing notes. (b) By grants from the Imperial Exchequer, and (c) By a tax on site values, a proportion of the funds so raised to be set aside for housing purposes. This Conference urges the London County Council and Borough and Urban District Councils in the area here represented, to use their existing powers to a greater extent than K 146 heretofore, to build houses for the people requiring them, and to let the same at rents which shall cover the actual annual cost, and, so long as the present system of borrowing at interest prevails, shall not include any payment to the redemption sinking fund other than the proportion of it which would be included in the ordinary rate. And this Conference calls upon members of public bodies to join in our demand for the before-mentioned improved financial facilities, and it asks all candidates for Parliament to pledge themselves to work and vote for the same, to the immediate end that every family may be assured of proper house room. 2. That this Conference, while viewing with alarm the agitation now being carried on by some land-owners in favour of entirely abrogating or so modifying rural building bye-laws, that cottages of match-lining and corrugated iron may be built, also deplores the tendency in London and other places to modify the urban bye-laws so as to permit the construction of rooms containing an inadequate air-space; and bearing in mind the case of the recent lire at Lambeth, in which a nurse was burnt to death in a bedroom the area of which was under 39 feet, this Conference calls upon the London County Council to introduce in its forthcoming Building Act Amendment Bill a clause defining a room, such definition to state that the air space of a room shall not be less than 1,200 cubic feet, and the Conference also urges the extra-metropolitan Local Authorities to embody the same provision in their building bye-laws. This Conference further declares that, inasmuch as the inquest on the body of Lena Pett, who died by the fire at Lambeth before-mentioned, disclosed the fact that the size of 147 the box of corrugated iron and match-lining in which she slept was only 8 ft. 6 in. by 4 ft. 6 in., and was in use before the taking of the census, and, therefore, was enumerated as a room, grave discredit is thereby thrown upon the alleged decrease of crowding in London during the ten years ending in 1901; and seeing that at the inquest on the case in question, it was clearly shown that the standard of two persons to a room, as constituting non-crowding, is an utterly false basis upon which to compute the measure of overcrowding, this Conference urges that the Registrar-General shall be empowered to issue to the enumerators of the next census a proper definition of a room. 3. That the reckless and irresponsible demolition, by the Government and private individuals and syndicates, of houses occupied by the workers, calls for serious attention at the hands of Parliament, and this Conference urges the introduction of a short measure extending the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903 (whereby railway companies taking houses occupied by more than thirty persons are obliged to re-house), to cover such cases as that of Lord Cadogan and his Estates Development Company at Chelsea. 4. That this Conference desires to impress upon Parliament and administrative bodies the urgent necessity for improved means of transit and locomotion for London, and urges that any recommendations which may be made by the Royal Commission on locomotion and transport to re-organise the existing means of communication, and to construct new main roads and light and other railways and other means of rapid transit in the metropolis and surrounding districts should be put into operation with all possible despatch. K 2 148 The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council— That the resolutions of the Conference on the London Housing Problem be approved, and communications in support thereof addressed to the Government, the London County Council and the representatives of the Borough in Parliament. On the 13th April Major Norton, on behalf of the Local Government Board, inspected the Bridge Road and Emmett Street area. It will be remembered that Arnold Buildings were ordered by the Magistrate to be demolished, and nearly the whole of the buildings have been pulled down. On the 8th August H. Percy Boulnois, Esq., on behalf of the Local Government Board, inspected Brewery Yard and Gandy Court areas. The inspection was made in order that the Local Government Board might decide whether they could adopt the view of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar that such areas might be dealt with as occasion arises under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. With respect of the "Brewery Yard Area," numbers 4, 5, 6 and 7, Brewery Yard have been completely pulled down. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a reference to approach the London County Council in opposition to the proposal to acquire property in Wellington Road for erection of a car shed, and directed a communication be addressed to the Highways Committee protesting against the proposal, urging, as an alternative site, the! acquisition of a. block of insanitary property lying between Bow Road and High Street, adjacent to the tramway terminus at Bow Bridge, and requesting the Committee to receive a deputation from the Council on the subject. 149 The Committee also communicated with the Members representing the Borough on the London County Council with reference to the matter. The Committee suggested to the General Purposes Committee that they should take the requisite steps to oppose the London County Council's; Bill, if necessary. The following letter was received from the London County Council: — LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 18th November, 1905. Sir, The Parks and Open Spaces Committee, and the Committee of the Council, have considered your letter of 21st September last, in which you urge the Council to arrive at an early decision upon the question of dealing with the Favonia Street Area, in order that any necessary works thereat may be put in hand so as to afford employment. With reference thereto, I have to inform you that in the opinion of those Committees, the most suitable way of dealing with that area would be by converting it into a tar-paved playground, as was done with a similar area now known as Little Dorrit's playground, acquired in connection with the Falcon Court Housing Scheme. In view of the small extent of this playground, it was not deemed desirable to employ a man to act as caretaker, but an arrangement was made with the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark under which the C ouncil is responsible for the maintenance of the surface of the 150 playground, whilst the Borough Council undertakes the duties of lighting and cleansing the same. The Committee are of opinion that it is desirable that a similar arrangement should be made in the present case, and, upon learning that the Borough Council would be prepared to erect, and maintain in the centre of the area, a lamp sufficiently powerful for the effective lighting of the same, and to keep the area clean and tidy, the Parks and Open Spaces Committee will recommend the Council to tarpave the area and maintain it as a playground. As regards the Providence Place area, the Council cannot proceed with the demolition of the present houses until some satisfactory provision shall have been made for re-housing the persons to be displaced under the scheme. The subject is being dealt with by the Housing Committee, and the consent of the Local Government Board must be obtained to any proposals which the Council may make in connection therewith. With reference to your further inquiry as to the Burford's Court and Tucker's Court areas, I have to inform you that the question of dealing with these areas is receiving the consideration of the Improvements Committee of the Council. I am, sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, The Town Clerk, Clerk of the Council Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health Committee were of opinion the Council should undertake the cleansing and lighting of the open space at Favonia Street, and asked the Works Committee to submit a recommendation on the subject to the Council. 151 With regard to Providence Place area and the statement that the County Council "cannot proceed with the demolition of the houses until satisfactory provision shall have been made for rehousing," the Committee were informed most of the houses on the area were empty, and the Committee were'of opinion sufficient provision for re-housing the persons to be displaced is afforded by the Council's dwellings in Ann Street, Cotton Street and Prestons Road, and that there was no reason for delay in dealing with the area, and Recommended— The Council concur in this opinion and the London County Council be so informed. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. Mr. William Johnson was appointed in April Permanent Sanitary Inspector for Houses Let in Lodgings (see report, pages 237-241. I here are 877 houses let in lodgings on the register (see report, pages 116, 237-241). Legal proceedings were instituted under the bye-laws against the landlord of 14 and 20, Box Street, for not causing the lodging houses to be cleansed with 14 days after service of the Council's notice. £3 penalty and 23s. costs were obtained in each case. Legal proceedings were also instituted under the bye-laws against the landlord of 59 and 61, Arcadia Street, for not supplying within a period of 14 days of the notice of the Council information necessary for the registration of such lodging-houses. A penalty of 40s. and 23s. costs were obtained in each case. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. In the memorandum issued by the Local Government Board to the Medical Officers of Health respecting their Annual Reports, it is stated that the Local Government Board desired to obtain, through 152 the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, information of particular changes of condition that occur by the action of the Local Authority, and one of the subject matters which is required to be reported upon is the condition of sewer and house drains. At the instigation of the Borough Surveyor the Works Committee recommended the Council that a short length of sewer be constructed in Benworth Street to connect with the sewer in Alfred Street. The Borough Surveyor suggested this to afford a complete scheme of drainage to the neighbourhood. The Borough Surveyor submitted a plan for the provision of a short length of sewer in Raleana Road to connect with the sewer in Preston's Road. The Works Committee recommended the Council to approve of the plan of the Borough Surveyor. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the under-mentioned premises, either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order: — Combined drainage system running at the rear of houses in Wilson Street and St. Leonards Road from Andrew Street to Joshua Street, namely, 1-19a, Wilson Street, 94 to 120, St. Leonardsi Road, Joshua Street, etc. to Andrew Street; 1 to 27, Three Mills Lane; 36 to 38, Cobden Street; 278-284, Manchester Road;, 30 and 31, Ashton Street; 2, 3 and 4, Ashton Street; Hope Foundry, Bowley Street; 103, Malmesbury Road; 29-31, Gough Street; 12-15, Thomas Street; 85-93, Donald Street; 9 and 10, Newby Place; 21, 23 and 25, Devons Street; 226 and 288 High Street, Poplar; 1, 2, 3 and 4, Cawdor Street; 89, 91 and 93, West Ferry Road; 153 11 and 12, Ivy Cottages; 57 and 59, Bath Street; 130, High Street; 28-40, Devas Street; 79-83, Chrisp Street; 24-27, Grace Street; 96-98, Kerbey Street; 575-583, Manchester Road; 38-40, Byron Street; 1 to 5, Thomas Street; 53-55, Bath Street; 158 and 162, Upper North Street; 1, Bloomfield Street; 59-61, Wellington Road ; 62-68, Devons Road; and 39, 41 and 43, Gough Street. With respect to the defective combined drainage system at 103, Malmesbury Road, included in the above, it appeared that in 1866 a Mr. Dempsey laid the drain in question without notice to the Sanitary Authority. He subsequently submitted a plan and application, but this was disapproved and proceedings were taken in the Police Court and a fine of 2s. 6d. imposed. There was no subsequent approval of the combined system nor was Mr. Dempsey called upon to remove the drain. The drain having become defective, proceedings were instituted against the present owner, and the magistrate in deciding the case held that in the absence of the order or approval of the Sanitary Authority of the combination, the combined drain became a sewer maintainable by the Council. He accordingly dismissed the summons, but without costs. See page 162. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Twenty-seven notices were served in) respect of cleansing houses infested with vermin under Section 20. Four notices were served under Section 22 calling upon the owners to provide two public-houses and two beer-houses with proper doors to the urinals attached to their premises. 154 WATER SUPPLY TO TENEMENT HOUSES. Sections 2 and 48 of the Public Health (London) Act provide that where there is a constant supply of water, absence of proper water fittings shall be deemed a nuisance, and that an occupied house without a proper and sufficient supply of water shall be a nuisance, liable to be dealt with summarily, and if it is a dwelling house shall be deemed unfit for human habitation. It has hitherto been considered that a single tap, accessible to all the inmates of a tenement house, satisfied the statute. In a case, however, heard at the Woolwich Police Court, the owner of a three-storied tenement house was summoned for not providing the tenants with a proper water supply, although there was a tap in the yard, and the Magistrate made an order against the defendant with £5 5s. costs. The London County Council, by a circular letter, called the attention of the Borough Councils to this case, and expressed a hope that the various authorities would take all possible steps to secure the provision of a proper and sufficient supply of water for the tenants of every floor of a tenement house. It was pointed out to the Committee that if it be desirable to afford facilities for obtaining clean water on every floor, it is equally desirable to provide sinks and down cast shafts to empty away refuse waters from every floor. At the Conference of Representatives of the Borough Councils, held at the County Hall in July, 1904, a resolution was unanimously adopted— "That a draw-off tap from the rising main and a sink should be provided on every floor of a tenement house." 155 A copy of a letter received from the Metropolitan Water Board in reply to ai letter of enquiry of the London County Council, was forwarded by the Clerk of the London County Council. The letter stated— "In reply thereto I am desired to inform you that, without prejudice to its statutory rights, the Board will he glad to cooperate as far as possible in the direction desired by the Council, and would be prepared to accept in tenement houses similar arrangements to those adopted in the case of blocks of houses constructed by the London County Council. "It is, of course, understood that proper arrangements would be made to prevent the lower floors taking away the pressure from the higher floors during the busy times of the day; and, further, that the Board would not contribute in any way towards the cost of providing the necessary pipes and fittings in the houses. "It is, of course, desirable that the Chief Engineer of the Board should be communicated with in each case before arrangements for an improved supply are commenced, so that there may be no misapprehension as to the height at which the supply can be afforded." Copy of report of Br. Reginald Dudfield, Medical Officer of Health for Padding ton, to his Public Health Committee, 21st November, 1905. "Summonses were taken out against the owners of these houses (31, 33 and 39, Claredon Street, and 58, 60 and 76, Cirencester Street), which were heard by Mr. Plowden on Friday last, the 17th instant. The first summons against Mr. ——— (owner of Nos. 58, 60 and 76, Cirencester Street) was argued at length, he 156 being represented by Mr. Morrell, a Solicitor, as a test case and dismissed with one guinea costs against the Council. In giving his decision the Magistrate held that the words of the Section, 'proper a,nd sufficient supply,' referred to the source of supply and not to the provision of taps within the house. He did not think that the section was intended to deal with any case in which the occupier might be put to inconvenience as was alleged in this house. I was present at the hearing, and it appeared to me that the Magistrate overlooked the need of additional supply with a view to proper cleansing of the homes and the occupiers thereof." LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL SCHOOLS. The Public Health and Housing Committee directed that a communication be addressed to the London County Council with regard to the dirty condition of the Council Schools in the Borough. REMOVAL OF DEAD HORSES. The bye-laws made by the London County Council with respect to the mode of conveying carcases of dead horses through the public streets were confirmed by the Local Government Board and are now in force. RIVER LEA. The Works Committee considered a proposal of the Public Health Committee, on a letter from the Lea Conservancy, with respect to dead bodies of dogs and cats found in the River Lea. It was stated 1,102 carcases were taken from the River between Hackney Malrshes and the Thames in one year, and it was suggested bodies are thrown into the river in the absence of other means of disposal. 157 The Public Health Committee suggested facilities be afforded at the Dust Destructor for disposal of the bodies of dead animals found in the Council's area: also that the Lea Conservancy should be asked to publish notices on the banks of the Lea within the Borough, that bodies of dead dogs and cats will be destroyed without charge on giving same to dustmen on their calls, or taking such bodies to any of the depots of the Council. The Works Committee were of opinion the suggestion should be carried into effect, and gave instructions accordingly. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1. Cap. 8, Sect. 26 (2).

Where W.C. pans and traps are fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council By-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builder is written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise the matter will be reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee in order that legal proceedings may be instituted against him for infringing the by-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work has been found to have been done and covered up without 158 inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. For fixing in pans and traps without giving the proper notice three builders were threatened with legal proceedings. Water certificates under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 48 (2), were asked for and granted in respect of: — Cubitt Town Library.

Lists of houses not inspected were given to the Inspectors with instructions to inspect such premises as soon as possible. The inspection of these premises is now being completed. The inspections have taken a long time as many defective drainage systems had been discovered, which had to be rectified before further inspections were made and fresh drainage work created. See Inspectors' Reports, pages 206, 209 and 219. Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting eleven cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 36 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 47 of overcrowding abated; 5 cases of overcrowding were abated in workrooms (see (Miss Tattersall's report, page 236; 74 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with Houses-let-in-lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, pages 238 and 239). 7,970 communications were received, and 745 complaints (including 127 smoke) as to nuisances were made. The Islington Borough Council suggested that Sanitary Assessors might be appointed to assist Police Magistrates in dealing with cases involving a technical acquaintance with sanitary work, and asked whether the Council would be prepared to join in a representation to this effect to His Majesty's Government. 161 The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the appointment of Sanitary Assessors was unnecessary, And recommended— The Council to concur in this opinion and the Islington Borough Council be so informed.

AKERS-DOUGLAS, One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. Home Office, Whitehall. 15th August, 1905. Circular to Local Authorities in Great Britain for the •purposes of the Sale of Food and Lrugs Acts, 1S75 to 1899. Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, 4, Whitehall Place, London, S.W. 27th March, 11/05. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1899* (62 and 63 Vict, c. 51). Sir, I am directed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to advert to their Circular Letter of the 28th December, 1901, of which a copy is herewith enclosed, and to inform you that they have received numerous representations from dairy farmers and others complaining of the institution of proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, in cases in which, as is alleged, the deficiency of milk-fat or milk-solids as compared with the limits laid down in the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901, was due to accidental causes and not to any fraudulent action on the part of the vendor. In the Circular Letter above referred to, the Board suggested that in the absence of any special circumstances indicating the * See page 126, 169 commission of fraud, the Local Authority might in the first instance call the attention of the vendor to the adverse report of the analyst and afford him an opportunity of submitting any explanation he might desire to offer on the subject. The Board further expressed the opinion that if the explanation were one which the Local Authority felt able to accept, they might, in the exercise of their discretion, refrain from the institution of proceedings, or withdraw any summons which it might have been necessary to take out in order to avoid the failure of proceedings, at the same time making arrangements for the taking of further samples of the milk supplied, in order that a satisfactory conclusion as to its character might be arrived at. The experience of the past three years has confirmed the propriety of the views expressed by the Board on the subject, and they would be glad to learn that your Local Authority have made arrangements to proceed on the lines suggested, and if not, that the matter will be further considered at an early date. I am also to say that the Board think it very desirable that farmers, dairymen and all other cowkeepers should have samples of the milk of their cows tested from time to time, so that they may be able to watch the seasonal and other variations in the quantity of milk-fat contained in the milk, and by modifications in the feeding, housing, or time of milking, and if necessary by the disposal of animals giving milk of an exceptionally poor character, keep the quality of their mlik at a satisfactory level. The Board have ascertained that with the object of assisting farmers thus to acquaint themselves with the character of their milk the various Agricultural Colleges and Agricultural Departments of University Colleges, etc., are willing to determine for a fee of sixpence the percentage of milk-fat in any sample of milk which may be sent to them from the Counties with which they 170 are respectively associated. Detailed information as to the arrangements thus made is given in the Journal of the Board of Agriculture for March, 1905. The Board would be glad if your Local Authority would co-operate with them in the matter, and do what is possible to facilitate the testing of milk in the manner proposed. The Board are satisfied that if the keepers of cows will from time to time test the quality of their milk for themselves, and if the Local Authorities will adopt some such arrangement as that above suggested for hearing what the vendor has to say for himself before taking the case into open Court, any legitimate ground of complaint on the part of producers as to the administration of the law, so far as the adulteration of milk is concerned, will speedily be removed. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, T. H. ELLIOTT, Secretary. Circular to Local Authorities in Great Britain for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. Board of Agriculture, 4, Whitehall Place, London, S.W. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1899* (62 and 63 Vict, c. 51). Sir, I am directed by the Board of Agriculture to bring under the notice of your Local Authority the following observations with reference to the Regulations relating to the Sale of Milk in Great * See page 126. 171 Britain, which, in pursuance of the powers conferred upon the Board by Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, were made by the Board on the 5th August, and came into operation on the 1st September, 1901. The Regulations were as follows: — Milk. 1. Where a sample of milk (not being milk sold as skimmed, or separated, or condensed, milk) contains less than 3 per cent. of milk-fat, it shall be presumed for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved that the milk is not genuine, by reason of the abstraction therefrom of milk-fat, or the addition thereto of water. 2. Where a sample of milk (not being milk sold as skimmed, or separated, or condensed milk) contains less than 8.5 per cent. of milk-solids other than milk-fat, it shall be presumed for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine, by reason of the abstraction therefrom of milk-solids other than milk-fat, or the addition thereto of water. Skimmed or Separated Milk. 3. Where a sample of skimmed or separated milk (not being condensed milk) contains less than 9 per cent. of milk-solids, it shall be presumed for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine, by reason of the abstraction therefrom of milk-solids other than milk-fat, or the addition thereto of water. In the Regulations the limits below which a presumption is raised that the milk is not genuine were necessarily fixed at figures 172 lower than those which are usually afforded by genuine milk, in which the proportion of milk-fat and non-fatty solids very frequently exceeds the percentages specified above. It is therefore important that Local Authorities should keep steadily in view the possibility of the artificial reduction of the quality of natural milk to the official limits by the abstraction of cream, or the addition of separated milk, or of water, and arrangements should be made for the taking of samples and the submission of the same for analysis whenever the existence of malpractices of the kind is suspected. In this connection, it may be observed that the evidence given before the Milk Regulations Committee [Cd. 491], tended to show that the practice of fraudulently mixing separated milk with new milk has become increasingly prevalent, particularly in some of the larger towns. Although the quality of genuine milk offered for sale will usually be well above the official limits of milk-fat and non-fatty solids, there may occasionally, and especially in certain seasons of the year, be cases in which a sample of genuine milk may fall below those limits. To meet cases of this kind it is suggested that in the absence of any special circumstances indicating that the case is a fraudulent one, the Local Authority might, in the first instance, call the vendor's attention to the analyst's report, and ask him whether he desires) to offer any explanation, and if the explanation is one they are able to accept, they might, in the exercise of their discretion, refrain from the institution of proceedings or withdraw any summons which, in order to prevent the failure of proceedings, by reason of the time limit imposed by the Act, it may have been necessary to take out. But it may be desirable that further samples of milk should be taken in such cases, in order that a satisfactory conclusion as to the character of the milk supplied may be arrived at. 173 Cream. The Milk Regulations Committee reported that the evidence submitted to them went to shew that it was a common practice to add gelatin to cream for the purpose of giving it a fictitious appearance of richness or thickness. Local Authorities are urged to take steps to ascertain whether this form of adulteration is practised within, their districts, and if a public analyst reports the presence of gelatin or other similar substance in a sample of cream, the Local Authority concerned should consider whether the case is one in which proceedings might not with advantage be instituted under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. Collection and Retention of Samples. It is desirable that, so far as may be found practicable, there should be uniformity of procedure in collecting and retaining samples of milk procured under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and the following recommendations have been drawn up for the guidance of the Local officials employed in this work: — (1) The quantity tc» be purchased should not be less than one pint, except that it may be expedient to purchase only half-a-pint, in cases where there is reason to believe that the object of the purchase would be defeated if a greater quantity were demanded. (2) The division of the sample under Section 14 of the Act of 1875, as amended by Section 13 of the Act of 1899, should be made as equally as possible, so that the portion reserved by the purchaser may be not less than one-third of the whole. (3) The bottle used for each divided part should have a 174 narrow neck, and be of such capacity that the milk may nearly or quite fill it. The shape of bottle known as "Winchester" is strongly recommended, but in any case the bottles should have rounded sides in order to give security to the sample during transit by post or otherwise. (4) Corks only should be used and these should always be new and sound, and fitting so tightly as to secure the contents without any aid from the wax which is subsequently used for sealing the sample. It is most desirable that the sealing should be carried out in such a way as to prevent any attempt to remove the cork. It is therefore recommended that the cork should be slit down to one-fourth of its length and the string drawn through and securely fastened round the neck, the ends being afterwards carried to the top of the cork and sealed thereon. (5) Special attention should be given that the reserved portion of milk be kept in as equable and cool a temperature as possible, pending its production in Court in instances where proceedings are taken; and, if directed by the Justices to be referred to the Government Laboratory, it should be carefully packed so as to secure its safe transmission. The Board would be obliged if you would take steps to bring this Circular under the notice of your Local Authority, and they will be glad to forward you additional copies for distribution amongst the members of your Local Authority and the officers concerned upon being informed of the number you require. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, T. H. ELLIOTT, Secretary. 175 Again I must thank Mr. Shillinglaw, the principal Clerk in the Town Clerk's Department for his kind assistance which at all times he has so willingly rendered me, adding efficiency to the working of the Public Health Department. Mr. Shillinglaw acts as Clerk to the Public Health and Housing Committee, and has recorded the resolutions, recommendations and reports of the Committee which have been quoted in this report. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh; Diplomate in Public Health, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, England; Fellow and Member of the Council of the Royal Institute of Public Health; Member of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine; Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., Corner of Fairfield Road, April, 1906. 17C Public Health Department, December 31st, 1905. To the Medical Officer of Health. SIR,— I beg to lay before you my sixteenth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending 31st December, 1905, as follows: — Inspections on complaints of nuisances 966 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 335 Do. on house-to-house visitation 193 Do. Canal Boats 55 Re-Inspections 2,595 Making a total of 4,144 Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act), 1891. Of the total number (1,494 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that 39.4 per cent. of the premises thus inspected various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out—requiring the service of 589 written intimations, 364 statutory, and 60 final notices. In many of these cases on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 3 cases it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating 4 attendances at the police-court to ensure enforcement. 177 Home-to-House Visitation. The house-to-house inspection comprised the whole of the houses in the under-mentioned roads and streets— Ruston Street. Monteith Road. Jodrell Terrace. Prince Arthur's Avenue. Victoria Cottages (three times). And sections of Lamprell Street and Ranwell Street. New drainage systems, of which plans and particulars were submitted to the Council for approval, have been laid at the undermentioned premises: — Monteith Road School, new additions.

The market places have been regularly inspected throughout the year, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. The following have also received constant attention throughout the year:— Bakehouses 21 Registered Milksellers 57 Public House Urinals 23 Marine Store Dealers 3 Butchers' Shops 19 Fishmongers' „ 12 Fruiterers' „ 9 Ice Cream „ 6 Hair Dressers' „ 15 Food and Drugs Acts.

The 30 coffee and eating houses and other premises where food is prepared have been specially inspected, and the food stuff on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Unsound Food. Through the year 1 case of pomegranates and 1 barrow load of cauliflowers were specially examined by request of their respective owners, and found unfit for human consumption. The fruit and vegetables were destroyed and the usual certificate given. Factory and Workshop Acts. The workshops, workplaces and outworkers on the Register have been visited, and the terms of the Acts relating to them have been required by notice, where necessary, to be complied with. No summonses were necessary, as the works were immediately executed on the service of intimation or notice. 182 PARISH OF BOW (West Division).

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, WILLIAM BOYCE, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Bow ( West Division). 183 Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., December 31st, 1905. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— Unsound Food. The year ending December 31st, 1905, was attended with only one incident of any note occurring within the Bow East Division, and consisted in the seizure and condemnation of an exceptionally large quantity of bad fruit pulp obviously intended for conversion into jam for human consumption, and ending in the conviction of the manufacturer. The evidence before the magistrate at the hearing largely tended to demonstrate that it was no uncommon practice for certain jam makers to avail themselves of any cheap and defective fruit pulps with a view to the production of what might truly be termed "resurrection jam," as it was shown that after subjecting the bad pulps to a certain degree of temperature the character of the fruit pulp became entirely disguised, and there was no means by which its previous condition could be ascertained, the jam could only be said to be of an inferior quality. This business of utilising bad fruit pulps is on a parallel with the processes hitherto known to have been applied to bad and inferior tinned meats, condensed milks, etc., by passing them through a revivifying process and then to be placed upon the market in a disguised and seductive form. The far-reaching effect from the consumption of such goods can possibly only be guessed at and probably is more disastrous than it is possible to conjecture. The particulars of the case dealt with in the district are as follows: — On 14th June the premises, No. 417a, Old Ford Road, were visited, when a large number of barrels (about 150) filled and empty 184 were found stacked in the open yard. On closer examination the heads of several of the filled barrels appeared to be badly blown. A large store-room in the yard was filled with tins, jars, and cases of tins of bad fruit pulp of various kinds and a quantity of bad jam. On ascertaining the yard was in the occupation of the Eureka Preserving Company, Maverton Road, a visit was immediately made to those premises, and it was at once evident that jam-making on a fairly large scale was carried on. In the preserving room there were seven steam preserving pans fitted and attached to a large vertical boiler, though no steam was on at the time, power driven pulping and slicing machines and all the necessary apparatus for the purpose of jam-making and colouring matter and foreign seeds to give the finished jam a semblance of genuineness. One of the coppers contained about 1½ cwt. of strawberry pulp, and one about l½ cwt. of blackberry pulp in a highly fermenting condition. There were also in the preserving room near the coppers several open barrels containing black-currant, strawberry, raspberry and plum pulps, all highly fermenting and totally unfit for food, and embedded in the top of the strawberry pulp was a copper dipper entirely covered with thick verdigris. There were also some large tins of apricot pulp (badly blown), ten ½ cwt. jars of various pulps, and about 3 dozen jars of orange pulp of a very doubtful quality. Adjacent to and communicating with the boiling room was a covered store containing a large number of cases of tins, bottles and jars of fruit pulp, the greater proportion of them being unsound. In the open yard were stored 66 4 or 5 cwt. barrels of pulp and 8 doz. 20-lb. jars of orange pulp. Two or three girls were at the time engaged in the packing room tying up and labelling pots and jars of jam, of which there was a 185 large quantity in the room. The whole of the place, utensils, apparatus and implements were in a neglected condition and filthy to a degree, and the stock of pulps appeared to be stored with an utter disregard for its maintenance in a good condition. All the tinned pulps were then minutely examined, and all the pulp that was obviously bad was then seized and removal proceeded with for condemnation by a magistrate. The quantity removed from Maverton Road, amounting to over 2½ tons, and from the Old Ford Road premises, over 15 tons, totalling in all about 17½ tons, which were conveyed in 15 vans to Worship Street Police Court, and after examination by the presiding magistrates the whole was condemned and an order made for its destruction. The condemned pulp was contained in about 2,750 tins, jars and barrels and amounted in all to about 40,000 lbs. in weight. The quantities of the various pulps destroyed are as follows: — tons. cwt. qrs. lbs. Raspberry Pulp 2 17 3 22 Gooseberry „ 5 13 3 0 Apricot „ 5 8 2 18 Strawberry „ 7 0 16 Red Currant „ 12 2 0 Plum „ 10 2 0 Black Currant Pulp 4 0 0 Blackberry „ 1 0 0 Peach and Melon Pulp 3 0 24 Orange „ 1 9 1 0 Assorted „ 1 1 4 Various „ 2 3 2 Bad Jam 4 0 0 17 16 0 2 186 There were also found on the premises, seized, condemned and destroyed, 96 bottles of had sauce and 20 21b. tins of bad corned beef. The destruction of the pulp was immediately proceeded with and occupied over three days for its demolition. It was destroyed by turning it out into a bed of lime. After the destruction of the seized pulp, the premises were again visited on several occasions, and on one visit the owner had further examined his stock and had himself destroyed over 6¼ tons as bad. Authority was obtained at the Public Health Committee Meeting following the seizure to take legal proceedings against the owner for having the bad pulp deposited on his premises for sale as food, or in course of preparation as food for man; and a summons was immediately applied for against the occupier, trading as the Eureka Preserving Company, Maverton Road, Old Ford, and made returnable for 26th July, but the defendant in the meantime having removed from Dongola Road he had not received the summons, it was therefore adjourned to 6th September. The hearing on 6th September, after taking up the whole of the afternoon, was further adjourned to 11th September, when the defendant was fined £50 and 10 guineas costs or in default three months' imprisonment. The jam factory in Maverton Road and the store in Old Ford Road had been in occupation and use by the defendant about a twelvemonth, during which time no intimation had been given the Local Authority or Home Office that a factory or workshop was 187 being conducted at either of the premises and there was no indication on the! entrances of the premises that any business whatever was being carried on. Since the proceedings the factory has been entirely closed down, completely dismantled and sold up by auction On the day of the sale by auction the goods left were further examined, and the following goods condemned: — 3 cases containing each 12 dozen tins of salmon, not labelled; 7 dozen tins salmon, not labelled; 3 dozen tins salmon, labelled; 23 dozen and 4 tins of rabbit; 3 5-cwt. barrels of pulp; and 42 5-cwt. barrels of pulp were found bad and destroyed. During the year 1904 attention was drawn to the existence of some means by which some salesmen at the fish markets appeared to avoid inspection of part of their stock, and the consequent substitution of certain unwholesome fish for that purchased from sample, and which was not discovered by the buyer until arriving home. Some diminution in complaints of this description has been perceptible, but the practice still seems to exist in a minor degree if the complaints of buyers and hawkers are reliable. On 29th April a half-barrel of small skate was examined and found unfit for food. The fish was destroyed and a certificate of unfitness given. Owner said bad fish was not according to sample. On 21st July five trunks of hake were surrendered. 188 The fish was bad and was said to have been bought from sample at market that day, and delivered from a large stack of trunks in the market. On 8th September a trunk of plaice and two bags of mussels were examined and found unfit for food. Said to have been purchased from sample and found bad on arriving home. On 9th September a barrel of herring was condemned after examination and destroyed. Said to have been purchased from sample. On 18th September a barrel of herring was examined and found to be unfit for food, condemned and destroyed. On 29th November a box of skate was condemned after examination. These were said to have been purchased from sample at market the same day. Canal Boats. The Inspection of Canal Boats was without particular incident. 22 registered and 26 unregistered boats received attention. All the boats visited appeared, with one exception, to be in fair condition, and in compliance with the requirements of the Acts and Regulations. In one instance the master was without the necessary certificate, having left it behind on. changing over to the boat. The Registration Authority and owners were notified of the delinquency. Only one boat was found to have children aboard. 189 Highway Locomotives. The strong action of the Council during the previous year with respect to the prevention of smoke nuisances from Highway Locomotives passing through or within the district appeared to have a very salutary effect, as complaints in this direction were found to diminish very considerably for a time, but later a recrudescence of the offence necessitated the issuing of further summonses. At the Thames Police Court on 6th July, Messrs. Mann, Crossman and Paulin, Ltd., were ordered by the Magistrate to pay 23s. costs for causing a smoke nuisance to arise from a highway locomotive in the Bow Road. On 14th July the Road Breaking Company, Ltd., of Broadway Chambers, Westminster, were fined £1 and costs for a similar offence. Offensive Businesses. Nuisances from bone boiling arising without the district occurred at very frequent intervals. On each occasion the probable source was traced, and the West Ham Corporation communicated with, resulting eventually in an abatement of the nuisance. Food and Drugs. Fifty-four varied samples of food have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analyses. Three were certified to have been adulterated, and owing to the small amount of adulteration the vendors were cautioned by order of the Council. The House-to-House Inspection in the Division comprised Bream Street. Brewery Yard. Davey Road. 190 Smeed Road. King's Head Yard. Rothbury Buildings. Beachy Road. Trellis Street. Taylor's Buildings. And portions of— Monier Road. High Street. Rothbury Road. Maverton Road. Hepscott Road. Old Ford Road. Baker's Alley. Blondin Street. Malmesbury Road. Wick Lane. Allanmouth Road. Trego Road. Kelday Road. Drainage. Drainage part re-construction was carried out on old lines at — Allanmouth Road, 20. Monier Road, 44, 108. Old Ford Road, Clayhall Tavern. High Street, 87, 13, 15, 33.

Re-constructions of Sewers on private premises by Council— Malmesbury Road, 99 to 103. Milkshops. The milkshops have been visited from time to time and found satisfactory. Ice Creams. During inspections of ice cream shops and street stalls an alien vendor was found to have no name on barrow as required by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. As he could not understand English a copy of the Act in Italian was supplied him and the following day was complied with. The premises where ice cream was made were found fairly satisfactory. Smoke Nuisances. A considerable diminution in smoke nuisances arising from within and without the district has been perceptible. The manufacturers appear to be most anxious in the efforts to prevent any nuisance, and attention drawn to a nuisance immediately has the desired effect. No summonses were required to be issued in the case of smoke nuisances from factories. 192 Small-pox. Two contacts have been kept under observation for the incubatory period, and it is satisfactory to report that no cases have arisen from them. Houses Let in Lodgings. In this Division, 45 houses have been placed on the register of houses let in lodgings: High Street, Nos. 47, 49, 51, 53, and Beachy Road, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

All premises where ice cream is made have been regularly inspected. Workshops and Workplaces. &c. During the year the above premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected. Milk Shops. There are 54 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out. This is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation. A caution was necessary in one shed. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a! view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound. 200 Unsound Food. Several pig's heads have been surrendered owing to being diseased, but the carcases belonging to the heads were not upon the premises, as the heads are bought separately. Bakehouses. These are often inspected, but there has been little cause of complaint. They are now classified as Workshops or Domestic Workshops. Smoke Nuisances. Observations have been made throughout the district with respect to smoke nuisances. Several intimations have been served and the nuisance abated. Offensive Matter. There has been no cause for proceedings under this heading during the year 1905. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Assoc. San. Inst.. Cert. Sanitary Inspector Exam.

Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorization granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings, in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with London County Council's and Council's own Bye-laws, as the statutory notices served were complied with. Inspection of Eating-houses (Coffee-shops, and Stewed Eel-shops), Pork Butchers, Sausage Makers and Fried Fish Shops. I have by your direction inspected the whole of the above described business premises, and where required served intimations, notices, etc., for works of repair, and cleansing, which in every case has been carried out. In no instance upon such visits made, was there cause for complaint, so far as food was concerned. Inspection of Bakehouses. I have, as specially instructed, made the periodical inspections of the bakehouses, and where required served extracts of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901 and statutory notices for the necessary work of repairs and cleansing, which were duly complied with. 205 Dairy, Milk Sellers and Purveyors. The cow-sheds and milk purveyors' premises were frequently inspected, and the register kept at the Pubilc Health Offices corrected in the cases of those found to be non-registered, through change of proprietorship of business, the new occupiers were furnished with forms in accordance with your instructions, which were signed, and particulars inserted in register. Constant attention has been given to the enforcement of the regulations relating to cleanliness of utensils, premises, etc., but in no case has any infringement been discovered. Upon notice received for renewal of licenses the cow-shed at the rear of 27, Abbott Road was again inspected, found in fair sanitary condition, no objection was raised to the application of the owner of business. Examination of Food. I have on several occasions, upon different itinerant vendors' and tradesmen's applications, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found "unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food of man" witnessed same destroyed by the owners, and have given certificates to that effect. In no instance was there any article of food "exposed for sale, deposited for sale, or preparation for sale," at the time of my visit in such condition as to justify seizure. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. As directed by you, all the premises where ice cream was made were inspected, with the view of detecting nuisances, and any infringement of the London Council's (General Powers Act 1902). I he barrows used by the itinerant vendors were examined to see that they were legibly marked with their names, etc., also care taken that the premises in question were placed and kept in fair sanitary condition, and that: the ice cream was wholesome, and the utensils, etc., with surroundings, satisfactory. 206 Factory and Workshop Inspections. Nuisances arising within the several factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., were dealt with. The whole of the ascertained premises above described were inspected and found, in most cases, to be in a cleanly condition. Where necessary "intimations," notices, were served, which were duly complied with by the work of repairs being carried out. Smoke Nuisances. I have, where a nuisance has occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney other than belonging to a private dwelling house, viz., factories, workshops, workplaces and bakehouses, either on complaint or from my own personal observation, served "intimations," notices, etc., and the nuisances, for the time being, were abated with but one exception, viz.:— At the Thames Police Court, on 15th March, 1906, an abatement order and prohibition order on the first summons, with penalties of £5 and 23s. costs, and on the second, 1s. and 2s. costs were obtained, against a firm in St. Leonards Street for two separate offences, 28th February and 14th March respectively. Inspection of Canal Boats (Barges). I have made 42 inspections of the cabins, etc., of non-registered barges, with the result that no infringement of regulations had been discovered. Outstanding Arrears of Premises not inspected. I have to report, that, respecting list of premises stated not to have been inspected during the eleven years ended 1903, in accordance with your instructions, inspections have been made, with the result that in several instances drainage defects, etc., 207 have been discovered, and single and combined systems have been newly and partially reconstructed; the outstanding portion is nearly completed. Schools. I have at different times visited the Public Schools, all of which have been found in fair saritary condition. There are no private schools in my district. Hairdresser's Premises. I have, at your request, visited the whole of above described premises, and have, where found necessary, had the same put in proper order. Overcrowding of Inmates of Premises. I am glad to report that every case during the year has been dealt with, and nuisance abated, without recourse to Police Court proceedings. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Margarine Acts. I have, as required, procured 53 samples, articles of food, and submitted same to the public analyst (Mr. W. C. Young) for analysis. Five were found to be so much adulterated that legal proceedings were taken. The nature of article, extent of adulteration, result of prosecution being as follows:— Vinegar.—Deficient in acetic acid to the extent of 8 per cent. Vendor fined 5s., 23s. costs.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS. Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Druqs Acts, and Canal Boats Act, Bromley Central Division. 209 Public Health Department, 31st December, 1905. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my fifth Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith, in the West Combined district, during the 12 months past, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds 1,407 houses or other premises have been visited, 298 of this number being in connection with infectious diseases, including those notified from the Public institutions and 60 being Houseto-House visits. The number of infectious diseases shows a still further falling off as compared with previous years. House-to-House Inspections. These visits were confined principally to premises that (according to the list which you had prepared) had escaped attention up to the end of 1903, and which has proved of much use. They were carried out in the undermentioned places. Chrisp Street. Fawe Street. Goodliffe Place. Ivy Cottages. Hill Place Street. Northumberland Street, Upper North Street. Ricardo Street. Flint Street. Rigden Street. Flint Avenue. o 210 Brains. The drains of 179 premises have been tested with either smoke or scent tests, and in 139 cases found to be defective. During the year the drains of the following) premises were taken out (where necessary right through to the sewer) and reconstructed, and where practicable, in order to comply with the Bye-laws of the L.C.C. and Borougii Council, were intercepted—ventilated— and provided with proper means of access for clearing in times of stoppages in same, the whole being subjected to a water test before being passed as sound. In a number of instances combined systems were dealt with: — St. Saviour's Schools (part of). Bowen Street, 11. Chrisp Street, 135, 137 (64, 66, part of), 151, 167 (164, part of).

The undermentioned premises were also drained or redrained according to plans submitted for approval to; the Borough Council, o 2 212 and in accordance with the London County Council's Bye-laws, and in some, alterations to the sanitary fittings were carried out. According to arrangements with the Surveyor's Department I have been present when the work on new buildings has been under test. The Prince's Theatre, East India Road. L.C.C. Technical Schools, High Street Queen Victoria Seamen's Rest, Jeremiah Street (part of). Howrah House (part of). Park Street, 90. Mission Hall, Canton Street. High Street, 130. East India Road, 66. Aberdeen Wharf. St. Peter's Church (part of). The drainage of many premises has also been repaired and made sound. Coffee and Eating Houses. These have been regularly inspected during the year. New premises opened have been placed on the register, and those closed up taken off. There are now 30 in the district. While inspecting these premises, attention as far as possible has been paid to the food about to be cooked and in preparation. They have been kept clean, and no complaints have been received respecting same. Food Inspection at Wharf, &c. Aberdeen Wharf, where food and skins are landed for transit, has been periodically visited, but nothing found to complain of. The butchers' premises and market stalls are inspected, sometimes by day and at times by night. 213 Wherever brawn and sausages are made special attention has been given. At one brawn makers I found and condemned 22 sheeps' tongues, in pickle, which were more or less unsound. They were destroyed with the consent of the owner. I have had occasion to speak very severely to one stall keeper who deals largely in cow beef about the quality of the meat offered, for sale, and more care is now exercised over same. This stall is visited nearly every day, and also the place where the meat is stored. Several consignments of damaged wheat, rice, barley, etc., have been received into my district from the docks, to be made up into poultry food. These have been watched through and dealt with. The following is a list of food destroyed during the year:— 2 boxes of eels Surrendered on inspection. 22 sheeps' tongues „ „ 1 box of sweets „ „ 5 boxes onions. 2 sacks of cabbages. 2 boxes of tomatoes. Numerous small lots of damaged fruit have been dealt with in a satisfactory manner. Factory and Workshops. All these now on the register are visited regularly, and when required, cleansing notices are served which are quickly attended to. No overcrowding in any workshop has been found to exist. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited, and notices to cleanse the walls and ceilings served in some instances. 214 Smoke Nuisance. All observations of black smoke from the factory chimneys and shafts in the district, notified by the L.C.C. and also my own observations, have been dealt with. It was necessary in the case of Messrs. Locke, Lancaster and W. W. and R. Johnson, Ltd., of Bridge Road, to take legal proceedings owing to so many complaints. The firm apparently do all they possibly can and know of to abate the nuisance, but the difficulties to be overcome are not of the ordinary kind owing to so much "furnace" work instead of boiler work. Further experiments are still being carried out to prevent any more trouble. Bakehouses. These now number 25, and have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out without much difficulty, and some have been cleansed more than twice owing to change of tenants. In the underground bakehouses the troughs have been moved and the unseen parts thoroughly cleansed. This is now facilitated owing to the troughs being on wheels. In some instances the bakers have had to be cautioned about leaving the sweepings under the troughs during the baking. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops and Slaughter Houses. These places have received attention throughout the year. The dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness, and have been mostly kept well covered to keep out the dust.. The cowsheds, before the renewal of licenses, have always been examined, attention being given to all overhead woodwork and beams, etc., where dirt collects. 215 The register of milkshops requires frequently altering and amending, owing to the smaller shops so often changing hands and the new tenants being placed on the register. The slaughter houses have been visited when killing was in progress, and everything found satisfactory. The number of these premises now on the register is as follows:— Milkshops, 90. Cowsheds, 2. Slaughter houses, 3. Canal Boats Acts. Canal boats have been boarded and inspected as opportunities occurred. These numbered 9 registered boats and some 24 unregistered boats, including sailing barges. They were found in most cases in a very clean condition. In 2 instances "Notices" for repairs had bean served on the owners of the "Rennet," registered No. 324, and the "Crowford," registered No. 109, by the inspectors of the Rural districts of Newport-Pagnell and Leicester. On boarding I found the work had been done in a satisfactory manner, and therefore endorsed the "Notices" and returned them to the owners. "Overcrowding."—No case of overcrowding on any of the boats was discovered. "Utensils."—These were at all times in a very cleanly state. The pumps, bulkheads, ventilators, etc., when at times examined were found in good order. No cases of infectious disease were discovered on board, although the master's wife of one boat was left behind on one voyage and died of "erysipelas." 216 Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. 49 samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis by the Public Analyst during the year, 6 of which proved to be adulterated. By directions of the Committee legal proceedings were instituted in each case. 5 prosecutions were under the Food and Drugs Acts and 1 under the Margarine Act. The details are set out below:— Butter.—Adulterated with 17.6 per cent. of foreign fat. Defendant fined 40s. and 23s. costs. In this case the third portion was asked for and sent to Somerset House for analysis when the Council's analysis was confirmed. Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 60 per cent. Defendant fined £4 and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with at least 13 per cent. of foreign fat and containing 1.6 excess of water and 0.42 of boric acid. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. In this case the third portion was asked for and sent to Somerset House for analysis, when the Council's analysis was confirmed. Butter.—Adulterated with 11 per cent. of foreign fat. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with 36 per cent. of foreign fat. Defendant fined 40s. and 23s. costs. 217 Butter.—Analysed as "Margarine." Summons under Margarine Act. Defendant fined 5s. and 23s. costs. In some instances, according to instructions, I have taken samples on Sunday mornings. L. C. C. General Pouers Acts. Ice Cream Regulations. All premises where ice cream is made or sold in the district, numbering 35, have been regularly inspected during the season, and new vendors have been placed on the register. The places have been kept clean, and the itinerant vendors have complied with the regulations in so far as keeping their names and addresses on their barrows. This regulation now seems to be well understood among the foreigners. Public House Urinals. These have been kept as clean as possible under the new powers conferred by the Act. Public Health (London) Act. All cases of infectious diseases have been closely enquired into, in order to trace the connection (if any) between one case and another. A summons was taken out for not complying with a "Notice" from the Council respecting a defective roof. The defendant appeared, and his witness, a Surveyor from Kensington, pleaded insufficiency of time allowed. 218 Defendant was fined 20s. and 23s. costs, and an abatement order made. The Owner (name at the time unknown) of Nos. 14 and 15, South East Row, was summoned for allowing the houlses to be occupied without a water supply and not complying; with the "Council's Notice" to abate the nuisance. Closing orders were asked for and obtained in each case, the tenants were got out, and when the owner was found 25s. costs on each house was granted. The occupier of a top front room at 21, Ellerthorpe Street was summoned for badly overcrowding the room, which was in a filthy state. He was fined 40s. or 10 days' imprisonment in default He elected to do the 10 days. In the interval the premises were thoroughly cleansed, and new tenants found. The whole of the bedding, etc., was disinfected in the Council's disinfector. The Agent of the two houses, 14 and 15, South East Row, was summoned for letting the premises without having "Closing Orders" rescinded which were previously made on the order of the Court. He was fined 10s. and 10s. 6d. costs in each case. A Firm was summoned for emitting black smoke from shafts on their premises. There were 3 summonses for 3 different) offences. The first hearing was adjourned, and at the second hearing the firm was fined £5 and £5 5s. costs on the first summons, and £1 1s. penalty and £1 1s. costs on each of the others.

I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is sold throughout the district, with the object of detecting any infringement of the regulations, in respect of means of storage, prevention of contamination:, cleanliness and registration, and during the year there has been no occasion to take legal proceedings, a caution in 3 cases only being necessary. Number of milk sellers 42 Number of milk sellers—change of ownership 6 Number of milk sellers discontinued selling milk 2 Number of milk sellers added to register 3 Factory and Workshops. During the year the workshops and workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number employed in each case being checked, and any alteration found duly reported and entered in the register kept for that purpose. Particular attention has been givenl to the sanitary arrangements, cleanliness, light and ventilation, and where necessary notices served and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. Smoke Nuisances. During the past year the shafts throughout the district have been kept under special observation, and in 5 instances nuisances were detected. Intimations and statutory notices were sent, and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. There has been no recurrence of the nuisances therefore no necessity to take legal proceedings. 225 Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, &c. During the past year special supervision has been given to these premises, all of which have been inspected with regard to cleanliness, light and ventilation, and sanitary conditions generally. Lime washing in nearly every case was found necessary, the particulars of which have been duly reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee. The foodstuffs at each premises were examined at each visit and found to be satisfactory. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. In accordance with your instructions all the premises where ice cream is prepared have been inspected with a view to detecting any infringement of Part viii. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act 1902, also each itinerant vendor's barrow has been inspected, and in each instance the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed to them. At the same time the utensils were found to be in a clean condition, and the ice cream of good quality. In one case a child was supposed to have died from eating ice cream, but on investigating the matter found that there was no foundation for the allegation. Bakehouses. By your instructions 1 have made periodical inspections of the bakehouses throughout the district (17), 3 of which are underground. The conditions in some cases necessitated service of intimation, with respect to lime washing, removal of sweepings from under the troughs, and cleansing of utensils. Cow Sheds and Slaughter Houses. Five notices were received for the renewal of licenses, the premises were duly inspected, and where any infringements of the p 226 regulations were found intimations and notices were served, and the infringements remedied before the licenses were granted. (Cowsheds, 2 ; slaughter houses, 3.) Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, &c. There is only one wharf in my district where food (all tinned) is landed for sale both at home and abroad, viz., Concordia; Wharf, Cold Harbour. These premises have been carefully inspected, and kept under strict supervision during the past year, and the following articles were found to be blown or otherwise damaged, and on examination proved to be unfit for human consumption, and were condemned1 with the consent of the Manager, who stated they were not intended for sale:— January.—407 tins (various sizes) of chicken, rabbit, beef, mutton, soup, and tongue. March.—250 6-lb. tins of beef and mutton. April.—907 tins of beef, mutton, chicken and tongue. May.—13 2-lb. tins of beef and mutton.

During the year complaints of 11 cases of overcrowding were received, which were dealt with by serving the usual notices, and the nuisances abated without having to take legal proceedings. 227 Unsound Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been regularly visited with a view to detecting unsound and unwholesome food, and in a few instances parcels of fish, meat and fruit, on being examined, were found to be unfit for human consumption and destroyed. In each case the vendor was severely cautioned. On the 21st March I was called to a fishmonger's shop in High Street and requested to examine the contents of two cases of fish "meagrams," which were found to be totally unfit for food. They were destroyed by the owner, and a certificate given as to their condition. On the 27th March two kits of skate were brought to the office, and found to be in a putrid condition. A certificate to that effect was given, and the fish destroyed by the owner. Cards re Prevention of Consumption. By your instruction these cards have been distributed throughout the district, in workshops, workplaces, public urinals, etc Verminous Persons, Circulars respecting personal cleansing of verminous persons have been distributed throughout the district among the common lodging houses and seamen's lodging houses. Hair Dressers' Shops. The whole of the hair dressers' shops in the district have been inspected, particularly with respect to cleanliness of the materials used in the business, and also of the premises. In almost every p 2 228 instance the lavatory basin waste pipes were not trapped, and in a few cases directly connected to the drain. The defects were duly reported upon. and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. Outworkers. The various premises where male outworkers reside have been visited, and invariably found to be in a fairly good condition.

The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. In no instance was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings. The smoke preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking, as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits and cautions no doubt contributed to this result Workshops, &c The workshops and workplaces were regularly inspected— numbering 24—and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by lime washing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FORD, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats, Poplar South Division. 235 Public Health Department, 31st December, 1905. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present to you my sixth Annual Report, which deals with the work done in factories, workshops, and among outworkers during 1905. Five workshops in Bromley have been overcrowded; in each case the nuisance was abated on serving an intimation. During the year 9 intimations have been served where the sanitary accommodation was insufficient, unsuitable, or not separate for the sexes. In one case separate accommodation was erected for the males, one employer reduced the number of employees, and in 7 cases alterations or re-arrangements were made. I have visited several dirty children who had been excluded from school owing to their verminous condition, and in some cases cleansing of the houses was carried out. I have inspected a number of schools in the Borough in regard to the sanitary accommodation for girls and infants, and found generally that owing to the new Education Act alterations were pending. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 79 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 270 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 105 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. 236 The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— REPOET OF LADY INSPECTOR (Miss Tattersall).

Notices to carry out cleansing have been served throughout the year, and rooms and passages have been stripped of foul papers, water closets, and front and back areas whitewashed, as follows:— Rooms, 643; passages and staircases, 144; areas, water closets and wash houses 216. London County Council General Powers Act, 1904, Section 20. Since being authorised by the Borough Council to serve notices under this Act, several rooms have been thoroughly stripped, and rid of vermin. Registration. Registration has been proceeded with, and there are now 877 houses on the books, 114 having been registered during the year, and 41 re-registered. All cases of property changing hands, and tenants moving from time to time is recorded in the registers and journals in order to keep the books up to date. 238 Overcrowding. As was the case in previous years, the larger part of the overcrowding has been discovered in particular areas, where the landlords pay practically no attention to the number of people who get into a house. Many of the cases are abated by a re-arrangement of the beds, and in other cases a notice generally causes the nuisance to be abated. Night and Early Morning Inspection. In all cases where overcrowding is likely to arise, or is suspected, inspections are made either late at night, or in the early hours of the morning . Nuisances. In all cases where nuisances come to my notice that cannot be abated under the Bye-laws:, a written notification is handed to the Inspector for the district, for the matter to be dealt with under the Act, or Council's Bye-laws. "Spitting on Footways and Cleansing Verminous Persons." Cards and notices referring to the above have been posted at several lodging houses throughout the Borough. Legal Proceedings. In July, the landlord of two houses in Bromley was summoned at Thames Police Court for not carrying out cleansing, according to notices served under the Bye-laws. He was ordered by the Magistrate to pay £8 6s. fines and costs.

POP9 Bord of Works for the Poplar District. ANNUAL REPORT, YEAR 1899, ON The Sanitary Condition with Vital Statistics of the Parishes of POPLAR and BROMLEY within the Poplar District, BY FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Diplomate in Public Health (England,) MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH for the SOUTH DISTRICT. Comprising the Parishes of All Saints, Poplar, and Bromley St. Leonard. To the Chairman and Members of the Board of Works for the Poplar District. Gentlemen, In accordance with "The Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my seventh Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1899 and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley, and the Report of the Inspector of Nuisances in manufactories and workshops. Vital Statistics. The populations of the two parishes, estimated to the middle of the year 1899, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1891 and 1896 being maintained, are:— Registration South Poplar or London Isle of Dogs 21,010 South Bromley 37,296 4,546,752. North Poplar 37,699 North Bromley 32,322 Total 58,709 69,618 2 being 60.9 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 50.4 per acre in Poplar and 114.5 in Bromley. These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report. In calculating the birth and marriage rates, also the general death and zymotic rates, in addition to using the above-mentioned estimated populations, these rates have also been obtained by dealing with populations estimated by deducting the deaths from the enumerated populations and adding the births from the time that the census of 1896 (the end of the first quarter of the year) was taken to the middle of the year 1899. The unknown figures relating to emigration and imigration concerning the parishes have received no consideration. Poplar. Bromlev. Census 1896 57,759 69,821 Deaths from first quarter of year 1896 to middle of year 1899 4,033 4,654 53,726 65,167 Births for the corresponding period 6,481+ 8,256 + Estimated population (b) to the middle of year 1899 60,207 73,423 For convenience the rates as mentioned above will be styled (a) or (b) according to the respective estimated population used. Poplar. Bromley. (a) 58,709 69,618 (b) 60,207 73,423 Next year, 1901, will be the year for taking the census, when it will be interesting to discover which of the two estimated populations proves the more correct. Of course, when comparing the figures, 3 consideration will have to be given (as far as possible) to the alterations in the boundaries as settled by the Commissioner under the new London Government Act. In calculating with two estimated populations, it is obvious, that when rates are obtained with the lower population, the result will always be greater than if the higher figures had been used, and vice versa. In dealing generally with the rates in this Report, the lower population (a)—except where mentioned—will be used, in order to compare the rates obtained with those of other metropolitan sanitary districts, as the populations of these areas (which form the whole metropolis) are estimated upon the same theory. The births during the 52 weeks were:— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 1036 945 1981 Bromley 1253 1229 2482 Totals 2289 2174 4463 Of these births 59 were illegitimate in Poplar, 27 males and 32 females. In Bromley there were 44 illegitimate births 25 males and 19 females. The annual birth rate per 1000 living being;— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

The annual marriage rate per 1000 living being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

Treating the 2129 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 740 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 188 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1577. The 1363 deaths in Poplar included 15 illegitimate children, 9 male and 6 female, and the 1577 deaths in Bromley included 19 illegitimate children, 11 male and 8 female. Males. Females. Totals.

Poplar 290 328 618 Bromley 409 496 905 Totals 699 824 1523 The male births in the two parishes exceeded those of the female 5 by 115, but the male deaths exceeded those of the female by 240, which makes a gain of 125 females. At the end of the year 1898 there was also an excess of females. The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 15 years:— Poplar. Bromley.

Legislation is urgently required for the regulation of dairies and the inspection of milch cows. The compulsion of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on tuberculosis would no doubt tend to lessen the prevalence of consumption in its various forms. 8 TABLE I. 9 ( A) Table of Deaths during the year 1899, POPLAR Division of the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Poplar, classified according to Diseases, Ages and Localities.

Notifications and Hospital Accommodation, Outworkers, and Port Sanitary Authorities' Notifications. There were 528 notifications of infectious diseases in Poplar and 556 in Bromley; these do not include 44 second notifications. The notification rate per 1000 living being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

Of the 528 patients notified in Poplar, 220 were removed to hospitals, and of the 556 in Bromley, 253 were isolated. In giving the above numbers of notifications, no deductions have been made for the following cases, which it will be seen developed other diseases, either shortly after admission or after being in the hospital some time, whilst the list 'also shews that some patients removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Boards' hospitals, after being detained in those institutions some days were returned home certified as not suffering from the complaint or any other notifiable disease. 23 Parish.

On account of certain patients contracting another infectious disease whilst inmates of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, I was directed by the Board to communicate with the Medical 24 tendents of the South Eastern and Eastern Fever Hospitals. The following is the report upon the subject presented to the Sanitary Committee, 27th April:— "So far as the South Eastern Fever Hospital is concerned, a reply was received from the Clerk to the Asylums Board stating that the matter shall receive attention, and later on the Clerk to the Asylums Board wrote—'Your letter of the 30th ultimo, addressed to the Medical Superintendent of the Hospital upon the matter, was read to the Committee of Management at their meeting on the 20th inst. At the same time the Committee had under consideration the observations of the Medical Superintendent upon the subject-matter of your letter, and a copy of these they directed me to forward to you in reply to it.' "[Copy.] "South Eastern Hospital. "Observations of Medical Superintendent re case of--. "I beg to report as follows concerning the case referred to in Dr. Alexander's letter: "--was admitted here on the 23rd December, 1898, with diphtheria. While in the hospital he developed chicken-pox and scarlet fever, on February 4th, 1899, and February 10th respectively. The source of infection in the first case could not be traced ; in the second case it was from a boy in an adjoining bed. I regret to say that this case is not an isolated instance, and that many patients develop a second disease after admission to hospital. I have regularly reported to you the number of such cases in each annual report I have submitted to you. "20th April, 1899. "(Signed) F. M. TURNER. "The Medical Superintendent of the Eastern Fever Hospital in his reply states: 'Diphtheria has long been known as a complication of the convalescent stage ol Scarlet Fever. I think myself, and I think this is the commonly accepted view, that the infection of 25 Diphtheria gets conveyed into the Starlet Fever wards by means of mixed cases of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, in which symptoms of the latter disease are marked by those of the former. The same observation applies with respect to the case of---, only putting Enteric Fever instead of Scarlet Fever; and adding that the combination of Diphtheria is much less common than that of Diphtheria and Scarlet Fever.'" During the last quarter great difficulty was experienced in the isolation of patients suffering from typhoid fever, through want of accommodation at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals (see page 31). Three cases of scarlet fever and two of typhoid fever in Poplar and one of typhoid fever, also one of diphtheria and one of continued fever in Bromley were connected with milk shops in Bromley. The London County Council was communicated with and the sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected. Six outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified, 3 in Poplar and 3 in Bromley. The usual notices were served. With regard to Section 55 (4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—"Where a Medical Officer of Health receives a certificate under this section relating to a patient residing within the Metropolitan Asylum District he shall, within twelve hours after such receipt, send a copy thereof to the Metropolitan Asylum Managers, and to the head teacher of the school attended by the patient (if a child), or by any child who is an inmate of the same house as the patient." In a report to the Committee, on the 23rd February, it was pointed out, that if the true letter of the Act is to be carried out it would 26 involve officers being at work night and day, as notifications are received at all hours. In order to more closely comply with the forwarding of the copies of notifications to the head teachers so that children might be excluded from schools, as soon as possible, and thus prevent the spread of infectious disease, instructions were given to the Sanitary Inspectors to send their men to the office to make enquiries every afternoon about 4 o'clock, or communicate by telephone from the Board's Depots as to whether any notifications had been received since the morning, and, if so, the men were to at once call at the houses and bring back information to the Clerk in the Sanitary Department whose duty it is to send copies of the notifications to the schools, so that a copy of the notification might be sent the same evening to the school or schools, as the case might be, in order that children might be excluded first.thing in the morning. Notices of eight passengers had been received from the London Port Sanitary Authority (see Bubonic Plague, page 61.) disinfecting department. The following figures give the number of premises disinfected, and the number of times the Board's apparatus was used for the two parishes, some thousands of articles being disinfected. Private premises. Board's apparatus. Poplar 372 322 Bromley 399 389 771 711 In my report dated 23rd November upon Bubonic plague (see page 61), I called the attention of the Committee to the fact that there was only one disinfecting apparatus in the Poplar district. The 27 Committee was also asked to consider the advisability of having a stand-by apparatus erected at the disinfecting station, so that in the event of a break-down with the present one, there would be no delay in disinfecting. The Committee deferred the consideration of the matter until it was found out whether another apparatus could be fixed at the existing station. SMALL POX. Two cases of small pox, one in Poplar and the other in Bromley, were notified during the year. The Poplar case was notified from Grosvenor Buildings The patient was a winch-man on board a steamship in the Albert Dock. The case had been seen by three medical men, and as there was a difference of opinion I examined the patient and advised his removal in order that he might be isolated and watched, the disease being doubtful. The patient was removed and detained at the South Wharf, and afterwards sent to the hospital ship. The Medical Officer for the Port of London was communicated with. On the 16th November I was called to a patient who appeared to be suffering from a modified attack of small pox. Removal was advised in order that the case might be isolated. The patient was an Engineer's Steward on board the ss. "Arundel Castle," and lodging in Bromley. He had one good vaccination scar. The ship left the Cape on the 13th or 14th of October and arrived in London on 7th November. A passenger sickened with small pox on the voyage home and was landed at Plymouth on 4th November. 28 The engineer's mess-room was immediately opposite the hospital where the patient was isolated. The London Port Sanitary Authority was immediately communicated with as the "Arundel Castle" was to sail again on the 17th November. Mr. Hitchins, the vaccination officer, has kindly furnished me with the following statistics, which are copied from those forwarded to the Local Government Board:— 1898.—January to June.

Seventy-seven cases in Poplar and 53 in Bromley were removed to various hospitals as follows:— Poplar. Metropolitan Asylums Boards' Hospitals 49 St. John's Nursing Hospital, Lewisham 2 Greenwich Hospital 1 Childrens' Hospital, Shadwell 3 Sick Asylum 7 London Hospital 5 Metropolitan Hospital 3 Charing Cross Hospital 2 German Hospital 1 Poplar Hospital 2 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 2 77 *Note.—This means that 31 cases in Poplar and 13 in Bromley occurred in houses where typhoid fever already existed. It is my endeavour to make the friends of patients aware that typhoid fever can be contracted from the urine (which is not generally known) as well as from the stools, and that the former requires disinfecting as well as the latter. This fact I have caused to be stated in the printed directions on the bottles of disinfectants given away to parishioners in typhoid fever cases. To further jnstify my action in discarding sulphur fumigation and using a solution of Formic Aldehyde Gas (Formalin) for spraying rooms after infectious cases, it no doubt will be interesting to learn that a drug called Urotropin is now given to patients suffering with typhoid fever. Urotropin is formed by the action of Formalin on Ammonia, and, when taken internally, Formalin is liberated from the drug after its passage into the urinary tract (bladder, &c.) which it disinfects, and causes the typhoid baccili to rapidly disappear from this portion of the body. One cannot educate the public too much in the matter of preventing the spread of such a terrible disease as typhoid fever and I trust this note may be of some means in assisting in that direction. 31 Bromley. Metropolitan Asylums Boards' Hospitals 33 London Hospital 15 Greenwich Hospital 1 St. Bartholomew's Hospital 1 Sick Asylum 2 Metropolitan Hospital 1 53 Eight cases sent to various hospitals, 5 in Poplar and 3 in Bromley, were returned home (see list page 23) as not suffering from typhoid fever. No deductions for these cases have been made in any of the figures given above. Nineteen Poplar parishioners died from typhoid fever, and 12 fatal cases occurred among the Bromley patients. The typhoid fever cases occurred for the most part, as will be seen, during the last quarter of the year. 1st Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total. Poplar 27 9 19 88 143 Bromley 16 13 16 47 92 43 22 35 135 235 During the last quarter of the year when Typhoid Fever prevailed, great difficulty was experienced in obtaining the removal of patients, as many as fifteen being kept waiting at onetime. Several cases had to seek relief from the Parish and desired to be admitted into the Sick Asylum. This could not be granted through the existing instructions of the Local Government Board. Learning of the great distress, Mr. Crooks interested himself in the matter, and, for the time being, cases which applied to the Relieving Officers were admitted into the Sick Asylum. 32 Apart from the eating of badly washed celery and watercress. and of raw or im erfectly-cooked shell-fish taken from sewage-contaminated sources, or the drinking of polluted water, one explanation that Typhoid Fever generally prevails during the last quarter of the year may be that the cold atmospheric air displaces the heated ground air, and also the sewer air-fermentation having taken place in the polluted earth during the hot summer. The heavy rains which happen at this period affecting the movement of the ground and sewer airs may also be a cause of the prevalence of Typhoid Fever. DIPHTHERIA (INCLUDING MEMBRANOUS CROUP). 144 cases of diphtheria and 7 cases of membranous croup were notified in Poplar, and 176 cases of diphtheria and 4 cases of membranous croup were notified in Bromley.

Best endeavours are always made to keep children away from school for at least one month after notification of diphtheria.

A scheme was suggested to the effect that no premises should be disinfected, nor any child allowed to return to school until the throat of the patient had been bacteriologically examined. It was also pointed out that Medical Practitioners differ as to diagnosis, on account of the difficulty of forming an opinion by a naked eye examination. "The Committee deferred further consideration of the matter pending enquiries to be made by the Medical Officer, of the Medical Practitioners in his district, as to the arrangements necessary to be made with them in the event of the scheme being adopted by the Board. "A circular letter was addressed to the Medical Practitioners asking for their views respecting the proposed scheme. 35 "Twenty answers were received. The scheme for arriving at a correct diagnosis was considered good by all the Practitioners, and the question of payment for sending membrane and secretions was raised by some of them. "There is no doubt that such an examination could be easily carried out, with the consent of the parents, &c., in the first instance, upon notification, and the 2s. 6d. fee should satisfy any Practitioner, who should doubtlessly be paid for his trouble, whether the complaint turned out to be diphtheria or not; but the difficulty would be in declaring a patient free, as the services of the Medical Man who first attended might have been discontinued, so that there might be no Practitioner in attendance, or another one might have been called in from a district where the measure was not in operation, so that this part of the scheme would appear to be unworkable, unless adopted throughout the Metropolis. "The matter is a very difficult one to carry out in its entirety. There is no doubt, as has been pointed out in one of my annual reports, that a large number of cases notified as being diphtheria are not the complaint. In one Metropolitan sanitary area, in which 60 cases were bacteriologically examined, it was found that no less than 24 were not true diphtheria, though all the symptons were those of the dread disease, so that if bacteriological examinations of throats were universally carried out, the hardship and expense consequent upon isolation and disinfection would be saved. "On the other hand, the Committee will remember that at the end of the year 1897, when diphtheria was prevalent, with a high mortality, on the Isle of Dogs, children were found attending the Wharf Road Board School suffering from complaints following diphtheria, and they had never been notified as having the complaint. "If the aid of bacteriology is to be of any use, doubtlessly all sore throats should be tested for diphtheria, inasmuch as diphtheria cases 36 of a small degree of severity are difficult to recognise, and at the same time, if unrecognised, are liable to spread the disease; then, if samples of the secretions are taken from the throat, even though the bacteriological examination shows absence of diphtheritic germs, a fee would possibly be payable. "If the Board School Authorities would not re-admit a patient until such an examination had been properly made, the spread of diphtheria would, doubtlessly, be mitigated (this examination has been done in the case of a private school outside the district); but among the poor, who is to pay Practitioners for this examination, which may have to be repeated: the Sanitary Authority or the School Board ? "It is very largely agreed that since the coming into force of the Education Act of 1870, diphtheria has prevailed in towns, and this fact is no doubt due to the crowding together of children in Schools. "One Practitioner, in his reply, suggested that all Board Schools should be closed six months in order to stamp out the epidemic, which he stated had been" going on for ten years. "There are cases notified as diphtheria which rapidly improve in a few days, and are certified by the Medical Practitioners as recovered. Before advising the Committee further in the matter, I decided in the early part of the year 1898, to prevent—as far as I was able—children returning to School within four weeks after notification, and not to have premises disinfected within that period. A space for inserting the date of the notification has been printed on the post cards left at infected houses, so that the Medical Practitioner can see the time which has elapsed before signing the cards, and Practitioners have been constantly communicated with respecting their certificates of recovery, and their attention called to the desirability that not less than a month should elapse before disinfection, from the date of notification. 37 "The notice of the Committee is called to the undermentioned figures:— 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 Diphtheria — 418 575 526 599 390 Typhoid Fever - 156 136 153 148 119 Scarlet Fever 148l 570 673 703 727 532 "There is no doubt that keeping children from school, for at least one month after notification of any infectious disease, is the proper course to pursue. It may, however, be premature to pass an opinion as to whether such action, combined with the disinfection of premises by spraying with a solution of formic aldehyde gas (burning sulphur having been discontinued), has been the cause of diminishing the number of infectious cases during the past year. "On account of the impossibility of diagnosing diphtheria by the naked eye examination, differences of opinion have occurred from time to lime among the Practitioners of the district. This is not only most unfortunate for the patients and their relatives but also interferes materially with the carrying out of isolation. To quote an instance which has occurred lately : a patient, aged 25 years, came home ill from service to her mother in Bromley, and a Practitioner called in and diagnosed the case as diphtheria. The patient was seen also by his assistant, a qualified man, in the evening, who agreed as to complaint. Next day the young woman resolved to go to a hospital; the ambulance was sent for, and arrived at the door ; but another medical man had been called in who pronounced the disease as not diphtheria, although no bacteriological examination had been made. Many instances can be quoted where medical men differ, and also it must be known to the Committee that cases have been sent in good faith to the Asylums Boards Hospitals, and returned after some days certified as not having the disease, nor any other infectious complaint. "From the middle of July, i8q8 to the present time, eleven 38 patients—seven notified as diphtheria, and four as typhoid—were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, and after some days were returned home as not suffering from those complaints, or other notifiable disease. "That cases should be diagnosed as diphtheria when they are not that malady, is a bad state of affairs, as children in the same house lose their education, and tenants are put to the inconvenience of isolation and disinfection; and moreover, the bread winner in some instances is not allowed to work. Further, should a patient in his or her turn be removed to a hospital when there is want of accommodation, and other cases are waiting for admission, a true case may be kept at home, and not receive the full benefit of the skilled "anti-toxin" treatment. "I beg to inform the Committee that a system can be adopted in Poplar, as in some other Metropolitan Sanitary Districts, whereby facilities are offered to Medical Practitioners for the bateriological diagnosis, not only of doubtful diphtheria cases, but also of typhoid fever cases, in which latter complaint there is frequently difficulty and nearly always long delay in stating definitely the disease, and friends are caused prolonged anxiety. The Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine, Chelsea Gardens, S.W., provides tin cases, or diagnosis boxes, containing sterilised outfits, with directions at IS. per box. A supply of these boxes could be kept at the Board's Offices, or one could be sent to every Medical Practitioner in the district, and the boxes, when charged in accordance with the directions, should be forthwith sent to the Medical Officer of Health in a stamped and addressed envelope, and an uncharged diagnosis box, with addressed and stamped envelope, should be transmitted to the Practitioner by return. The boxes should be numbered and stamped, "Board of Works for the Poplar District." Inside the box should be an "IDENTIFICATION FORM." No of Diagnosis Box Date 39 Medical Practitioner Name Address Patient Name Sex ... Age Address Disease Suspected "The charged boxes upon being received at the Public Health Department, would be forwarded as soon as possible to the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine, in special shaped envelopes, and if received at the Institute before 6 p.m., the result would be communicated by telegram before noon next day. The above is a general description of what is being carried out now by some Local Authorities. "The Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicin1e charges Sanitary Authorities 2s. 6d. for the examination, 6d. for refitting boxes with sterilised outfits, and 6d. for the telegram, making 3s. 6d. in all, not including the one shilling for the box in the first instance. "In conclusion, the Committee will, no doubt, understand from statements in the report, the immense benefit which would be derived, not only to the persons immediately concerned, but to the public at large, in having diphtheria and typhoid fever cases correctly and quickly diagnosed. "Parents in some instances would not be kept from work, children in a house after notification would not lose their education, and there would not happen the inconvenience of having the premises disinfected." Upon this report the Committee recommended that the Medical Officer be authorised to arrange experimentally for two months, for the supply of outfits to Medical Practitioners for doubtful cases of typhoid fever and diphtheria, and to submit the charged boxes of secretion from the throat for bacteriological examination. 40 At a meeting of the Sanitary Committee held on the 28th June, I presented the following report:— "Respecting the bacteriological examination of doubtful cases of diphtheria and typhoid fever, a copy of the Board's Resolution of the 14th February, with a copy of the report of the Medical Officer to the Sanitary Committee, dated 26th January, was sent on the 27th February to 72 Practitioners in the district and its immediate vicinity; at the same time, a letter was forwarded asking whether, in doubtful cases of typhoid fever and diphtheria, the Practitioner would be willing to avail himself of the opportunity offered by the Board to arrive at correct diagnoses, more especially where no objection is raised to the removal of such cases to isolation hospitals. Sixteen answers were received. "On the 4th April, 16 diphtheria and a like number of typhoid fever diagnosis outfits, were delivered to those Practitioners who had replied to the communication. After the 4th April, 6 Medical Practitioners applied personally for outfits. "Since the 4th April, 13 "swabbings" from throats of suspected cases of diphtheria have been sent on to the Board's Offices, and then forwarded to the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine to be examined bacteriologically. "The bacillus diphtheriae was isolated in 4 instances, in 5 cases the diphtheritic germ was not found, and in 4 swabbings the socalled pseudo bacillus diphtheriae was isolated, which is a germ nonvirulent to animals; so that out of 13 patients suspected to be suffering from diphtheria, only 4 had the complaint. "In the above 13 instances, 5 notifications were received. The Practitioners refrained from notifying until they had learnt the result of the examination. "A notification of diphtheria was received from an institution outside the district, The mother of the patient, against the wish of 41 the Resident Medical Officer, brought the child home through the streets, and then took the patient to a practitioner in the district, who having his doubt about the complaint, sent a swabbing from the throat on to the Board's Offices for examination : no bacilli were found. "This is an instance of a case being notified by one practitioner as diphtheria, which, upon having ' swabbings' taken by another medical man, showed no germs of the disease, and clearly proves, as mentioned in the report of the 26th January, that a naked eye examination in doubtful cases is of no avail. "In one case a boy had a sore throat; he was comparatively well, but the medical attendant thought it advisable to have a 'swabbing' from the throat examined. The result shewed the bacillus diphtheriae present; the patient was thereupon removed to Homerton Fever Hospital. This is an instance of diphtheria causing only slight catarrhal symptoms, the disease not being notified, and the patient no doubt feeling apparently well in a day or two would be sent back to school, and thereby possibly causing an outbreak of diphtheria. In a case like the above post-diphtheritic paralysis may follow. It will be remembered when diphtheria was prevalent, with a high mortality, on the Isle of Dogs, at the end of the year 1897, children were found attending the Wharf Road Board School suffering from complaints following diphtheria, and they had never been notified as having the complaint. "One practitioner who had had the circular letter, &c., sent to him, and who was notifying diphtheria cases, was again written to calling his attention to the facilities offered by the Board in order to arrive at correct diagnoses, but up to the present he has not asked for a diagnosis outfit. "It was necessary, after forwarding the boxes, to send a circular letter to practitioners informing them that the diagnosis outfits were only to be used for cases in the Poplar district; one medical man 42 in the Bromley Parish had sent a charged box from a patient outside the district. "The method of transmission of the boxes from the practitioners to the Board's Offices, and thence to the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine, has answered very well. If the boxes are received at the Board's Offices and posted on, so as to arrive at the Jenner Institute before 6 o'clock p.m., a telegram has been sent about 11 a.m. next day stating the result, and the official certificate has followed later on. "By practitioners waiting for the result of the examination before notifying, the notification fee of 2s. 6d. has been saved in those cases which have turned out not to be the disease, so that the notification fee has been practically paid by the Board for the bacteriological examination. "I trust that the Committee will recommend the Board to allow of the continuance of bacteriological examination, as it must be obvious that parents in a number of instances have been relieved from any anxiety as to the nature of the complaint, and they have also not been inconvenienced by having their homes considered as being infected and necessary to undergo disinfection ; also the breadwinners have not been kept from work, and children have not been excluded from school.'' Upon this report the Committee recommended that the system be adopted throughout the district. The sending of specimens (swabbings and blood) to the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine commenced on the 4th April. Since which date the number of specimens forwarded with the results has been as follows:— Bacillus Diphtheriae isolated 21 Pseudo Bacillus 5 No result 22 Total number of swabbings sent 48 43 Widal (typhoid) reaction* obtained 18 No result 6 Total number of specimens (blood from typhoid fever cases) forwarded 24 There were also sent three swabbings from doubtful convalescent cases of diphtheria, but no bacilli were found. The relation between the pseudo-diphtheritic bacillus of Hofman and the virulent Klebs-Loffler bacillus is a difficult and vexed question and is not clearly understood. Some authorities state that there is no doubt that the diphtheria bacillus may assume the form of the pseudo-bacillus. It is also contended that under certain circumstances the pseudo diphtheria bacillus apparently becomes transformed into the virulent Klebs-Loffler bacillus. Examinations of throats have revealed the virulent form present upon the first test, the pseudo upon the second and the virulent again upon the third. So far as notification of cases is concerned, where the pseudo bacillus is found immediately the patients come under treatment, this matter must be left to the experience of the medical attendant to decide in individual cases, and further bacteriological examinations might be made. There can be no doubt that in the presence of an outbreak of diphtheria the pseudo bacillus should always be looked upon with suspicion, as otherwise a very tedious process of experimentation on animals would have to be gone through in each case, more especially as the pseudo and the virulent bacilli may exist together and the latter escape observation. On the whole a person who has had throat symptoms and in whom the pseudo bacillus is found, should not be permitted to mix with other individuals until the throat is clear. "Note.—The re-action depends on the fact that the specific (Eberth-Gaffky) bacilli of typhoid fever lose their power of movement, and become collected in clumps (or agglutinated as it is called) in fluids containing the specific antitoxin of the disease, and this antitoxin is developed in the blood of all patients suffering from typhoid very shortly after the invasion of the disease. 44 There are some authorities, however, who consider these cases should be regarded as diphtheritic and hence notified. WHOOPING COUGH. Thirty-six deaths were registered in Poplar from whooping-cough and 5 deaths were notified from outside the parish, making a total of 41, and all these deaths with the exception of 1 were of children under 5 years of age. In Bromley were registered 50 deaths under 5 years of age; but 10 of these deaths did not belong to the parish, so that the deaths from whooping cough belonging to Bromley were 40 in number. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

Fourteen deaths occurred in Poplar from influenza, and all these were in persons over 5 years of age. 38 deaths happened from the same disease in Bromley, 1 of these deaths was in a child under 5 years of age and 1 death occurring within the parish did not belong thereto, so that 37 Bromley parishioners died from influenza. MEASLES. Thirty-eight deaths from measles happened in Poplar, and one death in an outlying institution, making a total of 39 deaths, 38 of which were of children under five years. In Bromley 59 deaths were registered, 12 of these deaths occurring in the Sick Asylum, also 1 in the Stepney Union Workhouse, and 3 in the Bromley portion of the City of London Union Infirmary; but as 15 of the 59 deaths did not belong to the parish, the total deaths from measles belonging to Bromley will be 44, and of this number 43 were under and 1 over 5 years of age. 45 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

All children from infected houses were excluded, not only from the Infants' department, but also from the Boys' and Girls' departments. The Medical Officer of the School Board was communicated with. On the 20th July it was reported from the Woolmore Street Board School that 129 scholars had been excluded, either from measles being in the houses, or on account of suffering from the disease. A number of scholars at St. Gabriel's Church School, Morris Road, also suffered from measles. A certificate was forwarded to the Vicar advising exclusion of children from all infected houses. It was fortunate for the sufferers that at the time the weather was warm, so that the risk of complications through lung troubles was minimised. Shortly after the occurrence of these cases the Summer holidays commenced, so that no doubt the spread of the disease was thereby stopped. In my last annual report, under the heading of measles, I mentioned the gross injustice of depriving children, when excluded from school by reason of infectious cases, of their attendance marks, thereby causing them to lose their chance of winning medals. The Committee, in the year 1898, recommended the School Board to be written to, and again last year (1899) the Committee advised that the School Board be urged not to deprive the children, when excluded from school, of their chance of winning medals. 46 DIARRHŒA. Seventy-four deaths from diarrhœa with 8 from outlying institutions belonging to the Poplar parish, give a total of 82 deaths, 75 of which occurred in children under 5 years. In Bromley 102 deaths happened, 5 of which were of non-residents, and two deaths were reported from outlying institutions, so that 99 deaths belong to Bromley, and of these, 92 were of children under 5 years of age. For death rates see Tables III. and IV., page 12. Deaths from diarrhoea for the past six years were as follows:— 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. 1899.

So far as Grosvenor Buildings are concerned, 6 Dispensary medical orders, and 8 orders for the Medical Officer to see patients at their own homes were issued. There were also on the permanent medical relief list 13 persons residing in the Buildings who were entitled to apply for medical attendance at any time.

At a meeting of the Sanitary Committee, held the 27th day of April, the Committee considered a Report from me on the subject of the condition of 16 to 40, Devas Street, 1 to 19, Favonia Street, 52 to 66, Donald Street, 1 to 6, Thomas Street, and 1 to 4, Sarah Place. The Committee viewed the area and agreed with me that I should represent Nos. 1 to 4, Sarah Place, 9 to 19, Favonia Street (Nelson Court), 28, Devas Street, and I, Thomas Street, making 12 houses D 50 in all, to the London County Council, to be dealt with by them under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as an "unhealthy area," and that notices should be served upon the owners of the other houses requiring them to put such premises into proper sanitary condition. On the 11th May, I represented the houses iu question as comprising an "unhealthy area" under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, and as this report is being written, an inquiry by an official on behalf of the Home Secretary is about to take place, as well as in respect of the Burford's Court and Tucker's Court areas which I represented in the year 1898 as being unhealthy. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. In my last Annual Report I stated that on the 8th September, 1898, I presented a report upon the whole subject of Houses Let in Lodgings to the Sanitary Committee, and the Committee deferred consideration of the matter for three months. On the 23rd March the Committee again considered my report and the letter from the London County Council with reference to the enforcement of the Bye-laws and their exemption clauses. The Committee recommended that notices should be given to landlords of houses in certain streets under clause 5 of the Bye-laws requiring them "to supply the information necessary for the registration of such house by the Sanitary Authority." Accordingly the necessary notices were given. Whilst writing this report the replies received are being tabulated, the completion of which I had endeavoured to fit in with the work of the department. Now that the Board has appointed a Senior Clerk (Mr. Rodford) for the Public Health Department I trust that there will be no delay in bringing any further matter before the Committee. BAKEHOUSES. During the year the bakehouses were twice inspected by Mr. 51 Raymond, the Inspector of Nuisances in factories and workshops, and the notices as to limewhiting, &c., were served in those cases considered necessary. See Inspector's Report, page 93. SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND COWHOUSES. Fourteen slaughterhouses, (8 in Poplar and 6 in Bromley), and 11 cowhouses, (4 in Poplar and 7 in Bromley), were inspected upon receiving notices from the owners of their intention to apply for the renewal of their licenses to the London County Council. In no instance was the Board advised to oppose the license. In the preceding year 1898 there were in Poplar 9 slaughterhouses and 5 cowhouses. INSANITARY BARGES. On the 31st July, at the Cannon Street Hotel, I was invited to attend a Conference of Local Authorities, re Insanitary Barges. The cause of the convening of the conference was that the notice of the Sanitary Committee had been called to the insanitary condition of barges not registered under the Canal Boats Act, and that on board of such vessels men through various causes were obliged to remain, or in other words, sleep and live. Mr. Potts, the Clerk to the Board,—who had all the trouble and extra labour in calling the conference, acting as its Clerk and carrying on the correspondence in connection with an endeavour to obtain an amendment to the existing law,— no doubt, will presently in his Annual Report, enter fully into the result of the proceedings and conference. It is as well to remember that apart from the registering of canal boats under the Canal Boats Act, a Local Authority has jurisdiction 52 of any vessels by section no (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. "For the purposes of this Act any vessel lying in any river or other water within the district of a sanitary authority shall (subject to the provisions of this Act with respect to the Port Sanitary Authority of the Port of London) be subject to the jurisdiction of that authority in the same manner as if it were a house within such district. "(2) The master of any such vessel shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be the occupier of such vessel." By section 141: "The expression 'vessel' includes a boat and every description of vessel used in navigation." At the Conference it was pointed out that where a non-registered canal boat is used for sleeping purposes test legal proceedings might be instituted under the Canal Boats Act. Section 1. " If a canal boat is used as a dwelling in contravention of this Act, the master of the boat, and also the owner of the boat if he is in fault, shall each be liable to a fine not exceeding twenty-shillings for each occasion on which the boat is so used." FISH OFFAL. Following up the matter of the nuisance arising from the collection and removal of offal from fishmongers shops and its deposit after removal, I reported as follows, at a meeting of the Sanitary Committee held 26th January:— "With respect to the Committee's suggestion that the Board should collect the fish offal of the district, the matter having been referred to the Clerk and Medical Officer to make enquiries and to report, I interviewed the Clerk and Surveyor to the Woolwich Local Board, which authority collects and destroys, as trade refuse, its fish offal. In Woolwich the Local Board supplies, free of cost, galvanised iron receptacles with air-tight lids. There are 140 of these receptacles, 53 70 of which are collected every day and 70 left in their places, some shops having two or more according to their wants. The collection and distribution of receptacles occupies one half day, and is carried out by means of one trolly drawn by a horse; two men accompany the trolly, one in charge of the horse, and the other collects and distributes the receptacles. The lids of the charged receptacles are not removed until the 'Destructor' is reached, when the offal is mixed with the house refuse to be burnt on the tipping platform. The man who collects and distributes the receptacles is engaged during the afternoon in cleansing and disinfecting the receptacles previous to their distribution next day. No payment for collection has been made up to the present, but it is under the consideration of the Local Board to collect also the butchers' offal, as well as the fish, and to make a charge at so much per bushel, so as to cover expenses. "It will be remembered that the Committee, at its meeting on the 24th February, 1898, directed that notices should be served throughout the district, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sec. 36 (2), requiring the daily removal of the refuse matter:— '(2) Notice may be given by a Sanitary authority, by public announcement, in the district or otherwise, requiring the periodical removal of manure or other refuse matter from stables, cowhouses, or other premises; and where any such notice has been given, if any person to whom the manure or other refuse matter belongs fails to comply with the notice, he shall be liable, without further notice, to a fine not exceeding twenty shillings for each day during which such non-compliance continues.' "The bye-laws made by the London County Council, under sec. 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prescribe the times and manner of removal of offensive, &c. matter. "It appears from the Act that the Sanitary authority can compel offensive matter to be removed periodically, but they cannot compel 54 owners to have it removed by the Local authority; on the other hand, the Local authority can be required to remove trade refuse. "Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— '33. (1) If the Sanitary authority are required by the owner or occupier of any premises to remove any trade refuse that authority shall do so, and the owner or occupier shall pay to that authority a reasonable sum for such removal, and such sum, in case of dispute, shall be settled by the order of a Petty Sessional Court.' '(2) If any dispute or difference of opinion arises between the owner or occupier and the Sanitary authority as to what is to be considered as trade refuse, a Petty Sessional Court, on complaint made by either party, may by order determine whether the subject matter of dispute is or is not trade refuse, andt he decision of that Court shall be final.' "Section 141 Public Health (London) Act, 1891: The expression 'trade refuse' means the refuse of any trade, manufacture, or business, or of any building materials." SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. On account of drainage work being carried out at St. Saviour's Church Schools, Arcadia Street, it being necessary to abolish the old drains which pass under the building, and also to remove the sewage sodden earth, a conference took place with the Vicar, Architect, and H. M. Inspector. It was decided that the school should be closed whilst the work was being executed. The next day, acting on my advice, under the 88th section of the Code of Regulations for Day Schools, Mr. Bussey (the then Chairman) and Mr. Riddall (a Member of the Board) visited the schools, and gave the Managers notice to close, and exclude all children from the school until the work was carried out. The school remained closed from the 28th February to the 13th March. 55 Trees have been planted by the Millwall Dock Company on the border of the mud area at the rear of the houses in Stebondale Street, and appear to be doing well. Where w.c. pans and traps had been fixed without notice to the Clerk under clause 14 of the London County Council bye-laws, section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Sanitary Committee, in every case brought under their notice, directed that the builder be written to, asking him to open the ground, otherwise he would be prosecuted for infringing the bye-law. During the year 12 cases were brought under the notice of the Committee. In three instances, after the ground had been opened the drains were found defective. Builders. I am pleased to say, are now beginning to recognise the importance of the bye-law. This is no doubt due to the action of the Committee. Under section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, certificates were authorised to be signed that there were proper and sufficient water supplies at the following newly erected premises:— 37, Byron Street; 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34, Cottage Street (west side); 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, Cottage Street (east side, north end); 1, 3, 5 and 7, Oban Street; Police Station, East India Dock Road: 50, and 52, Bruce Road; 37, 83, 85, 87 and 89, Galbraith Street; Porter's Lodge, Sick Asylum; 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, n, 12 and 13, Cottage Street (east side, south end); 70, Pennyfields; Christ Church House Follett Street, Dee Street, Board School and School-keeper's premises. Certificates were given under section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting 12 cases of overcrowding:-2 in Bromley and 10 in Poplar, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 22 cases of overcrowding, 10 in Poplar and 12 in Bromley, were abated upon service of intimations. 56 List of Sanitary Works carried out in the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley, from the 1st January, 1899, to 31st December, 1899.

I suggested to the Sanitary Committee that it would be advisable to point out to the importers and the wholesale houses the desirability of having tins containing bad condensed milk destroyed altogether, or removed by the Local Authority as trade refuse (more especially as the importers and wholesale houses now pay to have it taken away) and then there would be no possibility of it being used as human food. I stated that it was manifestly wrong that the contents of tins which have practically been given away for pig feeding or manure should again find their way into the market. It is not only detrimental to the public health, but it is bad from a monetary point of view as it must interfere with the trade of the shopkeepers, and it must also lessen the business of the wholesale houses and importers of condensed milk. The question was asked, is such milk fit for pig feeding ? but the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, only relates to articles intended for the food of man. The Committee recommended that the various sanitary authorities in London be asked to communicate the suggestion to wholesale dealers in condensed milk in their districts. On another occasion I reported for the information of the Committee and general public, that it was rumoured that the contents of blown tins containing unwholesome condensed milk, since the recent prosecutions, are emptied into gallon jars and thus supplied to dishonest pastry-cooks, &c. The opening of such tins and the pouring into the jars take place near a pig stye, as if for pigs' food, in order to throw the Officers of Local Authorities off their guard. 61 BUBONIC PLAGUE.* At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee on the 23rd November, the following report was presented:— "On account of cases of plague occurring in Portuguese and "Spanish ports, Dr. Reece, one of the Medical Inspectors of the "Local Government Board, was instructed by that authority to confer "with the Clerk and your Medical Officers of Health on the question "of precautions to be taken in regard to seamen from abroad, who "may possibly be the means of introducing plague into the district. "Mr. Randall, the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee was present "at the Conference. "One of the outcomes of the Conference has been that letters have "been sent to the medical practitioners of the Poplar District and its "immediate neighbourhood, stating the absolute desirability that "special attention should be paid to all seafaring persons coming "under their notice in early stages of illness. It was pointed out in "the communication that the incubative period of plague is estimated "to be from five to ten days, and the duration of the voyage from "Oporto is only four days, therefore it is quite possible for persons to "land in an incubative stage. Moreover, Portugal is not the only "country where plague exists at the present moment, hence the "absolute need for careful attention in respect of all seamen. The "practitioners were informed that patients suffering from plague will "be immediately admitted into the hospitals of the Metropolitan "Asylums Board upon certificates forwarded in the same manner as "for other infectious and contagious diseases. "Dr. Reece stated that the Local Government Board intended at "the beginning of the year 1900, to make plague a notifiable disease. "Printed directions were also enclosed for obtaining and sending "material from plague cases (both from the living and from the dead) "for bacterioscopic examination. The specimens upon being received * See foot note page 63 and 64. 62 "at the Board's offices would be immediately forwarded to the "officials at Whitehall, who will carry out such examination. "I called at all the common lodging houses in Poplar, and I also "visited (through information received) premises where seafaring men "are known to board The deputies and proprietors were requested "to give immediate information at the Board's offices of any seamen "(whether British or foreign) arriving from Spanish or Portuguese "ports, so that I might examine them and keep them under constant "observation. Cards to be hung up have been printed and sent "round to all the above-mentioned premises.‡ "The Sanitary Inspectors in their rounds will also be constantly "inquiring as to places otherwise than those already known where "sailors take up their lodgings. "So far as the Scandinavian Sailors' Home, Garford Street, and "the large common lodging house in the High Street (St. James "Chambers), and likewise the Mission to Seamen in the West Ferry "Road, near the entrance to the Millwall Docks, where sailors are "taken in to sleep, are concerned, a suggestion might be made to the "owners for daily medical examination of the inmates. The "Scandinavian Sailors' Home has a regular medical attendant.† "With respect to the notices received from port Sanitary Authorities "six passengers were notified to this district from the Port of London "Sanitary Authority. Three passengers were in good health and "going about their usual duties. One passenger notified did not "belong to the Poplar District but to Whitechapel, and information "was immediately forwarded to that authority. The address given of "another passenger was not known in London. The sixth passenger "gave an address but he could not be accommodated, and then, it "was stated, he went to some place in Bethnal Green, address un"known. The Port Medical Officer of London had these facts "communicated to him, and a suggestion was made that where "passengers were proceeding to lodgings, and were not certain of ‡ See foot notes page 64. 63 "being boarded, an address should be given where they are likely "to apply when such an eventuality as above stated, is likely to occur. "The Medical Officer for the Port of London wrote in answer to "the suggestion: 'I would point out, however, that the address given "to the Authority is supposed to be the address to which the man is "going, and I have no means of checking this afterwards.' "The penalty for wilfully giving a false address to a Port Sanitary "Authority is £100, but it cannot be considered as wilfully done, "when a passenger gives an address to the best of his belief. "In regard to the three passengers who were going about their "duties, two of them a few days after their arrival went to sea again, "and here a very serious danger to the world at large, which may "happen again and again, is apparent, insomuch as a sailor coming "to this country may have the germs of disease in his system and "within the ten days of incubation start on a voyage. In the course "of one's inquiries it was stated that sailors from Spain and Portugal "take cargoes to such places as Antwerp, and are there paid off, and "then make for this country in order to obtain another ship. "Quarantine would appear to be a great safeguard. "The question of quarantine for all vessels coming from infected "ports from which the British Isles can be reached in less than ten "days (five to ten days being the period of incubation of plague) was "mentioned to the Local Government Board Inspector, but it seems "that at present the Central Authority does not deem quarantine to "be advisable." * "Plague is an acute infectious fever caused by the bacillus pestis of Kitasato and Yersin, and it is the only known disease of the class which attacks epidemically and simultaneously man and certain of the lower animals. It differs from some other infectious maladies in not being a water-borne disease, but the results of investigation point to the probability of its being rat-borne, at any rate as one of the vehicles for its spread. The factors for the dissemination and prevalence of the disease are the presence of the bacillus, susceptible material for it to work upon, and a suitable environment," 64 "Fleas.—Simond has made ingenious experiments to show that plague is transmitted from rat to man by means of fleas. A healthy rat has very few fleas on him doubtless because, being careful of his toilette, he gets rid of them as cats and dogs do." "A sick rat becomes absolutely covered by these insects, doubtless because the illness makes him careless and neglectful of himself. The insects which attack the sick animals charge themselves with microbes and afterwards kindly transfer these to us." Bubonic Plague, etc., by Dr. Jose Verdes Montenegro, translated by W. Munro, M.D. Edin. "The importance of the dissemination of plague by rats is only gradually being appreciated. It is a well-attested fact, and has in numerous localities been the precursor of an extensive outbreak. The rat plague is also slow in its progress, and it must not be imagined that it is just previously to the rats dying in their hundreds and thousands that plague is imported into the locality ; the origin has to be sought at a much earlier period, when mortality occurs only among one or more rats in groups. It is a well-known fact among the ancient Hindoos that when rats begin to die in a house it was time for the inmates to leave their abode. Rats when they sicken with plague leave their holes and come out into the open. They look ill and are in a dazed condition, their eyes are watery and bleary, their coats are partially deprived of hair, and they hobble about with difficulty and stagger and fall. They make very little attempt to escape when approached, and their behaviour is so extraordinarily different from what is usual that the illness from which they are suffering may be at once suspected. The glands of plagueinfected rats are enlarged, and these, together with the internal organs and blood, contain plague bacilli. It is not safe to handle rats which are either suffering, or have recently died, from plague."Plague viewed from several aspects by W. J. Simpson, M.D., Aberd., F.R.C.P., Professor of Hygiene, King's College, London. ‡ At the suggestion of Mr. Randall, Chairman of the Sanitary Committee printed post cards for giving information respecting fresh arrivals were also left at the premises. † The Committee directed a letter to be sent by the Clerk to the Authorities of the premises in question to this effect.

The nature of articles, extent of adulteration, and results of policecourt proceedings were as follows: Milk Adulterated with 10 per cent. of water. Vendor fined 20s. Coffee Adulterated with 60 per cent. of chicory. Vendor fined 20s. Margarine Proceedings taken under Margarine Act. Vendor fined 40s. and 23s. cost. Milk Adulterated with 19 per cent. of water. Vendor fined £12 and £1 3s. Under the Public Health (London) Act 1891, police-court legal proceedings had been taken against the owners of the undermentioned premises for disobeying the Board's notices with the following results:— Tibbats Road, 13 and 15. Defective drains. Magistrate's orders to execute the works in fourteen days with 7s. in the first case and £2 13s. 3d. in the second case. 8, Quickett Street. Improperly repairing drain. 69 In pursuance of the Board's order of authorization dated the 25th May, I applied for a summons against the builder of the above premises, under the 42nd section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for improperly repairing a drain; evidence having been given by the Medical Officer and myself as to the improper work, the presiding magistrate, Mr. Cluer, fined the Defendant £5 and £2 2s. costs. On the 9th of March, I visited in company with the Medical Officer of Health, the premises in the Devons Road, occupied by a butcher, and there seized a carcase of a diseased cow, as being unfit for the food of man. It was taken before Mr. Dickinson, the presiding magistrate, at the Thames Police-court, who made an order for its condemnation, and granted a summons against the owner returnable on the 7th April. On that date the summons was heard against the owner, and after a protracted hearing the magistrate said it was a very bad case, and fined the Defendant £30 and £7 7s. costs. The markets and stalls have been regularly inspected throughout the year with a view of detecting diseased and unwholesome food, and only in two instances has there been occasion to interfere, one was in the above case, the other case the owner destroyed it in my presence. I have also made periodical inspections throughout the year of the cow and slaughter-houses. The licensed slaughter-houses number 4; the licensed cow-houses number 3.

Legal Proceedings appertaining to following Cases, See Annual Report for 1898. Follett Street, No. 44. I was summoned to appear at the Thames Police Court to show reason why the Magistrate's "closing orders " under date 22nd December, 1897, should not be cancelled. On your visiting the premises you found that the works necessary to render the same fit for human habitation had been executed to your satisfaction. I therefore, by your direction, in response to owners' 75 application informed the Magistrate there was no objection to the cancellation of the three orders—Nos. 44, 46, Follett Street, No. 3, St. Leonard's Cottages had been altered into one premises. Albert Street, 9. I appeared at the Court in response to summons taken out by owner for cancellation of "closing order" made 20th November, 1897. The premises having been put in habitable repair to your satisfaction no objection was made, order was cancelled. Special Proceedings. Ettrick Street, No. 72. Legal proceedings taken under the 12th Section Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for the abatement of urgent nuisances, to save delay, summons made returnable (forthwith) same day. "Abatement order" to execute the work in 14 days and £1 6s. costs allowed. Forty-seven samples of food have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis: 4 samples of butter were so adulterated that legal proceedings were taken. The nature of articles, extent of adulteration, result of prosecution being as follows:— Butter Adulterated with 98 per cent. of foreign fat. Vendor fined full penalty, £20 and 27s. costs. Butter Adulterated with 83.3 per cent. of foreign fat. Vendor fined full penalty, £20 and 23s. costs. Summonses under the Margarine Act.—For serving same in unlabelled wrapper. By suggestion of Magistrate, withdrawn. For neglecting to label parcel from which sample had been taken. By suggestion of Magistrate withdrawn. Margarine Adulterated with 68 per cent. of foreign fat, proceedings taken under Margarine Act for having served same in unlabelled wrapper. Vendor fined £3 and 23s. costs. 76 Butter Adulterated with 79.6 foreign fat. Vendor fined £4 and £1 costs. The market places and stalls were regularly inspected throughout the year. I have on several occasions, on the Vendors' application, examined the articles of food purchased by them at the markets and when found unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for food, had the same destroyed as trade refuse, and gave the necessary certificates to that effect, but in no instance was anything exposed for sate at the time of my visit in such a condition as to justify a seizure, excepting that in one instance it was proved in evidence that a quantity of unwholesome tinned condensed milk was so deposited as to be intended for the food of man. In accordance with your instructions I visited a tradesman's premises at Chrisp Street, and there found a case containing 71 blown tins of condensed milk which were seized by me, brought to you, and by your approval taken to Court. The Defendant's assistants admitted that the tins were deposited for the contents being used for making "caramel toffee." On the same being proved to be unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for the food of man, a penalty of £20 was inflicted and £10 10s. costs allowed the Board. Five notices of intention to apply for renewal of slaughter-house and cow-house licenses were received from my district. The premises were again forthwith inspected, and where necessary various works were executed on the service of written "intimations" and notices. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Assoc. San. Inst., Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Bromley, South Division 77 31st December, 1899. To the Medical Officer of Health, Poplar and Bromley.

On the 29th July, whilst inspecting the shops and stalls in Chrisp Street, my attention was drawn to a basket half full of rotten cherries which were exposed for sale at 2d. per pound on a stall, they were seized and taken before the presiding Magistrate, who said he had no hesitation in condemning them and granted two summonses, one for exposing for sale, and the other for selling to the prejudice of the purchaser. The summonses were heard on the 8th August, when the vendor was fined £4 on one summons and 1/- on the other. I have made periodical inspections throughout the year of the cowhouses and slaughterhouses in the district and in each case found them in a sanitary condition, with good water supply, &c. The licensed slaughterhouses number 5 „ „ cowhouses „ 3 In every case where new pans and traps had been found to be fixed without giving notice in writing to the Clerk of the Board (Infringement of London County Council Bye-laws), letters were sent to the respective owners to open up the ground under the pan and trap. This in each case was done, and any defects found to exist were remedied, and the work passed after applying the smoke or chemical test. Cases of overcrowding at the under-mentioned premises were 84 abated without having to institute legal proceedings-2, Latham Street, 31, Giraud Street, 78, Park Street, 1 Dingle Lane, 6, Ellesmere Street, 2, Kerbey Street, 5, Union Street, 8, Hale Street, 27 Ellerthorpe Street, 19, Arcadia Street, 10, Sophia Street, 19, Wade's Place, 17 and 1, Woolmore Street, 68, Bath Street, 36, Vesey Street, 96, Sussex Street, 60, Dock Cottages. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Poplar, North Division. To the Medical Officer of Health Poplar and Bromley, 31st December, 1899. Sir,— I beg leave to submit to you my tenth Annual Report of the Sanitary Work executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1899.

In addition to the above, 950 complaints of nuisances and 235 notifications of infectious diseases were received and dealt with, making a total of 1556 primary inspections; while 4314 re-inspections were made during the year. Of that total, 568 premises were found to be in fair condition and 63.4 per cent, required various works of Sanitary Improvement. 249 drains were proved defective by the smoke or chemical tests, and in 913 instances the applications of these tests revealed no defects. During the year the drains of the under-mentioned premises were reconstructed on the old lines as follows :— Stebondale Street, 4 to 12, 21 to 35, 134 136, 73 to 79 Manchester Road (323 and blacksmith's shop at rear of) 290, 292, 294, 296, 298, 300, 116, 118, 120 122, 124, 316, 320 to 336 (stable premises at rear of 326), 76, 402.

Manchester Road, 138, 140, 142, 144 (line of drain altered; insufficient fall for interceptor). West Ferry Road, 175, 177. Where practicable a severe water test has been applied to all new drain work. In 18 instances plans were submitted in accordance with the Board's regulations. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Police Court proceedings have been taken, in pursuance of the Board's orders of 87 authorisation, against the owners of the undermentioned premises, for disregarding statutory notices, with the results indicated:— Abatement Orders. Manchester Road, 389, 14 days Abatement Order ; 30s. costs. Marshfield Street, 39, 7 days Abatement Order; 27s. costs. Samuda Street, 16, 21 days Abatement Order; 27s. costs.

Closing Orders. Samuda Street, 20, premises closed as unfit for human habitation; £3s. costs. Manchester Road, 183, premises closed as unfit for human habitation ; £5s. costs. Manchester Road, 326. A summons was issued in this case for neglecting to repair the defective drain. Prior to the day of hearing, the owner's solicitors claimed that the drain in question was a sewer repairable by the Board, as a stable at rear which was not shown on the plan in the Board's possession was connected with the same drain system. The ground was opened and this was found to be the case, the summons 88 was consequently withdrawn, both parties paying their own costs, and the necessary work was executed by the Board. Disobeying Magistrates' Orders. On the 31st of May the owner of the premises 39, Marshfield Street, was summoned for disobeying a Magistrate's order, made on the 5th of the same month. Owing to the fact that different persons collected the rent and that the alleged owner refused to admit ownership, many hours waiting on several occasions became necessary in order to see the rent paid and the rent book signed. This was eventually done, and the collector's name and address taken. At the court the collector pleaded that he was not the owner, but on proof that he had received the last weeks rent, the Magistrate held him responsible within the meaning of the statute, and he was fined 20s. and 23s. costs. In spite of the above conviction the nuisance remained unabated, and I had to further watch the premises until the rent was again received and the rent book signed by the owner. A summons was therefore issued for his attendance at the court on the 21st June, at the hearing of which the defendant applied for a week's adjournment in order to obtain the services of a solicitor. At the adjourned hearing the Magistrate imposed a penalty of £6 ios. and 44s. costs, or in default 21 days imprisonment. On Wednesday, the 21st June, the occupier of 20 Samuda Street was summoned at the court for continuing to occupy the said premises, knowing they had been closed by Magistrate's order on the nth of the previous month. The Magistrate imposed a fine of £2 and 23s. costs, and informed the defendant that by occupying the premises he had become liable to 40s. per day from the date of the order, which would have amounted to about £70 89 Inspector summoned to rescind Closing OrdEr. I was summoned to attend the Thames Police Court on the 12th August, to show cause why the owner of the premises 183, Manchester Road, should not be released from the Magistrates order dated the 31st May, closing the house as unfit for human habitation. Before attending the court it was found that several necessary works were outstanding and nuisances unabated, I therefore attended the court and opposed the application, in consequence of which the matter was adjourned for a week by the Magistrate in order that the defects which were indicated might be remedied. At the date of the adjourned hearing this had been done, and the premises had been in your opinion rendered fit for human habitation. I attended at the court and the order was rescinded unopposed. Defective Drain Work. In October last it came to my knowledge that certain drain repairs had been executed at the premises 331, West Ferry Road, and the ground filled in without any notice to the Board, or opportunity being afforded for inspection. By your direction, and with the Sanitary Committee's authority, the premises were entered, the ground was opened and the drain was exposed. It was then found that the work had been so badly executed as to be a nuisance and dangerous to health ; proceedings were therefore authorised by the Board to be taken against the person liable. I at once interviewed the owner, who stated he had not visited the premises for a month and had not seen the repairs in question. A builder at Forest Gate who employed the workmen who did the work, denied having given •the man any instruction to repair the drain. He stated, however, that the rent collector might have done so. I next interviewed the rent collector who stated that he had 90 instructed the man to clear the drain; but he had neither ordered nor even seen the repairs in question. This was reported, and proceedings were taken against the workman who actually did the work. At the police court he was fined ios. and 2s. costs, and received a strong reprimand from the Magistrate, who said that had he not been a poor man the fine would have been much heavier. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT. 49 samples of food and drugs have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst; of that number 6 were certified to be so much adulterated that it was necessary to take proceedings against the respective vendors. The extent of adulteration, and the results of the prosecutions were as follows:— Milk Deficient in cream to the extent of 33 per cent. Vendor fined £10 and £1 3s. costs. Butter Adulterated with 86 per cent. of foreign fat. Vendor fined £3 and £1 3s. costs. Milk Adulterated with 22 per cent, of water. Vendor fined £3 and ,£1 3s. costs. Milk Adulterated with 11 per cent, of water. Vendor fined £2 and 2s. costs. Milk Adulterated with 16 per cent of water. Vendor find and 12s. 6d. costs. Butter Adulterated with 85.5 percent, of foreign fat. Vendor fined £3 and 3s. costs. Four notices of intention to apply for renewal of slaughterhouse and cowhouse licenses were received from my district, 91 The premises were forthwith inspected and various works executed on the service of the Board's notice. The shops, food stores, and stalls have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting diseased and unwholsome food but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Assoc. San. Inst. Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs Acts.

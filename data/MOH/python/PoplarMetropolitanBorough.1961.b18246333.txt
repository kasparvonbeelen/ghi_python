Telephone No. ADVance 4414 TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OP THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough during the year 1961 The population in Poplar reached a peak of 169,000 in 1926, over the years it dropped slowly to 131,200 in 1939. The war had a very marked effect. Owing to the evacuation of persons and the demolition of nearly one third of the houses during the war, it fell to 51,260 in 1942. Since then there was an increase to 74,940 in 1948. Then intense activity in connection with slum clearance and re-development, which entailed the clearance of large areas, the planning of new open spaces, and the re-zoning of areas previously used for residential purposes for industrial use, caused the population again to drop to 63,340 in 1960. The character of the area has been changed and improved; as a result of the re-development a more stable population has developed and this is recorded in an increase of 2,510 on the figures for last year, the population now standing at 65,850. Whilst this is undoubtedly due in some part to re-development, probably one half of the increase is related to overseas immigrants, notably from Pakistan and the West Indies, most of whom are distributed in small numbers fairly evenly throughout the area. The total of infectious diseases recorded in the borough for the year was 1,607 of which number 1,333 were measles. Of the remaining 274, 67 cases were cases of pneumonia, which represents a 50% increase on the figure for 1960, and 60 cases of scarlet fever, representing a 100% increase on 1960, Whooping cough, which soared in 1960, has once more dropped to normal. During the year there was an interesting outbreak of typhoid fever of seven cases which was familiar in distribution and origin, it being discovered that a grandmother aged 70 had suffered from typhoid at the age of 14 and although she had had several children and there were a number of grandchildren with whom she mixed frequently and intimately, there was no previous history of her having infected anyone else until this present outbreak when the connection was proved bacteriologically. She is still a carrier. There have been no outbreaks of dysentery or food poisoning. 6 In January 1960, in co-operation with St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the City of London Corporation set up the City of London Cancer Diagnostic Centre for female City workers over the age of 35. The scheme has now been extended to cover Poplar. The service is being brought to the notice of firms With reasonably large female staffs. Cancer of the lung appears to be static but because of the quite definite association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, and the long exposure factor, every endeavour should be made to dissuade smoking among children and young people. Parents have a grave responsibility in this matter not to encourage smoking and they should set an example. It is obvious from the profligate spending on tobacco that in the absence of some selfdiscipline - prosperity can be socially harmful - not only in this respect, but also in others. Coronary Heart Disease during the year has increased by 25% This would appear to be another adverse effect of prosperity. In view of the apparent connection between Coronary Heart Disease and overweight subjects in sedentary occupations, healthy living would appear to require further self-discipline in eating and exercise habits. The degree of pollution of river water over the year shows a continued slight improvement. Fewer complaints concerning its smell and black appearance have been noted. This is, no doubt, due to improvement in the quality of sewage effluent discharged into the river and also a smaller quantity of sulphates being added to the river from the gas washing effluent from Battersea and Bankside Power Stations. I am pleased to report that a further seven Smoke Control Otders of approximately 180 acres were made by the Council and confirmed by the Minister, to become operative from 1st September next year, A further Order covering 200 acres in the S.E. Section of the Isle of Dogs has been forwarded to the Minister for confirmation. The trespass of caravans on unlicensed and unsuitable sites still takes up a considerable amount of time in the department. There have been fewer trespassers this year, probably due to the vigorous action taken by the department, and the increasing penalties imposed by the Courts. I would like to express my thanks to Members of the Council and, in particular, to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee, for their help and encouragement. My thanks are also due to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for their assistance and co-operation at all times, and to my own staff for their loyal and ready support. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. C. TURNER Medical Officer of Health 7 SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 644 and the home population estimated by the Registrar General to number 65,850 at the middle of the year shows an increase of 2,510 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was 20.62 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 17.79 for 1960 To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar General, Factors are supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 19.58 as compared with 17.4 for England and Wales. The death rate in 1961 was 10.85 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 10.48 for 1960. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 12.26 as compared with 12.0 for England and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 11.53 and 11.5 respectively. The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 27.98 as compared with 26.6 for the previous year. The figures for England and Wales are 21.4 and 21.7 respectively. The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from neoplasm of the lung show no appreciable change, though Coronary disease shows a marked increase.

Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The water supply to the Borough has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity during 1961. The water supply to the area is a mixture of River Thames-derived and River Lee-derived filtered water in varying and unpredictable proportions. The water from these two sources is stored in the Board's reservoirs and filtered and chlorinated on the Board's works before being pumped into supply. Samples are collected at each stage of the purification process, as the water is pumped into supply, and in the distribution system. A summary of the results of the chemical and bacteriological analyses of the water passing into supply from these two sources for the year 1961 is set out on page 14. The waters are not plumbo-solvent. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination revealed by inspection or analysis. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine and the water in them is checked as to its quality afterwards, before the structures are restored to service. All inhabited houses are supplied with a piped water supply direct to them and no houses are permanently supplied by standpipe. There have been no new sources of supply nor new important extensions of trunk mains in this area during the period under consideration, and there were no changes in the general scheme of supply. New mains were laid to the extent of 1,193 yards. Acknowledgements are due to Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, who supplied these facts and figures. 12 Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, in 529 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough, some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used" for drinking purposes, but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. See overleaf for analysis of water supplies. SANITARY INSPECTION OF THE AREA. The District Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows, on page 15. 13 14 AVERAGE RESULTS OF THE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLIED TO THE BOROUGH OF POPLAR DURING 1961 MILLIGRAMMES PER LITRE (unless otherwise stated) Description of the sample No. of samples Ammonia Nitrogen Albuminoid Nitrogen Oxidised Nitrogen Chlorides as Cl.

Sewage disposal in London is the responsibility of the London County Council and it can be regarded that, generally, these functions are discharged satisfactorily. In view, however, of the heavily polluted, and at times anaerobic condition of the water in the middle reaches of the Thames there is still room for improvement in the quality of all effluents discharged to the river. As far as the London County Council is concerned conditions will be much improved when the new sewage treatment plants at both the northern and southern outfall works are in full operation. Many of the houses in the Borough were built over 100 years ago and generally the sewerage system has been expanded in conjunction with the housing development. Prom time to time sewers have been repaired and, where necessary, rebuilt and new access points provided. The sewers are maintained and cleansed regularly and as a result of improvements which have been effected no part of the Borough is now subject to regular flooding. The whole system is treated with poison bait every two months as a Rodent Control measure. This has resulted in a very low level of rat infestation. Prom time to time there are complaints of smells from sewers and it would appear that the ventilation in some of the smaller branch sewers leaves something to be desired. As a result of extensive re-development in the area some sewers have become redundant. These have been stopped off or grubbed up, Part of the London County Council main northern outfall sewer passes through the Borough. There are, in addition, L.C.C. pumping stations and the London County Council main and intercepting sewers into which branch sewers owned by this Council are connected. OFFENSIVE TRADES. One dresser of Furskins is established in the Borough. 21 COMMON LODGING HOUSES. There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 244 males, in the Borough. 11 day inspections and 1 night inspection were made during the year. SEAMEN'S LODGING HOUSES. There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 3. Each year, when considering applications for renewal of licences for Common Lodging Houses and Seamen's Lodging Houses detailed inspections are made of the premises by: (a) Public Health Department (b) Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department. This includes fire precautions. (c) London Electricity Board. and a licence is issued subject to the requirements and recommendations of these Departments being met. PERSONAL CLEANSING. As in recent years the arrangement was continued with Stepney Borough Council whereby persons requiring personal cleansing were treated where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. The number of persons cleansed during 1960 was as follows : Verminous Scabies TOTAL Adults 30 14 44 Children – 2 2 TOTAL 30 16 46 DISINFECTION AND DISINFESTATION. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given overleaf: 22 (a) Disinfection:— Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 72 1,241 Tuberculosis 41 467 Scabies 6 75 Miscellaneous 675 4,025 Disinfection for manufacturing firms – 3,033 TOTALS 794 8,841 In addition 531 tons of waste paper, and 52¼ tons of Sterilised Rags were disinfected.

The work of Rodent Control is carried out by skilled and experienced operatives with supervision by the Council's Officers and all repression work is carried out by methods approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood. Great care is taken to ensure that baits are protected from domestic animals and non-responsible persons. The work of the section is divided into three main categories:— (a) Sewer Maintenance Treatment (b) Business premises (c) Dwelling houses - complaints from occupiers. Sewer Maintenance. The majority of rodent infestations are by sewer (brown) rats and, concurrently with the treatment of premises, there has been a regular series 23 of routine treatments in sewers in an attempt to eradicate the nuisance at source. In recent years, the level of rodent infestation in the sewers appeared to be static, but at a level which still gave rise to fairly frequent infestations. Rats start to breed soon after reaching maturity, at about 2 months, and may have 10 or more young in a litter. This fact suggested that, in order to be effective, any scheme of control should attempt eradication before they have time to breed. An experiment was, therefore, devised in Poplar to poison sewers every 2 months instead of 3 prebaits and 3 poison treatments. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood were advised of these proposals. The experiment started on the 8th May, 1961, with a complete prebait of the whole sewer system using a sausage rusk. After assessment of the "takes" it was decided to follow with 5 poison treatments bi-monthly, each lasting four days, using the same bait to which Sodium Fluoracetamide (1081) would be added. In May, 1962, a complete prebait, lasting 8 days, will be made at the end of the series, and from the results of this it will be possible to assess the results of the experiment. Business premises. The Council's Scheme for the inspection of premises and treatment, where necessary, of infestation on commercial and industrial sites on a contributory basis has again continued to function satisfactorily. The assessment of charges is made on the estimated cost of labour, materials for visits and treatments during the year, the actual contribution depending upon the size and nature of the premises, the materials stored and handled and the degree of current infestation. The income derived from this scheme amounted to £4,207. 14. 11 d Dwelling houses. Where rat infestation of dwelling houses has been discovered it has usually been found to be due to defects in the drain or sewer and suitable repairs have been effected the number of complaints received during the year totalled 412. This service is carried out by the Council's staff and no charges are made to occupiers of dwelling houses. 24  TYPE OP PROPERTY Local Authority Dwelling Houses including Council houses All other (including Business Premises) TOTAL Number of properties in Borough 39 17. 064 3, 687 20,790 Number of properties inspected as a result of:— (a) Notification 22 412 1,624 2,058 (b) Survey under the Act 4 14 16 34 (c) Otherwise — — — — Total inspections carried out, including re-inspections 110 1,845 8,772 10,727 Number of properties inspected which were found to be infested by:— (a) Rats Major — 12 26 38 Minor 13 122 244 379 (b) Mice Major 2 68 59 129 Minor 7 178 594 779 No. of Infested properties treated 22 380 923 1,325 Total treatments carried out 106 1,751 1,898 3,755 Number of Block control schemes carried out — — 191 191 25 26 FACTORIES ACT, 1961 (TABLES IV, V & VI) TABLE IV INSPECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH PREMISES Number on Register NUMBER OF Inspections Written Notices Occupiers prosecuted 1.

The work of this section has progressed steadily and the appointment of a Clean Air Clerk has enabled an efficient administrative system to be set up and maintained. Smoke Control Orders No. 7 - 13. These seven Smoke Control Orders, covering approximately 180 acres principally in the Bromley district, were confirmed by the Minister on the 29th September, 1961, and come into effect on the 1st September, 1962. Smoke Control Order No. 14. This Order, covering 200 acres in the south east section of the Isle of Dogs was made by the Council on the 27th November, 1961, and was forwarded to the Minister for confirmation. Future programme of Smoke Control Orders. The first thirteen Orders made by the Council were small in area, and were principally concerned either with cleared sites or sites on which redevelopment was in progress or imminent, as it was felt that tenants of new Council property should be accustomed to the use of smokeless fuel from the commencement of their tenancies. Now that the redevelopment sites within the Borough have been made the subject of Smoke Control Orders, it is possible to make more extensive areas the subject of Smoke Control Orders, and it is anticipated that if the present rate of progress is maintained, the last Order will be made in 1964, and will come into operation in 1965. Smoke Abatement. During the year, a number of smoke nuisances were reported to the Clean Air Section and many more were detected as a result of routine observations in the Borough. A total of 92 visits and 75 revisits were made in connection with smoke nuisances. Several complaints were made concerning smoke nuisances from railway locomotives, and these were referred to British Railways for attention. 13 plans and specifications of proposed boiler installations were submitted for approval, ranging from 51,000 B. T. U's per hour to 1,300,000 B. T. U's per hour. Height of Chimneys. Although there is no specific legislation covering the height of chimneys 29 industrial boiler operators in the Borough have been most co-operative in ensuring that new chimneys have been of an adequate height, and in all cases the recommendations of the Clean Air Inspector have been adopted. Atmospheric Pollution. The two smoke/sulphur dioxide recording stations previously set up at the Town Hall and Poplar Technical Institute have remained in operation and much useful information has been obtained. A telesmoke and reflectometer were purchased during the year, and their use has enabled much more accurate smoke observations and measurements of atmospheric pollution to be obtained. Trainee Public Health Inspectors. Two trainee Public Health Inspectors have been seconded to the section each week to assist the Clean Air Inspector. In January, all four trainee Public Health Inspectors attended a course run by the Coal Utilisation Council on which they were instructed in the correct method of fixing and adjusting approved solid smokeless fuel appliances. Exhibitions. During the year, two visits were made to the Borough by the mobile display of the Solid Smokeless Fuels Federation, each visit lasting five days. The exhibition displayed a representative selection of approved appliances and fuels. 30 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 ANNUAL STATISTICS 1st JANUARY to 31st DECEMBER, 1961 REASON FOR VISIT CODE NO.

A list of persons who sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List is maintained under the provisions of the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. The number of persons on the list at the end of 1961 was 68. RAG FLOCK AND OTHER FILLING MATERIALS ACT, 1951. This Act requires the registration of premises upon which a business is carried on involving the use of filling materials. The number of premises registered is 10. The Act also requires the licensing of premises for the storage of rag flock. PET ANIMALS ACT, 1951. Licences have been issued in respect of 2 premises within the Borough HAIRDRESSERS AND BARBERS. The total on the register at the end of the year was 57 persons and 50 premises. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 50. Burials carried out under the provisions of this Act totalled 3 adults and 2 stillborn children. The total cost was £60. 14s. Od. of which £39. 10s. 0d. was recovered. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE ACT, 1948, SECTION 47. NATIONAL ASSISTANCE (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951, SECTION 1. The number of cases on the register of Aged and Infirm persons in need of care and attention shows a substantial increase. However, I am pleased to say that despite the many cases referred to the department for help and assistance, on no occasion was it necessary to resort to use of powers for compulsory removal of any old person. It has been possible to assist many old folk with their problems and difficulties both physical and mental and thanks to the valuable co-operation of the L.C.C. Home Help Service, the 34 W.V.S., District nurses, local Medical Practitioners, National Assistance Board and Local Voluntary Organisations, assistance was given with the minimum of delay. Details of inspections are as shown below:— Cases on the Register at 31st December, 1960. 390 New cases added to the Register 357 Number of removals from Register (a) Deaths 68 (b) Transfers 35 (c) Other cases 8 Total number on Register at 31st December, 1961. 636 Visits to new cases 470 Miscellaneous visits and enquiries 1,474 Visits to old cases 784 HOME BATHING. Because of urgent requests for such a service the Council launched a pilot scheme for home bathing in October, this is normally restricted to those who are house bound and cannot avail themselves of facilities otherwise available. This scheme has proved to be highly successful. INCONTINENT LAUNDRY. Since the installation of special equipment at the Disinfecting Station this service has expanded, It is now possible to provide in certain cases a daily service. MORTUARY AND CORONER' S COURT. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court. It is fitted with modem refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-mortem room. In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the pathologists and clerks. The total number of bodies received during 1961 was 743. (Residents 284 non-residents 459). Post-mortem examinations were made in 610 cases and inquests were held in 132 cases. There was 1 case for deposit only. 35 PUBLIC CLEANSING. The arrangements for collection, removal and disposal of refuse are under control of the Borough Engineer, who has supplied the following information:— Refuse: During the year 22,053 tons 11 cwts. 2 qrs. of house, trade, street, gully, market and kitchen refuse were collected and disposed of at the controlled tip. In addition 14,124 tons 15 cwts. 1 qr. of refuse from other boroughs were also dealt with at the Council's Refuse Disposal Depot. This is an increase of nearly 2000 tons on the previous year due to improved disposal facilities at the wharf. Street Cleansing: Two Mechanical/Sweeper/Collectors supplemented the work of the manual Road Sweepers, and as warranted by weather conditions a watering machine was used for washing and watering roads and street markets. Gully Cleansing: Gully/Emptying machines have carried out 6,291 gully cleansings and weekly emptyings of three cesspools. SWIMMING BATHS AND WASH-HOUSES. The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent:— Poplar Baths Vapour, Foam and Slipper baths, Swimming Pools Island Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry Aberfeldy Street Launderette PUBLIC SWIMMING POOLS. There are two pools, both situated at the main establishment. East India Dock Road, E, 14., and I am indebted to the Chief Baths Superintendent for the information contained in the report which follows:—[ Large Pool Small Pool Length 100 ft. 64 ft. Width 39' 6" 25 ft. Maximum depth 8' 6" 6' 6" Minimum depth 3' 6" 3 ft. Capacity 150,000 galls. 50,000 galls. 36 The water to the pools is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a mixture from the Rivers Lea and Thames. Continuous filtration and chlorination of the water is carried out during the whole period the pools are in use; the period of complete turnover of both pools being 3,5 hours The pH value of the water is maintained between 7.6 and 7.8 while the chlorine content is maintained at 1.0 to 1.2 parts per million. As soon as the last bather leaves the pool at the end of the day and for the week-end closure of the establishment, the chlorine content is increased to 1.5 (or even more) parts per million to ensure sterile water when the pool is re-opened. Wallace and Tiernam Chlorinators supply the chlorine to the water and the filtration equipment used is made by United Filters. Sulphate of Alumina is used in required quantities in the filtering of the water and soda ash, or similar, is used to assist in maintaining the necessary pH. value of the water. Hourly tests are made of both pools to see that the correct pH. and chlorine values are present. Periodical bacteriological examination of the water is carried out by visiting pathologists from the London County Council Public Health Department Pathological Services, The water is maintained in such sterile condition that it is not neccessary to empty the pools. However, as the large pool is closed during the winter season, and has to be drained down, the contents of the small pool are used to thoroughly wash out the filters servicing this pool, and then, 50,000 gallons of water from the large pool is filtered through both sets of filters into the small pool. This, in effect, means that both pools are emptied down each year. While the pools are empty opportunity is taken to thoroughly scour all sections of the pool steps that are under water, and all glazed tiling is cleaned down with an abrasive powder. 37 SECTION C HOUSING Details of new housing accommodation completed in Borough during 1961 are as follows Poplar Borough Council 18 dwellings London County Council 657 dwellings The numberof families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 31st December, 1961, was as follows Type of dwelling No. of Lettings Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,058 Post-war Council houses and flats 1,624 Temporary bungalows 354 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 87 Acquired properties 157 Other properties 7 TOTAL PROPERTIES 3,287 38 RENT ACT, 1957.

Of these 535 were submitted to the Public Analyst for Chemical examination, the remaining 244 being sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service for biochemical or bacteriological report. Samples examined by the Public Analyst included a comprehensive variety of food. One sample was acquired formally and 534 informally. A total of 14 samples (2.6 per cent) were found to be adulterated. Details of the unsatisfactory samples and the action taken are shown in Table VIII on page 44. The rate of adulteration in the Borough for the past five years was as follows NUMBER OF SAMPLES PERCENTAGE ADULTERATION 1961 535 2.6 1960 550 4.2 1959 538 2.6 1958 543 2.2 1957 550 2.0 Average: 543 2.7 MILK SAMPLING 12 informal samples of Milk were examined and found to be satisfactory. No milk adulteration has been found in the Borough for the past seven years. Seven samples of milk were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical analysis and all were satisfactory. Average solids were Pat 3.5, and nonfatty solids 8.6. Five samples of Channel Islands milk showed fat figures of an average of 4.3 and non-fatty solids 9.6. Three evaporated milk samples were examined and these complied with the regulations. UNSOUND FOOD The Cbuncil's Food Inspector is called upon to pass judgement of fitness on great quantities of food. Frequently large and valuable stocks are involved. Among special lots of food examined during the year were the following:— Detailed overleaf:— 45 Unsound Food (contd.)

DISPOSAL OP UNSOUND FOOD. The bulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned and destroyed by the Borough Engineer's refuse disposal service as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned, arrangements may be made under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch, or manure making. ICE CREAM. The sale of "soft" ice cream, frozen upon extrusion to 19°F. as against 12°F. for the hardened brick or carton has arisen at a tremendous rate within the last year or so and all major manufacturers are competing in this market. Our own local manufacturer has a franchise to produce soft ice cream mix with distribution rights in an area roughly comprising the Midlands and Southern England. 47 The mix is made up in the usual way — pasteurised, homogenised and cooled exactly as for hard ice cream although the fat content, for technical reasons, is lower - 7% as against an average 12%. At the factory, the mix is filled automatically into one gallon plastic bags and cardboard cartons and loaded into a refrigerated van kept at approximately 30°F. at which temperature it is delivered to a depot or direct to the retailer. The Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations 1947 requires that a mix shall be kept at a temperature of 45°F. until freezing in the machine installed in the shop or van and it is here that difficulties occur. Firms, operating their own retail vans, employ cleaners to cleanse and sterilize the machines on arrival at the depot at the end of the day but shopkeepers, snack bar owners or independent itinerant vendors often have no idea at all of sterilization or its importance. Samples taken at the factory during 1961 gave results as follows Grade 1-44 Grade 2-28 Grade 3 - 4 Grade 4 - 6 or 88% grades 1 and 2 and 12% grades 3 and 4 which is satisfactory when viewed against Ministry recommendation of at least 80% in grades 1 and 2. FOODS FOR EXPORT. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 14 inspections were made of foods exported from the district: 14 certificates of purity were issued. FOOD POISONING — (See Infectious Diseases).

This increase was mainly due to the number of cases of measles notified. DIPHTHERIA. There were no confirmed cases of diphtheria in the Borough during the year. However, 3 suspect cases were brought to the attention of the Department. Two proved to be suffering from tonsillitis and the third from aseptic meningitis. It was ascertained in 1961 that over 70% of the under 16 population of London had been protected against this disease yet this fact does not give any grounds for complacency - the immunisation level is still too low. The target should be 100% or as near as possible to that figure. DYSENTERY. The number of cases notified and confirmed during the year was the same as the previous year (23). The majority of cases were isolated and not connected. In every case where dysentery is suspected swabs are taken from patients and their families, and an exhaustive investigation to trace cause and possible source of infection. Close co-operation is maintained with General Practitioners in all these matters. FOOD POISONING. Notifications for this disease amounted to 30 in comparison with the last year's total of 61. There were no outbreaks and most cases were isolated and not connected in any way. MEASLES. The early part of the year was marked by an outbreak of measles, which continued until June and then declined rapidly. Totals for the past three years are as follows 1961 1,333 1960 247 1959 1, 166 POLIOMYELITIS. Two cases of poliomyelitis occurred in 1961. Both were paralytic. 50 TYPHOID. A small outbreak of typhoid (7 cases) was quickly contained and localised. All persons at risk were kept under surveillance and constant supervision. The cases came to light following the investigation of a contact of a case of paratyphoid (which diagnosis was subsequently revised as typhoid). Laboratory tests of swabs taken were positive for typhoid and it was found that one of the contacts investigated was a carrier of this disease although she had no symptoms, TUBERCULOSIS.

The service is also utilised by the general practitioners in the Borough. HOSPITALS There are three hospitals in the Borough - St. Andrew's, St. Clement's and Poplar Hospital. These hospitals, together with the Poplar Chest Clinic, Wellington Way, E. 3, which continued to operate during the year, are under the control of the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. Bow Group Hospital Management Committee. AMBULANCE FACILITIES The provision of ambulance transport within the administrative County of London is the responsibility of the London County Council and is available, free of charge, in the following circumstances (a) Accidents (wherever occurring) and sudden illness (in the streets, public places or places of employment) Dial '999' and ask for 'Ambulance' or follow instructions given on telephone instrument. (b) Very urgent illness at home For the conveyance of sick persons from their homes to hospital, provided a doctor certifies that the case is one of life or death and that arrangements have been made with a hospital for the patient's admission. Telephone WATerloo 6000 NEW Cross 2645 RELiance 3622 CENtral 6301 REGent 4000 54 (c) Maternity cases Normally, if the expectant mother has booked a bed at a hospital or nursing home, she is in possession of a white card (Form L.A.S. 23) confirming the booking arrangements and giving full instructions for summoning the ambulance. Where no previous arrangements have been made, however, the London Ambulance Service cannot accept direct applications for removal to hospital except in the case of emergencies occurring in the street or other public place, when the procedure as in (a) above should be made by a doctor or midwife to the Emergency Bed service. Telephone HOP 7181 (d) Other illness For the removal to and from hospitals, etc., of sick persons provided the ambulance is ordered by the hospital authority, by the Emergency Bed Service, or, in certain circumstances by a private doctor, application should be made in writing or by telephoning.

B. cases 19 Aged and chronic sick cases 1,011 Other 43 57 HOME HEALTH SERVICES. In connection with the welfare of old people a Woman Welfare Officer is employed whose main function it is to visit old people in their homes to assess their needs and through liaison with the appropriate statutory and voluntary bodies, including, if need be, removal to institution or hospital, with a regular follow up to see that everything necessary is done. It is hoped that this service will be increased. It is backed by the necessary clerical staff and records, a domiciliary laundry service to handle soiled linen of incontinent persons and the cleansing facilities of the Disinfecting Department. MENTAL HEALTH. Progression in the provision of Mental Health Services; There is in the Borough a large hospital being developed as a psychiatric unit. In view of the changed attitude towards mental ill health many patients who have been long term inmates of mental hospitals are, as a result of new treatment and techniques, now discharged home. Unfortunately, not all of them are able to live integrated with a family unit, many are elderly and live alone. In conjunction with the Psychiatric Staff, where appropriate, these persons are included under the supervision of the Woman Welfare Officer. As part of the hospital service a Day Hospital and Evening Hospital have been established, and there is a reciprocal arrangement for the supervision of patients referred to, or discharged from the hospital, which is fulfilling a valuable need in that many of the patients do not require the supervision of a fully trained psychiatric social worker. The provision of appropriate services by liaison into the voluntary and statutory bodies through a unified channel, has much to commend it. HEALTH EDUCATION. Members of the Public Health Staff give lectures and film shows to local groups in order to stimulate interest in hygiene and matters of public health interest. Advertising material published by the Central Council for Health Education is freely distributed and displayed at Council Depots and elsewhere as occasion arises. Its magazine "Better Health" has a free circulation amongst youth groups and old people's clubs where it is likely to be an influence and where it is clear that it is producing beneficial results. The Council co-operate with the London County Council in all their Health Education activities. In addition members of the Public Health Inspectorial staff frequently give lectures to groups within factories, particularly in relation to the hygienic handling of food in canteens and the proper maintenance of satisfactory standards in kitchens. Periodically communications are addressed to individual sections of the food trade, drawing attention to the regulations and particular facets of hygiene, and, in general, all 58 members of the public health department staff give advice where appropriate to everyone with whom they come into contact, of the benefits of healthy living and how much individuals can do for themselves to achieve this very desirable end. LEGISLATION. The undermentioned new legislation affecting the Public Health Department was made during the year:— Housing Act, 1961. Factories Act, 1961. Licensing Act, 1961. L. C. C.

By JOHN NORTON, M.D., D.P.H., Medical Officer of Health, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England; Fellow of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health; Fellow of the Royal Institute of Public Health. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the City of Westminster. My Lord Duke, My Lords and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you my Annual Report on the health, sanitary condition, and vital statistics of the Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John for the year 1900. METEOROLOGICAL SUMMARY. (Royal Observatory.) First Quarter. The mean reading of the barometer was 29.661 inches; the mean temperature of the air 39°2. The amount of rain measured during the quarter was 6.78 inches, and the amount of bright sunshine recorded was 172.8 hours. The weather during the first two months of the quarter was generally wet and dull, the temperature being above the average, excepting from 12th to 14th January, and from 27th January to 15th February. The coldest period was from 7th to 13th February, when the deficiency of temperature 4 averaged 98.3. The weather in March was cold, fine, and dry, the temperature being below the average, excepting from 10th to 15th of the month. In the first quarter of 1899, January had been the warmest and March the coldest month; last, quarter January was again the warmest month, but February was slightly colder than March. Second Quarter. The mean reading of the barometer was 29 793 inches; the mean temperature of the air 52°.8. The amount of rain measured during the quarter was 5.11 inches and the amount of bright sunshine recorded was 507.7 hours. Speaking generally, the weather was fine with little rain during April and May, but dull and wet during June. The mean temperature of the air was generally above its average from 10th to 24th April, from 30th April to 8th May, and from 9th to 19th June, but below its average during the other parts of the quarter. Third Quarter. The mean reading of the barometer was 29.861 inches; the mean temperature of the air, 61°.8; the amount of rain measured during the quarter was 4.58 inches, and the amount of bright sunshine recorded was 635.7 hours. The weather was for the most part fine, bright, and warm in July and in September, but dull and wet in August. The mean daily temperature of the air was generally below its average from 1st to 8th July, but above it during the remainder of the month, with a remarkably hot period extending from 10th to 27th; the temperature fell below the average from 1st to 11th August, rose above it from 12th to 21st, and again fell below it from 22nd August until 6th September, after which it was above the average until the end of the quarter, except during a short period from 11th to 13th September Fourth Quarter. The mean reading of the barometer was 29-712 inches; the mean temperature of the air, 47°.6; the amount of rain measured during the quarter was 5.85 inches, and the amount of bright sunshine recorded was 189 3 hours. The weather during the quarter was generally mild and dull, with frequent rain from the latter part of October to the end 5 of December. The mean temperature was above its average on about three-fourths of the days in the quarter, the excess ranging from 9°.4 to 13°.l on eight days in the month of December.

Births and Deaths (St. Margaret and St. John) foe the Year 1900. Births. The number of births registered during the year, when all corrections have been made, was 1,056, showing a birth-rate of 18'9 per 1,000 of the population. Of these 280 births occurred in St. Margaret's Parish, and 776 in St. John's. Deaths. The number of deaths of parishioners when duly corrected amounted to 1,097, showing a death-rate of 19.7 per 1,000. Of these deaths 373 occurred in St. Margaret's Parish and 724 in St. John's. The death-rate for the whole parish when corrected for age and sex distribution was 22.2. TABLE I.—ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, "WESTMINSTER. For Whole District.

Note.—For the purpose of obtaining an estimate of the population of the whole district and the separate parishes at the middle of each year, the populations enumerated in April, 1891, and April, 1896, have been taken as a basis for the whole table, and after correcting the 1891 enumeration by one.fourth of the average annual difference I have each year added 86 to St. Margaret's population, and deducted 520 from St. John, and 434 from the whole district, and I believe that other variations will render this method fairly accurate. 6 TABLE II.—ST.

Section 2 (1) of the Vaccination Act, 1898, provides that no parent or other person having the custody of a child shall be liable to a penalty under the Vaccination Act, 1867, if, within four months of the birth of the child, he satisfies two Justices, or a Stipendiary or Metropolitan Police Magistrate, that he conscientiously believes that vaccination would be prejudicial to the health of the child, and within seven days thereafter 12 delivers to the Vaccination Officer for the district a certificate by such Justices or Magistrate of such conscientious objection. The Section came into operation on the passing of the Act, i.e., the 12th August, 1898, but in its application to a child born before the passing of the Act there was substituted for the period of four months from the birth of the child the period of four months from the passing of the Act. A Parliamentary Return (No. 89, H. C., Session 1899) showed that between the date of the passing of the Act and the 31st December, 1898, the number of certificates of conscientious objection received by the Vaccination Officers was 203,413, and that the number of children to whom such certificates related was 230,147. The increases in the numbers of vaccinations for the halfyears of 1899 as compared with the corresponding half-years of 1898, were 77,713 and 91,322 respectively, a total increase for the year of 169,035, or 33 8 per cent. The number of births registered in England and Wales during 1898 was 923,265, and during 1899 was 928,640. The ratios per cent. of successful primary vaccinations to births registered were 54.2 in 1898 and 72.1 in 1899, an increase in ratio of 33 per cent, in 1899 as compared with 1898. Remarks on Infectious Diseases. It is again necessary to note the incidence of infectious cases occurring in Government Buildings, chiefly in Barracks or Married Soldiers' Quarters, in which, this year as last, the special incidence of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria call for notice; but whilst last year's number of cases represented 15 per cent, of those occurring in Wards I. and II. St. Margaret's, the percentage during 1900 has risen to 23. In one house in York-street five cases of Scarlet Fever and in another three cases of Diphtheria occurred, and in each instance it was reasonable to assume that the cases were the result of direct infection from the initial cases prior to their notification. During the year attention has been called to the danger of disseminating contagion through the medium of dust impurities in public conveyances and places of public resort. Professor Hamilton has recorded the results of a research on the bacteriological impurities of dust in railway carriages. By inoculation experiments, he ascertained that 16.6 per cent. of his samples of dust, that is, two samples out of 12, contained 13 tubercle bacilli. In each case the compartment from which the tuberculous dust was obtained was from first-class smoking compartments. Infectious disease has occurred in three instances at premises in which milk is sold. The sale of milk was prohibited in each case until after the necessary fumigation and disinfection had been carried out and a certificate to that effect had been given. Smallpox.—No case of Smallpox was notified in this district during the year 1900, but on 11th of June last, I made a special report to the Westminster Vestry re Smallpox in London during the months of April and May, 1900, which is of sufficient importance to relate here. The report was as follows:— Gentlemen, In consequence of certain statements which have been reported in the local press, I deem it desirable to submit the following special report on an outbreak of Smallpox that occurred in London during the months of April and May last and its possible connection with an inmate of this parish, who died at "M." Terrace, Westminster, on 9th May. Investigations which I caused to be made revealed the following facts, viz.:—No case of Smallpox was notified in London between 17th of March and the 10th April. The case notified on the 17 th March was the last of a series of directly connected cases occurring in January, February and March of this year. The steamship "Caledonia" from Bombay, at which port Smallpox has been for some time and is still prevalent, put two persons —one a passenger—ashore at Marseilles, suffering from Smallpox. The ship arrived in London on 29th March last and a large number of passengers and others disembarked. In Marylebone, on April 10th, a clerk who was employed on the ship referred to, was certified as suffering from Smallpox, and three other persons who had been in contact with the patient were likewise certified as suffering from the same disease on the 23rd, 24th and 25th of April respectively. 14 In St. Pancras, on April 14th, a Steward from the sameship was certified as having Smallpox, and on the 19th hedied. Three other persons who had been in contact with him or his effects were likewise certified on 27th April and6th and 20th May respectively. In this district a valet living at the address first mentioned in this report became ill on 30th April, and died on 9th May. Before and after death he was examined by six medical men and neither of them was of the opinion that the man had died of smallpox,, and his death was certified as being due to malignant measles and exhaustion. The wife of this man was just before death removed to the lunatic observation ward of St. George's Infirmary and discharged from there, as safe on 16th May, to the house of her son-in-law in Kensington) Parish. In Chelsea, where she had taken apartments, she herself was certified on May 19th as suffering from smallpox. In St. George's, Hanover Square, the ward attendant who attended the woman just mentioned was on May 23rd similarly certified. In Kensington, on 30th May, two persons at the house to which the valet's wife was discharged on 16th May were also certified to be suffering from Smallpox. A perusal of this report shows that no known case of Smallpox has occurred in this parish, and the most careful investigations do not reveal a trace of direct evidence of the contact of the valet with any of the persons who have been suffering from this disease or with any other sick person. A statement as to his contact with a person suffering from Measles at a house in "Victoria-street, and a suggestion that a near relative of the valet was employed at a hospital near the various premises in St. Pancras and St Marylebone, at which Smallpox occurred (and this might be a possible source of the valet's disease) were carefully followed up, but with entirely negative results. I may state that every possible precaution was taken after the valet's death to have the body, rooms, bedding, &c., thoroughly disinfected. 15 On June 19th I made a further report to the Vestry, which. was as follows:— With reference to my special report dated 11th inst., on the incidence of Smallpox, which appears on to-day's agenda, I deem it desirable to submit the following additional facts which have come to my knowledge:— On May 11th last a housekeeper (who lived above the flat where the valet died) was removed to St. Mary's Hospital. She had been under the care of a doctor for some weeks and had kept her bed for a whole month, but no symptoms of any infectious disease were observed. On May 28th, seventeen days after her admission to the hospital, an eruption appeared and she was removed to an isolation ward, where she died on 4th June. From 15th to the 18th June, five cases of Smallpox occurred amongst persons in attendance on the housekeeper when she was in the isolation ward. The coincidence of the housekeeper's residence in Westminster must be read in conjunction with the facts— (а) That 19 days elapsed since the death of the valet referred to in the previous report, seventeen days of which period had been spent in a hospital ward. (b) That for the ten days prior the housekeeper had' kept her bed in Westminster. (c) That on June 6th three cases of Smallpox were removed from the Infirmary of St. George's-in-the East, the primary case having been admitted to the Infirmary on May 17th as a case of Measles,, from a house in that parish, where a child had "sores on his body." It is therefore necessary to note that unfortunately cases of Smallpox are now occurring in London, the origin of which apparently remains untraced. Scarlet Fever.—One hundred and twenty-three cases were notified compared with 201 in 1899, and only one death occurred compared with five the previous year. Of the 123 cases notified 118 were removed to an isolation hospital. It will therefore be seen that we have been particularly free from Scarlet Fever compared with previous years. I consider that the large number of cases removed to hospital very creditable, to the officers of the Sanitary Authority. 16 Diphtheria.—One hundred and four cases were notified during the year, compared with 99 cases in 1899, and eight deaths occurred from this disease compared with eleven last year. Eighty-nine cases were removed to hospital. Christ Church Schools were closed on two occasions at my request— once in January for five days, and for a few days 8 weeks later, on account of two cases of diphtheria occurring in the Schoolmaster's family residing on the premises. The first case was removed to an isolation hospital, and this patient had not returned from the hospital whsn the second case occurred. The schools were thoroughly cleansed and fumigated, and no further cases were reported. Return Cases.—Five cases of disease were notified as Diphtheria and were removed to an isolation hospital as such, but they were afterwards certified by the hospital authorities not to be cases of Diphtheria or any other notifiable disease. In October last a case of Diphtheria was notified in Tachbrook-street. On enquiry it was found that two other children of a different family, and residing in another part of the house were suffering from bad throats. On a medical man being called in the children were found to be suffering from Diphtheria. Three other cases were subsequently notified in the children of the family in which the. first case occurred. Complete disinfection and fumigation were carried out. No defects were found to exist in the sanitary arrangements of the house in which they lived. Whooping Cough. - Thirteen deaths occurred from this disease compared with five in 1899. Enteric Fever.—Thirty-one cases were notified, compared with 14 in 1899, and eleven deaths occurred, compared with nine the previous year. 25 cases were removed to hospital. Erysipelas.—Fifty-five cases were notified against fifty-three the previous year. Four deaths occurred from this disease, ' one of which was an infant under one year of age. Three deaths occurred in 1899. Diarrhœa.- Diarrhœa was responsible for twenty-five deaths compared with 30 the previous year. Eighteen of the deaths occurred in young children under one year of age, and chiefly during the months of June, July and August. 17 Puerperal Fever.—Two deaths occurred from this disease. Four cases were notified during the year against none last year. Two of the cases were removed to hospital. Influenza.—Nineteen deaths occurred from this disease compared with twenty-two last year. Influenza was very prevalent at the beginning of the year. As is well known, this is a disease of a most infectious character, and we know absolutely no more how to guard against it and little more with regard to its treatment than when it made its first appearance, in what was called the Bussian form, ten years ago. The curious thing about Influenza is its prevalence in usually healthy districts ; and it is emphatically not a disease of the slums. In London, in 1890, 650 persons died of this disease; but in each of the two subsequent years, the deaths ascribed to it reached over 2,000. Measles.—Twenty-one deaths occurred from this disease compared with seventeen in 1899. In consequence of an epidemic of Measles at the Infants' Department, James-street Board Schools, there being only 83 children in attendance out of 178 on the roll, I thought it desirable to have that department closed for sixteen days. This was done with good results. The premises were thoroughly cleansed and disinfected on March 28th. The investigations then made revealed the following facts:— On 5th and 6th March, two children, scholars at this school, from the same address, developed measles; on the 15th instant one other case, a scholar, was noted ; on 19th twenty-two scholars were excluded, twenty-one actually suffering from measles. In all, 45 children were excluded from the infants' department in consequence of measles, 42 being patients, the remaining three being unaffected by the disease. Further, seventeen of the later cases occurred in fifteen houses, several of which were located at distances of at least half-a-mile from each other, the children apparently having no intercourse other than at school. In the boys' department, one case of the disease was known to have affected a scholar personally, and ten were excluded in consequence of cases at their homes. 18 In the girls' department thirteen scholars were excluded in consequence of cases at their respective homes, but no scholar was known to be personally suffering. Other schools disinfected after the occurrence of several cases of measles were the Horseferry-road Board Schools.

It is with pleasure that I note the early action of the Public Health Committee of the Council in this matter in ordering samples of milk to be taken for bacteriological examination. The samples have been taken and submitted to the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine, and I eagerly await the result of the examination in the hope that grounds may be obtained to press home my conviction of the need of legislation in respect of this important matter. In connection with this question I should like to say that it formed the subject of careful consideration by the late Vestry, and, to aid them in their deliberations, I reported fully on the matter. The report pointed out that there appeared to be no power under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Acts to deal with milk containing disease germs of any kind, and that the extraordinary precautions necessary to be observed in the collection of the samples for bacteriological examination would tend to further complicate the procedure under the very technical provisions of the Acts. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 71 gives power to Sanitary Authorities to deal with " any dangerous infectious disease attributable to milk," but the power, whilst being extensive, could not apply to any form of tuberculosis. Section 47 provides that any article, solid or liquid, intended for food and which is unsound may be seized by a Medical Officer of Health or a Sanitary Inspector, and that, therefore, if it were known that milk was contaminated by tubercle bacilli it might be possible for the milk to be seized, but the practical difficulties in obtaining a knowledge that the milk was so affected in time to seize the bulk were so great, and also the fact that the person to whom the milk belonged had a good defence in saying, and probably truly, that he was not aware of the presence of the disease germs, there would be little hope of obtaining a conviction. The report also went on to say that Section 15 of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order provides that if at any time disease exists among the cattle in a dairy, &c., the milk from a diseased cow therein (a) shall not be mixed with other milk; (b) shall not be sold or used for human food. Tuberculosis, however, is not included in the Contagious Diseases Animals Act, under which this Order is made, and that even if it was the London County Council were the authority responsible for the execution of the Order. In the concluding paragraphs of my report I referred to the report of the Royal Commission on the subject, and also to the 21 report by the late Dr. Thorne-Thorne, in which the dangers arising to man from the source in question were pointed out, and I ventured the suggestion that to obtain the end the late Vestry had in view they direct their attention to obtaining, if possible, an alteration in the law. Following upon this the late Vestry communicated with the Local Government Board, pointing out the grave danger to which children are exposed by the consumption of milk contaminated with tubercle bacilli, and the need for legislation dealing with the sale of such milk. The other local authorities were communicated with on the subject, with the result that fourteen of them wrote to the Local Government Board, concurring in the views of the Vestry. It was also probably the means of causing the Hackney Vestry to take 100 samples of milk for bacteriological examination, the result of which being such as to influence the Public Health Committee of the late Westminster Vestry, in the absence of legislative power to deal with the subject, to cause a circular to be issued to every ratepayer in the district, advising that all milk should be boiled and the careful cleansing of all vessels in which milk had been stored. The Contamination of Milk in Transit. The "Justice of the Peace" for December contains the following article on the above subject, which I consider to be one of the utmost importance, and to be of general interest from a public health point of view:— "The Royal Agricultural Society was asked some six months ago by one of its members as to the possibility of milk, during its transit by railway, becoming infected with the germs of tuberculosis. A reply has now been made in the following terms:—(1) It is obvious that milk (even absolutely pure milk, and milk which has been effectually sterilised) is quite capable of being contaminated with tubercle bacilli or other infective organisms, unless means are adopted to keep it from contact with infective matter, which may be conveyed to it at any time by the atmosphere and in other ways. The society is fully alive to the dangers to the public health which may arise from the prevalent habit of expectoration by possibly consumptive persons on railway platforms, highways, and other public places, and has cooperated with other public bodies in endeavouring to arouse public attention to this matter. The possibility must not, however, be excluded that sufficient care is not 22 always taken on the farms where milk is produced to secure the most scrupulous cleanliness in the vessels containing the milk, and in the returned empty milk churns, as well as in all the surroundings of the milk on the farm, and of the cows themselves. (2) The Committee are advised that the holes in the cone in the centre of the lid of a milk churn are essential to allow the escape of steam, vapour, or gases of any kind which may be disengaged from the milk during transit; but, in the opinion of the Society's scientific advisers, these holes are scarcely worth consideration as a means of the possible contamination of the milk through the agency of the air. (3) A more likely source of contamination is to be found in the too common practice of sending milk by railway in churns with loose lids. Milk which may be splashed out round the lids during a journey, or whilst the churns are being moved about railway platforms, may wash away the dust and other impurities which accumulate on the surface of the lid, and may carry them back into the bulk of the milk in the churn ; and in this way it is quite possible that tubercle bacilli might gain access to the milk in the churn through the medium of the dried expectorations of consumptive persons in railway stations, streets, or other public places. (4) This danger, however, may be guarded against by sending milk by railway in locked or sealed churns, the lids of which are tight. There appears to be still considerable misapprehension amongst farmers as to the willingness of railway companies to accept for transit over their lines milk churns thus locked or sealed, although it is a regular practice by farmers serving some of the leading milk-distributing companies in the metropolis. The railway companies have undoubtedly favoured the system of sending churns with loose lids, on the ground that examination of the contents by the railway officials was thus facilitated ; but the Dairy Committee of this Society, having had their attention drawn to the matter, passed on January 31st, 1899, a resolution 'That the present custom of sending milk in unsealed churns is unsatisfactory, inasmuch as it exposes the farmer to the risk of having his milk tampered with during transit.' Communications were opened with the railway companies, and an assurance was received that at a meeting held at the Railway Clearing-house on May 10th, 1899, all the companies had agreed that they would not refuse to accept milk churns ' sealed,' provided the conditions under which the companies accept such cans were adhered to. These conditions are thus defined 23 in a letter addressed on October 12th, 1899, by the* Railway Companies'Association to the assistant secretary of the Railway Department of the Board of Trade:— ' Senders have for a long time been allowed to send milk in sealed cans ; the companies accept the declaration of the senders as to the quantity conveyed, no extra charge being made. The only condition the companies require to be fulfilled is that the tare weight of the can shall be stamped upon the outside of the can, so that in case of doubt the quantity of milk within the churn can be approximately ascertained by allowing l0¼1b. for each gallon of milk declared. It does not appear to the companies that there is any difficulty in the senders protecting themselves against alleged loss of milk in transit by sealing, padlocking, or otherwise fastening their cans.' " Sanitaky Legislation of 1900. The following list includes the principal Acts of the year 1900, which either wholly or in part relate to local government and sanitary administration :— Housing of the Working Classes Act. Census (Great Britain) Act. Census (Ireland) Act. County Councils (Elections) Amendment Act. District Councillors and Guardians (Term of Office) Act. Members of Local Authorities Relief Act. Ancient Monuments Protection Act. Military Lands Act. Elementary Education Act. Housing of the Wokking Classes Act. Amendment of Part III. [63 & 64 Vict., Ch. 59.] This Act is one to amend Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, that is, the Part which deals with the provision of working-class lodging-houses. Previously to the passing of this new Act a local authority in the exercise of their powers under Part III. of the Act of 1890 were not, as it was considered, enabled to provide lodging-houses for the working-classes outside their district. This difficulty has been removed by Section 1 of the present measure, which provides that where any council, other than a rural district council, have adopted Part III. they may, for supplying the needs of their district, establish or acquire lodging-houses for the working classes under that Part outside their district, 24 Dairies, Slaughterhouses and Offensive Businesses. Transfer of Powers. Since November 9th the following powers hitherto exercised by the London County Council have been exercised by the Metropolitan Borough Councils— (1) Power under Section 28 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of registering dairymen. (2) Power of enforcing the by-laws and regulations for the time being in force with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughterhouses, knackers' yards and offensive businesses. The Vestry offered no objection to the renewal of the licenses of the following Cow-houses and Slaughter-houses by the London County Council during the past year. Cow-houses.

The following notice was sent to each medical practitioner in the district in accordance with the Vestry's instructions:— By an Order of the Local Government Board, dated 19 th September, 1900, the disease known as Plague becomes a notifiable disease within the meaning of section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and it is therefore the duty of every legally qualified medical practitioner to notify to the Medical Officer of Health for the district, any case of Plague coming to his immediate knowledge. I am now directed by this Vestry to request that should any case of this disease occur in your practice in this district, you will [kindly forthwith notify the same to me. During the year one passenger arriving from Glasgow was notified me by the Medical Officer of the Port of London—she was found to be ill in bed at a hotel in Westminster—but there were no symptoms of Plague and she soon recovered her usual health. Verminous Persons Act. During the year one person availed himself of the provisions of the above Act. This is the first application in this district under this Act since it came into operation. Black Smoke. Strict observation has been kept upon various premises within the district with the view of ascertaining where smoke nuisances existed. Proceedings were taken against the New Vauxhall Bridge Works Company, with the result that they were fined five pounds and costs. The Queen Anne's Mansions Hotel Company were also summoned, but the magistrate was of opinion that the wording of the Act was somewhat obscure and he decided in favour of the Vestry with regard to the 29 issue of the notices. Eventually the further hearing of the summons was adjourned sine die. Against the Westminster Electric Light Company, Millbank street, four summonses were issued, with the result that the Company were fined £40 and four guineas costs. A large fan has now been erected in connection with the chimney-shaft in order to create an increased draught, and this has been the means of reducing the nuisance to a minimum. / Numerous intimations have been served, during the year to the owners of various factories in the district with good results. Unsound food. The following articles of food were condemned and destroyed as being unfit for human consumption:— 105 stones of beef. 4 baskets of cherries. 100 oysters. 10 bushels of peas. 2 cases of haddocks. 1 box of plaice. 1 barrel of cod-fish. 9 bags of greens. 1 box of skate 1 box of mixed fish. 3 barrels of pine-apples Water Supply to Newly-ebected Houses. Under Section 48 of the Public Health London Act, 347 certificates have been granted to the owners of newly-erected dwellings. Several certificates have also been refused, and the premises are still unlet. Houses Let in Lodgings. Over one thousand houses are now on the register. In several cases it has been found necessary to require the provision of additional w.c. accommodation. :;o Summonses were issued in two eases in which the landlords failed to carry out the bye-laws with respect to the cleansing of the walls and ceilings, and in each case the magistrate imposed a fine of five pounds and costs. Workshops anb Factories. Under the operation of the London Government Act the workshops of Messrs. Woolland and Messrs. Harvey, Nichols (who employ several hundred hands) have been transferred to the Borough of Chelsea. Since the re-building of these premises, which extended over a period of several months, the workshops and their sanitary conveniences have been very satisfactory. In several other large workshops in the district it has only been found necessary to call attention to minor matters, and these were duly remedied. Bakehouses. The bakehouses have all been periodically inspected, and the necessary lime-whiting and cleansing have been carried out. Housing of the Working Classes Act. The only house closed during the year under this Act, as being unfit for human habitation, was No. 1, Carey-place, owned by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. The premises were subsequently demolished. A reference from the Vestry on 25th July last was considered: — That in view of the enlarged powers given to Local Authorities in the Metropolis in reference to the Housing of the Working Classes by the London Government Act, it be referred to the Public Health Committee to make a thorough investigation of the whole question, and to report 1. Whether there are any areas in the parish which can be dealt with under Part II. of the Housing of the Working-Classes Act, 1890; and 2. Upon the practicability of adopting Part III. of the Act in the near future, in order to secure the 31 erection of working-class dwellings at reasonable rents; and that the surveyor and the medical officer of health proceed meanwhile with reports, for the use of the Committee, upon any area or buildings within the parish to which the attention of the Vestry or their successors may be called in this connection. The following joint report by medical officer of health and the surveyor was presented to the Public Health Committee on September 13th, 1900 13th September, 1900. Gentlemen, In accordance with the resolution of the Vestry on the 21st July last, we have visited various areas in the parishes, and find that those most likely to come within the meaning of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, and the Local Government Act, 1899, would be Williamsplace in Tufton-street, York-buildings in Grubb-street, and Blue Anchor-court in Great Peter-street; each is a cul-ile-sac, and is without means of through ventilation. Williams-place comprises an area of about 4,140 square feet, has 6 houses with 12 tenements, housing about 40 people. Nos. 1 to 9, York-buildings, Grubb-strest, which is within the area proposed to be taken by the London County Council's Embankment Improvement Scheme, are two-roomed cottages, standing upon an area, including the forecourt, of about 3,772 square feet, and housing about 45 people. Nos. 2 to 6, Blue Anchor-court, standing upon an area, including the forecourt, of about 3,450 square feet, are four-roomed cottages, housing about 35 people. We should also like to draw the Committee's attention to a badly-designed block of buildings in Tufton-street, viz., "Lion Buildings," not with the idea that the Vestry could proceed against such under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, as there is through ventilation and the building is structurally good; but with a view of at some future time entering into negotiations with the owners for the purchase thereof, and erecting upon the site more suitable dwellings. 32 The building in question is a brick structure of 5 floors and a basement containing about 40 tenements of 1 and 2 rooms, principally the latter, let at 3/6 to 7/- respectively per week, and housing about 160 persons; there are 3 w.c.'s, 1 scullery, and dust-bin accommodation on each floor. After due consideration of the whole of the circumstances relating to these particular areas, we do not see our way to recommending the Vestry to deal with them under the Housing of the Working Classes Act. With regard to the small houses on both sides of Lewisham-street, we are of opinion also that it is not at presenta sufficiently insanitary area to be dealt with under theabove-named Act. Millbank Site. The following new blocks of dwellings are now in occupation,, viz.:— Accommodation for. Hogarth-buildings 306 persons- Leighton „ . 120 „ Millais ,, 120 Eomney ,, . 290 Turner ,, 430 ,, The blocks nearly completed are:— Eossetti-buildings 290 Euskin ,, 430 „ The blocks now in course of construction are:— Eeynolds-buildings 400 ,, Gainsborough „ 396 ,, Lawrence „ 296 „ Maclise „ 296 ,, Landseer ,, 230 „ Mulready „ 230 ,, Morland „ 300,, Wilkie „ 300 ,, 33 Customs and Inland Revenue Act.

LEGAL PEOCEEDINGS. Inspector Dee. Eight summonses for infringements of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were taken out during the year. In six cases the Vestry were successful in recovering £2 3s. 6d. in costs or fines, one case was withdrawn, the work having been completed prior to the hearing, and the other case after two hearings, at each of which the defendants were represented by Counsel, was adjourned sine die. 35 Two summons were also taken oat for obstruction caused by flower sellers at Knightsbridge, one against the husband who was fined 2s. and 2s. costs, whilst the summon against the wife was dismissed with 42s. costs against the Vestry.

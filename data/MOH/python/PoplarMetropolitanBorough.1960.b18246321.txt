Telephone No. ADV. 4414 TO TOE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF TOE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough during the year I960. I am pleased to report that in spite of a steady decline in the population from 73,260 (1951) to 63,340 (1960) the number of births has remained remarkably regular, between 1,114 and 1,307 (this year 1,127). The standard of health of the inhabitants compares favourably with previous years with minor exceptions. Although deaths in the Borough have been rather less than usual, deaths from lung cancer again showed an increase. Infant mortality shows a rather disturbing increase of nearly half as much again as last year. More than 80% of births in London take place in hospital, this in itself carries a risk to child life from cross-infection and other factors, and the number of coloured immigrants in the area is increasing, possibly with a low standard of child care among some of the groups. Whooping Cough has increased considerably on both the 1958 and 1959 figures. The position will be kept under review and studied carefully to ascertain the cause should the rising trends continue. Infectious disease notifications continue to decline and show the usual marked decrease anticipated every other year due to the fall in Measles notifications. -7- There was no appreciable change in the number of Dysentery cases, there being only two outbreaks, both of a minor character, one related to a nursery school and the other to a "Halfway" house for homeless families, involving six and seven cases respectively. The appointment of a Clean Air Inspector and two additional Trainee Public Health Inspectors has enabled six Smoke Control Orders, on the stocks for some time, to be completed and surveys of the areas involved in future Clean Air zones are making good progress. The caravan situation, in no way such a problem as last year, still absorbs considerable effort by officers of the department in an endeavour to deal with this situation. Although comparatively few in number, the remaining caravans have been very difficult to remove. None of them appear to be owned by members of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain, most of them are, in fact, trespassers on land cleared for local authority housing development. The sites are without any water supply, sanitary accommodation and remote from all such facilities None of the sites are licensed. I would like to express my thanks to Members of the Council and, in particular, to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and encouragement. My thanks are also due to the other Chief Officers and their staffs for their assistance and co-operation at all times and to my own staff for their loyal and ready support. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. C. TURNER, Medical Officer of Health. -8- SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 462 but through rehousing and other reasons some 660 residents moved from the Borough to other areas and the home population estimated by the Registrar General to number 63,340 at the middle of the year shows a decrease of 200 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was 17.79 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 17.78 for 1959. To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar General. Factors are supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 17.0 as compared with 17.1 for England and Wales. The death rate in 1960 was 10.48 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 11.7 for 1959. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 11.53 as compared with 11.5 for England and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 12.9 and 11.6 respectively. The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 births, was 26.6 as compared with 18.5 for the previous year. The figures for England and Wales are 21.7 and 22.0 respectively. -9- The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from neoplasms of the lung, once more show an increase on last year's figures. No significant change in deaths from other diseases was recorded.

The domestic water supply in the Borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board' s laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The water supply to the Borough has been satisfactory both in quality and quantity during I960. The water supply to the area is a mixture of River Thames-derived and River Lee-derived filtered water in varying and unpredictable proportions. The water from these two sources is stored in the Board' s reservoirs and filtered and chlorinated on the Board's works before being pumped into supply. Samples are collected at each stage of the purification process, as the water is pumped into supply, and in the distribution system. A summary of the results of the chemical and bacteriological analyses of the water passing into supply from these two sources for the year 1960 is set out on page 16. The waters are not plumbo-solvent. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination revealed by inspection or analysis. All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine and the water in them is checked as to its quality afterwards, before the structures are restored to service. -14- All inhabited houses are supplied with a piped water supply direct to them and no houses are pernanently supplied by standpipe.. There have been no new sources of supply nor new important extensions of trunk mains in this area during the period under consideration, and there were no changes in the general scheme of supply. New mains were laid to the extent of 796 yards. Acknowledgements are due to Dr. E. Windle Taylor, Director of Water Examination, Metropolitan Water Board, who supplied these facts and figures. In view of the increasing number of new flats in the Borough, all of which have more than one tap for the drawing off of water, including a bath, the total consumption per head may be expected to rise considerably in the future. Taking into consideration the volume of water used in the average bath and the cost of heating it to an acceptable temperature, the limited use to which many are put, and the space taken up by a bathroom, it might be a convenient period to urge an improvement in the planning layout of future homes to install showers instead of baths. A satisfactory shower can be had with only one-sixth of the water necessary for a bath; it is so much more convenient that the benefits can be enjoyed more frequently and the cost of water heating for this item is reduced pro rata. With the need of a lavatory basin inside the toilet or W. C. lobby, perhaps this latter compartment could contain the shower space and any bathroom space saved allocated to living room space or a study room. Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 in 639 cases. -15- There are 11 private wells in the Borough, some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes, but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. See overleaf for analysis of water supplies. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The District Public Health Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows, on page 17. -16- AVERAGE RESULTS OF THE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLIED TO THE BOROUGH OF POPLAR DURING I960 MILLIGRAMMES PER LITRE (unless otherwise stated) Description of the sample No. of sampl es Ammonia Nitrogen Albuminoid Nitrogen Oxidised Nitrogen Chlorides as CI.

The flow in the River was good but as there is no indication of any diminution of the "sulphate" content of the water it must be assumed that conditions for the growth of "sulphate reducing" organisms was less favourable owing to there being some residual oxygen in the water. This is, no doubt, in part due to the improved quality of the very large effluent from the London County Council Northern Outfall Sewer Works which has a marked influence on water circulating in Limehouse, Greenwich and Blackwall Reaches which surround the southern boundary of the Borough. Offensive Trades. One dresser of Furskins is established in the Borough. -23- Common Lodging Houses There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 244 males, in the Borough. 10 inspections were made during the year. Seamen's Lodging Houses. There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 5. Personal Cleansing. As in recent years the arrangement was continued with Stepney Borough Council whereby persons requiring personal cleansing were treated where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. The number of persons cleansed during 1960 was as follows:- Verminous Scabies Total Adults 18 15 33 Children 2 4 6 TOTAL 20 19 39 -24- Disinfection and Disinfestation. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below:- (a) Disinfection:- Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 102 790 Tuberculosis 38 362 Scabies 5 48 Miscellaneous 641 4,074 Disinfection for manufacturing firms - 31,742 TOTALS 786 37,016 In addition 585 tons of waste paper, and 23% tons of Sterilised Rags were disinfected (b) Disinfestation:- Inspections:- Number of visits 885 Premises requiring treatment 879 Furniture requiring treatment 410 Re-inspections after disinfestation 130 Miscellaneous visits and revisits 255 Disinfestation carried out:- Rooms (in 1,026 premises) 2,573 Beds, bedding, etc., articles 6,825 Furniture articles 6,562 -25- Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. The work of Rodent Control is carried out by skilled and experienced operatives with supervision by the Council's Officers and all repression work is carried out by methods approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Great care is taken to ensure that baits are protected from domestic animals and non responsible persons. The work of the section is divided into three main categories: - (a) Sewer Maintenance Treatment. (b) Business premises. (c) Dwelling houses - complaints from occupiers. Sewer Maintenance. Two treatments were carried out during the year in April and October to coincide with treatments in the neighbouring Authorities' areas. On both occasions Prepared Warfarin was used on the recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Analysis of results obtained indicate that the rat population of the sewers appeared to be static and that new methods and more frequent treatments will have to be adopted in the future in order to obtain a reduction in the numbers. Business Premises. The Council's Contributory Scheme of Rodent Control in business premises has again continued to function well. The income derived from this scheme this year was £3,986. 17s. Od. Charges made to individual contributors are calculated in units of £6 to £200. The charge for this service is based on the estimated number of visits, their length, the amount of labour involved and the materials used with an addition for overheads. -26- Dwelling Houses. Where rat infestation of dwelling houses has been discovered it has usually been found to be due to defects in the drain or sewer and suitable repairs have been effected. The number of complaints received during the year totalled 569 This service is carried out by the Council's Staff and no charges are made to occupiers of dwelling houses.

I am pleased to report that the appointment of a Clean Air Inspector and two additional Public Health Inspector Trainees, who. together with the two existing Public Health Inspector Trainees, devote half their time to Clean Air work, now enable this section to function as a proper unit. Snoke Control Area Nos. 1-6. On the 1st February, 1960, the Council made six Orders, covering some 42 acres and containing approximately 2,000 dwellings, at an estimated cost of £2,300. These have been submitted to the Minister for confirmation for operation in the autumn of 1961. These areas, although small in size, are based mainly on post-war London County Council redevelopment and constitute a useful implementation of smoke control in the Borough at small initial cost. Snoke Control Area Nos. 7-13. Seven smoke control areas, covering approximately 180 acres, containing 3,300 dwellings, at an estimated cost of £1,400 have been prepared and it is hoped to submit them to the Council early in 1961, with a view to their being confirmed by the Minister for operation in the autumn of 1961. These areas, like the previous ones, are based mainly on post-war London County Council and Poplar Borough Council housing redevelopment, but contain some industrial and commercial premises interspersed. (For location of areas, see map). The plan is to expand these areas until the central portion of the Borough is covered by Orders which are in preparation, then to deal with that portion of -31- the Borough contained within the loop of the River Thames and known as the "Isle of Dogs", the final phase being the north of the Borough, where the future life of the properties and development of the area is not yet quite clear. Smoke Abatement. During 1960, numerous smoke nuisances were brought to the attention of the Clean Air Section, either by complaint or vigilance of the staff in their normal duties. 118 initial visits and 174 revisits were made in respect of dark smoke nuisances and 11 initial visits and 12 revisits were made in respect of other smoke nuisances. A few were dealt with formally, the majority informally; in no case was it necessary to institute legal proceedings. Seven applications were made for prior approval, involving seven notifications of new furnaces. A few complaints of smoke from railway engines were received and, in co-operation with British Railways, the complaints were promptly investigated and the necessary action taken. Liaison was established with the Port Health Authority and it was decided that the Poplar Borough Council would deal with smoke nuisances outside the curtilage of the Port Health Authority and that the Port Health Authority would deal with smoke nuisances within their own curtilage, but that the two Authorities would co-operate over matters of mutual interest. Industrial Plant Survey. In December 1960, a survey was inaugurated to obtain details of the industrial fuel burning and steam raising plant in the Borough and the types and amounts of -32- fuel used. It is estimated that 650 factories and industrial premises will have to be circularised and it is hoped to collate the information from this survey early in the New Year when a Clerk is appointed to the Clean Air Section. The survey should indicate how far mechanical stokers have superseded hand-firing and the extent to which oil has replaced coal and will provide valuable data on premises and equipment in the borough likely to be affected by the seven year moratorium before the Clean Air Act comes fully into operation in 1963. Height of Chimneys. When dealing with cases of prior approval, difficulty has been experienced in some cases in obtaining adequate chimney heights. There is no specific legislation in the Clean Air Act applicable to London governing the height of chimneys and there are no provisions to alter the height of existing chimneys when additional furnaces are installed. This will remain a difficult problem until the matter is covered by legislation. Atmospheric Pollutioq. Two smoke/sulphur-dioxide recording stations have been set up in conjunction with the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, one at the Town Hall, known as Station Poplar No.6, and the other at the Poplar Technical College, known as Station Poplar No. 11. A centre in the Borough is used for testing re-agents used in "sulphur" recording. A smoke telescope has been obtained, and a smoke reflectometer has been -33- ordered to measure the concentration of smoke as recorded on the filter paper of the volumetric recording apparatus. At present, this information is obtained by the kind co-operation of the Hackney Borough Council. The lead-dioxide candle and deposit gauge previously in use has been continued as it is felt they will be of empirical value locally for comparison purposes when the first smoke control areas have been brought into operation. Details of the monthly results of recordings are as shown in Table VII. The work of the Clean Air Section has been most effective. Very good cooperation with industrial users has been achieved and a smoking factory chimney in Poplar is now a rarity apart from occasional plant-failure. -34- -35- TABLE VII ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RECORDING TABLE Constituents JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE WATER 31.45 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1.24 in. rain Tons per square mile 37.51 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1.48 in. rain Tons per square mile 38.16 mm. rain Grains per 100 sq. metres 1.50 in. rain Tons per square mile 10.08 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 0.40 in. rain Tons per square mile 51.65 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 2.04 in. rain Tons per square mile 30.47 mm. rain Grams per 100 sq. metres 1.20 in. rain Tons per square mile TOTAL WATER INSOLUBLE MATTER 499 12.72 1042 26.58 482 12.28 551 14.06 451 11.51 434 11.07 Soluble in CS2 5 0.13 8 0.20 11 0.27 5 0.13 4 0.10 3 0.07 Ash 399 10.17 967 24.67 390 9.93 478 12.18 320 8.15 357 9.09 Other Combustible matter. 95 2.42 67 1.71 82 2.08 68 1.75 128 3.25 75 1.91 TOTAL WATER - SOLUBLE MATTER 379 9.66 301 7.69 345 8.79 192 4.90 259 6.61 274 6.98 Ca++ 45 1.14 43 1.11 50 1.27 33 0.84 39 1.01 38 0.97 Cl' 55 1.41 49 1.24 39 1.01 28 0.70 20 0.50 24 0.60 SO"4 126 3.22 101 2.58 161 4.09 68 1.75 112 2.85 97 2.48 TOTAL SOLIDS 878 22.38 1343 34.27 827 21.07 743 18.96 710 18.12 708 18.05 Wt. of S03 collected estimated on mg/100 sq. cm. /day.

A list of persons who sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List is maintained under the provisions of the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. The number of persons on the list at the end of 1960 was 76. Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act requires the registration of premises upon which a business is carried on involving the use of filling materials. The number of premises registered is 10. The Act also requires the licensing of premises for the storage of rag flock. Pet Animals Act, 1951. Licences have been issued in respect of 3 premises within the Borough. Hairdressers and Barbers. The total on the register at the end of the year was 54 persons and 46 premises. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50. Burials carried out under the provisions of this Act totalled 3 adults and 2 stillborn children. The total cost was £37. 17s. 0d. of which £36 was recovered. -37- National Assistance Act 1948, Section 47. National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, Section 1. The number of cases on the register of Aged and Infirm persons in need of urgent care and attention continued to increase. Although many of these old people were found to be living in most unsatisfactory and, on occasions, deplorable conditions, at no time was it found necessary to use the power of "Compulsory Removal". Thanks are once again due to the valuable assistance and co-operation of the London County Council Home Help Service, W.V. S. District Nurses, Local Medical Practitioners and Hospital Authorities, National Assistance Board and local welfare organisations. Details of inspections are as shown below:- Cases on the Register at 31st December, 1959 226 New cases added to the Register 201 Number of removals from Register:- (a) Deaths 18 (b) Transfers 14 (c) Other cases 5 Total number on Register at 31st December, 1960 390 Visits to new cases 339 Visits to old cases 642 Miscellaneous visits and enquiries 300 Incontinent Laundry. There has continued to be a steady demand for this service which is greatly appreciated by old people and their relatives, who find it difficult to cope with incontinent laundry. Before this service is offered each case is visited by the Council's Welfare Officer who confirms whether conditions warrant inclusion in this scheme. Provision had been made in 1959 for the acquisition of laundry equipment and this was purchased and installed in the Council's Disinfecting Station at Yeo Street in April of this year. This has undoubtedly enabled the department to provide a much more efficient service. -38- Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner" s Court. It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-mortem room. In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the pathologists and clerks. The total number of bodies received during 1960 was 554. (Residents 193, non-residents 358.) Post-mortem examinations were made in 468 cases and inquests were held in 83 cases. There were 3 cases for deposit only. Public Cleansing. The arrangements for collection, removal and disposal of refuse are under the control of the Borough Engineer, who has supplied the following information:- Refuse. During the year 22,029 tons 16 cwts. of house, trade, street, gully, market and kitchen refuse were collected and disposed of at the controlled tip. In addition 12,934 tons 4 cwts. 1 qr. of refuse from other boroughs were also dealt with at the Council's Refuse Disposal Depot. Street Cleansing. Two Mechanical/Sweeper/Collectors supplemented the work of the manual Road Sweepers, and as warranted by weather conditions a watering machine was used for washing and watering roads and street markets. Gully Cleansing. Gully/Emptying machines have carried out 5,419 gully cleansings and the weekly emptyings of three cesspools. -39- Swimming Baths and Wash-houses. The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent:- Poplar Baths r, Foam and Slipper baths, Swimming Pools. Bow Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Island Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Wick Lane Baths Slipper Baths. Watts Grove Baths Slipper Baths. Sophia Street Baths Laundry only. Public Swimming Pools. There are two pools, both situated at the main establishment, East India Dock Road, E. 14, and I am indebted to the Chief Baths Superintendent for the information contained in the report which follows:- Large Poo1 Small Pool 1. Length. 100 Ft. 64 ft. 2. Width. 39' 6" 25 ft. 3. Maximum depth. 8' 6" 6' 6" 4 Minimum depth. 3' 6" 3 Ft. 5. Capacity. 150,000 galls. 50,000 galls. The water to the pools is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Board, and is a mixture from the Rivers Lea and Thames. Continuous filtration and chlorination of the water is carried out during the whole period the pools are in use, the period of complete turnover of both pools -40- being 3.5 hours. The PH value of the water is maintained between 7.6 and 7.8 while the chlorine content is maintained at 1.0 to 1.2 parts per million. As soon as the last bather leaves the pool at the end of the day, and for the week-end closure of the establishment, the chlorine content is increased to 1.5 (or even more) parts per million to ensure sterile water when the pool is re-opened. Wallace and Tiernam chlorinators supply the chlorine to the water and the filtration equipment used is made by United Filters. Sulphate of Alumina is used in required quantities in the filtering of the water and soda ash, or similar, is used to assist in maintaining the necessary PH. value of the water. Hourly tests are made of both pools to see that the correct PH. and chlorine values are present. Periodical bacteriological examination of the water is carried out by visiting pathologists from the London County Council Public Health Department Pathological Services. The water is maintained in such sterile condition that it is not necessary to empty the pools. However, as the large pool is closed during the winter season, and has to be drained down, the contents of the small pool are used to thoroughly wash out the filters servicing this pool, and then, 50,000 gallons of water from the large pool is filtered through both sets of filters into the small pool. This, in effect, means that both pools are emptied down each year. While the pools are empty opportunity is taken to thoroughly scour all sections of the pool steps that are under water, and all glazed tiling is cleaned down with an abrasive powder. -41- SECTION C HOUSING Details of new housing accommodation completed in Borough during 1960 are as follows:- Poplar Borough Council 84 dwellings London County Council 749 dwellings The number of families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 31st December, 1960, was as follows:- Type of dwelling No. of Lettings Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,058 Post-war Council houses and flats 1,621 Temporary bungalows 364 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 77 Acquired properties 157 Other properties 7 TOTAL PROPERTIES 3,284 -42- Rent Act, 1957.

Further samples to be taken. -50- Food Sampling A total of 1077 samples of food were procured during the year by the Council's Food Inspector. Of these 550 were submitted to the Public Analyst for Chemical examination, the remaining 527 being sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service for biochemical or bacteriological report. Samples examined by the Public Analyst included a comprehensive variety of food. 3 samples were acquired formally and 547 informally. A total of 23 samples (4.2 per cent) were found to be adulterated. Details of the unsatisfactory samples and the action taken are shown in Table VIII on pages 49 and 50. The rate of adulteration in the Borough for the past five years was as follows:- Year Number of Samples Percentage Adulteration 1960 550 4.2 1959 538 2.6 1958 543 2.2 1957 550 2.0 1956 550 3.8 Average 546 3.0 Nine informal samples of Milk were examined and found to be satisfactory. No milk adulteration has been found in the Borough for the past six years. Condensed Milk. One formal and two informal samples of machine skimmed condensed milk were examined. One of the informal samples was low in milk solids and also in the declared equivalent pints. One full-cream evaporated milk was examined and found to comply with the regulations. This was an informal sample. -51- Unsound Food. The Council's Food Inspector is called upon to pass judgment of fitness on great quantities of food. Frequently large and valuable stocks are involved. Among special lots of food examined during the year were the following:- Fresh Foods Canned Foods Ham 2 Tons. 9 cwts. (Stock at shop) Condemned and destroyed Ham 16 cwts. 3 qrs. 9 lb. (Stock at Wharf) Condemned and destroyed Tomatoes 16 cwts. 2 qrs. 2 tons 3 cwts. 1 qr. 19 lb. (Stock at Wharf)- Condemned and destroyed Tonato Puree 6 cwts. 2 qrs.

This summary differentiates only between canned food and others; foods preserved by salt, sugar, dehydration, etc., being included under the heading "Fresh Foods". Disposal of Unsound Food. The bulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned and destroyed by the Borough Engineer's refuse disposal service as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned, arrangements may be made under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch, or manure making. -53- Milk Supply Registration and Licensing. For details of registration of distributors see page 47. Licences issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation (Raw Milk)) Regulations, 1949:- Sterilised Pasteurised Tuberculin tested Dealers 112 63 24 Supplementary 28 23 23 Milk Sampling. A total of 13 samples of milk ( - formal, 13 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination. All samples were satisfactory. For average solids in all samples, excluding Channel Islands milk, the figures were: Fat 3.5, Non fatty solids 8.7. The Milk and Dairies (Channel Islands and South Devon Milk) Regulations, 1956, fixed a minimum standard of 4 per cent, fat in connection with milk sold under the description Channel Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and South Devon. 4 samples of Channel Islands milk were taken and reports showed fat figures of an average of 4.5 and in each case the non-fatty solids figure was 9.0. -54- Tea. In 1960 responsibility for the sampling and examination of tea upon importation passed from H. M Customs and Excise to Local Authorities. During the year 261,155 chests containing approximately 13,100 tons of tea were landed within the Borough and a sampling routine has been established. Advice has been given regarding damaged and contaminated teas, 2 tons 13 cwts. 3 qrs. 27 lbs. being released for re-exportation for manufacturing purposes. Ice Cream Production at the largest of the manufacturers has increased considerably during the year and a total of 118 samples were taken for bacteriological examination. Close supervision is exercised in connection with the manufacture and storage of ice cream produced within the Borough and retailed over a large part of the Midlands and Southern England. Samples examined by the Public Analyst under the Pood Standards (Ice Cream) Regulations, 1959 were satisfactory in all respects. Ice Lollies. During the year, 18 samples of ice lollies were taken and submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination. Results were generally satisfactory. -55- Desiccated Coconut. The importation into this country of Desiccated Coconut infected with food poisoning organisms of the Salmonella group has led to a considerable increase in the number of samples taken for bacteriological examination. Some 8,000 tons of this commodity arrives in London annually and a sampling schedule, agreed with other Riparian Authorities, has been strictly enforced at Poplar wharves and warehouses. In addition, extensive experiments have been carried out with the co-operation of Dr. Tomlinson, Director of the Public Health Laboratory Service and a local firm specialising in the roasting and processing of nuts, resulting in a method of heat treating infected coconut. Considerable quantities, sent from all parts of the country, are processed under the supervision of this Department and released to manufacturers for human consumption. Foods for Export. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 63 inspections were made of foods exported from the district; 63 certificates of purity were issued. Food Poisoning - (See Infectious Diseases). -56- LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Legal proceedings were instituted in respect of contraventions of the Pood and Drugs Act, 1955, and the Pood Hygiene Regulations, 1955, in the following instances:- Premises Food and Drugs Act, 1955 Of fence Result Baker's Shop Bread roll containing lava or grub or moth.

Diphtheria. Although no cases of diphtheria were notified during the year, there were several cases in other parts of London and there is, therefore, still no room for complacency with regard to this disease. It must be reiterated that freedom from diphtheria can only be maintained by emphasizing to the public the seriousness of this disease and by gaining their support and maintaining a vigorous policy of immunisation. Dysentery. There was very little change in notifiable cases as compared with 1959. There were, however, two minor outbreaks, one being related to a nursery school, involving six cases (five children, one parent), and the other to a Half-way House for homeless families. The latter resulted from the transfer of a family from another Half-way House which had had positive cases. As a result of past experience, it has been agreed with the London County Council that no transfer shall be made from a large Home in which there have been recent cases of dysentery unless the family to be transferred has a satisfactory history, confirmed by a series of negative swabs. -58- In the outbreak referred to above a symptom free family was transferred after two swabs had proved negative, the result of a thiri not being known until after transfer - was found to be positive. The damage had been done, and seven cases in two families occured - all of the same phage type. However, with the co-operation of the family doctors, the patients were kept under surveillance until cleared by negative bacteriological examination. They made rapid recoveries. Food Poisoning. There were 61 cases of food poisoning, which shows an increase of seven on the number of cases for 1959. One death occurred, a boy of six, due to salmonella typhi-murium. He was admitted to hospital one day after the onset with a temperature of 103° and died within four days. The history suggested that a relative had died eight months previously of gastro-enteritis. Investigation of the family disclosed that the patient's brother, a child of nine months, was a symptomless excreter of the same organism, but was cleared after treatment. Measles. The number of cases of measles notified during the year was 247, as compared with 1,166 in 1959 and 86 in 1958, once more clearly illustrating the cyclic nature of this disease. Poliomyelitis. During the year, four confirmed cases of poliomyelitis (paralytic) were notified. They were unrelated in time, no source could be traced, and there were no secondary cases recognised. -59- Tuberculosis. Although much progress has fortuitously been recorded in the apparent control of tuberculosis by reason of the advent of new drugs, in recent years there has been very little change in the number of cases notified and it is apparent that this disease is a long way from eradication. There were 49 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1958, 57 cases in 1959 and 41 cases in 1960. The rise in 1959 does not appear to be related to the influx of immigrants and 1960 continues to show the anticipated downward trend in notifications of pulmonary tuberculosis. A graph illustrating this trend is shown on page 62. If we are to obliterate this scourge, as I think is possible, there is a very great need for every consideration to be given to the preventive approach. Whilst in England it is considered repugnant to insist on compulsion in the treatment of tuberculosis, from time to t me individuals are found, open cases with positive sputum, who refuse all offers and persuasion to undergo treatment and in London we are hampered in dealing with this type of obstruction because of the lack of suitable legislation. The table shown overleaf indicates the age and sex of the cases notified. Whooping Cough. Notifications of this disease show a considerable increase; 98 cases were notified in 1960, 15 in 1959 and 22 in 1958. This may be related to the influx of immigrants and also to a lack of appreciation of the necessity for immunisation in the first year of life. -60- TABLE IX TUBERCULOSIS - PRIMARY NOTIFICATIONS 0 yrs 1 yrs 2 yrs 5 yrs 10 yrs 15 yrs 20 yrs 25 yrs 35 yrs 45 yrs 55 yrs 65 yrs 75 yrs TOTAL Respiratory males – – – 1 1 5 2 3 4 7 4 1 1 29 Respiratory females – 2 3 - - 1 1 2 1 2 – – – 12 Non-respiratory males – – – – – – – 3 – – – – – 3 Non-respiratory females – – – – – – – - 1 – – – – 1 In addition 57 other cases were added to the register as a result of information received from the following sources:- Death returns 3 Transfers from other areas 54 During the year 10 deaths were certified as due to tuberculosis, as compared with 9 the previous year.

During the printing of this Report the following recommendation of the Public Health and Housing Committee was received and adopted by the Council:— "We have considered complaints made at meetings of the Council of insufficient centres for distribution of disinfectants, especially in North Bow. The Medical Officer of Health has obtained the offer of rooms at 37, Trego Road and a shed at 97, Stebondale Street, Cubitt Town, for the purpose of additional distributing centres, at a rental of 4s. per week in each case. The opening of these depots for half-days would involve the employment of one additional man." We recommend— "(d) That additional distributing centres for disinfectants be opened at North Bow and Cubitt Town, as suggested." Therefore there are now seven depots in the Borough as follow:— Poplar. Bickmore Street (High Street) 8 a.m. to 12 noon. West Perry Road (near Millwall Dock Entrance) 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. (Saturdays excepted.) 97, Stebondale Street (Cubitt Town) 8 a.m. to 12 noon. Bow. 37, Trego Road (Hackney Wick) 8 a.m. to 12 noon.

ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with the "Sanitary Officers' (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my sixteenth Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1908, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. The Report of the Lady Health Visitor is also included. VITAL STATISTICS. Population. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1908, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 170,445:— Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,795,757 60,510 66,892 43,043 being 60 6 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 73.22 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 51.88 per acre in Poplar Sub-District, 110.41 2 in Bromley, and 77.45 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1908. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports; for the Sub-District of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three sub-districts might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., and VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. Births. During the year 1908, 133 births were notified outside the Borough belonging thereto:—129 by the Medical Officer of Stepney, two by the Medical Officer of Finsbury, one by the Medical Officer of Health of Marylebone, and one by the Medical Officer of Health for Greenwich. 112 of the Stepney births occurred in the Mothers' Home, Commercial Road, and 15 in the London Hospital. The two births in Finsbury took place in the City of London Lying-in Hospital. The Marylebone birth occurred in Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital.

In the 53 weeks '2831 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 680 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1736 in Bromley, and 415 in Bow; from the 680 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 74 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 397 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 1003 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1736 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 863 deaths of nonparishioners and adding 205 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 1078. From the 415 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 6 non-residents and added 291 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 700 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III. that in considering the deaths of nonresidents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2831 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 521 deaths of actual nonresidents and 471 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2781 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1003 deaths in Poplar included 14 illegitimate children, 8 male and 6 female; the 1078 deaths in Bromley included 13 illegitimate children, 6 male and 7 female; the 700 Bow deaths included 7 illegitimate children, 3 male and 4 female, making a total for the Borough of 34 deaths of illegitimate children. 8 Males.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Sub-Districts of Poplar and Bromley.

The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 26th February, 1908. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to your letter of the 21st instant, and to state that they hereby consent to the adoption of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, within the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, and, in pursuance of Section 2 (2) and paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the Act, they hereby fix the 9th March, 1908, as the date on which the Borough Council's resolution of adoption shall come into operation. I am to point out that Section 2 (3) of the Act requires that the local authority shall bring the provisions of the Act to the attention of all medical practitioners and midwives practising in their area. Moreover, Section 1 (2) requires that the local authority shall supply without charge addressed and stamped postcards containing the form of notice to any medical practitioner or midwife, residing or practising in their area, who applies for the same. I am at the same time to advert to your letter of the 21st December last, and to state that the Board do not see any objection to Voluntary Health Visitors acting in concert with the lady officially appointed by the Borough Council as Health Visitor, the latter, of course, working under the direction and supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LITHIBY, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk, Poplar. Notice of the coming into operation within the Borough on the 9th March, 1908, of the Council's resolution of adoption of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, was given to the local medical practitioners and midwives, and public notice was also given thereof. The Act provides that it shall be the duty of the father of a child, if c 14 he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, and of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours after the birth, to give notice within thirty-six hours, in writing, of the birth, to the Medical Officer of Health. Any person who fails to give notice of a birth as above is liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty shillings, but is not liable to such penalty if he satisfies the Court that he had reasonable grounds to believe that notice had been duly given by some other person. The notification required to be given under the Act is in addition to, and not in substitution for, the requirements of any Act relating to the registration of births. 3363 notifications were received during the statistical year 1908, ended 2nd January, 1909. Immediately upon the receipt of a notification, the following are posted off to the mother :—" Hints regarding the Management of Infants," directions as to " Method of Boiling Milk," a handbill respecting " Prevention of Summer Diarrhoea among Infants " (see page 109) and another handbill informing the mother that the Poplar Health Visiting Association have established in certain districts " Consultation Days" for mothers to bring their babies and obtain advice either about their own health or that of the baby from the doctor or trained nurse who will be in attendance on these consultation days, and mothers can have their babies weighed. (See page 17.) By Section 1 (4) of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, the Registrars of Births and Deaths shall at all reasonable times have access to notices of births received by the Medical Officer of Health under this Act or to any book in which those notices may be recorded. By Section 2 (5) in London the Medical Officer of Heath of every Metropolitan Borough in which this Act is in force shall send weekly to the London County Council on a form prescribed by the London Government Board a list of all notices of births received by him under the Act during the week. In Poplar the Public Health Department, to assist the Registrars, sends a press copy of the weekly list mentioned above to the Registrars of Births and Deaths. Every week the Registrars forward to the Public Health Department a return of births registered by them during the week. When the Registrars' returns are received the children are for the most part over six weeks old. 15 Now it is found that in many instances the date of the birth of the child as given by the person registering the birth differ from the date notified to the Medical Officer of Health. Each of the three Registrars of the Borough informs the Medical Officer of Health that frequently the date given by the person registering the birth varies from that which is returned to him by the Medical Officer of Health. In some cases the Registrar by calling attention to the date which appeared on the notification of birth card supplied by the Public Health Department is able to register the date previously given to the Medical Officer of Health, but in others the person registering the birth will not admit any mistake ; hence the Registrar has no option but to enter the date which must obviously be incorrect, as there can be no doubt that the date on the notification birth card is the more correct as it is posted within 36 hours after the birth. The probable explanation is, the parents give the wrong date of the births, as they fail to register such births within six weeks, as required by the Registration Act, and thereby avoid the penalty. There can be no doubt the adoption of the Notification of Births Act and the sending to the Registrars copies of the filled-in form which is sent weekly to the London County Council assists the Registrars in registering the correct date of the birth. Health Visitor and Poplar Health Visiting Association. Miss A. E. Hall, of Bradford, was appointed by the Council to be the " Health Visitor." A card system was arranged to enable the Health Visitor to keep records of the births. Steps were taken to form an Association of voluntary helpers to act with Miss Hall, a course which the Local Government Board approved when sanctioning the adoption of the Notification of Births Act in the Borough on the Council agreeing to appoint a Health Visitor.! * See Health Visitor's Report (page 250). t Since the appointment of Miss Hall, the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, has been passed, giving power to Sanitary Authorities to appoint Health Visitors:— 6 (1) Any sanitary authority may on or at any time after the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and nine appoint suitable women (to be known 16 At a meeting at which the " Poplar Health Visiting Association for the Prevention of Infantile Mortality " was formed, Mrs. Sydney Buxton was appointed President; Mrs. B. H. Green Vice-President; Rev. H. Mosley Treasurer, and Miss Wintour and Miss A. E. Hall Organizing Secretaries. In order that the Association may act effectively, it is necessary that its members should be in close touch with the official Health Visitor; the Public Health and Housing Committee therefore approved the proposal that Miss Hall should act as Organizing Secretary of the Association, in conjunction with Miss Wintour, and the Public Health Offices be used as the official address of the Association. The Council confirmed the approval of the Committee. The following handbill, among other matter (see page 14), is posted to the mother immediately upon receipt of the notification of the birth :— as health visitors) for the purpose of giving to persons advice as to the proper nurture care and management of young children and the promotion of cleanliness and discharging such other duties (if any) as may be assigned to them in accordance with the provisions of this section. (2) The Local Government Board may make regulations prescribing the qualifications, mode of appointment, duties, salary and tenure of office of health visitors appointed under this section, and no appointment of health visitor shall be made otherwise than in accordance with such regulations. (3) It shall be lawful for the council to pay out of the County Fund and charge to the Exchequer Contribution Account any sum or sums by way of contribution towards the salaries of any person so appointed not exceeding in the case of any such person one-half of her salary. 17 Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. MOTHER the Poplar Health Visiting Association, which consists of a number of ladies and gentlemen anxious to do all in their power to help you, and who are working in the Borough, wish to BRING to your notice the fact that they have decided to extend their work by establishing in each district a " Consultation Day for Mothers and Babies," to which you may bring YOUR baby, and get advice either about your own health, or that of baby, from the doctor or trained nurse who will be in attendance. Medicine will not be given, but if found necessary either for you or BABY you will be advised where to go. Perhaps you do not know that nearly a thousand babies, under one year of age, die each year in your own Borough, others, who struggle on, are weak and unhealthy. This ought not TO BE and the Association are doing their best to prevent it, and want you to co-operate with them. Most of the deaths are due to improper feeding, mothers in their anxiety often giving them the wrong thing, because they think baby is not getting on. The best way to find out, is to have baby WEIGHED regularly. A steady increase in weight being a sure indication that baby is thriving, and as there is a proper machine for this purpose, you are cordially invited to bring your baby to be weighed, and get advice if you need it.

Darby, the Medical Officer attended the National Conference on Infantile Mortality held at the Caxton Hall on 23rd, 24th and 25th March. The following resolutions were passed:— I.—That this Conference expresses its appreciation of Parliament having passed the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and urges upon all Local Authorities the importance of adopting the Act and appointing qualified women to carry out its provisions. II.—That, in order to combat the prevalent ignorance resulting in wastage of infant life and injury to the health of many survivors, the conference urges upon the Board of Education, and upon Educational Authorities generally, the importance of securing to all girls in every grade of school a satisfactory training in domestic and personal hygiene and the duties of womanhood. • Most sympathetic replies were given by Mr. Asquith, Mr. Runciman, and Mr. Burns to a deputation from the National Conference on Infantile Mortality which was received in the Prime Minister's Room at the House of Commons on Friday, 26th February, 1909. The Prime Minister made a brief reply to the deputation, but its tone as well as its phraseology was in a marked manner sympathetic. The concluding sentences of his speech are worth quoting in extenso. " While we have had a general improvement in sanitary conditions," said the Prime Minister, "this particular evil of infantile mortality remains substantially unchanged. I think we must agree that the causes are those which you have communicated to me to-day. First, there is the ignorance of the mother; secondly, there is the not infrequently unskilful treatment from unqualified or partially qualified practitioners at and after the birth of the child ; and thirdly, the almost grotesquely bad forms of nutrition which the unfortunate child which survives receives. There you have three causes co-operating to produce two results which are almost equally bad. First, there is the waste of child life which has been connected with the appalling rate of mortality of children under twelve months ; and, in the next place, there is the growth to womanhood and manhood of children who at the most critical time of their existence, considering the conditions under which their earlier years are spent, never have a chance of developing into the raw material for good workmen and good citizens. That is substantially the case you present us to-day. Speaking now generally, I am heartily in sympathy with you and any practical form of legislation which may be suggested will receive from the Government their most sympathetic consideration." 19 III.—That the Conference welcomes most gladly the Children's Bill, introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P., for the amendment of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, and recommends the Executive Committee to ask that the Bill be specially amended to include the case in which one child only is put out to nurse for reward; and that the Bill be further amended to empower Local Authorities to charge upon the rates the cost of carrying out the existing statutory provisions for the prevention of cruelty to children. IV.—That the Conference, being convinced of the injury done to infant life and health through infants being taken into public houses, urges upon Parliament the necessity of providing such legislation as will prevent this. V.—That this Conference urges upon Boards of Guardians the advisability of making greater use of their existing powers to adopt, under the Poor Law Act, 1899, the children of incorrigible parents. VI.—That all preparations offered or sold as food or drugs for infants should be certified by a Government Analyst as non-injuriousi and that each packet should contain its analysis. VII.—That, in view of the unsatisfactory conditions under which milk is produced and distributed, the Conference, being of opinion that immediate amendment of the law is desirable, urges upon Parliament the necessity of at once taking such steps as are necessary to effect this. VIII.—That the Conference re-affirm the resolution of the former Conference, that the Midwives Act, 1902, be extended to Scotland and Ireland. IX.—That the Conference continue as a Committee to give effect to the foregoing Resolutions, with power to remit to an Executive Committee to carry out the same. 20 Children Act, 1908. Notice as to the Keeping of Nurse Infants and oth;.r Mattehs. The undermentioned provisions of the Act will come into operation on 1st April, 1909 :— Infants received for Hire.

Notice of the removal or death of a nurse infant must within fortyeight hours be sent to the Council.* Notice of the death of a nurse infant must within twenty-four hours be sent to the Coroner. If a death certificate has been issued such certificate should be sent with the notice to the Coroner. Forms of notice for the above purposes will be supplied by the Council* on application to the Chief Officer of the Public Control Department, 31, Spring Gardens, S.W., and any person who has received an infant as aforesaid and fails to give notice as aforesaid or wilfully makes or causes any other person to make any false or misleading statement in any such notice will be guilty of an offence. Number of Infants to be kept. The number of nurse infants who may be kept in a notified dwelling will be fixed by the Council, and no infant must be kept in excess of the number so fixed. Inspection. A visitor duly appointed and authorised in writing by the Council* will from time to time inspect the infants referred to in any notice and the dwelling in which they are kept, in order to be satisfied as to the nursing * London County Council. 21 and maintenance of the infants and to give any necessary advice or directions. It will be an offence to refuse to allow such officers to visit or examine the infants or the dwelling in which they are kept. Improperly Keeping Infanta. An infant shall not be received— (a) In premises that are overcrowded, dangerous or insanitary. (b) By any person who by reason of negligence, ignorance of other cause is unfit to have the care of an infant.

A person who receives an infant in respect of whom notice is required to be given cannot benefit under any insurance on the life of the infant, and any such person who directly or indirectly insures or attempts to insure the life of such infant will be guilty of an offence. Separate Cots. Each infant should sleep in a separate cot. The Act provides for a penalty under certain conditions when an infant dies of suffocation when sleeping in the same bed as an adult. Fire Guards. Every fire should be protected with a fire guard. The Act provides for a penalty where through the absence of fire guards an infant is killed or suffers serious injury.

Public Health Tuberculosis Regulations, 1908.* The Local Government Board for affording facilities for the extension of administrative action for the prevention of tuberculosis issued an Order on the 18th December in pursuance of Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended and extended by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Public Health Act, 1896, to provide for the notification to the Medical Officer of Health of Sanitary Authorities of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occurring amongst the inmates of Poor Law Institutions, or amongst persons under the care of District Medical Officers, and for the taking of certain measures in such cases. Notification by Medical Officers of poor Law Institutions. Article IV. of the Order directs that the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution, as defined by Article I., shall within 48 hours after his first recognition of the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in the case of a poor person who is an inmate of the institution, post to the Medical Officer of Health of the sanitary district in which the person resided immediately before he became an inmate of the institution a notification of the case. The notification must be made on a printed form as set out in the Schedule to the Order. Notification by District Medical Officers. Article V. directs that a similar notification shall be posted to the Medical Officer of Health by the District Medical Officer in the case of any poor person suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis on whom he is in medical attendance according to his agreement with a Board of Guardians. The notification must be posted within 48 hours after the District Medical Officer has first recognised the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis, and must be addressed to the Medical Officer of Health acting for the sanitary district in which the residence of the poor person is situate. • Under date February, 1909, the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board has issued a memorandum on Administrative Measures against Tuberculosis. 26 Notification by Superintending Officers of Poor Law Institutions. Under Article VI. it will be the duty of the Superintending Officer of a Poor Law Institution to post to the Medical Officer of Health on a printed form as set out in the Schedule to the Order a notification of the actual or intended place of destination and address at that place of any person leaving the institution in respect of whom a notification has been made by the Medical Officer of the institution under Article IV.

Date on uhich the Order comes into effect. The Order will take effect after 1st January, 1909. * Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Prevention of Consumption. Introductory. Consumption and other forms of tuberculosis cause one death in every eight deaths in this country; and of all deaths in the United Kingdom between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five, in the prime of life, therefore, nearly one-half are due to consumption. 29 In Great Britain alone, at the present time, probably a quarter of a million persons are suffering from consumption, and are thereby more or less unfitted for the proper discharge of the duties of life. The causes which predispose to consumption are such as bring about a low state of health : the susceptibility to it, often inherited, may also be induced by unhealthy conditions of life, evil habits, etc., as overcrowding in close, unventilated, dirty, dark, damp dwellings; bad or insufficient food ; and intemperance. The disease may be prevented by the adoption of means for the improvement of the general health of the community, and by the removal of insanitary conditions in houses, etc.; in many cases, moreover, it is curable, especially in the early stages. The Tubercle Bacillus or Microbe. Science has of late years proved beyond doubt that consumption is caused by a minute living organism, the "bacillus of tubercle," and that the presence in the body of the tubercle bacillus is most rarely inherited, but is introduced from without. What is inherited is the non-resistile condition of the vitality of certain cells in the body which are unable to destroy the tubercle bacillus, when it has become accidentally introduced into the system. To prevent consumption it is necessary, firstly, to avoid all those means by which the tubercle bacillus may be introduced into the body, and, secondly, to avoid all those causes which may enfeeble the vitality of the cells of the body, and so render them unable to destroy the bacillus should it become introduced. Consumption is caused by the presence in the body, and especially in the luugs, of a microbe derived usually from a person suffering from the disease. This microbe under favouring circumstances—for example, in dark, dirty, damp houses, and unventilated, dusty, overcrowded rooms, workshops, factories, etc.—is capable of living outside the body for a long time. It exists in enormous numbers in the spit coughed up from the lungs of consumptive persons. It may be present in the fiesh, etc., of tuberculous animals, and it is certainly present in the milk of cows suffering from tubercular disease of the udder. 30 Such milk is dangerous to infants and young children, being a cause of the " wasting " diseases so often met with at that period of life. But the main cause of the spread of consumption is the spit of consumptive persons. The spit infects everything on which it falls, and it is dangerous in the form of minute droplets sprayed into the air by consumptives in the act of coughing. The spit is even more dangerous if allowed to fall on the ground and to become dry; for then floating in the air as dust, it may be taken into the lungs in breathing and so spread consumption from one person to another, especially to those predisposed to the disease. Destroy the microbes and consumption will not be spread. There is little risk of taking the disease from the breath of a consumptive person if the precautions herein set out are observed. Fresh air and sunlight are preventives of consumption : they kill the microbe and also act curatively; therefore, the consumptive person, if well clad, can hardly be too much in the open air. Personal Precautions to be observed by Consumptives. For the protection of their own families, and to prevent the spread of the disease to other persons, the following precautions should be taken by all who are suffering from consumption. A consumptive person when coughing should hold a handkerchief or rag or piece of paper in front of the mouth, and should never cough in the direction of any other person. Do not swallow the spit, as by so doing tubercular disease may be set up in the bowels and other parts of the body not already affected. Do not spit about the house, or workplace, or in the street, nor on the floor of any cab, omnibus, tramcar, railway carriage, or other conveyance, nor in theatres, concert rooms, or other public meeting places. Spit only into a covered cup, spittoon, or bottle kept for the purpose, and containing water, to which a disinfectant should be added. Out of doors a small wide-mouthed bottle, with a well-fitting cork, 31 should be used ; or a pocket spittoon, which may be obtained from any chemist and druggist. When a proper vessel is not at hand, and also for wiping the mouth, a piece of rag or paper, or paper handkerchief, which can be burned, should be used. These after being used should never be carried loose in the pocket, but in a tobacco pouch, sponge bag, or other water-proof receptacle. On returning home the paper or rags should be burnt, and the pouch or bag well washed with disinfectant. If an ordinary handkerchief is used, it should be kept wet until it can be put into boiling water and washed. The spit if collected in a cup, bottle, or spittoon, must be destroyed by being put on to a clear fire. This is the simplest, quickest, and safest way of destroying the microbe. When there is no fire, wash the spit, at least twice a day, into the water-closet, or bury it in the earth. The spit vessel, after emptying, must be soaked for ten minutes in boiling water and then be thoroughly cleansed. A consumptive person must not kiss or be kissed on the mouth, there is a great possibility that the germs of the disease may be carried from the lips. A consumptive mother should not suckle her baby. A consumptive person should, if possible, sleep in a separate bedroom, and in any case should occupy a separate bed. But the best place for him is a Sanatorium. General Precautions. Clothing, towels, sponges, bedding, etc., should not be used in common by consumptives and healthy people. Consumptives should have special articles for their own use. Special feeding utensils, such as cups, saucers, plates, knives, forks, spoons, should be provided for consumptives, and should not be used by any other persons until they have first been boiled in water. A consumptive who smokes must not allow another person to use his tobacco pipe. Rooms (-sleeping rooms especially) occupied by consumptives, and 32 workshops, factories, etc., must be kept free from damp, and be well lighted and ventilated. The rooms occupied by a consumptive person should contain no unnecessary furniture; and especially curtains, bed hangings, and clothes hanging about should be avoided as far as possible. Do not block up the chimney of the bedroom, by closing the register or otherwise. Open windows and let in fresh air day and night. But avoid draughts. All affections of the lungs should be cured as quickly as possible, as a congested lung or bronchial tube is in a condition favourable for the tubercle bacillus to live and propagate. Cleanliness and good sanitary surroundings are most important for preventing and also for curing consumption. Young children should not be allowed to crawl on dirty floors. Their nails, teeth and mouth should be carefully attended to, and all small wounds, crusts or scabs properly treated and made to heal. Rooms, passages and staircases in a consumptive person's home must be frequently cleansed and kept free from dust, for Where there is dust there is danger, therefore don't stir up dust. Wet cleansing of infected rooms is necessary. Use damp tea leaves when sweeping floors, and then burn the leaves and dust. Moors should be scrubbed with soft soap. Use damp dusters to wipe up dust on furniture, carpets, hangings, ledges of doors, windows, etc. Boil the dusters after use. Papered walls should be cleansed from time to time with dough. Carefully burning the crumbs afterwards. Milk must be boiled for one minute ; or it may be heated in a double saucepan for at least five minutes after the water boils in the outer saucepan. Never give uncooked milk to children. By either method,, the microbes, if present, will be killed. Meat must be well cooked. After the death of a consumptive person, or the removal to a fresh 33 dwelling of one sick of the disease, the room must not be used again until it, and the things in it, shall have been cleansed and disinfected. Disinfectants may be applied by washing, or brushing, or spraying. If the patient's clothes, pillows or bedclothes become soiled with spit they should be at once disinfected by steam or washed with boiling water. Disinfection will be done by the Council's staff. Information on the subject may be obtained upon application to the Medical Officer of Health. By order of the Public Health and Housing Committee, FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health.

Proposed Provision for the Reception into Asylums Board Hospitals of Patients suffering from Erysipelas and Puerperal Fever. The Battersea Borough Council communicated with the Local Government Board and the Metropolitan Asylums Board, urging that 64 provision should be made in the Asylums Board Hospitals for reception of patients suffering from erysipelas and puerperal fever, on conditions similar to those attaching to the reception of fever, smallpox and diphtheria patients. Legislation would be necessary to effect this, and the Local Government Board were asked to include it in one of their omnibus bills, or otherwise. The average numbers of cases notified in London are 200 to 300 cases of puerperal fever, and 4,000 to 5,000 of erysipelas each year, but many cases would not require to be removed. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council—That the action of the Battersea Borough Council in the matter be supported. Errors in Diagnosis. In giving the above numbers of notifications, no deductions have been made for the following cases, which it will be seen developed other diseases, either shortly after admission or after being in the hospital some time, whilst the list also shows that some patients removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals, after being detained in those institutions some days, were returned home certified as not suffering from the complaint or any other notifiable disease. 65 POPLAR.

Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever bacteriologically examined. (See pages 99 and 102.) Arrangements are still made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the medical officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. Two cases of scarlet fever were connected with milkshops in Poplar, Four cases of scarlet fever, and three of measles were connected with milkshops in Bromley. One case of puerperal fever was connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.* Forty premises with outworkers were† connected with infectious cases notified, 2 in Poplar, 15 in Bromley, and 23 in Bow—28 scarlet fever, 7 diphtheria and 5 erysipelas. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Four cases of measles‡ (1 Poplar, 2 Bromley, and 1 Bow) were also connected with outworkers' premises, and where work was found on the premises it was disinfected before being returned if there were any likelihood of infection, but there is no power to prevent work being executed on outworkers' premises where measles exists.

The plant has now been installed for a period of three years, and is still in good working order, producing 185 gallons of fluid in 8 hours, at an average strength of 4.5 to 5.0 grammes of chlorine per litre. A very large number of improvements have been made since the plant was first installed. The cost of repairs, renewals, and improvements for the working of the whole concern has been under £45 during the year 1908. For the past three years the Public Health Department has used no other disinfectant. Quantity Manufactured during Year 1908. During the year 1908, 28,280 gallons of the electrolytic fluid have been manufactured and have been distributed as follows:— 1. Violet Road Depot 6,156½ gallons. 2. Bickmore Street Depot 3,253 „ 3.

The cost of material in manufacturing 28,280 gallons of the electrolytic fluid for the year 1908 was as follows:— £ S. d. Electricity, 4,543 units at l½d. per unit 28 7 10 cwt. qrs. lbs. Chloride of Magnesium 23 3 3 10 9 3 24 0 7 Salt, 6 tons 9 18 0 Caustic Soda 5 17 4 Water 1 10 0 Total cost of materials to produce 28,280 gallons £56 2 5 The cost of labour remains about the same (even with another depot opened) as it was during the year 1907. The wages are one man manufacturing the fluid, paid 35s. per week, and three men distributing at various arranged hours at the 5 depots (32s., 30s., and 30s. respectively). *Supplied at a charge of 1d. per gallon to Works Department (for watering roads, flushing gullies, sewer manholes and market places). All institutions are supplied gratis. 82 Depots. The fluid is distributed to the inhabitants of the Borough from five depots.* The fifth depot was opened early in the year 1908. Applicants bring their own bottles and vessels, and this method of distribution effects a saving to the Council, as the cost of the bottles for the year will showBottles have cost £31 2s. 11d., labels £3, and corks £8 1s. 6d., the cost of bottles, corks, labels and bags for the years 1903, 1904 and 1905, being £142 3s. 11d., £172 18s. 4d., and £168 7s. 7d. respectively. Total Quantity Manufactured since Installation of Plant. Cost for Electricity and Material. Condition of Electrodes. Since the plant has been installed (a period of three years) 60,000 gallons of Electrolytic Fluid have been manufactured, and the cost for electricity and materials has been about £120, and so far as the electrodes are concerned, about one dozen zinc electrodes with the necessary nuts and bolts for fixing same have been replaced, at a cost of under 40s. Stability. As to the stability of the fluid, it may be interesting to know that prior to the adoption of the improved method now in operation in Poplar, one of the carboys of electrolytic fluid made on 27th March, 1906, at a strength of 4.818 grammes of chlorine per litre, was kept for testing, and when tested gave results as follows:— *The opening up of a fifth depot did not involve any increase in staff as the hours of distribution were re-arranged and are as under:— Place of Distribution. Hours. Bickmore Street, Poplar 8 a.m. to 12 noon. West Perry Road, Council's Depot 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. (Saturdays excepted).

Tested 26th Sept., 1907 4 297 18 months after date of manufacture „ 12th Dec., 1907 4.184 „ 29th Oct., 1908 3.785 2 years and 7 months after being made A Recent Bacteriological Report. During the year 1908 cholera was very prevalent on some parts of the European continent, and cholera contacts, and passengers from cholera-infected parts arriving in this country, the agents for the Borough Electrolytic Disinfectant Plant submitted samples of fluid similar to that made in Poplar to Dr. Klein, the eminent bacteriologist to the Local Government Board, for examination. The following is the conclusion arrived at by Dr. Klein in his report on the result of his examination:—One ounce of the fluid to 150 ounces of water (or one ounce in nearly one gallon of water) will kill the cholera germ in 2½ minutes and the electrolytic fluid in the same proportion will kill the germ of typhoid fever. The germ of plague would be killed by a more largely diluted solution, as its vitality is much less than that of cholera and typhoid fever. When such a cheap, reliable and simply produced disinfecting fluid (which can be largely diluted before use) takes the place of more costly disinfectants, it is obvious that a great financial saving must be the inevitable result. The great monetary advantage* to the Borough since *The Public Health Department has purchased no disinfectants for the past three years. In the year 1905, previous to the installation of the plant, the Public Health Department expended £31i 2s. 0d. for disinfectants and £168 7s. 7d. for bottles, corks, labels and bags, and £313 12s. 2d. for wages with four depots open. Now with five depots established (and practically unrestricted distribution as the inhabitants bring their own utensils to be filled) the wages are £331 per annum. The bottles, labels and corks cost during the year 1908 £42 is. 5d. The cost for Material and Electricity during the year 1908 was £56 2s. 5d. for the manufacture of 28,280 gallons, so that for the sum of £56 2s. 5d. during the year 1908 the Public Health Department was not only furnished with disinfectants, but the Guardians were afforded an unlimited supply gratis to all their institutions (saving over £200 per annum), and the Managers of the Sick Asylums Blackwall and Devons Road were also supplied with an unlimited amount free. The Public Baths in the Borough were also supplied gratis, but for the 11,770 gallons supplied to the Works Department a charge of 1d. per gallon was made which amounted to £49, the Public Health Department being credited with this amount, although no actual monetary transaction took place. Nevertheless, this must also mean a saving to the Borough. 84 the installation of the electrolytic plant, with the free distribution of the fluid, need not be referred to in detail as the fact has been demonstrated again and again. The ultimate gain to the Borough Council by the continuance of this process will be enormous. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1907, VERMINOUS CHILDREN ATTENDING SCHOOLS AND VERMINOUS PERSONS IN COMMON LODGING HOUSES. Representations respecting Inadequate Staff of Nurses employed by the london County council for inspection of Verminous Children in Schools. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee, viz.:— At least during the year 1908 there must have been a saving to the Borough of £100. The plant has been established over three years; it has paid for itself and also for the construction of the depot where it is installed and from which the fluid is generally distributed, and besides, there has been a saving of considerably over £1,200 to the Borough and far most important of all, the health of the inhabitants is good. The saving is based upvn the expenditure of 1905 when the supply was limited and not upon an unlimited supply as at present. Therefore the saving is very much greater than the figures seem to indicate. There is a request for another distributing depot to be opened, which will make a total of six. See pages 80 and 81 as to details of distribution. 85 ONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W., 12th February, 1908. Sir, I am directed to draw attention to sections 36 and 37 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, with reference to the cleansing of verminous persons. It will be observed that section 36 gives statutory power to the county medical officer or any other person authorised by him (a) to examine the person and clothing of any child attending any school provided or maintained by the Council to ascertain whether the person or clothing of such child is infested with vermin or is in a foul or filthy condition: (b) to require the parent or other person responsible for such child to effect the cleansing of the person and clothing of the child within 24 hours of the notice to that effect, and (c) on default of such parent or other responsible person, to remove the child from the school and to cause the person and clothing of such child to be properly cleansed in suitable premises and with suitable appliances and to detain there such child until such cleansing has been effected: and that section 37 enables the medical officer or any other person authorised by him (a) to enter any lodging house and examine the person and clothing of any person whom he has reason to suspect of being infested with vermin or in a foul or dirty condition (b) to require such person to submit his person and clothing to be cleansed at specific suitable premises within 24 hours of notice of such requirement, and (c) on default of such person, to remove him to suitable premises for the purpose of effecting the cleansing and to detain him there until it has been effected. The Council believes that the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council will agree that it is absolutely necessary that any arrangements made for carrying the Act into effect shall provide for dealing separately not only with men and women but also with boys and girls. The Council recognises that children in most cases belong to an entirely different class from that to which the adult person requiring cleansing belongs, and separate days or hours should be appointed for their reception, or particular rooms allocated to them, in order to avoid coming into contact with obviously undesirable adults. These are the more important points arising in connection with G 86 the new powers conferred upon the Council. Before making any definite arrangements to put the Act into force it is necessary that the Council should obtain the fullest possible information as to the extent of the provision already existing: the method of disinfection of verminous clothing and of dealing with a verminous condition of the hair: the arrangements in regard to the supervision by the cleansing staff: and the facilities which the Metropolitan Borough Council would be prepared to afford the Council in the matter. I am therefore to say that the Council will be obliged if the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council will at the earliest possible moment favour the Council with information on the points just referred to, and will indicate also what facilities can be afforded to the Council in its administration of the sections of the Act in question. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, Clerk to the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. There are four baths, provided in connection with the Shelter, at Bromley Depot, and adjacent to the Disinfecting Station, which are also used for persons making application under the Cleansing of Persons Act. The use of these baths, with all necessary materials, might, the Committee thought, be placed at the disposal of the London County Council for the purposes required, so far as such baths are not needed for the purposes for which they were provided. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion school children requiring to be cleansed should be attended to at these baths by the parents or by a person appointed by the London County Council. Clothing might at the same time be disinfected by the Borough Council's staff at the Disinfecting Station. These facilities, at times to be arranged with the Medical Officer, should, the Committee thought, be sufficient until the actual requirements had been ascertained by experience. The Public Health and Housing Committee communicated with the London County Council to this effect. 87 Representation respecting inadequate Staff of Examining Nurses, London County Council Schools. Representations were made to the Public Health and Housing Committee of the inadequate staff of nurses employed by the London County Council for the inspection of verminous children in schools. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is important a sufficient number of nurses should be employed by the County Council to ensure more frequent inspection of children in the schools and the carrying into effect of the necessary cleansing. The Committee recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and representations on the subject be made to the London County Council.* CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897.† During the year 876 persons had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfected. Since the notices were posted throughout the Borough a total of 2,923 persons had applied for baths, etc., as mentioned above. PORT SANITARY NOTICES.

Proposed Extension of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from the Local Government Board on the subject of representations made by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries as to the desirability, with a view to checking the spread of such diseases, of information being afforded by the Medical Officer of Health to the Clerk to the Local Authority under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, of cases or suspected cases of glanders, anthrax and hydrophobia in man. In order to afford this information the Local Government Board stated it is necessary a means of notification should be adopted, and the Board would be prepared to favourably consider an application for their approval of a resolution of the Council for extending to the diseases in * Woolsorter's disease, or splenic fever, or malignant pustule. 91 question the provisions of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Committee did not anticipate that there would be any number of cases to be notified, but considered it desirable notification should be required in the event of the occurence of cases of these diseases. Fourteen days' notice to members of the Council as required by Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, was given on the 22nd December, 1908. London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907. Under the London (Notification of Glanders) Order, 1907, the Veterinary Inspector of the London County Council reported, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of the Order, the existence of glanders at a stable in Bow, and also at a stable in Poplar on the 17th and 21st January respectively; at two stables, one in Bromley and one in Poplar, on 12th and 14th February respectively; on 3rd March a notice was received, under date the 2nd March, of glanders at a third stables, in Poplar; on 30th March at stables in Bow; on 13th April at stables in Poplar; on 20th May at premises (stables) in Poplar ; two notices were received during July (one on the 4th and the other on the 22nd) of glanders at premises in Poplar ; notice was received on the 12th September of the existence of glanders at premises in Poplar ; and notice was received on the 14th October of the existence of glanders at premises in Poplar.

On the 28th December a request was received from the Medical Officer (Education) of the London County Council for the disinfection, on account of scarlet fever, of the Infants' Department of Malmesbury Road School, to be carried out during the Christmas Holidays. Proposed Local Government Board Inquiry. The Holborn Borough Council called attention to a resolution recently adopted by the Metropolitan Asylums Board, as follows, viz.:— "That in view of the continued prevalence of scarlet fever, notwithstanding the extensive isolation accommodation which has been provided, the Local Government Board be asked to cause an inquiry to be instituted into the cause of this disease, and whether any, and if so, what further means can be adopted for its prevention." The Holborn Borough Council communicated with the Local Government Board in support of the application for an inquiry, and suggested similar action should be taken by other Borough Councils. In 1890 the number of cases of scarlet fever in London notified was 15,330, of which 6,537 were admitted to the Asylums Board's Hospitals. In 1907, 21,154 cases were notified, and 18,922 were removed to the Hospitals. The rates per 1,000 of population of cases notified increased from 37 in 1890 to 4-5 in 1907, and the percentage of hospital admissions to notifications increased from 42.6 in 1890 to 89.5 in 1907. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable an inquiry should be instituted as proposed, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the Local Government Board be so informed. 96 CONTINUED AND TYPHUS FEVERS.

Prevention of Summer Diarrhœa among Infants. During the warm weather of every summer, many hundreds of babies get sickness and diarrhœa, from which very many die. This illness is nearly always caused by wrong feeding, and bottle-fed babies mostly suffer. With care, mothers can keep babies from having the complaint, and can do much to help them to recover if they do take it. Very few babies who are suckled by the mother die from diarrhoea ; therefore make a special effort to feed your baby at the breast, and avoid weaning during the summer months—July, August and September. If a baby must be fed on the bottle do not use a tube bottle, which has been called the baby killer. Always have two boat-shaped feeding bottles without tubes. Long tubes cannot be kept clean and are death traps in the summer. Therefore only use a clean glass bottle or feeder with a teat over the neck. The jugs and feeding-bottles used for the milk should be kept scrupulously clean by scalding. Summer diarrhoea may be caused by stale milk or a dirty bottle. If, unfortunately, you must feed baby with the bottle be sure to get cow's milk as fresh as possible and boil it immediately on its arrival at the house. Milk should always be kept covered and in a cool place. Flies (which are poisonous), dust, and germs in the milk may give the baby diarrhœa. Only make one feed at a time. Do not use old feeds. If baby does not use all the feed, destroy what is left in the bottle. Wash out the bottle and teat in hot water and soda directly baby is fed, and keep them in cold water until the next feeding time. Always finally wash the bottle and teat before putting in the feed. 110 Infants should not be allowed to crawl on the floor or courtyard where they can pick up dirt. The bodies and clothing, etc., should be kept very clean, so as to prevent dust and dirt being conveyed to the mouth in any way. All rooms and yards must be kept scrupulously clean. Animal and vegetable refuse and waste food should be quickly removed from the house and covered up in the dustpail. Slops must be without delay emptied down water closet, which should be kept well flushed. These precautions will assist to keep away flies. Keep rooms well ventilated by open windows and doors. Diarrhoea is so rapidly fatal in young infants that whenever it commences medical advice should be sought at once and valuable time not lost. Whilst sending for medical advice stop giving the baby milk and give warm water (freshly boiled and sweetened with a little sugar) every half hour until the doctor arrives. Remember the illness is catching and infection is contained in what passes from the bowels. Always wash the hands after changing baby, and forthwith disinfect all soiled clothing by boiling. The soiled napkins should on no account be left lying about, but in order to destroy the disease germs, should be immediately soaked in a solution of disinfectant, which can be obtained at the Council's Depots as under:— Apply at Depots—Bickmore Street, Poplar, between the hours of 8 a.m. and 12 noon. West Ferry Road (near Millwall Dock Entrance) 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. {Saturdays excepted). Old Ford Road, 8 a.m. and 12 noon. 20, Ford Road, Clark's Stone Yard, 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. (Saturdays excepted).

The question of the provision of suitable mortuary accommodation in connection with a coroner's court for the Borough, which has been under consideration during the past 16 years, has now reached a position in which the present unsatisfactory arrangements will very shortly be discarded and a suitable mortuary and coroner's court provided. Plans have been prepared to build on the Cottage Street site and the Local Government Board inquiry is being awaited. 113 MODEL DWELLINGS. Grosvenor, County Council, and Hanbury Buildings.

I Mr. Langley reports that he visited two non-registered boats twice. § Includes thirty-seven barges and two sailing-barges. Mr. Miners reports he visited one barge twice. || Mr. Field reports one registered boat was illegibly marked, and that the steps taken to secure compliance with the Act and Regulations as regards such infringement was notification to owners. One boat was inspected twice, one three times and one four times. If Mr. Boyce reports one non-registered boat was visited twice and one three times. WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES AND OUTWORKERS. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 119 and 120. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. I 118 The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,743, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 119, and Tables C and D, pages 122 and 123. The places where the outworkers are employed were inspected all of them twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 244 and 245, and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 197, 201, 207, 221 and 230. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 71. A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 122 to 125) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in ivithout any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in t)ie journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic ivorkshops, and also workshops,* and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops olfactories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Table A, under " Laundries Domestic Workshops," there were 15 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were "Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 119 TABLE A.

London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1909. Part ITI. Unwholesome Milk. The London County Council is authorised to take samples of milk on delivery at any railway station in London, and the Borough Council to take samples at any other place in its own district.

Summonses were applied for in 5 instances, see pages 184, 185 and 186. London County Council and proposed Amendment ok Law. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 10th March, 1908. Sir, The Public Control Committee of the Council have under consideration the question of obtaining an amendment of the law with the view of dealing more effectively with nuisance from smoke. The Committee recognise that the existing law is largely ineffective, and that many sources of nuisance are at the present time untouched. It would appear desirable that the Council and the several local authorities should have more extensive powers for enabling them to deal with the evils arising from smoke, and a draft scheme for the amendment of the existing law has accordingly been prepared for consideration. The scheme, briefly, is:— (a) That dense smoke discharged from any building, vessel, stationary or locomotive engine, place or premises (other than a private dwelling house) within the area of the City and the County of London and the surrounding urban districts to a distance of twelve miles of Charing Cross or upon the waters of the Port of London and its tributaries within such 137 area, shall be a nuisance for which a fine not exceeding £10 may be imposed with cumulative penalties for subsequent offences, at the discretion of the magistrate. (b) That the Council shall have power to make by-laws, subject to the approval of the Home Office or the Local Government Board: (i.) To bring under the terms of the provision set out in conclusion (a) other instances of avoidable smoke nuisance. (ii.) To prescribe and revise from time to time a standard of smoke nuisance to further define emissions of smoke to be liable to penalties. (iii.) To prohibit the adoption in new or re-constructed factories, premises or buildings, of any furnace or grate or other fuel consuming apparatus of a type which shall have been proved to the satisfaction of the Council to produce an unnecessary amount of smoke. (iv.) To prescribe any additional measures or requirements necessary for the suppression and prevention of smoke nuisance. (v.) To provide a penalty for the breach of any such bylaw not exceeding the penalty specified in conclusion (a). (c) That exemption from liability to penalties implied or pressed in favour of Crown property or premises of electric power corporations be repealed. (d) That it shall be the duty of the several sanitary authorities to enforce the provisions of the law and any by-laws made by the Council. (e) That the Council shall have joint authority with the several administering bodies to enforce the law, and any by-law, within the area as above defined, with power to recover from the sanitary authority when it has been in default, the expenses of proceedings not recovered by order of a court and not incurred in unsuccessful proceedings. 138 (f) That the Council shall be the paramount authority for the whole area above defined, and as such, shall have power to expend money for the purpose of (i.) Promoting a knowledge of the principles of (a.) Combustion of fuel. (b) Furnace and grate construction. (c) Stoking. (ii.) Encouraging the study of the scientific heating of houses or the use of smokeless fuels with a view to the reduction of nuisance from the open fire grate. (iii.) Determining generally the best means for securing the prevention of smoke in the consumption of fuel. The Public Control Committee before recommending the Council to seek legislation on the subject will be glad to be furnished with any observations which the Poplar Borough Council may desire to make upon the draft scheme set out above. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, Clerk to the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it ie desirable legislation should be promoted for dealing with nuisance from smoke, on the lines of the scheme proposed by the Public Control Committee of the London County Council, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the London County Council be so informed. 139 FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.

In 18 instances samples were taken on delivery at institutions within the Borough—viz., 5 Poplar Union, 4 Sick Asylum, 4 Blackwall Sick Asylum, and 5 Stepney Union Workhouse. All the samples were genuine. f See pages 142-145 under heading of "Legal Proceedings" respecting samples purchased as butter which were found to be margarine on analysis, and also as to whether parcels of margarine were properly labelled when found exposed for sale or when delivered to the Inspectors. 140 Result of Analyses.

Three wholesale dealers in milk blended butter, one Bromley and two Bow. Three manufacturers of margarine, one Poplar two Bromley. "Butter Mixture"—Proposer Amendment of the Law. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee: — Borough of Camberwell, Town Clerk's Office, Town Hall, Camberwell, S.E. 26th May, 1908. Dear Sir,— Food and Drags Acts.—Butter and Margarine Mixture. This Council have had under consideration reports from their Food and Drugs Inspector with reference to the practice which is becoming more prevalent, adopted by certain traders in this Borough, of selling margarine under the title of "butter mixture." The article of food when sold in this manner is enclosed in a magarine wrapper, and generally contains from 5 to 10 per cent, of butter fat, the remaining portion consisting of margarine, and it is the common practice to charge Is. per lb. for the article, notwithstanding that margarine can be purchased at a much lower rate. There is no standard for "butter mixture." 148 The matter appears to this Council to be of 9uch importance as to warrant an amendment of the Food and Drugs Act in a way which will enable local authorities to cope with the difficulty, and I have been directed to address communications to the Presidents of the Local Government Board and of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, calling their attention to this particular question, and requesting them to take the necessary steps with the object of obtaining an amendment of the Acts in the direction indicated. I am also directed to approach the County Councils,. County Boroughs, and the Metropolitan Borough Councils upon the subject, and to ask them to take similar action. This Council express the hope that your authority will, after giving the matter their consideration, support the action taken, and communicate with the respective Presidents. Yours faithfully, C. WILLIAM TAGG, Town Clerk. To the Clerk, Poplar Borough Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee concurred in the action taken by the Camberwell Borough Council in the matter, and recommended that communications be addressed to the Presidents of the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, urging amendment of the Food and Drugs Acts as proposed. "Warranties"—Proposed Amendment of the Law The Camberwell Borough Council called attention to a case of a sample of milk taken under the Food and Drugs Act in course of delivery from a wholesale company to an infirmary in the Borough, which milk, upon analysis, was found to contain 12 per cent, of added water. On proceedings being taken the company relied on the farmer's warranty and the case was dismissed in the absence of proof that the company or their servants had tampered with the milk. The Camberwell Borough Council called the attention of the Presidents of the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture to the matter and urged action be taken to amend the law relating to warranties under the Food and Drugs Acts. 149 The Poplar Borough Council had repeatedly called attention to similar cases, but in view of impending legislation with regard to milk supply, the Public Health and Housing Committee considered it desirable the question relating to warranties should be again pressed, and recommended the Council that the action of the Camberwell Borough Council in the matter be supported.

Proposed Appointment of a Meat Inspector. The Public Health and Housing Committee had before them the reference from the Council to consider and report as to the present means adopted for the inspection of meat within the Borough, and to further L 150 consider the advisability of appointing an Inspector specially for this duty Meat inspection is now carried out by the several Sanitary Inspectors, each within his own district. The Committee were of opinion that it is not at present necessary to appoint an officer specially for inspection of meat, and recommended the Council—That the reference of the matter to them be discharged. Unsound Food Regulations (First Series.) On 12th September the Local Government Board issued regulations (which were published in the "London Gazette" on the 15th September) under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, for the purpose of preventing danger to the public health from importation, preparation, storage, and distribution of articles of food or drink other than drugs or water. The Regulations took effect on and after October 1st, but the Borough of Poplar was not included as one of the Sanitary Authorities under the Regulations The Local Government Board issued an "Order'' on the 29th December requiring the Port Sanitary Authority and the Poplar Borough Council to act together for the purposes of the Regulations. Object of Regulations. The object of these Regulations is to secure that articles of food which are unsound, unwholesome, or unfit for human consumption, and which, as part of the cargo of a ship, are brought to a place in this country either as a place of destination or as a place of deposit for transmission to a place of destination elsewhere in the United Kingdom so that articles of food may be dealt with at the port of discharge. Inspection. Powers of inspection for the purposes of the Regulations are conferred upon the Medical Officer of Health, or any duly qualified medical practitioner appointed or employed by the Sanitary Authority to act in the execution of the Regulations, and upon any other person appointed or employed by the Authority under the Regulations to exercise any powers or discharge any duties assigned to the Medical Officer of Health. Place and Method of Inspection. The Medical Officer of Health is authorised by Article IV. to examine articles of food which have been landed within the district of the Sanitary 151 Authority. If the circumstances, in his opinion, so require, he may also examine such articles before they have been landed. The same Article provides for necessary facilities being given for the purposes of his examination in the matter of convenient arrangement, unpacking, and the like, and Article VI. authorises him to apply to a Justice for a warrant to enter premises in special cases. Taking of Samples. In order to meet the case of particular consignments in which it is necessary that special examination should be made (e.g., in the laboratory), powers of sampling are conferred by Article VIII. Article VIII. also provides for the temporary detention of consignments pending the completion of the examination of the samples taken. Communication with Customs Officers. Article XIV. (2) provides that in certain circumstances the examination of an article of food by an officer of the Sanitary Authority shall not be made without the consent of the Officer of Customs. The Officer of Customs is, however, required to afford facilities for such examination. Procedure in connection ivith Unsound Food. Under Article IV. the Medical Officer of Health is empowered, himself or by an assistant, to seize and carry away an article of food which, in his opinion, is unsound or unwholesome, or unfit for human consumption, in order that application may be made to a Justice for an order of condemnation. Alternatively, the Medical Officer of Health, by notice to the importer or to any other person having charge of the article, may require that until it has been examined by a Justice it shall not be removed from the place specified in the notice without the permission of the Medical Officer of Health. Such notice, however, does not preclude the removal of the food in question, at the request or with the consent of the importer, and with the permission of the Medical Officer of Health, for the purpose of its destruction or for the application of a process which will effectually prevent the article from being used for human consumption. The Justice, if satisfied as regards the unsoundness of the particular food concerned, is required by Articles V. and VI. to condemn the food and order its destruction or its disposal under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health by such means and in such a manner as to prevent its being used for human consumption. If, however, evidence 152 satisfactory to the Justice is adduced that the food in question, although unsound, is not intended for sale for human consumption, he is required to make an order dismissing the complaint. A description of the food in question is to be given in any such order of dismissal, and a copy of the order is to be furnished to the Sanitary Authority. Article VII. requires the Sanitary Authority to keep for a period of not less than twelve months a record of any article of food destroyed or disposed of in pursuance of the Regulations. Provision for Determination of Differences, etc. Article XIII. empowers the Board, on the application of all the parties affected, to determine, either as arbitrators or otherwise, any difference arising in relation to any subject-matter of, or anything done under, the Regulations. Foreign Meat Regulations. On ]2th September the Local Government Board issued Foreign Meat Regulations (which was published in the "London Gazette" on the 15th September) under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, for the purpose of preventing danger to the public health from importation, preparation, storage, and distribution of articles of food or drink other than drugs or water. The Regulations were to come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1909, but the Borough of Poplar was not included as one of the Sanitary Authorities under the Regulations. The Local Government Board issued an order on the 29th January requiring the Port Sanitary Authority and the Poplar Borough Council to act together for the purposes of the Regulations. Object of the Regulations. The Regulations are designed to deal with foreign boneless meat which is imported in the form of scraps, trimmings, or other pieces not sufficiently identifiable with definite parts of a carcase, and which has not before importation been made ready for human consumption in the form of a sausage, or of another prepared or manufactured article of food; with imported tripe, tongues, or kidneys to which certain chemical preservatives have been applied; and with severed parts of a pig not prepared before importation as bacon or ham, and not contained in a package with an "official certificate" of the kind referred to below unopened on it or attached to it. These meats are classed together in the Regulations as "Foreign Meat of Class I.," and unless ths importer of meat of this class 153 exports it at his own expense, or furnishes proof, in the manner prescribed by the Regulations, that it is not intended for sale for human consumption the meat is required to be destroyed. With a view to stopping the importation of carcases of pigs from which the lymphatic glands about the throat and elsewhere are absent (thereby preventing the detection of evidence of tuberculosis and other disease in the carcase), the Regulations provide that carcases of pigs, not prepared as bacon or ham, which are imported without the lymphatic glands, and from which the head has been removed (Foreign Meat of Class II.) shall be dealt with in a similar manner to Foreign Meat of Class I. Foreign Meat of Class III. consists of the severed parts of a pig, not prepared as bacon or ham, and not being Foreign Meat of Class I., but contained in a package with an "official certificate" attached as evidence that the pig from which the meat is derived has been certified by a competent authority in the place of origin to be free from disease at the time of slaughter, and that the meat has been certified by the like authority to have been dressed or prepared, and packed with the needful observance of all requirements for the prevention of danger arising to public health from the meat as an article of food. A further object of the Regulations is to provide means by which oreign meat generally which is diseased, unsound, unwholesome, or unfit or human consumption may be detected and dealt with by public health authorities at the place of importation. Date on luhich the Regulations take effect. The Regulations will take effect on and after 1st January, 1909. Inspection. Powers of inspection for the purposes of the Regulations are conferred upon the Medical Officer of Health, or any duly qualified medical practitioner appointed or employed by the Sanitary Authority to act in the execution of the Regulations, and upon any other person appointed or employed by the authority under the Regulations to exercise any powers or discharge any duties assigned to the Medical Officer of Health. The appointment and payment of such persons, with the consent of the Board, is authorised by Article XV. of the Regulations. 154 Procedure under the Regulations. The Regulations require by Article III. (2) that the Officer of Customs shall cause to be detained, for examination by the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority, any foreign meat which according to the best opinion which, in the circumstances of the case, his knowledge enables him to form has the characteristics of foreign meat of either Class I. or Class II. If he finds that the cargo comprises Foreign Meat of Class III. or Foreign Meat Unclassed he may allow it to be removed unless he is of opinion that the meat requires examination by the Medical Officer of Health. It will be the duty of the Medical Officer of Health, on being informed by the Customs Officer of the detention, to examine the meat and to give either a notice forbidding its removal for any purpose other than exportation, or a certificate that it may be removed. But he is not to give a certificate and must give a notice as regards Foreign Meat of Class I. or Class II., and also Article X. requires a record to be kept of foreign meat destroyed, and Article XII. enables the Medical Officer of Health to take samples of foreign meat for the purpose of the Regulations. He is to dispose of the samples in such manner as the Sanitary Authority direct. It will be observed that under Article IV. the Medical Officer of Health is empowered to examine any foreign meat which is still in the district; even though its removal from the ship, or from the place of delivery or of landing, may have been allowed, and that if he is of opinion that it should not be removed to a place of destination for any purpose other than exportation, he is to give notice forbidding its removal except for exportation. Provision for determination of Differences, &c. *Article XVII. empowers the Board, on the application of all the parties affected, to determine, either as arbitrators or otherwise, any difference arising in relation to any subject-matter of, or anything done under, the Regulations. On the 12th December the Local Government Board issued a circular letter drawing attention to further matters in connection with the administration of the Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations. In connection with this circular letter specimen forms for use in connection with the Foreign Meat Regulations were appended. 155 Unsound Food (First Series) Regulations, 1908. Foreign Meat Regulations, 1908. London Port Sanitary Authority and Poplar Borough Council. On 4th December the Local Government Board forwarded the following letter with copies of their draft regulations to the Poplar Borough Council:— [copy.] 135,968 E. 1908. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 4th December, 1908. Sir,— I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that the Board have had under consideration the question of the application of the Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908, and the Public Health (First Series: Unsound Food) Regulations, 1908, in the case of foreign meat and food to be landed in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, and have caused Orders (drafts of which are enclosed) to be prepared under Articles XVI. and XII. of the Regulations respectively, requiring joint action by the Council of the Borough and the Port Sanitary Authority of the Port of London for the purposes of the Regulations in the matter. In the case of the Unsound Food Regulations, it is proposed that the powers and duties under those Regulations in regard to food landed in the Borough shall, except in the cases referred to in Paragraph 2, be exercised by the Council and their Medical Officer of Health. In cases where the Port Medical Officer of Health has specified a. place in the Borough for the detention of food, he is to notify the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough, who will thereupon deal with the food. Where food is consigned to a wharf in the Borough, has been examined by the Port Medical Officer of Health and found to be in good condition, he will, if the importer desires it, notify the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough of the fact of the examination, and no further examination will then be made by that Medical Officer of Health unless he has reason to think that the food has subsequently become unsound. 156 In the case of the Foreign Meat Regulations it is proposed that meat which, after it has been landed in the Borough is made the subject of notice by the Officer of Customs, the Council and their Medical Officer, except in the cases specified in Paragraph 3, shall deal with it. When the meat is consigned to a wharf in the Borough and has been examined by the Officer of Customs on board the ship that officer will give notice to the Port Medical Officer of Health, who will notify the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough, who will then deal with the meat. If the Port Medical Officer of Health has given a certificate releasing any foreign meat from detention under Sub-division (5) of Article III. of the Regulations, no further examination will then be made by the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough unless he has reason to believe that the meat has subsequently become unsound. As it is desirable that the orders should be issued as soon as may be practicable, the Board direct me to request that if the Council desire to make any observations respecting the proposed orders they may be forwarded by as early a date as possible. Copies of the Regulations to be applied by the proposed Orders are also enclosed. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) H. C. MONRO, Assistant Secretary. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The two orders for combined action of the Port Sanitary Authority and Poplar Borough Council were issued by the Local Government Board on the 29th December to come into operation on the 1st January, 1909. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council—That the several Sanitary Inspectors be appointed, subject to approval by the Local Government Board, to discharge, under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health, all or any of the duties of the Medical Officer of Health under the "Poplar (Foreign Meat Regulations) Order, 1908," and the "Poplar (First Series: Unsound Food Regulations) Order, 1908." And that the Borough Public Analyst be appointed to conduct any analyses required under the said Regulations, at a fee of 7s. 6d. per sample analysed. 157 Proposed Regulations as to the Conveyance and Storage of Meat. Notice of motion was given— "That this Council welcomes the Public Health (Regulations as to Pood) Act, 1907, respectfully suggests to the President of the Local Government Board (the Right Hon. John Burns) the urgent necessity of at once framing the regulations applying to that Act, and this Council trusts that such regulations will include the conveyance of meat through streets in properly constructed vans, and also deal with the storage of meat upon barrows in market places." Certifying Officer in connection with the Export of Meat Products to Argentina, United States and Philippine Islands. In view of regulations made by the Argentine Government with regard to the sanitary inspection of meat foods, the Local Government Board made conditions to be complied with by traders in England and "Wales who prepare or pack meat foods for export to Argentina, and who desire that such exportations should be accompanied by an official attestation of precautions taken to safeguard the wholesomeness of the foods in question. Application was made to the Board by Messrs. C. & E. Morton, Millwall, for the designation of a Certifying Officer, under the regulations, and the Board stated that if the Council and Medical Officer assented they would be glad to designate the Medical Officer of Health as Certifying Officer for the Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to assent to the designation of the Medical Officer of Health as Certifying Officer for the Borough of Poplar in connection with the official certification of meat-food products intended for export to Argentina. The Local Government Board also received an application from Messrs. C. & E. Morton for the designation of a Certifying Officer in connection with the export of meat products to the United States of America and the Philippine Islands, and suggested that the Medical Officer of Health should be so designated. 158 The Council also approved the designation of the Medical Officer of Health as proposed. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR TO MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. At the end of the year there were 1,010 houses on the register. For Inspector's report see pages 246 and 249. Legal proceedings were instituted in seven instances, see pages 184 and 186. HOUSING. Accommodation for Persons Displaced (Educational Purposes). Proposed Sale of Housing Land (London County Council). National Housing Congress. Housing and Town Planning Bill. Accommodation for Persons Displaced, The London County Council asked the Local Government Board to decide that a scheme for providing new dwellings to accommodate persons of the working classes to be displaced by certain school extensions was not necessary in view of housing provision already made by the Council and vacant accommodation in the neighbourhoods affected. Five houses in British Street and Cahir Street were proposed to be demolished and 42 persons would be displaced. The Local Government Board asked for the observations of the Council on the matter. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it was not necessary that special housing accommodation should be provided by the London County Council in respect of the premises in the Borough 159 proposed to be demolished, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the Local Government Board be so informed. The London County Council proposed to demolish Nos. 8 and 9, Coborn Street, for extension of Malmesbury Road School, and asked the Local Government Board to decide that a scheme for the provision of new dwellings to accommodate persons of the working class, who would be displaced, was unnecessary. The London County Council pointed out there were 600 rooms available within a quarter of a mile, and the 11 persons to be displaced would experience no difficulty in finding new accommodation. The Local Government Board forwarded copy of the application for the observations of the Borough Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion a scheme for re-housing the persons to be displaced was unnecessary, and recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the Local Government Board be so informed. Proposed Sale of Housing Land (London County Council). Notice of motion was given to move— "That this Council emphatically protests against the proposal now before the London County Council to sell or lease to private persons 200 acres of land which have been acquired by past Councils for the purpose of housing the people, to so do being a gross breach of trust, the London County Council having no mandate from the people to do so. That copies of this resolution be forwarded to the London County Council, the members of the London County Council, and the President of the Local Government Board." National Housing Congress. Together with the Chairman of the Public Health and Housing Committee (Mr. Councillor A. H. Darby), the Medical Officer attended the National Housing Congress, held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, on the 4th and 5th May. The Congress was convened by the National Housing Reform Council, to discuss the provisions of the Housing and Town Planning Bill introduced into Parliament by the President of the Local Government Board. More than three hundred delegates and representatives attended the great Housing Congress to discuss the provisions of Mr. Burns's Housing 160 and Town Planning Bill. The measure was thoroughly discussed from every point of view, and important suggestions for amendment were made. The chair was occupied all day on Monday and on Tuesday afternoon by Sir John Dickson Poynder, Bart., M.P., Chairman of the Select Committee on Bural Housing, and on Tuesday morning by Alderman W. Thompson, Chairman of the National Housing Beform Council. Whilst the Congress approved of the general principles on which the Bill was founded it carried a large number of amendments. It almost unanimously approved of land purchase in connection with town planning schemes, and it was equally emphatic in supporting that to make it obligatory upon local authorities to obtain the consent of the Local Government Board before even proceeding with the preparation of a town plan is quite superfluous and can only produce unnecessary delay. The following resolution was moved and seconded:— "This Congress welcomes the removal of the restriction on the period of repayment of loans from the Public Works Loans Commissioners (Clause 3, b and c), but in view of the terms accorded to Irish local authorities (under the Irish Labourers Act, 1906), this Congress is of opinion that the Treasury should lend money for housing purposes at the lowest rate at which the Treasury can itself borrow: — (a) To local authorities up to the full amount of the security; (b) To public utility societies up to 75 per cent, of the security. The following amendment was moved:— "That in order to encourage local authorities to provide improved housing accommodation for the working classes, apart from street widenings, improvements, or town planning schemes, an amendment should be inserted providing that, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board to the plans, rents to be charged, scheme, and to a proper audit of the housing accounts, a grant should be made to cover either the whole, or such a portion as the Local Government Board may determine, of the annual deficiency (if any) arising upon each completed year's revenue account, and now chargeable to the local rates, upon the condition that when all outgoings have been defrayed, and a surplus arises the whole of such surplus shall be utilised each year in the repayment of the sums granted, without 161 interest, and that the Government should create a special Housing Fund for the purpose." After discussion, the amendment was put to the meeting and defeated, only 25 voting for it. A second amendment was moved in the following terms:— "That Clause 3 should be amended to provide that loans by Public Works Loans Commissioners shall be advanced, if required, upon application by any authority carrying out the provisions of this Act." This amendment was also defeated. A further amendment was moved as follows:— "That Clause 5 should provide that the expense incurred in the laying-out and the construction of any streets or roads may be made from the General or District Rate, but such contribution shall only be made after approval by the Local Government Board, and that this expense should also apply to, and power be given to local authorities to alter, widen, close, or deviate existing streets in an housing area." This amendment was likewise defeated. Another amendment was brought forward, which ran as follows:— "That after Par. (b) in Resolution I., the following words be added: "and that local authorities should be assisted by a subsidy, if necessary, from the Exchequer, to build houses under Part III. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, at low rentals of from Is. 9d. to 3s. per week." The amendment was negatived, and the original resolution carried. The following resolution was moved:— "This Congress strongly approves of the provisions for the issue of closing and demolition orders by local authorities (Clauses 13 and 14), and further approves of Clauses 26 and 27 as giving a much needed power to local authorities to insist upon dwellings being kept 'reasonably fit for human habitation'; this Congress, however, urges, that Clause 26 should apply to all dwellings not exceeding £40 rental in London, and £26 rental elsewhere." 162 The resolution was carried. The Town Clerk of Edinburgh moved as an addendum that power should be sought such as they possessed in Edinburgh. On a show of hands this was lost by 64 to 63. The following addendum was moved and seconded:— "That local authorities shall have power to make a demolition order in cases where they have made a closing order against the property and that property has not been put into a sanitary condition within three months." This was agreed to. A third resolution was moved as follows:— "This Congress approves the provisions for securing— (a) Improved powers of entry for purposes of inspection (Clause 32); (b) The appointment by every County Council of a Medical Officer of Health under Section 17 of the Local Governmant Act; but this Congress is of opinion that a grant should be made from the central Exchequer to County and County Borough Councils to enable them, in co-operation with minor local authorities, to make a quinquennial survey and prepare a register of dwellings, in accordance with the unanimous recommendations of the Select Committee on Rural Housing (Report, pars 53 and 54)." The resolution, on being put, was carried unanimously. A fourth resolution was moved as follows:— "This Congress approves of the provisions which secure— (a) That Part III. of the principal Act may be put into operation without formal adoption ; (b) That improved procedure shall be established for the acquisition of land for Part III. schemes ; 163 (c) That County Councils are given additional powers (Clauses 11 and 58); but this Congress is of opinion— (1) That County Councils should be local authorities, with concurrent powers (as in the case of London), for the purposes of Part III. and for town planning ; (2) That the power to supply land with cottages under the Housing Acts should not be limited to a quantity 'not exceeding half an acre '; (3) That provision should be made for securing a more effective inter-working with the Small Holdings Act (1907).'' The main resolution having been carried by two to one, it was moved to add :— "That this Congress urges the Government to allow local authorities to prescribe bye-laws fixing the minimum cubic capacity of living and bed rooms in houses proposed to be built in their area, and also to adopt a bye-law to compel the adoption of a minimum area of at least 144 square feet in one room of every new house." The addendum was then adopted. A further addendum was moved:— " That as some local authorities allow their building bye-laws to be not carried out in their entirety, this Congress presses on the Government to take steps to secure the definite execution of such bye-laws, and that power be given to four inhabitants to call the attention of the Local Government Board to neglect in administration. This Congress is also of opinion that all local authorities should now be required to adopt bye-laws containing at least the minimum requirements of the model bye-laws of the Local Government Board." This was seconded and adopted, with the exception of the last sentence. The following addendum was moved "That this Congress is of opinion that in regard to the rural 164 districts, a clause should be inserted in the Bill to make the tenure of the labourer's cottage more secure than it is at present." The addendum was formally seconded and adopted. It was moved:— "That both rural and urban Medical Officers of Health should not be dismissed without the consent of the Local Government Board." Several delegates objected to the proposal, and the previous question was carried with practical unanimity. It was moved:— "This Congress welcomes the town planuing and land purchase clauses, but— (1) Strongly urges that the area in respect of which town planning schemes may be made should comprise all land within the area of local authorities or in the neighbourhood of their area, and should not be limited to 'land which appears likely to be used for building purposes '; (2) Is of opinion that the preliminary permission for a local authority to prepare town plans for land within its own area is not necessary. Further, this Congress is of opinion that the Local Government Board should prescribe provisions empowering local authorities— (a) To limit the number of houses or rooms to the acre; and (b) In exchange for the dedication by landowners of open spaces or other concessions beneficial to the health and amenity of the community, to relax limitation and to vary bye-laws or other conditions which prevent economical road construction and cottage building." It was moved, by way of amendment:— "To leave out V. (1) and (2), and substitute the following:— "This Congress, being of opinion that improvements in the laying-out and extension of towns can best be secured by enactments 165 applying to the provinces the principles of the London Building Acts, and by increasing the powers of local authorities to make appropriate bye-laws, especially as regards provision, when necessary, of facilities for the prolongation and connection of any new streets, sanctioned by such authorities, recommends that Part II. of the Bill be withdrawn, and that steps be taken as soon as possible for amending the law in the direction indicated." The amendment was then put, four voting for it and most of the rest against. Sections (1) and (2) of the resolution were then carried separately. The second part of the resolution [(a) and (b)] was then put and carried with two dissentients. It was then moved as an addendum:— "After the word 'acre' in Par. V. (Sub-sec. a of the resolution), to add and specify class of houses to be erected, to prohibit, if deemed desirable in the interest of the district, the erection of any factory, workshop, or business premises." The motion was then put, and defeated by 67 votes to 65. It was then moved:— "To add to the resolution— "(c) To compel every builder of a dwelling or dwellings to contribute without payment a proportion of his land for a playground or playgrounds and other open spaces, deemed necessary by the local authority, and for a street of the width decided on by the local authority, provided always that no builder shall be compelled to contribute without payment more land for these purposes than he would have been compelled by the bye-laws hitherto in force in the local authority to provide for his proportion of a street." Addendum was put, and carried by a large majority. A further addendum was moved in the following terms :— "That it is expedient that local authorities should be empowered to prepare and, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, to enforce schemes for laying-out streets or roads and for m 166 securing sanitary conditions in the buildings to be erected upon the local authorities' area and in the neighbourhood thereof to which the schemes respectively apply without being compelled to acquire land or incur expenditure in forming the roads, drains, &c." The addendum was carried. An addendum was moved which ran as follows: "To add after Clause (a) and (b)" To require an open space in every given area." and on the words, "if not otherwise provided for" being inserted, it was carried. A final addendum to the resolution was moved as follows:— "Further, this Conference considers that a new sub-section should be added to Clause 50, providing that 'where the capital value of any land shall have been ascertained for purposes of taxation, the same shall be taken to be its value if purchased by any local authority, subject to such addition for severance or other special damage as the arbitrator may decide.' " The addendum was carried. The following resolution was moved : "That this Congress, recognising the vital importance to the nation of adequate housing administration, is of opinion that under the Bill definite duties should be placed upon the Local Government Board, as well as on the local authorities, and in order to secure the effective performance of such new duties a special housing department should be created, to inform, encourage and assist local authorities in their efforts for housing reform. "Further, this Congress is of opinion that greater liberty and freedom of initiative in constructive action should be granted by Parliament to local authorities." The resolution was carried with four dissentients. The following addendum was moved:— "That this Congress expresses its regret that the Government 167 have made the present Bill a Bill by way of reference, and hope that on an early date they will introduce a Bill to codify and simplify the Acts relating to the Housing of Working Classes." The addendum was carried. A further addendum in the following terms was moved :— "That this Congress is of opinion that local authorities should be given a right of appeal to Parliament against any order of the Local Government Board made under Clauses 12 and 51, and objected to by such local authority." On a show of hands being taken, the voting on the proposed addendum resulted in a tie—31 for and 31 against. The Chairman gave his easting vote against the addendum, which was accordingly defeated. The Chairman finally moved the following resolution:— "That, subject to the suggestions made in the resolutions passed, this Congress heartily welcomes the Housing Bill, and trusts that it will be passed into law during the present session of Parliament." The resolution was adopted. The Housing and Town Planning Bill. To amend the law relating to the housing of the working classes, to provide for the making of town planning schemes, and to make further provision with respect to the appointment and duties of county Medical Officers of Health, and to provide for the establishment of Public Health and Housing Committees of County Councils. Presented by Mr. Burns supported by Mr. Solicitor-General for Scotland, Mr. Attorney-General, and Mr. Masterman. Mr. Burns formally presented it for first reading on Wednesday, February 17th, 1909. There are four parts of the Bill. One part deals with the housing of the working classes, another with town planning, and the third makes further provision with respect to the appointment and duties of county Medical Officers of Health, and also provides for the establishment of Public Health and Housing Committees of County Councils. Included in the housing part of the Bill is a clause defining the duty of local authorities with regard to closing dwelling houses unfit for human 168 habitation. The duty is imposed on them to cause to be made from time to time an inspection of their district for the purpose of ascertaining whether any dwelling house therein is in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation. If on the representation of the Medical Officer of Health or of any officer of the authority, or on information given, it appears to them that any dwelling house is in such a state, it becomes their duty to make an order prohibiting the use of the dwelling house for human habitation until in their judgment it is rendered habitable. A new sub-section embodying important hygienic proposals is embodied in the clause. Quoted in extenso it runs thus:— "A room habitually used as a sleeping place, the surface of the floor of which is more than three feet below the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room, shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to be so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit for human habitation, if the room either (a) is not sufficiently protected against dampness, effluvia, or exhalation; or (b) is not sufficiently ventilated; or (c) is not in every part thereof at least seven feet in height from floor to ceiling; or (d) is not, to the extent of one foot at least in height, above the level of the surface of the part of the street adjoining or nearest to the room; or (e) has not one or more windows opening directly into the external air, with a total area clear of the sash frames equal to at least one-tenth of the floor area of the room, and so constructed that one-half at least of each window of the room can be opened, the opening in each case extending to the top of the window; or (f) is not provided along the entire frontage thereof with an open area properly paved, at least four feet wide in every part thereof: Provided that in the area there may be placed steps necessary for access to the room, and over and across the area there may be steps necessary for access to any buildings above the room, if the steps are so placed in each case as not to be over or across any external window." WATER CERTIFICATES. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 36, 42, 44, and 64, Wrexham Road; 708, 710, and 712, Old Ford Road; 4, Ridgdale Street; caretaker's cottage and office, Towler & Son, Carpenters Road; 9 to 12, Charteris Terrace, East Ferry Road ; St. Edmund's School, Millwall. 169 TENEMENT HOUSES. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, 7 Edw. 7 ch. clxxv. Water Supply. London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1909, Proposed Accommodation for Storage of Pood. Notices were served upon the owner of Rothbury Buildings, Bow, to provide on the storey or one of the storeys in which the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of each family occupying such house are situate a sufficient provision for the supply of water for domestic purposes. The buildings are now closed, see page 175. London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1909. Part IV.—Accommodation for Storage of Pood. The Borough Council may enforce provision of suitable and sufficient accommodation for storage of food in any rooms or lodgings in a tenement house, in the separate occupation of a family. ACCOMMODATION FOR COOKING FOOD IN TENEMENT HOUSES. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. 7. If at any time it appears to any sanitary authority that in any tenement house within their district sufficient and suitable accommodation for the cooking of food is not provided for the use of each family occupying such house on the storey or one of the storeys in which are situate the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of such family such sanitary authority may cause notice to be served on the owner of such house requiring him within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice to provide sufficient and suitable accommodation for the purpose aforesaid, and any owner failing to comply with any such requirement within the period prescribed in the notice shall be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings and to a daily penalty not exceeding twenty shillings : Provided that this section shall not apply to any tenement house used or occupied as such before the passing of this Act. 170 SEWERAGE, DRAINAGE AND SEWER VENTILATION. Hutchings Wharf; Rigden Street; Sewer Ventilation, Proposed Shafts Northern Outfall; Flooding, Severe Storm. In the memorandum issued by the Local Government Board to the Medical Officers of Health respecting their Animal Reports, it is stated that the Local Government Board desired to obtain, through the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, information of particular changes of condition that occur by the action of the Local Authority, and one of the subject matters which is required to be reported upon is the condition of sewer and house drains. Hutchings Wharf. The Borough Surveyor reported that an old brick sewer at Hutchings Wharf, Hutchings Street, Millwall, was in a dilapidated condition, and practically had no fall. New buildings were in course of erection which it was proposed should be connected to this sewer. The Borough Surveyor recommended that a pipe sewer be constructed. Rigden Street. The Borough Surveyor recommended the opening up of Rigden Street sewer, and substitution of new pipes for the existing defective brick sewer which was reported to have collapsed in several places. Sewer Ventilation, Proposed Shafts Northern Outfall. The Public Health and Housing Committee on various occasions called the attention of the London County Council to the nuisance arising from the open surface ventilators to the northern outfall sewer, and urged that the construction of tall brick shafts over the ventilators should be undertaken. The London County Council Committee replied that they regretted they were unable to adopt the proposal. 171 The Public Health and Housing Committee were strongly of opinion steps should be taken by the London County Council to remedy the nuisance by constructing shafts as suggested, and recommended the Council that further representations be made to the London County Council, urging the construction of ventilating shafts as proposed, and the members representing the Borough on the County Council be requested to support such representations. The following letter was received from the London County Council:— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W., 3rd December, 1908. Sir,—A Committee of the Council have had before them your letter of the 11th ultimo, containing the suggestion that tall brick shafts should be erected over the open ventilators to the northern outfall sewer. In reply, I am to say that the Committee, after carefully considering the proposal, regret that they are unable to see their way to adopt it. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, G. L. GOMME, Clerk to the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. In view of the nuisance arising from the open ventilators in question the Public Health and Housing Committee directed the London County Council be again urged to construct shafts as proposed, similar to that already provided on the London County Council sewer in Devons Road. Flooding—Severe Storm. On the occasion of the storm on the evening of the 4th June, the basements of several premises in the Borough were temporarily flooded, due to the surcharge of the London County Council sewers, which prevented the local sewers discharging thereinto. The Borough Surveyor communicated with the Engineer of the London County Council on the matter, and the Engineer pointed out that the rainfall in Poplar on the 172 day in question was the most severe that had occurred in the records of the County Council, the actual gauge reading at the Isle of Dogs pumping station being 117 inches of rain in 30 minutes. He stated that it is quite impossible for any system of sewers to deal with such a downpour of rain in that time. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Reconstruction by Council. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill—Position of the Bill. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises either on account of there being no plans or the plans not being in order:—55 to 63, Devas Street; 393-5, West Ferry Road and 1a, British Street; 2a, 2, 4, and 6, Athol Street; 3 and 5, Duff Street; 7, Harrow Lane; 139-141, Duff Street; 58 to 64, Guildford Road; 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19, Colin Street; 14 to 26, Upper North Street; 85-87, Bow Road; 89, Bow Road; 59 and 61, Bygrove Street; 1a, 3, and 9, Naval Row; 94 and 96, St. Leonard's Road; 212 to 219, Leven Road; 56 to 62, Reeves Road; 17, Colin Street and 43 to 49, Empson Street; 30 to 33, Egleton Road. Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill. At the Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, held at the St. Pancras Town Hall on the 24th June, 1907, it was referred to a Committee of the Conference to prepare, for presentation to the President of the Local Government Board, a Petition or Draft Bill dealing with the subject of combined drainage. The Executive Committee, comprising delegates representing Battersea, Fulham, Greenwich, Hackney, Kensington, Lambeth, Paddington, St. Pancras and Woolwich, met on several occasions at the Westminister City Hall, through the kind permission of the Town Clerk, and drafted a short Bill. A second conference of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils was then held at the St. Pancras Town Hall, on the 6th December, 1907, to receive the Committee's report and Draft Bill. On the 31st January, 1908, Mr. W. H. Dickinson, the Member of 173 Parliament for North St. Pancras, was approached, and was asked to take charge of the Bill and to bring it before the House of Commons. Mr. Dickinson kindly replied on the 1st February that he would be very happy to take charge of the Bill. The Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on the 5th March by Mr. Dickinson and was read a first time. The Bill is set out below in extenso:— METROPOLITAN SEWERS AND DRAINS BILL. MEMORANDUM. The object of this Bill is to amend the state of the law relating to combined drainage. There are two kinds of combined drain, the "combined drain" which in law is a "drain," and the "combined drain" which in law is a "sewer." The former is repairable by the private owner; the latter by the public authority. In the opinion of builders, owners, and local authorities, combined drains were originally constructed as drains, and were mutually regarded as such until the retrospective case of Travis v. Uttley (1893), the effect of which has been to convert thousands of drains, which had been privately owned and privately maintained, into sewers vested in the local authorities, and maintainable at the expense of the ratepayers. The state of the law has been described by the Lord Chief Justice, who said in a recent decision, "It seems to me, as I have before pointed out, to be essential that there should be some amendment of the law upon this subject. The state of the authorities is such that it appears to be impossible either to reconcile the various decisions or to deduce from them any logical rule." Several provincial authorities, notably West Ham, Croydon, Carlisle, Leyton, Wood Green, Sheffield, etc., have been successful in obtaining the powers which the Metropolitan local authorities ask for by this Bill. 174 [8 Edw. 7.] Metropolitan Sewers and Drains. A Bill to amend the Metropolis Management Acts with respect to Sewers and Drains. Be it enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:— 1. In and for the purposes of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act or Acts amending the same, the word "drain" shall be deemed to include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act, with which two or more houses, buildings, or premises are, at the date of the passing of this Act, or may at any time thereafter be connected, or which is used or capable of being or intended to be used for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses, buildings, or premises directly or indirectly to any sewer which has been approved as such by the Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of Works, or the London County Council, but shall not include any sewer so approved as aforesaid. 2. This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amendment Act, 1908, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same. On the back of the Bill appear the following names:—Mr. Dickinson, Sir William Bull, Mr. Bowles, Sir William Collins, Mr. Crooks, Mr. Timothy Davies, Sir George Far dell, Mr. Claude Hay, Sir Henry Kimber, Earl Percy, Sir Albert Spicer, and Mr. Waterlow. The Boroughs represented are St. Pancras, Hammersmith, Lambeth Woolwich, Fulham, Paddington, Shoreditch, Wandsworth, Kensington, Hackney and Islington. Position of the Bill. The Bill was down for second reading every night in the last Session of Parliament from the 12th October to 21st December, but was not reached. The Bill has therefore been before the House since March 5th, 175 1908, and it seems that unless the Government take it up there is little prospect of the Bill becoming law. The Bill will be reintroduced during the coming Session, and I understand it is suggested to Mr. Dickinson, who has charge of the Bill, that strong representations should be made to the individual members of the Cabinet. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890-1. Cap. 8, Sect. 26 (2). REVENUE ACT, 1903. 3 Edw. 7, Cap. 46. Rothbury Buildings, Bow—Cancelling Certificate. Rothbury Buildings, Bow, were found to be in a most insanitary condition; there was also no proper and sufficient supply of water* with no adequate washing accommodation. The Public Health and Housing Committee directed that the Board of Inland Revenue be informed of the facts and that exemption under the Acts should no longer exist. The Board of Inland Revenue thereupon treated the certificate as cancelled. At the time of writing this report the buildings are unoccupied, documents as to the defects having been served on the owner. • See page 169. 176 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904. Verminous Rooms* and Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the "Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are " in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the bye-laws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. The above procedure saves a large amount of time, as under the London County Council (General Powers) Act a certificate must be given by the Medical Officer of Health, who would have to inspect every room. However, eleven certificates had to be given to the Public Health and Housing Committee. During the year 213 rooms have been cleansed of vermin:— Poplar South Division 2 West Combined Division 24 East Combined Division 12 Bromley Central Division 15 Bromley North Division 50 Bow West Division 15 Bow East Division 23 Houses let in lodgings 72 No summonses were applied for. * For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons see page 87. 177 Licensed Premises' Urinals. Four notices were served under Section 22, calling upon the owners to provide proper doors to the urinals attached to their licensed premises. THE INCORPORATED SOCIETY FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF VERMIN. The Incorporated Society for the Destruction of Vermin desired that notice should be given them of cases of verminous dwellings in the Borough in order that they might, in conjunction with the sanitary officers, efficiently cleanse such places. It is intended to divide London into districts and allocate to each a number of men to strip and distemper walls, cleanse ceilings and floors, fumigate rooms and destroy verminous bedding (bedding, etc., destroyed being replaced by the Society). The men employed would be drawn from the unemployed registered by London Distress Committees and other bodies. The Society is a strong one influentially supported, and the Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion every facility should be offered them to carry out the scheme, and recommended the Council that the Society for the Destruction of Vermin be notified of cases of verminous houses occurring in the Borough. INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS. The drinking water supplies, storage tanks, lavatories, and water closets of the schools were inspected, and any defects found were notified to the London County Council. 178 EDUCATION (ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS) ACT, 1907. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— BOROUGH OF LEWISHAM. Town Hall, Catford, S.E. 14th March, 1908. Dear Sir,— I beg to inform you that this Council have had under consideration the question of the medical inspection of children in public elementary schools, under Section 13 of the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907, together with the Memorandum dated the 22nd November, 1907, issued by the Board of Education on the subject. This Council have received a report from their Public Health Committee upon the matter, and on their recommendation have arrived at the following conclusions with reference thereto: — (1) That it is desirable "on the grounds of efficiency, economy and harmony, that the work of medical inspection of school children under the provisions of the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, should be carried out in intimate conjunction with public health authorities" as set out in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Memorandum of the Board of Education, and that the Cities of London and Westminster and the Metropolitan Boroughs should for this purpose be made the units of administration. (2) That it is desirable that the Medical Officers of Health of the Cities of London and Westminster and the Metropolitan Boroughs be appointed (by the London County Council) as the local administrative officers, co-operating for this purpose with the Medical Officer of Health for the County of London. 179 (3) That it is desirable that any necessary executive assistants should be appointed by the London County Council and allocated to the Cities of London and Westminster and the Metropolitan Boroughs, such assistants to be under the control of, and to receive instructions from, and report directly to the Medical Officers of Health. (4) That it is desirable that the Medical Officers of Health should report directly to the London County Council on all matters relating to the administration of the Act. In accordance with the direction of this Council these conclusions have been communicated to the London County Council, and they were requested to adopt and incorporate the same in any scheme to be prepared by them under the Act referred to. The Board of Education were also communicated with. I am now directed to ask that the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar will be good enough to take the matter into consideration and that they will support the action of this Council. I am, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, EDWARD WRIGHT, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee concurred in the conclusions of the Lewisham Borough Council, and recommended the Council that the action of the Lewisham Borough Council be supported. 180 SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION, OVERCROWDING, &C., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Lead Street. Church Avenue. Hawgood Street Area and Brickfield Street, and Cul-de-Sac Mellish Street. In one case where a w.c. pan and trap were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builder was written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings would be instituted against him for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work has been found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. In 1904 the journals of the Sanitary Inspectors were examined from the date of the coming into operation of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and lists were compiled (which involved a large amount of work) of houses not inspected, and also those inspected with the number of inspections made. Lists of houses not inspected were given to the Inspectors with instructions to inspect such premises as soon as possible. The inspection of these premises is now completed. The inspections took a long time as many defective drainage systems had been discovered, which had to be rectified before further inspections were made and fresh drainage work created. 181 List of Sanitary Works carried out in the Metropolitan Borough of Popular, from January 1st, 1908, to December 31st, 1908.* Poplar South.

Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting three cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 30 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there wore in connection with private houses, 33 of overcrowding abated; one case of overcrowding was abated in a workroom (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 245); 123 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, pages 246-248). In no instance were legal proceedings instituted. General. 8,976 communications were received, and 850 complaints (including 92 smoke) as to nuisances were made. Lead Street. The attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee was called to the insanitary condition of Lead Street, Millwall, a private street not in charge of the Council. The Committee were of opinion the owners should be required to make up the street, and in default that the necessary work should be done by the Council at the owners' expense. A request on behalf of the owners to be allowed to drain the street on to adjacent land was not granted, a sufficient fall being obtainable to the West Perry Road sewer. Church Avenue. Representations were made to the Works Committee by the Public Health and Housing Committee as to the condition of Church Avenue, a passage-way connecting Brickfield Road and Gurley Street, which is not in charge of the Council. It was suggested the passage should be paved at the expense of the owners and thereafter maintained by the Council. The Council was liable for one-half the cost of paving, in respect of St. Andrew's Church which occupies one side of the passage and is exempt from charges in respect of paving apportionments. The Works Committee were not satisfied with the condition of the passage, and recommended the Council that Church Avenue be paved at the cost of the owners and the Council respectively. 183 Hawgood Street Area—Brickfield Road. Brickfield Road, Furze Street, Gale Street, and Hawgood Street were paved with asphalte paving. Cul-de-Sac off Mellish Street. The Public Health and Housing Committee reported that they had considered the dismissal by the Magistrate of a summons taken against the owner of a cul-de-sac off Mellish Street, to enforce proper drainage and repair of such place, which is in bad condition and drained into untrapped gullies. The proceedings were taken under Section 100 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855, and the effect of the decision is tha unless the freeholder is also the owner of the houses abutting no proceedings can be effective to compel owners to repair such places. The Committee were advised an appeal was not likely to be successful, and therefore directed no further legal action be taken in the matter. The Public Health and Housing Committee also requested the Works Committee to consider the desirability of arranging for the necessary work to be done by the Council at the place in question, and at other places in similar cases, the cost being apportioned upon the owners, and the Council thereafter accepting responsibility for maintenance. 184 185 Police Court Proceedings.

White Phosphorous Matches Prohibition Act, 1908. 8 Edw. 7, Cap. 42. " The object of this statute, which was introduced into the House of Commons by the Home Secretary, is to enable the Government to adhere to a convention which was approved at an International Conference on Labour Regulation, held at Berne in September, 1906. That convention —agreeing to prohibit the manufacture, importation, and sale of matches that contain white phosphorous—was signed at the time by the representatives of Germany, Denmark, France, Italy,. Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland; but His Majesty's Government was not then able to agree to the prohibition, for reasons explained in a memorandum (Cd. 3271) laid before Parliament in 1906. "For the better protection from necrosis of persons employed in factories where white phosphorous is used, it has recently been found necessary either to impose regulations more stringent than those hitherto in force, or to prohibit the use of white phosphorous altogether. After consultation with manufacturers, the latter course has been adopted, and with it follows, likewise, the prohibition of importation of such matches. "White phosphorous is not used in the manufacture of matches which strike only on a prepared substance. Substitutes for white phosphorous in the manufacture of "strike-anywhere" matches are in use, but are patented. By arrangement with the holders of the only patents which, to the knowledge of the Home Office, are being used in the industry in the United Kingdom, Section 4 has been inserted in the Act, making those patents available, on reasonable terms, to all manufacturers." (Paterson's Practical Statutes.) Children Act, 1908. See also page (20). 8 Edw. 7, Cap. 67. "This statute, while to a large extent consolidating—for it repeals and re-enacts the whole of no less than twenty-one Acts, as well as great part of many others—at the same time effects important amendments in the existing law. It deals with the protection of infants, children, and 189 young persons, with the punishment of juvenile offenders, and with reformatory and industrial schools. "Part I., relating to infant life protection, is practically a re-enactment with amendments of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897 (60 and 61 Vict., c. 57), which was itself in the nature of a consolidating statute. The most important changes made with respect to "baby-farming" are the application of the former provisions to the case of a single infant, and the extension of the age from five to seven years. Minor amendments are noticed in the notes to the sections. "Part II., relating to the prevention of cruelty to children and young persons, similarly re-enacts with amendments by far the greater part (though not the whole) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1904 (4 Edw. 7, c. 15). It also contains several new provisions, among which may be specially mentioned: a penalty on the suffocation of an infant under three by a drunken person in the same bed with it (Section 13); a penalty on exposing a child under seven to the risk of burning from an open fire (Section 15); a penalty on allowing children or young persons between four and sixteen to be in a brothel (Section 16); a penalty on causing, encouraging, or favouring the seduction or prostitution of a girl under sixteen (Section 17) ; a power to bind over a person having the custody of a girl under sixteen to exercise proper care (Section 18). Power is also given to the Home Secretary to inspect private charitable institutions for the reception of children or young persons. "Part III, relating to juvenile smoking, introduces some novel principles in a rather complicated fashion. It is made an offence to sell cigarettes (which includes tobacco) and cigarette papers to a person apparently under sixteen; and the duty is imposed upon constables and park-keepers to seize any cigarettes or cigarette papers in the possession of such young person found smoking in a public place, and to search him (if a boy). Special provision is made for the regulation of automatic machines for the sale of cigarettes. It may be observed here that cigars are apparently included, but pipes certainly not. "Part IV., relating to reformatory and industrial schools, is in the main a combined re enactment of the Reformatory Schools Act, 1866 (29 and 30 Vict., cap. 117), and the Industrial Schools Act, 1866 (29 and 30 Vict., c. 118), with the amendments introduced by subsequent legislation. The new provisions are neither numerous nor important. The only one that need be mentioned here is that (Section 74) which prescribes the duties and powers of local authorities with respect to the maintenance, etc., of inmates of certified schools. 190 "Part V., relating to juvenile offenders, is for the most part new though some of the provisions are re-enacted, with amendments, from the Youthful Offenders Act, 1901 (1 Edw. 7, c. 20). Special juvenile police courts are to be established, and also a system of registered places of detention for children and young persons. All juvenile offenders are, as a general rule, to be admitted to bail by the police, and are, in any case, to be kept from association with adults. The attendance at court of the parent or guardian is, as a general rule, to be required; and the parent or guardian may be ordered to pay damages or give security even when the juvenile offender is not himself convicted. No child (under fourteen) may be sentenced to penal servitude or imprisonment; nor may any young person (under sixteen) be sentenced to penal servitude or to imprisonment except when of an unruly or depraved character. Sentence of death is not to be pronounced against any child or young person, but for heinous crimes they may be sentenced to an indeterminate period of detention. "Part VI., contains some important miscellaneous provisions of a general nature. Power is given to clear the court when a child or young person is giving evidence in cases affecting decency or morality. No child or young person is allowed to be in court during the trial of other persons. Penalties are imposed on the purchase of old metals from a person under sixteen, on the taking of pawns from a person under fourteen, on vagrants preventing children from receiving education, and on any one giving intoxicating liquor to a child under five. Children (under fourteen) are to be excluded altogether from the bar of licensed premises. Special precautions must be taken for the safety of children at entertainments, when the number of children exceeds 100 and the accommodation for them is upstairs. Finally, there are provisions for the cleansing of verminous children who attend a public elementary school, and a penalty is imposed upon the parent, etc., who allows his child to require such cleansing a second time.

I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Fred R Wm -alegander. Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. April, 1909. 193 Report of Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1908. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my nineteenth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending 31st December, 1908, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 1,196 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 281 Do. on house-to-house visitation 122 Do. Canal Boats 59 Re-inspections 1,947 Making a total of 3,605 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,658 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 33.95 per cent. of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 543 written intimations, 264 statutory, and 6 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 1 case it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating two attendances at the police-court to ensure enforcement. House-to-House Visitation. The house-to-house inspection comprised the whole of the houses in the under-mentioned roads and streets— Beale Place.

Baker's Alley. Comboss Road. Wyke Road. Rothbury Road. Monier Road. Eliza Place. Allanmouth Road. Smeed Road. L.C.C. Schools. Smoke Nuisances. Only one case of smoke nuisance occurred in the district arising from without the district. Where nuisances have occurred within the 200 district intimation and notice have been served and the nuisance abated thereon, with two exceptions necessitating recourse to legal proceedings. No smoke nuisance presented itself under the Highways and Locomotives Act. Canal Boats Acts and Regulations. Under the Canal Boats Acts and Regulations 25 boats have been examined. Of these 16 were registered and 9 non-registered. All the registered canal boats, with one exception, were found in fair condition and in compliance with the Acts and Regulations. In the case of one registered canal boat the name on boat was not sufficiently legible. An intimation to the owner was immediately complied with. No contravention of the Acts was discovered on any of the nonregistered barges. Demolitions. Three shops, Nos. 728, 730, 732, Old Ford Road, have been demolished and the site cleared for the erection of six cottages. Unsound Food. The following unsound foods were dealt with during the year.— Twelve cases and eleven half cases of eggs. Twenty-five tins of blown condensed milk. One bushel of apples. One box of skate wings. One box of plaice. One sack of cocoanuts. One case of rabbits. Each of these parcels of food were condemned and destroyed. One hundred and six 21b. boxes and 141bs. of loose figs unfit for food and exposed for sale in a public market place were seized and a condemnation order obtained and the figs destroyed, followed by the issuing of a summons against the vendor. At the police court hearing the defendant was committed for trial at Sessions. 201 Offensive Businesses. The new regulations governing offensive businesses came into force on November 25th, 1907. The fat melters in the district have been required to conduct their businesses strictly in conformity thereto. The necessary alterations to premises and plant are not yet completed. Verminous Booms. 47 verminous rooms have been cleansed under the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces have been visited and found generally satisfactory, and any nuisances arising within these premises have been abated on the service of intimation. Homework. The outworkers, who are all boot and shoe operatives, have been visited twice during the year, and the premises of each examined for nuisances and sanitary defects. The workrooms were mostly found in a fair condition, and any defects in the premises were remedied by the owner or occupier on a notice being served. Milkshops and Cowsheds, Food Preparation, etc. The milkshops and cowsheds have given no cause for complaint; the cowsheds were limewhited and cleansed twice during the year, in accordance with the provisions of the Dairy and Cowsheds orders, and the milk vessels and measures of the various milk vendors were not unsatisfactory. The places where foodstuffs are prepared have been periodically visited. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. On visiting the ice cream makers and vendors during the season, the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902 was apparently care, fully complied with. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts fifty-two varied samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analyses. Four on analysis were found to be adulterated—one only sufficiently to require the vendor to be cautioned by the Public Health and Housing Committee, whilst in the cases of the remaining three, summonses were 202 issued against the vendors. Particulars of adulterated samples and results of proceedings are appended. Butter.—Containing 72.0 per cent, of foreign fat. Summons issued, but offender absconded before service was effected.

Under your instructions 52 samples of food stuffs have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst. The undermentioned articles were bought, viz.:— Milk, 20; butter, 17; coffee, 2; cocoa, 3; margarine, 2; vinegar, 3; jallap, 1; pepper, 2; mustard, 1; arrowroot, 1. The result of the analyses of above samples showed that the articles were genuine. Factories, Workshops, Workplaces and Outworkers. During the year the premises upon the Register have been periodically inspected, and where necessary, for sanitary purposes, notices have been duly served upon the responsible persons, and the nuisances were abated thereon. Milk Shops. There are 48 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. 208 Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation; I find that in some of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed slaughter houses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Ofttimes a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are seven fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public. Bake-Houses. There are 20 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 11 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean. Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small seale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period visits are often made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored over night is particularly investigated. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. 209 Unsound Food. During the year varied assortments of food stuffs have been surrendered by the owners as being unfit for food. Certificates were given where the articles were destroyed. On Thursday, 28th June, 1908, 1 ton 2cwt. of beef was seized and taken before the Magistrate, who condemned it at once, and on 3rd July, 1908, two men, who were concerned in the preparation for sale of this meat, were fined £20 and 5 guineas costs and £15 and 5 guineas costs respectively. During the month of December, 1908, unsound food was seen upon a stall in the Stepney district, and the Medical Officer of Health for that Borough, acting upon the information, visited the stall and seized a carcase of unsound beef. Smoke Nuisances. Many smoke nuisances have been notified, but only in one instance has the help of the Police Court been sought to abate the said nuisance. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive material is conveyed through the district. Only on two occasions were carriers cautioned, but the nuisances were very slight.

Inspection of District. I have inspected 1,468 premises, 1,030 in response to complaints of nuisances and notices received, 195 on account of infectious diseases notified, and 243 house-to-house visitations have been made. Of the 1,468 premises so dealt with 543 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the 925 premises (the remainder) defects and nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated statement page 181). In the supervision of same 3,561 re-inspections were made. House to House Inspections. Streets and Places. Bartlett Street. Dunbar Cottages. Bromley Cottages, Favonia Street. Church Avenue. Highland Street. * Twice inspected during year. 211 Sections of Streets. Abbott Road. Glencoe Street. Brunswick Road. Gurley Street. Bright Street. Leven Road. Byron Street. Railway Street. Colin Street. St. Leonard's Road. Devas Street. Spey Street. Ettrick Street. Wellington Street. Findhorn Street. Drains Tested. The drains of 297 premises were tested by means of the "rocket" smoke test. Thirty-two were proved defective, not gastight, whilst in 265 cases (the remainder) the result was negative. The water test has been applied to all new drainage work, and also where practicable to drains partially reconstructed or repaired. Drains newly Constructed and Reconstructed on old lines of Drainage. The drains of the under-mentioned premises were newly constructed or reconstructed on old lines, and also (where possible) intercepted, ventilated and furnished with means of access for cleansing purposes, in accordance with the London County Council's drainage bye-laws, and owners plans submitted and approved by Council:— Abbott Road, Nos. 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83.

The Council's new extension sewer in St. Leonard's Street in conjunction with newly-constructed combined systems at Nos. 2, 3, and 4, Bromley Lock Cottages and the "Sun" Flour Mills, have been the means of providing proper drainage in place of large cesspool, since abolished, which emptied into the River Lee. The work of reconstruction of "sewers" on private premises has been executed at the following :— Colin Street, Nos. 7, 9, 11. Devas Street, No. 55 connected with 57, 59, 61, 63.

Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act 1891, Metropolis Local Management Acts, London County Council General Powers Act, also Bye-laws, and Council's oivn Bye-laws. In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it has been found necessary 213 only in one instance to institute legal proceedings (see Smoke Nuisances), for in every other case the "intimations" and notices served for the abatement of nuisances, remedying of defects and infringements of byelaws respectively were complied with. Schools. The whole of the schools, which comprise the following:— Oban Street Council Schools, Bromley Hall Road Council Schools, Hay Currie Council Schools, (Entirely new, late Byron and Bright Street Schools), St. Leonard's Road Council Schools, Marner Street Council Schools, were inspected and found in fair sanitary condition; the drinking water supplies were drawn direct from Metropolitan Water Board mains; the storage tanks were periodically cleansed, only used for supplies to lavatories and closets. Inspection of Bakehouses, etc. I have, as instructed, made the periodical inspections of those (13) premises (three not in use), and, where required, served Extracts of Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, "intimations" and statutory notices for the necessary work of cleansing and repairs, which were respectively complied with. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops in division were inspected with respect to the cleanliness of the utensils used in the business and sanitary conditions generally of the premises. Where defects existed, "intimations" and statutory notices were served and nuisances abated. Public-House Urinals, etc. Attention has been given to the urinals that they were kept as clean as possible and furnished with the necessary fittings in compliance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. Verminous Booms. During the course of year 15 rooms were cleansed; it has not been P 214 necessary to enforce the provisions of the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1904. Eating Houses, Coffee Shops, Pork Butchers, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops. Inspections were several times made of the whole of the abovedescribed business premises and all necessary works of cleansing and repairs carried out, in some cases without service of "Intimations," etc. In no instance upon such visits was there cause for complaint so far as the condition of food. Cowsheds, Milk Sellers and Purveyors. The above (51) premises were frequently visited, the Public Health, etc., Office Registers corrected in the cases of those found non-registered through change of occupancy. The new proprietors were supplied with forms which were duly signed for the required alteration. Constant attention has been given to the enforcement of regulations relating to cleanliness of utensils, more particularly in compliance with the new London County Council (General Powers) Act relating to the sanitary conditions and surroundings under which milk was sold. Upon notice received for renewal of the licence of cowshed at 27, Abbott Road, the premises were again inspected, found in fair sanitary condition, consent was given to the application of the owner of this business to the London County Council.

I have, as directed by you, procured 65 samples of food, etc., which have been submitted to the Public Analyst (Mr. W. C. Young) for analysis; [8 were found to be so much adulterated that legal proceedings were taken ; the nature of articles, extent of adulteration and result of prosecutions were as follows:— Margarine.—Two summonses. "Samples served from parcels upon which there were no labels displayed. (1) No penalty, 23s. costs. (2) No penalty, 23s. costs. 216 Margarine.—-Sample served from parcel upon which there was no label displayed. Fined 40s. and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with 76.6 per cent. of foreign fat. Fined 20s. and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with 85.6 per cent, of foreign fat. Margarine.—Sample served in unstamped wrapper. Summonses against defendant in both cases were not served, gone away, whereabouts unknown. Adjourned, sine die. Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 33 per cent. Upon the evidence in support of "warranty," dismissed. Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 6.6 per cent. Upon adjourned hearing and result of Somerset House analysis, which fully confirmed extent of adulteration, but in consequence of the evidence in support of "warranty," dismissed, with £2 4s. costs allowed Council, with the decision"not to be a conviction." Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 13 per cent. Fined 10s., and 23s. costs. Altogether 18 samples of butter were obtained ; 2 were adulterated to the extent of 87.5 and 76.6 of foreign fat; one contained 1.0 per cent, excess in water (in which case the vendor was duly cautioned) and of the remainder 10 were found to contain boric acid preservative to the extent of 2—0.5; 1—0.47; 5—0.3; 1—0.2 ; and 1—0.1 per cent, respectively. Examination of Food. I have on several occasions, upon applications made by different itinerant vendors and tradesmen, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found "unsound, unwholesome and unfit for food," witnessed the same destroyed by the owners, certificates having been given to that effect. In no case was there any article of food "exposed for sale, deposited for sale, or preparation for sale" at the time of my visit to any premises in such condition as to justify seizure. Ice-Cream Makers and Vendors. All the premises where ice-creams have been made were visited, with 217 the object of detecting nuisances and any infringement of the London Council General Powers Act, 1902. The barrows were found to be legibly marked with names and addresses, etc., of vendors, also utensils, and the premises in question were clean and the ice-creams were wholesome. Factory and Workshops Inspections. Nuisances arising within the several factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., were dealt with. The whole of the ascertained business premises above described were inspected and found, in the majority of cases, to be in fair sanitary condition. In the remainder the work of repairs, cleansing, etc., has been carried out in compliance with "intimations," notices, etc. Smoke Nuisances. I have, where a nuisance has occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney other than belonging to a private dwelling-house, viz., factories, workshops, workplaces, etc., either on complaint or from my own personal observation, and in most cases the nuisances complained of were abated on the service of "intimations," and when necessary followed by statutory notices. In only one instance was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings against a firm in St. Leonard's Street, which resulted in a penalty of 40s. and 23s. costs inflicted for smoke nuisance. Canal Boats. I have inspected 39 barges, 38 non-registered and one registered Bailing barge, with the result that I have found the cabins fairly clean, and no infringement of regulations discovered. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E.

Sir,— I beg to lay before you my eighth Annual Report of the Sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith in the West Combined District during the past year, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. Inspection of Division. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds 1328 houses or other premises have been visited, 287 of these visits being on account of notifications of infectious diseases. This number shows a satisfactory decrease of 105 cases upon those of the previous year. Of the 287 cases 13 were notified from the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum, 9 from Langley House Receiving Home and 4 from the Poplar Union. House to House Inspections. These visits to the number of 132 were carried out in the undermentioned places, a large number of the drains proving unsound (some were very bad indeed) on being tested :— Canton Street. Northumberland Street. Ebenezer Place. Morant Street. Gough Street. Southill Street. Guildford Road. Suffolk Street. 219 High Street. Stainsby Road. Hill Place Street. Sturry Street. Plimsoll Street. Vesey Street. Park Street. Upper North Street. Woollett Street. Wade Street. Drain Reconstnoctions. The drains of 162 premises have been tested with either smoke or scent tests and in 128 cases found to be defective. During the year the drains of the following premises were taken out and reconstructed, and where practicable, in order to comply with the bye-laws of the London County Council and Borough Council were intercepted, ventilated and provided with mean3 of access for clearing in times of stoppages, the whole being thoroughly tested before being passed as sound :— Augusta Street, Tandem Yard Workshop.

These have been periodically inspected during the year, alterations in tenancy and new shops have been registered and the registers brought up to date. While inspecting these places, so far as possible attention has been paid to the food in preparation for cooking. They have been kept in fairly clean condition. Food Inspection at Wharf, etc. At Aberdeen Wharf, where food, skins, and potted meats are landed for transit, inspections have been made from time to time and everything found in good condition. The new regulations (as to food) of the Local Government Board will now make more inspections at this wharf imperative, and care will be exercised in working in conjunction with the Customs Officers in the case of any food being discovered which is unsound and dealing with the same under these regulations. The butchers' premises and stalls in Chrisp Street Market are 221 inspected at night times at week ends and sometimes on Sunday mornings. In each place where sausages and brawn are made special attention has been given. These places are conducted in a clean and careful manner, and are regularly cleansed. Several consignments of damaged wheat, rice, barley, etc., have been received into the district from the "docks" to be made up into poultry food. These have been watched through and dealt with. The following is a list of food destroyed during the year :— 1 leg of pork, 1 lump of bacon, 1 box of plaice, 1 box of tomatoes, 2 sacks of potatoes, 1 barrel of herrings, and many lots of damaged fruit in small quantities. Factory and Workshops. All those now on the register are regularly visited. "Notices" for cleansing have been served and complied with as required. No case of overcrowding or infectious disease in any workshop has been found to exist. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited at intervals. Changes of address have been noted and the registers altered accordingly. "Notices" to cleanse the rooms in some cases have been served and attended to. Bakehouses. The occupied bakehouses now number 25 and these have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily and the places conducted in a cleanly manner, everything at all times of visits being in order. 222 Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops and Slaughterhouses. These places are regularly visited during the year. The dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness and have, almost without exception, been kept in a good condition and the milkpans have been kept covered over to keep out dust, etc. In some cases where paraffin oil is sold it has been removed to a further distance from the milkpans, and in other cases to the rear of the premises. In three or four cases the sale has been stopped. All changes of tenancy in milkshops (which are of frequent occurrence) have been noted and the registers altered accordingly and brought up to date. The number of these on the registers at present are as follows:— Milkshops 72 Cowshed 1 Slaughterhouses 2 Canal Boats Acts. Canal boats that are "registered" under the Acts are visited as opportunities offer. They have been found, as regards the cabins where the occupants dwell, in an exceptionally clean and bright condition, and the cubic space allowed has been utilised to the fullest extent. The means of ventilation has been kept in order, and no cases of illness have been discovered. The "papers" have been produced and examined at times, and no overcrowding has occurred. Smoke Nuisances. All complaints from the London County Council have been dealt with and also my own observations. No legal proceedings were instituted as the " notices" which were served were immediately attended to. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. During the year 56 samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis, 7 of which proved to be adulterated badly. 223 Legal proceedings were instituted in each case. In some of the others different preservatives were found, and slight adulteration, causing three letters of caution to be sent to the vendors. In one case a summons was taken out for displaying an improper advertisement of margarine, contrary to the Act of 1907. Also in one case costs of £2 2s. were allowed against the Council, as the third portion of a sample was submitted to Somerset House, and the result proved different to the Public Analyst's certificate. Below is a list of "Samples" which were adulterated and the Analyst's report of same:— Margarine.—Containing 57.1 per cent. of butter fat (only 10 per cent. allowed). Summons withdrawn, and £2 2s. costs allowed defendant. Butter.—Adulterated with 76.6 per cent. of foreign fat. Second offence. Defendant fined £10 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in fat to extent of 15 per cent. Purchased from itinerant vendor, previous convictions proved. Defendant Company fined £5 and 23s. costs.

Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. 224 Milk.—Deficient in fat to extent of 46.6 per cent. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. All cases of infectious diseases notified during the year have been followed up in order to trace their origin if possible. One summons was taken out under the above Act against the owner of premises which had been empty a long time, and which were reoccupied after alterations had been carried out. There was no water supply to the premises, and the house had been occupied for about three months. The owner lived in the country, and the local police failed to serve the summons properly. The owner then in the meantime had the water put on, and no further action could be taken with success. Metropolis Local Management Acts, 1904. One summons under this Act was taken out against the owner of 11 houses in respect of improper drainage. The owner claimed the main drain as a "sewer," and the case went to Court. An abatement order with 1s. penalty was obtained and 23s. costs, and the work was then proceeded with. London County Council (General Powers) Act. Under this Act about 24 rooms have been successfully freed from vermin. No legal proceedings were necessary. The public-house urinals, as far as possible, have been kept in a cleanly state. Ice-Cream Regulations. All premises where ice-cream is made have been inspected and attention given to all the utensils used. In only one case was there ecessity for threatening proceedings before the cleansing was carried out. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOSEPH JOHNSON, E.P.C., Cert. San. Insp. Exam.

Inspection of Division. 1587 premises have been inspected, 1288 in response to complaints of nuisances, 137 on account of notifications of infectious diseases, and the remainder 162 house-to-house visitations. Of the 1587 premises so dealt with 921 were found to be in a fair sanitary condition, whilst the remainder, 666 premises, nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following sanitary works being executed (see tabulated list, page 181).

Warrington Place Stables. Bakehouses. By your instructions I have made periodical inspections of the bakehouses throughout the district (numbering sixteen), two of which are underground. The bi-annual cleansing in each case has been carried out satisfactorily. 228 The conditions in some cases necessitated service of "Intimations "with respect to the removal of sweepings from under the troughs and cleansing of utensils, etc. Food and Drugs Acts. Under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts 55 samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Five on analysis were found to be adulterated, 1 only sufficiently to require the vendor to be cautioned by the Public Health and Housing Committee, whilst in the cases of the remaining four summonses was issued against the vendors.

In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation (15) granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings in any case for the abatement of nuisances and non-compliance with the London County Council's and Poplar Borough Council's own bye-laws, as the nuisances were satisfactorily abated previous to applying for summonses. Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of premises where milk is stored and sold throughout the district with the objectof enforcing the regulations of the "Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885,"as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, particularly in respect to other articles kept for sale in the same premises; where old measures were found to be in use (porous) new ones have been provided, also where the counter pans were not properly covered instructions were given to have proper ones provided. Number of Milk Sellers 34 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 3 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 5 Number of Milk Sellers added to Register 1 Cowsheds and Slaughterhouses.

The slaughterhouses have been frequently visited, and at times when killing was in progress, and everything found satisfactory. The number of these premises now on the register are—cowsheds, 2; slaughterhouses, 3. Q 230 Overcrowding. During the year only four complaints of overcrowding were received; in each case the nuisances were abated after the service of intimation and statutory notices without recourse to legal proceedings. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. All the premises where ice cream is made have been inspected with the view of detecting nuisances, also any infringement of the London County Council's (General Powers) Act, 1902, Part viii. Each itinerant vendor's barrow and utensils have been inspected. In each case the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly affixed thereto, the ice cream and utensils were found to be satisfactory, no cause for action to be taken. Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-laws wider Section 50). The cisterns of the undermentioned buildings have been inspected during the year, and duly reported upon. Where covers were found to be defective, have since been amended, and made as far as practicable dustproof. Each cistern is so situated as to be free from pollution:— Adelaide Buildings 2, Baffins Buildings 2, Grosvenor Buildings 55, Hudson's Buildings 2, Melbourne Buildings 4, Montreal Buildings 4, Ontario Buildings 4, Ottawa Buildings 4, Prestage Buildings 6, Quebec Buildings 4, Council Buildings 5, St. Lawrence Cottages, Norfolk Street 14, Sydney Buildings 4, Toronto Buildings 2, Winnipeg Buildings 4. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, and notices to cleanse the premises have been served where required. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 20. During the year, on inspection, 12 rooms were found to be in a verminous condition. Intimations, also Statutory Notices where necessary were served, and the nuisances satisfactorily abated, without recourse to legal proceedings. 231 Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection has been given to these premises during the past year; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register. At each inspection particular attention was paid to the food being prepared, and in no instance was there cause for complaint; in some cases it was necessary to serve intimations and statutory notices respecting cleansing of the kitchens, etc. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops throughout my district have been inspected, the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of the articles used in the business being carefully noted. In some few cases intimations were required. Generally there is a marked improvement in these premises since they have been periodically inspected. Public House Urinals. The public house urinals have been under regular observation during the past year, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, Section 22, strictly enforced. Canal Boats. The inspection of canal boats was without particular incident during the year. Factory and Workshops Acts. The workshops, domestic workshops, workplaces and domestic workplaces in the district where male labour is employed have been inspected, the number employed in each case being checked, particularly in respect to overcrowding, the terms of the Acts relating thereto have been met with in response to intimation and statutory notices when necessary, and in no instance has occasion required legal proceedings. Smoke Nuisances. During the year the shafts throughout the district have been under careful observation, and in only two instances nuisances were detected. In these cases intimations and statutory notices have been 232 served, which has had the desired effect of abating the nuisances. No recurrence of the nuisances taking place, and no necessity to take legal proceedings. Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected in respect of unsound and unwholesome food, and during the past year there has been no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. During the year two cases of conger eels, ten baskets of cherries and one case of skate were brought to the Public Health Offices to be examined, and were found to be unfit for human food. After the usual precautions being taken to prevent any abuse of the condemnation, the usual certificate was given for the purpose of the purchaser getting his money from the wholesale vendor. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, etc. There is only one wharf in my district, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramornie Meat Co.), where food (all tinned) is landed, some of which is warehoused for other firms; the other, which is all examined, is for sale for both home consumption and export. A large amount goes into the Mercantile Service, all of which is examined and duly labelled by their officials before being taken away. The following number of tinned food (as set out below) on examination were found to be blown or otherwise damaged and consequently condemned as unfit for human food, which were set apart in a building adjoining these premises for the purpose of being sent to a fat boiler to be rendered down for fat. Proper precautions have been taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose. 293 61bs. beef, 323 21bs. beef, 21 llb. beef, 3 21bs. steak, 1 2ilb. steak, 9 21bs. sausages, 32 21bs. soup, 4 21bs. tongue, 2 llb. tongue, 1,043 61bs. mutton, 168 21bs. mutton, 32 l½lbs. chicken—making a total of 1,931 tins. The "Regulations under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907," give more power to your Inspecctor to inspect food imported into this country, and which will facilitate a more rigid examination, also supervision of the disposal of unsound food. 233 Public Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Public Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supply and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main, and the storage cisterns are cleansed periodically. The sanitary conveniences and offices were found to be in a clean and satisfactory condition. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts and Inspector of Canal Boats, East Combined Division. 234 Report of Inspector, South Division of Poplar.

The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. In one instance only was it necessary to resort to legal proceedings.* The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking, as the result of previous proceedings, rep sated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. * See Legal Proceedings under Public Health Acts. 238 Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division (Poplar South) number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. St. Edmund's Schools, West Ferry Road—Rebuilt, with new drains and up-to-date sanitary accommodation and offices. St. Luke's Schools, West Ferry Road.—Defect in automatic flushing apparatus—remedied on service of written intimation. Otherwise in fair condition. St. John's Schools, Roserton Street.—Drain was repaired and made watertight (during the year). Fair condition. Janet Street (New) L.C.C. Schools.—Fair condition. Millwall L.C.C. Schools.—Fair condition. Glengall Road L.C.C. Schools.—Fair condition. Cubitt Town L.C.C. Schools, Wharf Road.—Fair condition. British Street L.C.C. Schools.—Fair condition.

The premises had undergone thorough repair and were then in a sanitary and habitable condition. On this evidence the order was cancelled by the Magistrate. 239 Untrapped road gullies, defec- Cul de sac adjoin- Summons issued tive paving and channelling ing and between under Section 100 of road and iootways. 67 & 69, Mellish of the Met.

For the defence it was held that in this particular instance the responsible person must be not only freeholder of the court but also owner of the adjacent premises as interpreted by Sec. 99 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and as these premises were held under long leases by different owners, who were not the freeholders of the cul de sac, the freeholder could not be held responsible for the work. With this the magistrate concurred. Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises, and notices served as under :— No. of Intimations and Notices. Now Unoccupied. Bakehouses 10 11 2 Cowhouses 1 — — Slaughterhouses 2 — 1 Tripe dressers and sausage makers 11 3 1 Dairies and milk shops 26 — 2 Ice cream vendors 30 2 7 Coffee shops and dining rooms 36 40 4 Fish shops 12 12 — 128 68 17 The number of intimations and notices served and complied with, viz., 68, show the amount of work, principally cleansing and limewashing, which resulted from the above inspections. Riverside Wharves. Frequent visits were made to the undermentioned wharves for the 240 purpose of detecting the landing or storage of unsound food intended for sale for human consumption, with the results indicated:— Victoria Wharf (Crosse & Blackwell), West Ferry Road. Chiefly used for landing and storing vinegar and pickles. No food stuffs landed at time of visits. Hutching'B Wharf, West Ferry Road. No food stuff landed. Timothy's Wharf, West Ferry Road. No food stuff landed. St. Andrew's Wharf and Cattle Food Factory, West Ferry Road. The under-mentioned food stuffs were brought to the above premises in the district and converted into cattle food:- 9 packages shelled walnuts. 23 cases dates. 20½cwt. date sweepings. Maconochie's Wharf and Food Manufacturing and Preserving Factory, West Ferry Road. The above premises were constantly visited during the year. Particular attention was paid to the various food stuffs in course of preparation, as well as to the cleanliness of the vessels and utensils in use and of the sanitary conditions generally of the different kitchens and preparing rooms. All unsound or tainted food stuffs, blown or suspicious tinned food, etc., were destroyed in the furnaces by the firm on the premises, mostly in my presence. Summary of food stuffs destroyed during the year at this factory, all of which was contained in tins varying from ½lb. to 141bs. in weight:— Fish (mixed), principally lobster, salmon, cod, and herring 365 tins Meat, including meat paste 502 ,, Vegetable (various) 34 ,, Fruit (various) 49 „ Mixed fish, meat, and fruit 29 „ Total 979 tins 241 With reference to food stuffs exported to foreign countries, viz., the Philippine Islands (where certificates were required to accompany each consignment from the Sanitary Authority of the district whence the goods were dispatched), the premises were visited and the factory inspected and the goods examined and reported satisfactory before the certificates were signed by yourself. Sufferance Wharf and Food Preserving and Manufacturing Premises (for export only), West Ferry Road, Millwall. These premises were frequently visited and all unsound food stuffs, suspicious or blown tinned foods (sorted from imported stock) were destroyed by the firm. Summary of food stuffs examined and destroyed:- 70 cases tinned fish, mixed, principally lobster, salmon and sardines, about 50 tins per case. 469 tins mixed goods, fish and vegetables. 15 tins meat. 53 tins vegetables. 2 tons ½ cwt. of lemon skins. 25 cases of fish paste, previously condemned at the docks, were permitted by the Port Sanitary Authority to be delivered at the above premises for examination. On the application of the firm to yourself, permission was also given for the further removal of the goods to their factory at Lowestoft, and the medical officer of that district was notified of their despatch. Frequent exportations from this factory of consignments of hams or tinned meat to the Argentine or Philippines (where a certificate is required from the Sanitary Authority of the district whence the goods are despatched to accompany each consignment) had occurred. In every instance the factory had been visited and the goods examined before the certificates were signed. The additional powers conferred by the Regulations under the Public Health Regulations as to Food Act, 1907, will greatly facilitate in future a more rigid inspection of food stuffs landed at the above-mentioned wharves, and a more effectual means of dealing with and disposing of unsound food is defined in that statute. 242 The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Food Stuff Surrendered. During the year, at the request of the owners, 5 dozen frozen rabbits and ½cwt. trunk of fish were examined and found to be unfit for human food. Certificates to that effect were given to the owners after the goods were destroyed. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-seven samples of food and drugs were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Of that number 4 contained boric acid preservatives in the proportions of .2, .3, .5, and .8 per cent. respectively. In the last instance, viz., sample containing .8 per cent., legal proceedings were instituted. Of the remaining samples taken 6 were certified to be so adulterated that summonses were issued against the respective vendors, and in one case (sample marked 2F, butter certified to contain 80 5 per cent. foreign fat) butter was asked for and charged for at the rate of 1s. per lb., but as it was handed to the purchaser in a wrapper stamped margarine legal proceedings were not advised. The nature of samples and extent of adulteration, with result of prosecutions, are indicated below:- 6F Butter—Adulterated with 62.6 per cent. of foreign fat. Vendor fined £2 and £1 3s. costs 24F Butter—Adulterated with 81.1 per cent. foreign fat. Summons withdrawn through error in analyst's certificate. 30s. paid to vendor for cost of analysis. 32F Milk—Deficient in fat 10 per cent. Dismissed, no costs allowed. In this case the defence proved by expert evidence to the satisfaction of the Court that the milk when sold was in the same condition as when taken from their own cow, and had not been tampered with. 34F Milk—Deficient in solids not fat 9.4 per cent. Vendor fined £1 and £1 3s. costs. The written warranty defence failed. 243 45F Milk —Deficient in solids not fat 4 7 per cent. £1 and £1 3s. costs. 52F Butter—Contained .8 per cent. of boric acid. £1 and 12s. 6d. co3ts. This is one of the first convictions obtained through the excessive use of a preservative.

Public Health Department, December 31st, 1908. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my ninth Annual Report which deals with the work done in factories, workshops, among outworkers and other miscellaneous inspections during 1908. During the year one notice was served where the sanitary accommodation was unsuitable, and one where it was not separate for the sexes; in each case satisfactory alterations were made. Scabies and Verminous Children. I have visited a number of houses from which children were excluded from school when suffering from scabies, or on account of their verminous condition, and have had bedding disinfected and cleansing carried out. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation in the whole of the elementary schools in the Borough has been inspected and various defects referred to the London County Council. Outworkers. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 147 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 319 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 324 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. Prosecutions. Two employers were prosecuted for not sending in their lists as required. One was fined, and the other summons adjourned sine die. The following is a tabulated statement of further details:- 245 Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended December 31st, 1908:— Poplar.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to hand you my fifth Annual Report and details of the work carried out under the Bye-laws, for the year ended December 31st, 1908. Overcrowding. During the year visits were paid at late hours of night and in the early hours of the morning, and 123 cases were dealt with. Overcrowding took place in the following streets:— Alpha Road. Arcadia Street. Barchester Street. Blackthorn Street. Broomfield Street. Box Street. Clifton Street. Eastward Street. Furze Street. Gale Street. Gaselee Street. Hancock Road. Hawgood Street. High Street, Poplar. Kerbey Street. Lamprell Street. Oliffe Street. Otis Street. Park Street. Portree Street. Rook Street. Sabbarton Street. Sophia Street. Stebondale Street. Stewart Street.

In October, the landlord of houses in Gaselee Street was summoned at Thames Police Court for not supplying certain information necessary for the registration of the houses, which were in a dirty and verminous condition and much overcrowded. Fined £3 and £3 9s. costs. Registration. During the year 22 houses were added to the number on the registers, making the total at the end of the year 1010. Nuisances. Nuisances and defects that came to my notice and could not be dealt with under the Bye-laws were duly reported to the Inspector for the district. London County Council General Powers Act, 1904 (Section 20). A large number of rooms were rid of vermin through intimations being served under this Act, and in no case was it necessary for the Medical Officer of Health to issue a certificate for notices to be served.

Rothbury Road. 248 Special Report re Legal Proceedings. In March last the special attention of the Council was drawn to a report by the Medical Officer of Health on "Legal Proceedings under the Bye-laws," concerning some houses in Beachy Road, Old Ford. Briefly the facts were as follows:- The houses were in a dirty and verminous condition, and the owner, who did not comply with notices, was summoned to Old Street Police Court before Mr. Cluer. The magistrate heard the evidence of the Medical Officer of Health and myself, and although the owner did not dispute the condition of the rooms, and could offer no rebutting evidence, the magistrate decided to allow further time for the work to be done, and upon the completion of the work the magistrate withdrew the summonses and refused to allow the Council any costs. A report at the time after the magistrate's action was presented by the Medical Officer of Health, first to the Committee and then to the Council.

Sir,— The following is a Report of my work during the year 1908. I commenced my duties on May 4th, my time being chiefly occupied in trying to gain interest in the formation of a Voluntary Helpers Association. I, of necessity, met with some opposition, but that the idea was generally accepted with favour was shown, when at a meeting held on June 1st, only one month after I commenced my duties, it was unanimously decided that an Association, having for its object the prevention of infantile mortality, should be formed in the Borough. Since then the work has gone steadily forward, until at the time of writing, the Association has some sixty members, visiting from one to thirty-five babies each. Five "Centres'' have been formed in the Borough, each Centre having its own Hon. Sec., Committee and Band of Helpers, from members of which the Executive Committee (which is the governing body of the Association) is formed. Monthly "Consultation Days for Mothers and Babies" have been established in three "Centres."* Here fully qualified medical women (whose services are honorary) attend to give advice on the feeding, etc., of both infant and mother, and the infants are also weighed. I regret that so far my efforts to get a "Nursing Mothers' Milk Fund" established have been unsuccessful. Much good would be done in this way if the Guardians, when giving relief to a nursing mother, would see that due proportion was given in the form of milk and oatmeal, and in the case of a mother unable to suckle her child, a proper supply of milk for the infant. The organisation of an Association like this of necessity takes up a large amount of time, and as the Voluntary Helpers' reports are received every four weeks, the clerical work entailed is considerable and leaves me but little time for actual visiting. I am strongly of opinion that each case ought to be visited first by a trained worker, and those requiring systematic visiting, handed on, by her, to the Voluntary Helper. With only one trained worker, this is, of course, impossible. *A consultation day in a fourth centre has been established at the beginning of 1909. 251 Coming to the actual work, 3,495 visits have been paid to 832 babies. This number does not include "outs." Twelve of these had died before the visit took place; thirty-one have died since, and eighty-nine have removed. Reliable statistics regarding the whole are not available. The work of the Voluntary Helpers is most valuable, but one can hardly expect them, at any rate as yet, to gain the same amount of information as a trained worker. The following figures, however, relating to those families systematically visited by myself may prove interesting and may also be taken as typical of the whole:— Visited 336 Removed 39 Died 15 Taking away the thirty-nine who removed, this gives a death-rate of 50.5 per 1000 visited. Of those remaining, there were— 223 breast fed. 56 mixed feeding. 3 hand fed. The mothers of these infants had previously given birth to 1224 living children, of whom 187 died before reaching the age of one year, giving an infantile mortality rate of 152.7 per 1000 births. 26.6 per cent. worked for varying periods during pregnancy, 15.4 per cent. have started work since the birth of the child. Very few work regularly, so that reliable information as to income is hard to obtain, but amongst the home-workers the average earnings appears to be 1s. per day, and in some cases this is not earned without the help of the children. 15 per cent. have, at some period of my visits, been in receipt of parish relief. 21 per cent. occupied only one room; 25 per cent. two rooms, the families often consisting of parents and five children, and even where two rooms are occupied, the same sleeping apartment serves for all. If the authorities compel them to move, it is only to come across them later on, living under similar conditions. Of the fifteen deaths: — 2 died in the 1st month. 5 „ 2nd „ 4 „ 3rd „ 1 „ 4th „ 3 „ 5th „ 252 The causes of death were:— Inanition, marasmus, etc. (6 being twin children) 8 Convulsions 4 Epidemic diarrhœa 2 Heart failure 1 The method of feeding:— Breast fed 7 Mixed feeding 7 Hand fed 1 The last being fed from birth on separated condensed milk. Three of the mothers worked both during pregnancy and after the birth of the child. Two during pregnancy only. The difference in the rate of mortality between the infants of working and non-working mothers being shown in the following table:— Non-working mothers 4.8 per cent. Worked during pregnancy 6.7 „ Worked both during pregnancy and after birth of child 6.9 ,, The conditions of home life in three cases were decidedly unsatisfactory. In conclusion, will you allow me to take this opportunity of thanking all those who have helped to build up the Voluntary Helpers' Association, especially those who give up so much of their time to visiting the homes of their less fortunate sisters, to whom their sympathy and friendly advice means so much. I have the honour to remain, Sir, Your obedient Servant, ALICE E. HALL. Cert. San. Insp. Exam. Board (Lond.) Associate R. San. Inst. Cert. Lond. Obst. Society. Registered Central Midwives Board.

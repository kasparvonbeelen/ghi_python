THE VESTRY OF The United Parish of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, Westminster, REPORT. AMONG the seventy-eight civil parishes ing the City, and forming the area* to which the Metropolis Local Management Acts apply, none can lay claim to the antiquity and traditions inseparably associated with Westminster. Whether viewed in relation to the ecclesiastical prominence, to the intimate connection with national and political history, to the distinction as the residential parish of the Royal Houses of Plantagenet, Tudor, Stuart, and Hanover, or to the peculiar autonomy, the position of Westminster has been for centuries, as it is to-day, undisputably unique. The parishioners might therefore be disposed to allow, if not to expect, the representative body by whom their temporal affairs have been administered for three hundred years, to present a brief historical sketch of the parish. A momentary pause will, however, suggest exceptions which might be taken to such a course. Not only has the ground already been more or less covered by able writers, but the disentanglement and collection of information, the sketching of the intensely interesting biographies, indispensable to such a work, and the noting of the topographical changes wrought by Time, even in the limited area of eight hundred and fifteen acres, would be outside the province of a body incorporated for the performance of duties carefully defined by statute. But no such objection can be made to the review of the alterations *This area corresponds with the newly constituted "Administrative County of London." B 2 which have taken place in the local government of the parish and in the administrative functions of the Vestry. The publication of periodical reports of their proceedings for the information of the ratepayers is, in fact, one of the many obligations imposed by law upon the Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. Having regard, moreover, to the exceptional circumstances in which the Vestry is now placed, an extension of the retrospect beyond the year ended at Lady-Day last will be still less liable to objection. These exceptional circumstances are due to the important improvement made by Parliament during the Session of 1887 in the system of Local Self Government in Westminster (see pp. 28-35 of the Thirty-second Annual Report of the late Board of Works for the Westminster District) whereby the Vestry of the parish is restored to the position it occupied from the year 1580 to 1855. Thus restored, after a brief interval of comparative inactivity, to its ancient status, the Vestry has succeeded to the surviving functions animated by the spirit of its ancestors, anxious that their traditions shall not be impaired, and careful that loyal observance of more recent enactments shall not be wanting. Several Charters, each under the Great Seal of the Monarch of the time, the earliest dating from 1256 (40 Henry III.), have been brought to light during the past five years. The parish muniment room at the Town Hall also contains thousands of manuscript books and records of parochial affairs from the year 1464* (3 Edward IV.) to the present day, in addition to the Vestry Minutes, dating from 1585. These documents and records admit an insight into the local government of the parish as administered in four distinct periods:— I.—Prior to the Reformation. * Some few books of earlier date relating to ecclesiastical matters remain at the Vestry Room of St. Margaret's Church. 3 II.—From the Reformation to 1855, when many of the principal duties of the Vestry were transferred by the Metropolis Management Act to the Westminster District Board of Works. III.—From 1856 to 1888, the period during which the parish was under the regime of the Westminster District Board of Works. IV.— From Lady-day, 1888, to Lady-day, 1889, the first year of the Vestry as reconstituted. In case the possession of such ample means of reference may engender great expectations of the completeness of the review here attempted, it may be well, at the outset, to dispel any such anticipation, and to explain that neither the accounts nor the registers (the latter being preserved in the Vestry Room of the Church) have once been consulted. The minute books of the Vestry have almost exclusively been relied upon for the introduction to their predecessors which the Vestry are about to make. Nor is this sketch given with feelings of unmingled pride or selfsufficiency. On the contrary, the extracts hereafter given will show the present system to have come forth from dark ages dyed with superstitions, if not also disgraced with crimes even in the parochial administration. Nevertheless, in these records will be traced the gradual formation of a system of self-government which, however it may be designated, and however its imperfections in minor details may be magnified, may fearlessly claim to be without a parallel in any other method which continental or colonial ingenuity has been able to devise. Extent of A brief reference to the extent and boundaries the Parish. of Westminster may here be admissible. Three hundred years before the Domesday Book (1086) the extent of "the rural manor of Westminster," was mentioned in a Charter of Offa, King of Mercia, dated 785*. This Charter was confirmed by Edgar in 985, from whose * Walcott's Memorials of Westminster. B 2 4 Charter, preserved in the British Museum, Mr. Walcott gives an interesting extract. The Domesday Book (1086) describes Westminster as a village, in the Hundred of Ossulstone, and as containing xiij½ hides (about 945 acres) of land held by the Abbot. In addition there were viiij hides and j virgate (in all about 660 acres) belonging to the demesne of the Church of St. Peter, upwards of 100 acres let to the villeins (or tenants), pasture for the cattle of the village, meadow for xj ploughs, and pannage for C hogs. The measurements by hides and virgates give an area of upwards of 1,700 acres, but the omission of the superficial equivalent of the pasture, the meadow, and the pannage leaves the total dimensions of the parish at this time in obscurity. In the 6 Henry III. (1222), a decree of Cardinal Archbishop Langton and certain Bishops and Priors, who appear to have sat in arbitration on some difference which had arisen on the question, curtails from the east side of the parish all the precinct of the Savoy, the entire area of St.Mary-leStrand and St. Clement-Danes, and such parts of St. Giles and St. Andrew, Holborn, as had been included in the Charter of Edgar. St. Margaret, Westminster, as thus left, comprised the present parishes of St. Paul, Covent Garden. St. Martin-in-the-Fields, St. James, Piccadilly, St. Anne, Soho, St. George, Hanover Square, and St. John the Evangelist., Westminster; and, as if in compensation for the detachment on the east side, three manors were added to the parish on the west and north-west. Paddington had also been confirmed as an appendage of Westminster by Stephen (1135), and Henry II. (1154). By a charter of 17 Richard II. (1393) the parishes of St. Mary-le-Strand and St. Clement Danes, together with that of St. Martin-in-theFields. then newly formed, were declared to be possessed by the Abbot as part of the Manor of Westminster. Further changes were also made by Letters Patent in the reigns of Henry VIII. (1534) and James I. (1604). Through the good offices of Mr. T. C. Noble, who is 5 engaged in the compilation of a general history of Westmi aster, and who has rendered gratuitous and indefatigable assistance in obtaining copies of numerous documents from the Public Record Office, for use in connection with this sketch, these Letters Patent, not previously printed, are here reproduced:— Letter from the King to the Vicar of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, decreeing that the portion of St. Margaret's parish heretofore between the Palace Gate and Charing Cross, shall be hereafter considered as in the parish of St. Martin.

Given at our Mannor at Westmr the 12th day of November, in the 26th yeare of our Raigne. Half a century after the Letters of James I. saw the formation of St. Paul's Covent Garden as an independent parish (1660); in 1678 the area of St. Margaret's and St. Martin's-in-the-Fields was further reduced by the assignment of a specified limit to the parish of St. Anne, Soho; the constitution of the parish of St. James quickly followed (1685), and in 1725 the two parishes of St. Margaret and St. Martin were further diminished by the creation of the parish of St. George, Hanover Square. By these means the parish of Westminster, including the Hamlet of Knightsbridge, became reduced from 2,547 acres in extent to 815 acres. The constitution of the parish of St. John the Evangelist in 1728, hereafter more particularly noticed, still further decreased the area by 211 acres, leaving 604 acres as the compass of St. Margaret's parish, of which the Hamlet of Knightsbridge covered 384 acres. The severance of the parish of St. John the Evangelist, though complete for ecclesiastical objects, was only partial for civil purposes. The circumstances attending the separation are reviewed towards the conclusion of Part II. 8 PART I. Local Government in Westminster in PreReformation Times. According to Maitland,* the village or town of Westminster "was until the Reformation, Anno 1539, under the arbitrary government of the Abbot and Monks of the Abbey, as it was afterwards under that of the Bishop and the Dean and Chapter." Leaving the accuracy of the concluding part of this description to be examined in the next division of this sketch, it will soon be seen that the first part fails to convey an adequate idea either of the laws affecting local government as it then existed, or the machinery by which such laws were administered. As early as the twelfth century, the opulence, power and influence of the Abbot and Monks, and the attractions of the Abbey, together with the establishment of the Dean and Canons of the Chapel of St. Stephen, no doubt led to the gathering of an important residential population in the immediate neighbourhood— citizens, who were described by Fitzstepheu in 1174, as "themselves everywhere known and respected above all others for their civil demeanour, their good apparel, their table, and their discourse." The residence of the Kings and Princes of the Plantagenet line (circa 1216) from time to time, the assembling of Parliament, and the establishment of the Law Courts at Westminster, while they induced the courtiers and nobility to take up their abode in the vicinity, explain, also, the granting of Charters by successive kings and the passing of Statutes for the special advantage of Westminster. Furthermore, the growth of the town received a powerful impulse from the establishment by Statute of 27 Edward III. (1354) of the * Maitland, Vol. ii. p. 1348. 9 woolstaple, by which merchants were led to settle down, and were required by the statute which protected their commerce, to bear, at the same time, their share of duty in the local government. Two of their number were to be returned to a Court, consisting of a Mayor of the Staple and other Members, who were entrusted to choose two constables, apparently for the special service of the Staple and for the performance of duties independently of the Petty or Parish Constable, who had been "constituted" since 1252, or a hundred years prior to their brethren of the Staple. These parish constables* succeeded the old "tything-men" and were chosen by the court-leets, to whom they were responsible until commissions of the peace were organised in 1327 by Edward III. Much of the adminstrative power which had previously become vested in the county courts, the hundred courts, the court-leets, and even the "town-moots," gradually became transferred to the justices. Judicial functions were soon entrusted to this new authority, who also became invested with arbitrary powers for the prevention and suppression of crime and for the punishment of minor offences. The levying of a direct tax on the inhabitants of the county for the repair of bridges and for the building of gaols was also among the earliest duties committed to them. Meanwhile the more important parishes and townships foreshadowed as it were Sir Erskine May's recent description of "bearing the image and reflection of the State, with their miniature aristocracy of the Church and the land, and their miniature democracy of ratepayers assembled as parochial commonalties." Necessity for consulting local sentiment was acknowledged, and government through local agency made itself felt in all the branches of civil administration. The justices of the peace were, in certain of their powers, subject to the verdicts of juries; and local "inquests" or *The "deputy constable" was an officer not recognised until a comparatively recent period. 10 "recognitions" were customary in order to ascertain by the sworn testimony of the inhabitants, the local feelings and grievances of particular districts. Adverting to the circumstances under which the township of Westminster was founded, the community of interest and the facilities for frequent meetings of the inhabitants, will of themselves suggest that the conditions favoured the development of a system of local self-government thoroughly popular in principle, and therefore vigorous in practice. So powerful was the voice of the inhabitants, even at this primitive stage of local control, that the assent of representatives of each township was necessary to enable the justices to allow or levy the taxes to which reference has already been made. Whether or not these representatives were chosen at the conventions of parishioners at the village club, or on the village green is not recorded, nor are any of the regulations by which such choice was made—probably the proceedings were governed by unwritten laws—yet the system must be admitted to be the germ of that which to-day gives the parishioners a direct voice and power and liberty in the choice of their representative officers. Very little can be gleaned from such records as are preserved as to how far the water supply, drainage, abatement of nuisances, and other matters affecting the public health were regulated at this early period by statute law— deficiencies and neglect in these essentials were for the most part dealt with at common law, as was also the repair of the highways. The cleansing and lighting of the streets were, as yet, not attempted, although the attention of Parliament was given to matters of much less public interest. A multitude of penal laws were enacted in the reigns of Edward III. (1327) and Edward IV. (1461) to restrain the wearing of excessive apparel, short doublets, long coats, &c. These were, however, expunged from the Statute Book by James I. Even the diet of the citizens in common was ruled by a statute of 10 Edward III (1337) which 11 ordained that no man should be served at dinner or supper with more than two courses, except upon certain great holidays specified, when he might be served with three. This statute remained in force until 1829, but neither the parish books nor the Magistrates' records, so far as they have been examined, show that any penalty for an infringement of the law in this respect was recorded. . What the legislation omitted to provide for Highways. the public safety, and the common law failed to remedy, was supplied by what would now be regarded as Orders in Council. In 1204 King John issued an order to the Sheriffs of London requiring them to repair the road from London to Westminster. Mr. Walcott* states that a hundred and fifty years later (1353) the heavily laden wains, the carts and horses conveying the staple wares and provisions broke up the highway where it was paved, and wore it into deepening hollows, dangerous to all passengers. Edward III. thereupon imposed a charge on all packs of wool and other merchandise coming by land or water to the staple, in order to repair the road from Temple Bar to the Abbey Gates, and directed all persons living in the vicinity of the staple to pave a certain distance in front of their houses. The same author narrates that in the time of Richard II. (1377), and the succeeding reigns, the carriageways of King Street were in such a ruinous condition that faggots were obliged to be thrown into the ruts to facilitate the passage of the Royal carriages when the King went to Parliament. Such extracts warrant the inference that no local highway authority had yet been called into existence, watchmen Nearly a century prior to the above period the Statute of Winchester, 13 Edward I., 1285, had recognised the powerful aid to be commanded from the citizens. For the suppression of robberies each town was required to provide twelve men to watch continually all night, "from the sun-setting to the sun-rising." The method * Also Allen, History of London, Vol. IV., p. 3; and Hughson, Vol. I., p. 78. 12 of electing these public officers is not declared; but upon them was imposed the onerous duty of arresting all strangers on suspicion, and, if the arrest was not obeyed, of levying the hue and cry. The "lord of the town" was at the same time pressed into the public service, and the inhabitants generally were made responsible for the damages in case the offenders were not overtaken. The hardship this measure was expected to place upon the residents was not overlooked, for its penalties were respited from its passing in October until the following Easter, "forasmuch as the King will not that his People should be suddenly impoverished by reason of this Penalty that seemeth very hard to many." The extracts hereafter given afford proof of the damages from time to time made good by the Vestry under this enactment and others by which it was altered and extended. Numerous statutes placing direct responsibility upon the inhabitants in relation to the arrest of felons were passed during the Plantagenet time. Sewers. In the Pre-Reformation era Parliament seems to have made as little statutory provision for the public sewerage system as for the maintenance of the highways. It is at once conceded that the number of houses in Westminster was not such as to render an elaborate system necessary, especially as the more thickly populated part of the parish was insulated by the branch of the Thames which entered the parish between Cannon Row and Whitehall, intersected King Street, pursued its course along the line now known as Gardener's Lane and Princes Street, across the present Broad Sanctuary to the south wall of Abbey Garden, and following the line of College Street till it joined the river again. This ditch probabiy answered the requirements of the day with respect to the sewerage of Westminster, for no statute or order or proclamation upon the subject can be traced. Water Supply. Westminster derived its public water supply from four principal sources—the Thames, the conduit at Knightsbridge, the King's Conduit in the Palace 13 Yard, and ordinary wells. The condition of the Thames water in times so far removed from the present, was evidently such as to admit of the use of water without filtration, confirmation of which is borne by an entry in the Vestry Minutes of 26th July, 1700, and reproduced hereafter. The conduit at Knightsbridge furnished the supply for the Abbey and its precincts, whither the service was conveyed at the expense of the Abbot and monks, and the post-Reformation records of the Vestry show that inhabitants were permitted to connect their houses with the Abbey mains by means of leaden pipes. A stone memorial near the north-east end of the Serpentine bears the inscription:— Facing East— "On this spot stood a Conduit house which supplied the precincts of Westminster with water till the spring was cut off by drainage in 1861. "The building was removed in 1868, and this memorial erected in l870 to mark the place where it stood." Facing West— "A supply of water by a conduit from this spot was granted to the Abbey of Westminster, with the Manor of Hyde, by King Edward the Confessor. "The Manor was resumed by the Crown in 1536, but the springs as a head and original fountain of water, were preserved to the Abbey by the Charter of Queen Elizabeth in 1560." The King's Conduit, described in Mr. Walcott's work "as a beautiful fountain which fell in large cascades," stood on the north-west side of the Palace Yard. The surplus water flowing from this supply was by Charter under the Great Seal of Henry VI., dated 3rd February, 1446-7, granted to the commonalty of Westminster, though no reference is made to the means by which the water was conveyed to the houses. In their books for 1524 the Churchwardens made a note that "the King's Charter for "the Condett at Pales-gate remayneth in the custody of "the Churchwardens." This Charter, with the Great Seal in a fair state of preservation, was fortunately discovered 14 some five years ago, when, after more than four centuries of obscurity, it was brought to light and suitably mounted for preservation and exhibition in one of the principal rooms at the Town Hall. As early as 1267-8 (51 Henry III.) a provision was made for the protection of the public health in an enactment against the sale of contagious or unwholesome food, and corrupted wine, under pain of amerciament for the first offence, pillory for the second, and imprisonment for the third. That Westminster early enjoyed the favour of both King and Parliament has been shown by the reference already made to the distinction conferred upon it in 1352, when it was constituted by Statute one of the ten towns in England where the staple or market for wool and other commodities should be held. But nearly a hundred years previously (1256) Henry III. had granted the inhabitants the privilege of holding a weekly market and an annual fair in "Touthull," the market on Mondays, and the fair on "the eve, day, and day following St. Mary Magdalene" (July 2f, 22, and 23.) This patent was confirmed and extended by a charter of Edward I. (1298.) Other grants for the convenience of the inhabitants have from time to time been made, and the charters have recently been restored and preserved in similar manner to the foregoing; but further notice here is forbidden, since they have no direct bearing on the duties of the local governing bodies past or present. Knightsbridge Little is chronicled concerning Knightsbridge anterior to the Reformation. Mr. Davis in his "Memorials," refers to the rights exercised over the district by the Monks of Westminster, including the holding of a market and a fair, and the erection of a gallows tree. The existence of a market, which was continued until early in the present century, points to the locality having been more numerously inhabited than the earliest books of the Overseers (1561-2) indicate, for there were not more than a 15 dozen persons in Knightsbridge contributing to the relief of the poor until after 1580. The more wealthy residents may, however, have contributed in the shape of "benevolences," and the occupiers of the smaller houses may not have been enforced to contribute—the compulsory assessment of "all hereditaments" being but a modern requirement. After discussing the derivation of the name of "the Hamlet" as at present rendered, Walford, in his "Old and New London," vol. v., p. 15, says: "We may be content to leave the question for the solution of future topographers," merely remarking that whether it was originally "Knightsbrigg" or "Kyngesbrigg," King Edward the Confessor held lands here, and possibly may have built a bridge (to carry the road over the river Westbourne) for the use of the Monks of Westminster, to whom he devised a portion of his acres. That such was the case we learn from a charter preserved in the British Museum, which conveyed to the Monks of Westminster, along with the manor of Chelsea, "every third tree and every horse-load of fruit grown in an adjacent wood at Kyngesbrigg as heretofore by law accustomed." The periodical market and fair would have called for the appointment of at least one parish constable by the inhabitants in their local court assembled, or by the Commissioners or Justices after 1327; beyond this the "rude forefathers of the hamlet" made but little demand upon the local governing body. They were supplied with an abundance of excellent water by the springs close at hand, they were unconcerned as to the provision of anything more than a pit or a trench for drainage purposes, and they were free, as yet, from any obligation to maintain the highway passing through their midst from the west to London, and which was carried by the little stone bridge over the west bourne (or river) at the spot now known as Albert Gate. 16 PART II. Local Government in Westminster from the Reformation to 1728. Alternating and wavering as were the changes which accompanied the spread of the Reformation to England in the middle of the sixteenth century, a flood of light seemed then, as it were, to impart vitality to the institutions of the country. To the tendency to progress which was at once developed, stimulated as it was by the spirit of freedom, the condition of the popular mind, and the protection and favour with which Henry VIII. regarded Westminster, may be attributed a truly prosperous era in the annals of the parish. Gradual recognition of the Laity. As the priestly supremacy subsided, the laity spontaneously, though gradually, assumed direct and important functions in parochial matters. The inhabitant householders of Westminster began to meet in Vestry—possibly as an open assembly of parishioners until about 1590, thenceforward as a "select" Vestry— exercising direct powers in a multiplicity of ways, far greater than modern experience would suggest. In addition to the regulation of matters pertaining to the Church, to the relief of the poor, and to the repair of the highways and bridges, the Vestry of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries assumed much more than nominal functions in the constitution of their corporate assembly, in defining the parish boundaries, on the questions of fire-prevention, "local option," paving, street cleansing, lighting and watching, the suppression of popery, the punishment of vagrants, and on such matters as the custody of registers, the water supply and sewerage system, burials, and even in the choice of candidates for parliamentary honours, not 17 to speak of the miscellaneous affairs of which illustration is hereafter given. The organisation of the parish court, by whatever name it was known at different times, consisted of the justices, "who had means of studying the parish, what it could endure and what it would not tolerate," the coroner, the high constable of the hundred, and the parish constables. How far they succeeded in constructing an efficient administrative system, may be gathered from Mr. Walcott's description of affairs shortly after the Reformation. The butchers slaughtered their cattle in the public streets, the people in the courts and alleys were "for the most part . . . given to vice and idleness, living in contempt of all manner of officers." Six houses were found to be "kept by receivers of felons, masterless men, and cut purses . . . whose practice was to rob the chambers of gentlemen and artificers' shops," while a few years later "almost every fourth house was an ale-house harbouring all sorts of lewd and bad people." It would be unjust, however, to hold the parochial organisation to blame for all the shortcomings of that eventful period. During the reign of Henry VIII. "the will of the sovereign was the paramount authority to which all else was brought into subjection." Before the flowing in of the wealth which the suppression of the monasteries yielded,* the demands of this "will" were enforced by the Council in so oppressive a manner as, in a measure, to retard the citizens' interest in their corporate affairs. Benevolences. A general exaction, then called a "benevolence," was resorted to, and the manner in which the levy or collection was made leaves no doubt of its compulsory character. The Council instructed the Commissioners to incite all men to a loving contribution * The yearly clear value was computed, at £131,607, hut is declared by Burnet and others to have been much greater. According to a valuation in Speed's Catalogue of Religious Houses, the revenues of St. Peter's Westminster, were valued at £3,277. C 18 according to the rates of their substance, as they were assessed at the last subsidy, calling on no one whose lands were of less value than 40s., or whose chatties were less than £15. It was intimated that the least His Majesty could reasonably expect would be twenty pence in the pound on the yearly value of land, and half that sum on moveable goods. The Commissioners were to use ''good words and amiable behaviour" to induce men to contribute, and to dismiss the obedient with thanks. But if any person should withstand their gentle solicitations, alleging either poverty or some other defence which the Commissioners should deem unfit to be allowed, then, after failure of persuasions and reproaches for ingratitude, they were to command his attendance before the Privy Council, to whom they were to certify his behaviour, enjoining him in silence meanwhile, that his evil example might not corrupt the better disposed.* The power which governed under the name of Edward VI. acted upon no settled policy, and was guided by no fixed principles. The public mind had not regained the serenity essential to its energetic application to municipal necessities. Still less were such necessities likely to be studied during the retrogressive reign of Mary. It was not until the accession of Elizabeth (1548) that excitement made way for tranquility. Then it was that attention to local affairs received a new impulse. The Vestry, as a governing body, was not yet, however, in the enjoyment of that recognised status which it soon * Hallam, Constitutional History, 2nd Edition, Vol, I. p. 34. quotes from Lodge p. 80, a curious illustration of the consequences that awaited the refusal of this benevolence:—''One Richard Reed, an alderman of London, had stood alone among his fellow citizens in refusing to contribute. It was deemed expedient not to overlook this disobedience; and the course adopted in pursuing it is somewhat remarkable. The English army was then in the field on the Scotch border. Reed was sent down to serve as a soldier at his own charge, and the General received intimations to employ him on the hardest and most perilous duty, and to subject him, when in garrison to the greatest privations, that he might feel the smart of his folly and sturdy disobedience. The letter to the general concludes, 'finally you must use him in all things according to the sharpe disciplyne militar of the northern wars.' It is natural to presume that few would expose themselves to the treatment of this unfortunate citizen, and that the Commissioners, if they did not always find perfect readiness, had not to complain of many peremptory denials." 19 afterwards commanded, and has never since forfeited. The system was only in process of inauguration; it was therefore imperfectly understood, if not also imperfectly carried into execution. The Court of Burgesses. In the 27th year of Elizabeth two acts were passed affecting Westminster. The first, which was not, so far as can be ascertained, ever carried into operation, was entitled, "An Act for the Good Government of the City of Westminster and Liberties, the seat of Royalty, the Receipt of the Nobles and Estate of the Honorable Council, the Sanctuary of all Justices, the place of Parliament, the Show of all Nobles and of all Ambassadors coming from Foreign parts." The second enactment (27 Eliz., cap. 17, Private) was continued by four subsequent Acts in the same reign, and by others in the reigns of James I. and Charles I., in the 17th year of whose reign it was further continued "until some Act of Parliament shall be made touching the Continuance or Discontinuance thereof." An amending Act increased the number of Burgesses and Assistants; but the operation of the original measure was not affected. In his abstract of the provisions of these Acts, Maitland* says the civil government of Westminster was thereby lodged in the hand of the laity; though the Dean by the said Act was empowered to nominate and appoint the chief officers thereunto belonging, viz.—the High Steward, who if guilty of no malversation held his office during life. But this Officer seldom officiating left the management of affair's to his Deputy, who, being a person well versed in the laws of the kingdom, was appointed by him and confirmed by the Dean, and generally held his office during life or the government of his patron. The City or Borough, with its liberties, being by the said authority divided into twelve wards, the Dean or the High Steward, or his Deputy, were empowered for the better * Edition of 1772. P. 1348. c 2 20 government of the same yearly upon Easter Thursday to nominate and elect twelve sufficient merchants or tradesmen to be denominated Burgesses, with a like number of persons for their Deputies or Assistants, to preside over the respective wards for one year, and so from year to year during life, good behaviour, or residence in the City or Liberties thereof. And that all and every of the said Burgesses or their Deputies that should refuse to serve after he or they were duly elected, the former to forfeit the sum of ten and the latter five pounds, each to be levied by distress. Also that as often as any of the said twelve Burgesses or their Assistants should happen to die, remove, or be displaced, their several places to be supplied by proper persons to be chosen by the said Dean, High Steward, or his Deputy, who were likewise to appoint out of the twelve first, two to be denominated Chief Burgesses, who were likewise to continue as such for the term of one year, upon the penalty of ten pounds, to be levied as aforesaid. And by the same authority, the said Dean and his successors, the High Steward or his Deputy, the two Chief and other ten Burgesses or any three or four of them (whereof the said Dean, High Steward or his Deputy, or one of the Chief Burgesses to be at all times one) for the good government of this City or Borough or the Liberties thereof, to hear, examine, determine, and punish according to the laws of the kingdom, or laudable and lawful custom of the City of London, all matters of incontinencies, common scolds, inmates and common nuisances, and to commit all persons to prison that should be guilty of a breach of the peace, of which they were to give notice to a Justice or Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex, within the space of twenty-four hours. "And it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid that all good ordinances that shall from time to time be made * * * for or concerning the government of this City and Liberties, not repugnant to the Royal prerogative or 21 the laws of the nation, shall stand and be in full force and strength. And that as often as it shall happen that the said Dean and High Steward or his Deputy shall defer or be remiss in nominating or choosing the several Burgesses at the time above mentioned, then, and in every such case, two Justices of the Peace * * * are empowered to nominate and choose the said Burgesses out of such persons qualified as aforesaid, who, upon such an election are to enjoy the same liberties and powers in all respects as if chosen by the said Dean and High Steward. And it is also provided that no person shall be compelled to serve the office of Burgess above the term of one year, and that all persons who shall be fined for the same shall be exempt from serving for the space of five years." The Liberty or Suburbs of Westminster being greatly increased both in number of houses and inhabitants it was therefore judged necessary to increase both the number of Burgesses and Assistants from twelve to sixteen each, which Burgesses with their Assistants are by the said Act of Parliament empowered to act in all respects as the Aldermen's Deputies of the City of London. "The High Steward or his Deputy, attended by the Burgesses, acts as Sheriff by presiding at the Court Leet, and as Chairman at the Quarter Sessions. The next officer in dignity is the High Bailiff, who is likewise chosen by the Dean for life. This officer in some measure also represents the Sheriff, for he summons juries, manages elections for Members of Parliament, has the several Bailiffs of Westminster subordinate to him, and by having all fines and forfeitures belonging to him, his office is thereby rendered very profitable. The next officers in rank and power are the chief Burgesses, Burgesses and their assistants, and the inferior officers are the Town Clerk, Asserer, and Crier." Immediately upon their entry into office, the Court of Burgesses drew up and published a code of orders for the 22 good government of the area under their jurisdiction from which the following are selected by way of illustration:— Certain Orders and Ordinances made the 27th Day of May, in the 27th Year of the Reign of our Soveraign Lady Elizabetha. &c., by the Right Honourable Sir William Cecill, of the most noble Order of the Garter, Knight and Baron of Burleigh, Lord Treasurer of England, and High Steward of the City and 'Burrough of Westminster, and the Right Worshipful Mr. Gabriell Goodman, Doctor of Divinity, Dean of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter's in Westminster aforesaid. 4. Item.—If any Collier shall put to Sale any Coals in Sacks, and the same Sacks not being lawfull, or if his Sack or Sacks should be found to be lawfull, and not being filled with Coals accordingly, that then every such Collier, for every such Time soe offending shall be committed to Prison, there to remain by the space of Twenty-four Hours; and all his defective and unlawfull Sacks shall be burned in the Market place, and to receive for every Time soe offending such further Punishment as is used within the City of London. 7. Item.—If any Person or Persons shall receive or take into his or her Service, any Servant without a lawfull Testimonial! in Writing, or that shall put away such Servant, without giving to him or her lawfull Warning according to the Statute, that then every such Person, offending herein, shall forfeit and pay, for every Time so offending herein, as by the Statute is provided; and alsoe, if any Servant shall depart from the Service of his or her Master or Mistress, without just cause, or giving lawfull Warning, or not having a lawfull Testimonial!, shall then be punished according to the said Statute. 13. Item.—That every Burgess and their Assistants, and all and every other Person or Persons, using any Trade of Victualling, or keeping any Common Alehouse, shall yearly, and every year hereafter, from the Feast of All Saints until the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary find and keep one convenient Lanthorne, with a Candle being light in the same, in the Street, at every their Street-doors, viz., from Six of the Clock in Afternoon untill Nine of the Clock then next following, every Night nightly (except those Nights as the Moon shall then, and at that time shine and give light) upon paine to forfeit and pay for every Time offending herein, Four Pence. 14. Item.—That all other the Inhabitants of the City or Burrough shall find the like Lanthorne and Candle Light, in Manner and form as aforesaid, and as they, and every of them, from Time to Time, shall be assessed by the Burgess and Assistant of that Ward, where any of the said inhabitants shall then dwell, upon pain to forfeit and pay, for every Time offending therein, Four Pence. 23 19. Item.—That the Inhabitants of the City or Burrough Yearly, and every year hereafter, from the Feast Day of the Annuntiation of the Blessed Virgin Mary until the Feast Day of Saint Michaell the Archangell, viz. : every Day at six or seven of the Clock in the forenoon, shall, either by themselves or some others, with clean Water wash and sweep the Kennells and gutters near unto every of their Dwelling House, upon paine to forfeit and pay, for every day makeing Default, Four Pence. 21. Item.—That the Scavengers or Carter shall well and duely make, clean, and carry away the Soyle of the Streets upon every such Day, and in such convenient Order as it hath heretofore been lawfully used and accustomed, upon paine of Imprisonment, and there to remaine during the Space of Twenty-four Hours, for every Time offending in this Order. 24. Item.—If any Hogg or Hoggs shall at any Time be found upon the Common of Tuthill, and not being ringed or pegged, or shall be found wandering in any Street or Churchyard, that the owner of every such Hogg shall forfeit and pay, for every such Hogg, and for every time offending in any the Premisses Twelve Pence. 34. Item.—The Burgesses and Assistants shall in convenient order every Sabbath Day in the Forenoone, come to the Collegiate Church of St. Peter in Westminster and there to be present all the Time of the Sermon, upon paine, every one of them, for every Time making Default, without just cause, shall forfeit and pay Four Pence. Experience soon proved to the Court of Burgesses that their jurisdiction was not equal to the effectual suppression of the offences and disorders prevalent in the area for which they acted. Further powers were therefore sought at the King's hands, on the petition of the Earl of Pembroke, Lord High Steward, in 1636. The allegations of the petition were:— That whereas by reason of yor Matie's and yor most Royall Progenitors usuall residence neere or in the said Cittie. And for that your Matie's Courts of Ordinarie Justice usually sit there, the concourse of people thither is verie great and various, whence also so many offences and disorders are often in ye same Cittie and ye precincts thereof comitted. That for want of a larger Power of Jurisdicon and Government in the said Church or inhabitants, or both, the same offences and disorders can neither bee so conveniently punished nor prevented as is meete. And whereas it is conceaved that if the said inhabitants were incorporated, and the perpetuall Succession of Magistrate wih the power for punishing offenders and with like priviledges as other 24 yor Matie's townes Corporate within this yor Kingdom, and as the matter duly considered might require (the rights of the said Church being allwaies preserved) That a greate good would redound to yor Matie's said Cittie whence they shoidd also be much more enabled to serve you. Whatever may have been the terms of the King's reply, no change was made in the constitution or powers of the Burgesses, but the rising disturbances, already active at this time, and the arbitrary determination of public questions without the aid of Parliament, may account for the failure of the effort. The annual elections and the appointment of officers under these Acts are still made; but modern legislation has divested the court of nearly all its original powers, the principal surviving duty being that of punishing offenders in respect of defective weights or measures. The costs attending the progress of the principal Bill through Parliament amounted to £26 7s. 6d., and the outlay upon the adaptation and furnishing the Court House— probably the building used by the Staple Court—was £6 14s. 11d. The following particulars concerning such costs are taken from the Vestry Minute Book of the time:— Charges layde out concerninge the Acte of Pliamente for the Cittie of Westmr, and the Lyberties of the same.

From the first election of Burgesses of the newly created Court, onwards for upwards of a hundred and fifty years, a wholesome, though apparently unwritten rule admitted within the circle of the Vestry an influential number of inhabitant householders who were either Justices of the Peace or Members of the Court of Burgesses To this may safely be ascribed the absence of conflicting jurisdiction and the harmonious relationship long prevailing between the several representative bodies. The mode of election is illustrated by the minutes of the Vestry, from which the following are transcribed :— Md. that att A Vestreye houlden the vijth dave of June Anno Dm. 1622 William Ireland was elected and admitted to be one of the Vestrye of this Parrishe of St. Margaretts in WeBtin by the whoale consente of us whose names ar hereunto subscribed.

Wednesday, Tth Oct, 1674.—Sir John Cutler‡ and John Baynes Esquire were this day nominated and elected Vestrymen of this parish. And the Churchwardens are desired to acquaint them therewith.

Thomas Arneway, the husband of Joyce Goddard, Henry Forrest, Tobias Mills, Thomas Hanwell, Emery Hill, Bartholomew Fillingham, Charles Rampayne, Robert Griffin, ar.d others, who left bequests in favour of the poor of the parish were Members of the Vestry. 27 Ffalconbirde Esq were Elected and Chosen and Admited Vestrey men of the pish of margretts westrn1: by the Consent and nominacion of us of the Vestry whose names are subscribed. Early Legislation as to Vestries. After the Restoration, in 15 Charles II. (1675), an Act of Parliament — the first according statutory recognition to Vestries—was passed for purposes which the following abridged preamble and sections explain:— 15 Charles II., C. 5. (1) For the prevention of the Evils which may arise from Vestry men not conforming to the Government and Discipline of the Church of England as it now is by Law established. Be it enacted * * * That all and every person who now is a Vestryman * * within any Parish in the City of London and Westr, Boro' of Southwarke and weekly Bills of Mortality and all other Cittyes Boroughes and Townes Corporate where Select Vestryes are used * * on or before the Nine and twentyeth day of September next. And all and every person who at any time hereafter shall be elected to be a Vestryman or member of any Vestry, within one month after Election shall before the respective Archbishop Bishop or Ordinary Viccar Generall or Chauncellor of the Diocesse make and subscribe the Declaration * * * * in the words following:— I, A. B. doe declare That it is not lawfull upon any pretence whatsoever to take Armes against the King and that I doe abhor that Trayterous Position of takeing Armes by His Authoritie against His person or against those that are Commissioned by Him. And that I will conforme to the Liturgy of the Church of England as it is now by law established. And I doe declare That I doe hold there lyes no Obligation upon me or on any other person from the Oath commonly called The Solemne League and Covenant to endeavour any change or alteration of Government either in Church or State And that the same was in itselfe an unlawfull Oath and imposed upon the Subjects of this Realme against the known Lawes and Liberties of this Kingdome. And that all * * who shall neglect or refuse to doe the same within the respective times aforesaid -shall (ipso facto) be deprived of such his place of Vestry man * * to all intends and purposes and such place shall be actually void as if such person were naturally dead. * * * And that from and after such neglect or refusall it shall be lawfull for all persons who shall have right of Election or nomination of such Vestry man * * to proceede to election or nomination of some other discreete person of the respective Parish in the room of such person 28 soe neglecting or refuseing an aforesaid. And if such person so to bo elected in the room of such person so neglecting * * * shall also neglect * * to make and subscribe the said Declaration and Acknowledgement * * * * whereby such place shall again become void or if such persons who shall have right of Election or nomination as aforesaid shall not proceed to Election within one moneth after such Vacancy then it shall be lawfull to and for the respective Archbishop Bishop or Ordinary of the Diocesse under his Hand and Scale to elect and nominate a discrcete person of the respective Parish in such vacante roome which person so],to be elected and nominated after his makeing and subscription * * * * and Small * * * be reputed deemed and taken to be a Vestryman * * * in like manner as if he had been chosen by the respective Electors any Law Custome or Usage to the Contrary notwithstanding. Admission to a scat on the Vestry was, in consequence of this enactment attended with some little ceremony, as may be gathered from the method of recording the same:— 5 th Sept, 1077. Know all men by these pants that Mr Arthur Prior & MrNehemiah Arnold of the parish of St. Margts Westmr in ye County of Middx were Sworno Vestry men for ye Sayd parish before y° Rt Worll Sr Rich Lloyd Knt Doctor of Lawes Comissary & Officiall Principall to the Worll tho Deane and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of St Peters Westmr on Wednesday tho 13th day of June 1077.

RICH LLOYD. The like verbatim, For CAPTN. MICH ARNOLD* RICH PAGITT Esqe. MR THO WARNER MR MILES MICHELL MR RICH FFARTHING MR JOHN GREENE As the Act requiring these formalities was not renewed at the expiration of the year for which its operation was limited, the former method of election was resumed and continued until 1706. The Vestry then imposed upon the churchwardens the duty of personally waiting upon the newly appointed Vestrymen to request their advice and assistance:— Tuesd. 15 Feb. 1708. Ordered that Mr. Tho. Wisdome, Mr. Sam11 Mitchell and Mr. Jos. Hornsby be admitted Vestry Men of this parish and the Churchwardens are Desired to waite on them and acquaint them therewith and desire their advice and assistance at Vestrys. In 1709 a custom, observed for many years afterwards, was established with a view to ensuring that due care should be taken in the choice of Members:— Tuesd. 29 March, 1709. Ordered that if any Gent, shall hereafter be Nominated to this Vestry by any Member thereof in order to his being chosen a Vestry Man, the name of every such person shall be given in to this Vestry then sitting to the Intent that the Members thereof may inform themselves concerning the persons soe proposed. And the election of such Vestry Man may not be made till the next Vestry after the name given as aforesaid. In consequence of this order the entry takes the following form :— Sunday, 10th May, 1709.—Memdum. That Mr. Peter White be nominated at the next Vestry, in order to his being made a Vestry Man. During this year the " Rt. Hon. Lord Hallyfax," the Honble. James Vernon,f Sir John Humble, Bart., and Col. * M.P. for Westminster, 1685. f M.P. for Westminster, 1701-2. 30 John Staples, with numerous others, were admitted Vestrymen. For reasons that are not stated the Vestry on the 2nd December, 1709:— Ordd—That from henceforth noe other person or persons but the Churchwardens for the time being have liberty to nominate any person to the Vestry to be admitted as a member thereof. An enti-y which occurs under date 22nd July, 1712 almost suggests that seats on the Vestry were at a premium :— Thomas Green, Esq., being chosen a Vestryman of this Parish and haveing given the sum of Twenty Pounds to some Publick Charity within this Parish. Ordd-—That the said Twenty Pounds according to the desire of the said Mr. Green be given to the Grey Coat Hospital! and the Blew Coat Boys belonging to the Chappel School in the proporcons hereinafter menconed (vizt.) Three fourths parts being Fifteen Pounds to the Grey Coat Hosp!e- and the other fourth part being Five Pounds to the Boys belonging to the Blew Coat School. Ordd-—That the Churchwardens be desired to wait on the said Thomas Green, Esq., and Return him thanks from this Vestry for the same. A similar note is also made in respect of ' Mr. Thomas Wisdome,' who gave five pounds, divided in the same proportions. The regulations governing the nominations and elections were rigidly observed:— Sunday, 16th Nov., 1712. Resolved That it is the opinion of this Vestry That Capt. Thos. Butler cannot now be Elected a Vestryman he haveing not been Regularly Nominated by either of the Church Wardens. Meindum this Day Capt. Thomas Butler was nominated by Mr. Richard Filer p'sent ChurchWarden to be Vestryman. Oidd- That the said Nomination be taken into Consideration the next Vestry. Sunday, Feb. 8, 1712-13.—Ordd- That Capt. Butler be elected a Vestryman of this Parish and that the Churchwardens wait upon him and acquaint him therewith and desire his advise and assistance at Vestrys. According to Hallam* the country was in so thriving a * Constitutional History, Vol. III., p. 543. 31 state daring the reign of George II. that there was a surplus revenue after payment of all charges. " It was impossible that the kingdom could become, as it did under George II., more flourishing through its great natural fertility, its extensive manufacture of linen, and its facilities for commerce, or that a House of Commons could be constructed on a model more thoroughly English." To these conditions may be attributed, perhaps, the willingness of those in high social rank to share in the duties of local self-government. A random selection will be sufficient to show the constitution of the Vestry of that period:— Date. Members of the Vestry. 1725 Duke of Richmond (2). 1726 Duke of Dorsett (2). 1732 Sir John Evelyn (6). 1732 Earl of Berkshire (4). 1732 Horace Walpole. 1732 Lord Robert Walpole (Earl of Orford) (3). 1735 Duke of Montague (2). 1738 Earl of Abingdon (6). 1738 Earl of Pembroke. 1738 Lord Lincoln. 1738 Sir Joseph Ayloffe. 1738 Earl of Macclesfield (1). 1738 Earl of Onslow (x). 1738 Duke of Portland (2). 1742 Rt. Hon. Saml. Sandys, Chancellor of the Exchequer. 1758 John Wilkes. 1763 Earl of Halifax. 1. Resided in the New Palace. Were not assessed, owing to the exemption of Government Property from rating, but paid £1 14s. 4d. each to the Poor Rate, which represented a Rateable Value of £91 10s. Od. 2. Resided in Privy Gardens. Not assessed, but contributed of their "Benevolence" to the Poor. 3. Resided in Downing Street, ditto, 4. Rated at £150 in Duke Street. 5. Rated at £100 in Duke Street. 6. Resided in College Street, " Benevolence." 32 Date. Members of the Vestry. 1770 Jeremy Bentham (7). 1774 Duke of Newcastle. 1774 Duke of Rutland. 1793 Sir George Jackson, Bart. 1810 Rt. Hon. Spencer Perceval. 1812 Rt. Hon. George Rose. 1812 Rt. Hon. Charles Abbott, Speaker. 1814 Rt. Hon. Nicholas Vansittart, Chancellor of the Exchequer. 1818 Rt. Hon. C. Manners Sutton, Speaker. The assassination of Mr. Spencer Perceval in the lobby of the House of Commons is thus referred to in the Vestry minutes of 14th May, 1812:— This Meeting deeply lamenting the horrid and atrocious Assassination of the late Right Honorable Spencer Perceval, Chancellor of His Majesty's Exchequer, a Member of this Vestry, in the Lobby of the House of Commons, on Monday last, and sincerely participating in the National feeling upon the melancholy event, Do unanimously Resolve that the ancient Custom of ringing the bells upon the Election of Churchwardens be dispensed with upon the present occasion. Meetings nf tho Vestry. Meetings of the Vestry were summoned at the instance of the Churchwardens, as the parish business required. There were no regular intervals or appointed times of meeting. When held on Sundays, which was frequently the case, the convenient hour was " after evening service," probably about half-past four in afternoon. On week days the hour of meeting was frequently eight o'clock in the morning. The Audit 7. He was at this time residing in York Street, and only 23 years of age. He subsequently occupied a house in Qneen Street, and frequently acted as Chairman of the Vestry, before and after his visit to Russia. The rating of the parish officers at this time is worthy of notice. The Churchwardens and Overseers, who were assessed at sums ranging between £21 and £!0, were not charged to the Poor Rate, apparently cx-ojjicio. For the same reason also Thomas Wood, the " Amen " ol Thieving Lane, was neither assessed nor charged; Lewis Lloyd, the "Deputy Amen," though assessed at £20 was not charged. The Vestry Clerk, the Steward of the Workhouse, the Bel! lingers, the "Bedels," and the Bearers, seem all to have been relieved from payment of the Poor Rate. 33 mittee was required to meet for several successive years at six o'clock in the morning. Parish Boundaries. Reference having already heen made, in the opening pages, to the various changes made in the limits of Westminster from the Saxon era onwards, it is only proposed to touch briefly here upon the proceedings of the Vestry thereon. Memorand. That holden the fifthe Daye of June 1606 the vestry men hereafter named Did order and agree that the Churchwardens for the tyme beeinge and all other Churchwardens wch shall be choscn hereafter shall not disburse nor bestowe of the church or parishe goodes above the some of ffive poundes for the pambalacons to Kensington or other boundes of the parishe Duringe the whole time of two yeres wherein any such churchwardens shall contineuc in the sayd office and if there shal bee above the some of ffive poundes bestowed in anye two yeres in any such perambulacons that then the sayd churchwardens shall pay the surplusage themselves and not bee allowed above five poundes for two yeres upon their aceomptes. Wednesday, 9th May, 1679—It is Ordered that a Perambulation be made this yeare for Yisiteing the Parish Bounds according to the discretion of the Churchwardens who are desired to be moderate in the Charge thereof. Wednesday, 6th April, 1681—That the Church Wardens be desired not to make any Enterteynmt at Visiteiug the out Bounds of the parish this yeare saveing for Boyes onely and such officers as are needfull And as to the Inn bounds ye charge thereof is left to the discretion of the Church Wardens which shall be Allowed in their Acct. Sunday 15th Apll 1683—Ordered that the Preambulation for this yeare bee kept according to the antient custome Soe that the charges doe not exceed Twenty Nobles* (but no Wine) besides the charge of the bread and cheese and beere for the boyes for the Outward bounds And for the inward bounds to be kept alsoe according to the antient custome and the charges thereof to be left to the Discretion of the Churchwardens. The time honoured custom of " beating the bounds " was observed every two years, and orders in the foregoing terms occur many times. The elaborate Letters Patent of Henry VIII. (1534), already reproduced in extenso, see pp. 5 & 6, did not effectually remove the uncertainties in the minds of the *The value of the "Noble," a gold coin, was 6s. 8d. The limit of expenditure was thus £6 13s. 4d., representing about £30 in the present day. D 34 parish officers of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. The question as revived in October, 1708, was not settled for several years:— The Churchwardens acquainted tlie Vestry that the marks sett up by this parish at their preambulacon are very frequently put out as supposed by the Churchwardens or others belonging to the parish of St. Martin in the Feilds to the great prejudice of this parish. Referred to the Rev" Dr. Nicho. Onley Minister of this parish to Discourse the Revd Dr. Lancaster Vicar of St Martin in the Feilds about the same. Twelve months elapsed without the receipt of a report from Dr. Onley, whereupon the Vestry appointed a Committee, with a view to a conciliatory settlement, but without success. The erased marks were consequently restored, and a substantial reward offered for information as to persons who might thereafter be found defacing them. These precautions were however unavailing:— 25 May, 1732.—The Rev. Mr. Widmore and the Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that the Parish of St. Martin in the Fields in their Perambulation on Ascension Day last had made an Encroachment on the Northern Boundary of this Parish by affixing their Bound Marks so as to take Privy Garden and divers Houses and Places adjoyning into their Parish ; whereupon they had advised with divers Gentlemen of this Vestry what was fitting to be done on this occasion to preserve the rights of this parish who were of opinion (in regard a Vestry could not possibly be summoned to meet together within the Rogation Week in which all Perambulations are made) to go the Inner Bounds Perambulation of this Parish in Order to obliterate the marks so sett up by the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields as aforesaid. That pursuant to this advice they with several of the Gentlemen of the Vestry, parish Officers, and divers Inhabitants, attended by the Beadles, Charity Children and others of the parish, went by the said Inn-Bounds Perambulation on Saturday last when they did in the most publick manner cause the Bound Marks so sett up by St. Martin's parish to be quite defaced and obliterated. And the Church Wardens further acquainted the Vestry That on this Occasion they had expended and laid out the sume of Seven pounds and thirteen shillings which they pray may be allowed them in their account. Ordered that the said sume of Seven Pounds and thirteen shillings be allowed the said Clmrchwardens on their account. May 25, 1750. The Churchwardens reported having fixed (on a Perambulation) marks in the usual places about Whitehall & St. James' Park, viz., on the rails at the head of the canal 35 and on the north east corner of the garden wall belonging to Sir Thomas Robinson's House at Whitehall Stairs. Also reported a further obliteration of the marks by inhabitants of St. Martin-in-the-Fields. Churchwardens authorised to restore the marks obliterated by St. Martin's people. Nov. 3, 1752. A Committee report their proceedings, defining the boundaries according to their opinion, and that St. Martin's had disagreed, the Committees, having broken up "without coming to any agreement or appointing other meeting." Resolved—That the Vestry will by no means consent to treat with Saint Martin's about the Boundaries in dispute, upon any other terms than those that have been proposed by their Committee. Septr. 13, 1753. The Churchwardens submit an Instrument executed between this Parish and St. Martin's relating to the Boundaries. Ordered that a Fair copy be framed and hung up in the Vestry. Notwithstanding the tendency in the present day to make light of these periodical surveys, their careful observance in times past has resulted in an annual income of upwards of £1,000 a year in rates which would otherwise have been lost. The important case of Burrell versus Nicholson, decided in the Court of King's Bench in 1833, may be said to have turned in favour of the parish mainly on the evidence of ancient inhabitants, who were able to testify to their personal recollections of having " beaten the bounds" at particular spots, whereby the houses in question were shewn to have been for many years within the parochial limits. Duties of the Vestry in relation to Church Matters. For the entire period (300 years) over which this chapter extends, one of the principal duties assumed by the Vestry was that of regulating the affairs of the church, a duty which Mas performed with such strictness and precision that neither Minister nor Churchwardens were free agents. The annual choice of the two Churchwardens was in the hands of the Vestry absolutely. These officers were, however, merely executive agents, having no independent discretion with regard to the protection of the sacred edifice, the superintendence of D 2 36 public worship, the assignment of seats, and the execution of the parochial regulations, elsewhere entrusted exclusively to Churchwardens. All these, and other functions too numerous to mention, were jealously controlled by the Vestry. The "Articles of Agreement," copied below, point to an excessive exercise of discretion by the Churchwardens prior to 1591, which may account for the unusual restraint subsequently exercised:— Articles of Agreement made and concluded upon the Seventhe daye of Ffebruarie Anno Dmi 1591 by the general assent and consent of the vestrie men and churchwardens for the tyme now beinge for better governement and benefyte for the Churche as followeth vizt.:— 1. Imprimis that noe Churchwarden hereafter shall make election or bringe in anye man to be Churchwarden but by the generall choyse and election of the vestrie men or the moste pte of them for the tyme beinge The said Churchwardens for the tyme beinge to be allwaies of the number of the said Electors. 2. Item that noe Churchwarden in the tyme of his or there office shall buylde or buye anyethinge in to of or for the churche or churche yarde of the churche money above the value of xls. wthout the consent of the vestrie men or the most pte of them for the tyme beinge under their handes in wrytinge unlesse he or they will paye the overplus of his or there owne proper charges. ****** 4. Item it is further ordered and agreed that noe Churchwarden hereafter or nowe beinge shall sell away any the plate armes or furnyture bell or bells organs or any other thinge from the said Church neither shall pull downe anye of the glasse wyndowes to the ende to alter or change the glass but onelye to amende as nede shall requyre upon payne that he or they shall paye suche recompense as by the Vestrie men or the most pte of them shall awarde agavnste him or them and if he or they shall doe anye thinge in contempt of theise articles and orders wthout there handes in wrytinge or the most pte of them first obtayned then it shalbe lawfull for the said vestrie men or the most pte of them to put oute such twoe or one of them as they shall see good And appoynt other in their sayd places. 11. Item it is further agreed and ordered that noe pson man or woman having a pewe in the Churche and dothe not frequent the same once in three monthes unless he she or they have anye lawfull lett to the contrarie he she or they shall lose the benefit of the sayd pewe and the Churchwardens for the tyme 37 beinge shall see it executed And if defalte be made by the then Churchwardens for due execucion hereof then the said wardens shall forfeite to the use of the poore for there necligence therein vjs viijd viz iijs iiijd a peece. * * * * * * Even the pew rents and charges for the ringing of the bells were adjusted by the Vestry:— 8th Mail, 1593.—At a Vestrie the Day and yere abovesaid in the prte of the Vestriemen whose names are hereunder written it was agreed and orderyd that whatsoever Inhabitante of this parishe who shall happen to burrye his wife shall not claim chalendge or have any right unto his wifes pewe after hir death, but to be dysposed by the Churchwardens for the Tyme being except any such pson soe burrienge his wife be or have bene high Constable burgesse or vestrieman and it is further orderid that any such man shall reserve to himself soe that his next wife hir pewe paying within vj wekes after hir death xijd and yerely also xijd to the churchwardens for the same. And that whoesoever heretofore hath burried his wife and not paide xijd according to a former order Shall alsoe lose the beneffitt of there wives pewe and the churchwardens to place whome they shall think good notwithstanding any custom or order to the contrarye confirmed by or handes the day and yere abovesaid. An order taken in the vestry for the prises and rates of the belles and certayne pewes the xij day of January, 1594, in the xxxvij yere of quene Elizabeth. Upon consideration had of the grete sorames of mony lately disbursed out of the churchbox about the makings of one grete bell deper by a note than any other which was in the church before, and about the new castinge of the other belles and to the end that the rates may bo'hereafter certaynely knowen Therefore the Vestry men whose names are subscribed have rated taxed and assessed the new pewes and other things hereafter mentioned and expressed as foloweth Ffirst every man which shall be first on either of the two uppermost or highest pewes on the north side of our ladye chappell or in any of the fouer new pewes lately erected in the upper ende of the churche without the quyer and hath not ben placed before in this parish shall pay to the use of the churche thirtene shillinges fouer pence And if he have been placed before in this parishe then he shall pay for his remove into any of the said pewes ten shillings except such pson be or have ben a burgesse high constable or Vestryman in this parish Every such person shall pay for his remove six shillings eighte pence. This order was extended at great length to various other matters relating to the letting of the said pews to women, 38 and regulating the "knylls of the grete and seconde belles." Other orders were passed in the same year, directing the sale of the " smaller payre of organes," defining the duties of the sextons, and laying down a scale of charges for interments. An entry on the last-named subject is transcribed here:— The xiiijth daye of Aprill, Ao dm. 1611. Memorandn that it ys ordered by Consent in ye Vestrie ye daye and yeare Above written by us whose names hereunder are subscribed that all persons (of what condicon soever they bee) that shall wthi" twoe yeares next After ye date hereof bee buried in this pishchurcheyarde of St. Margaretts in Westminster shall bee buried in suche pte of the same onely as hath beene lately taken in dedicated e' consecrated to yc holie use And that for every corpse there buried in a Coffyn there shalbee payed for the Grave fouer shillings, and that for Every Corpse there buried wthout a Coffyn there shalbee payed for the grave twelve pence. And itt ys also ordered y' everye Grave shalbe made sixe foote deepe in ye grounde And yf anie grave shalbe made in the same grounde of lesse deepth then Aswell ye sexton as yc grave maker shall loose their ffee el dutie for that grave or funerall And that the graves shalbee made in a Streighte lyne asneere as inaye bee Conveniently one by the side of A nother. Towards the end of Charles I.'s reign the admission of the Minister was subject to the voice of the Vestry:— At a Vesfery holden 28th August 1617 it is ordered that Mr. John Binns, Minister, shall oficiate the Cure of this parrish, he having produced Certifict from sum of the Assembly of Divines to be a man of Able pts and unblameable life and conversacon. This entry is the more remarkable owing to the officiating Ministers having been " intruded" by Parliament between 104L and 1646. From the next entry something may be gleaned of the circumstances of the clergy of the period :— The 13th daye of Aprill 1019. That the Churchwardens doe give unto John Binns, Minister (who lately officiated in this parish), ffortie shillings towards the bearinge of his charges in his Travell to Yorkeshire, whereby this parish may be freed from any further charge in relieving him. Although the appointment of the succeeding three Ministers appears, from the silence of the Minutes, to have 39 been made without the aid of the Vestry, they were instrumental in the removal of two of them:— Att a Vestrie held the first of Octobre 1657. Resolved that in obedience to his Highnesse the Lord Protectors nominacon and appointm. bearing date the 22th day of September last remaining with the Churchwardens Mr. Vyner and Doctor Warmstree bee removed from preaching in the parish church of Margaretts Westmr. and that Mr. Edward Pearce be permitted to preach there on the Lords Daies in the forenoones and Mr. Seth Wood on the Lords Daies in the afternoones and that they the said Mr. Pearce and Mr. Wood shall have and enioy such advantages and maintenance as shall be raised in such sort as hath been usual here. Mr. Walcott (p. 120) states that Mr. Vyner was taken as a prisoner to the Upper Bench, and that Dr. Warmstree was removed as a notorious delinquent. The same self-derived power as the Vestry exercised in other church matters was employed in relation to the choice and appointment of the Officers of the Church, from the Lecturer downwards. From 1591 to 1693 this power was never subjected to question—bearers, gravemakers, bell ringers, church cleaners, sextons, parish clerks, organists, gallery keepers, and others were all subject to the will of the Vestry. On the 3rd of January, 1693, however, one Ezekiel Turner attended before the Vestry to announce himself as gravemaker appointed by the Bishop of Rochester, then Dean of Westmiuster. A deputation from the Vestry was forthwith dispatched to interview his Lordship, whose refusal to withdraw the right he had asserted was warmly debated by the Vestry on the following Sunday, when a resolution was passed declaring the choice to be in the Vestry absolutely. A search Committee was directed to examine the ancient books of Orders, a task which was commenced at seven o'clock in the morning of the next Tuesday. Two days afterwards the proceedings are thus entered:— " Whereas John Parker Esq & some other gentlemen of this Vestry have in pursuance of an Order of the one and twentieth instant 40 viewed the several antient books of the Vestry & reported their procedure therein & in an abstract of antient orders relating to the choice of church officers Which abstract of original orders being publicly read before us whose names are subscribed, We do therefore declare that it is our unanimous opinion that the sole right of election of parish clerk, organist, sexton, woman that cleans the church & pews, gravemaker, gallery keepers, bearers, bellringers, searchers, & all others church officers is in the Vestry of this parish and none others & hath been so time out of mind." A Deputation was commissioned to communicate this fiuding to the Bishop, and two gravemakers, with an assistant, were forthwith engaged by the Vestry. Having vindicated their supremacy in the matter, the Vestry conferred upon the unsuccessful nominee of his Lordship the Dean, the office of sixth bearer " upon consideration that he hath severall small children." Twenty years later the appointment by the Dean and Chapter of one Roger Gethin as parish clerk was sternly resented by the Vestry. The ancient records were again searched:— Wed., 8 July, 1713.—Ordd that the ancient Books of Orders of Vestry and other papers in the custody of the Churchwardens be inspected into to find out the custome and usage of choosing Church Officers * * A report was presented by the Committee a fortnight later, but as it gave only abstracts of the past Orders of the Vestry, the Clerk was instructed to transcribe the same verbatim. Within a week these verbatim extracts were presented by the Committee, who entered with some warmth into the controversy with the Dean and Chapter. With a view to the speedy termination thereof the Vestry took counsel's opinion:— Thurs., 13 Aug., 1713.—(Sir John Crosse, Bart., in the chair). The Opinion of Sir Edward Northey, Knt., Attorney General, Sr Bobert Raymond, Knt., Sollicitor Gen", John Ward and Ffrancis Annesly, Esq", Councillors at Law under their hands in Writings, touching the right of Election of a Barish Clerk of this Parish were delivered unto this Vestry and Bead. The Churchwardens acquainted this Vestry that they had received a Certificate from the 11' Revd Bather in God Ffrancis Lord Bp 41 of Rochester and Dean of Westmr which was in these words following, Viz' To the Revd Dr Onely Curate and to Mr. Michael Tanner and Mr. Ffrancis Mackreth Churchwardens of the Parish of St. Margaret. This is to acquaint you, that in right of the Church of Westmr I as Dean of the said Church, have nominated and appoint Roger Gethin to be Clarke of St. Margarets Church in the room of John Clayton lately decd and that the said Roger Gethin hath obtained a ffaculty under the Seal of the Comissary of our Jurisdiction, for the Execucon of the said Office Jul. 28, 1713. Fr. Rossen. Resolved that this Vestry does not acquiesce in the Dean of Westmr's appointment of Roger Gethin to be Clerk of this Parish. Resolved that the Right of Electing of a Parish Clark is in this Vestry, and that (it) is in them only to choose. The Attorney General and Mr. Annesly advised against the right of the Vestry, while the Solicitor General and Mr. Ward were of opinion that the contention of the Vestry was sound, whereupon the Vestry installed Henry Turner, who had been Organist of the Church in 1708, to the post. At the following meeting of the Vestry (Sat. 15 Aug., 1713)— The R' Revd Father in God Lord Bp of Rochester and Dean of Westmr came to this Vestry and took notice of what had been done by this Vestry on Thursday the 13th of this instant August upon the choice of the Parish Clerk and desired that he might have the Perusal of the antient Books in order to Compare a Copy of a Report made by a Commee of this Vestry and to see how it agreed with the Original Entries and at the same time expressed his unwillingness to enter into a Law Suit upon the accompt of the Parish Clerke place and therefore proposed to referr that business to arbitration. A Committee was appointed to attend his Lordship with the books. Tues., 20th Aug., 1713.—The following letter was read:— " August the 20th, 1713. If the BishP of Rochester's proposal made on Saturday last for referring the Dispute about a Parish Clark shall be agreed to by the Vestry, the Bishop's willing on his part (and doubts not but his Brethren of the Chapter will be likewise willing) to referr ye Decission of the dispute to the very Councill 42 Consulted by ye Vestry on this occasion: the Attorney Gen11, the Solr Gen", Mr. Annesley and Mr. Ward. But if the Vestry shall decline any manner of Referrence and choose rather to have this matter Judicially determined, the Bishop hopes and desires that the Cause may be Carryed on as amicably and with as little delay as possible. Resolved that it is ye opinion of this Vestry that the right of choosing Parish Clerk is so well warranted by the Precedents upon their Books y' they cannot think it reasonable to give up y' right without a Legall Determination but y' according to the Lord Bishop of Rochester's Proposall this Vestry is very desirous that the cause may be carried on amicably and with as little delay as Possible and are ready to enter into measures to try it by Consent of both Parties. So far the controversy had only extended over a month. Counsel were now instructed on both sides, and a delay of three months follows:— Sunday, December 13, 1713. The Churchwardens presented to this Vestry a Monition from the Comisary of the Ecclesiastical Court of the Dean and Chapter of Westmr wcl was served on them on Thursday the 10th instant, wch Monition was in the words following, Viz': to Michael Tanner one of the Churchwdns of the Parish of St. Marg'8 Westmr in the County of Middx by Virtue of the Monition herewith shown to you under Seal I monish you to bring into and leave in the Registry of ye Dean and Chapter Court of Westmr on or before the 14th day of this Inst Decembr all the Vestry books belonging to the Parish of St. Marg's Westminster aforesaid under pain of the Law and your Contempt herein and further to do and Receive as to Law and Justice shall appurtain and the like directed in the same words to Francis Mackreth the other Churchwdn. Upon reading whereof the Vestry came to the Resolution following Resolved that it is the declared opinion of this Vestry that no Vestry Books be taken or delivered out of this Vestry but by Order of Vestry. The record of the dispute extends over more than twenty pages of the minutes, so that further tracing the matter here in its various stages is forbidden. Suffice it to say that the judgment of the Court was for the Vestry. While the foregoing suit was pending, a futile effort was made by the Dean and Chapter to appoint a Sexton. The Vestry sustained their right without litigation:— 43 Friday Jan 15, 171¾. His Lordsp the Dean of Westmr acquainted this Vestry that as dean he has nominated one Thos Bedder to be Sexton of this Parish in the Room of Hen Robarts deced and offered him to be admitted to That place. Then the Bishop of Rochester left the Vestry Sr Thos Crosse, Bar1 in the chair. Resolved nemine contradicente that by antient usage the Sole right of choosing a Sexton of this Parish when that office is Void is in the Vestry or in the Major part of them Present. An appointment was forthwith made by the Vestry whereby the nomiuee of the Dean was superseded. The rights of the inhabitants were jealously guarded on every occasion of the choice of a Lecturer. All the arrangements for the election were made by the Vestry, the poll lasting sometimes for four days. Two elections taken quite at random from among the numerous records on the subject are all that can be noticed here:— Monday, 15 Dec., 1801.—The Churchwardens reported that by the Death of the Revd. Dr. Smith a Vacancy has occurred in the Office of Lecturer. Resolved that it is the Opinion of this Vestry that the right of Election of Lecturer of this Parish is in the Inhabitants rated to the Parochial Taxes. That any Gentleman intending to Offer himself for the Lectureship Do signify the same to Mr. Church Warden Kew on or before the 24th inst. and that no Application will be received after that time. That the Clerk do inform the several Candidates they are requested by the Vestry to preach a Probationary Sermon at some convenient time and place previous'to the Election of which they will have Notice. * * * * Resolved That the Churchwardens be requested to lay a Case before Dr. Swabey to receive information from him what the Duty of a Lecturer of this Parish is. Monday, 4 Jany., 1802.—The Churchwardens also Reported that in pursuance of the request at the last Vestry they had laid before Dr. Swabey a Case to ascertain the Duty of Lecturer of this Parish. Dr. Swabey being Commissary declined writing an anwer thereto—but informed them he was of Opinion that the reading of the Evening Prayers did not form any part of the Lecturer's Duty. Resolved That Mr. Stephenson the Vestry Clerk be desired to apply by letter to the Revd. Jn° Davis for the use of the Pulpit in Saint Margaret's Chapel for the Gent" who are 44 Candidates to succeed the late Dr. Smith as Lecturer to preach their Probationary Sermons and to inform Mr. Davies who the Candidates are. Resolved That the Church Wardens in the event of the Revd. Mr. Davies consent to the above request have authority to settle the time and Order of Preaching the Probationary Sermons and give Notice thereof by Hand Bills to the Inhabitants. Wednesday, 27 Jany., 1802.—It was agreed That the following should be the form of the Notices to the Inhabitants. " Parish "of Saint Margaret Westminster."—" The Vestry of this "Parish having resolved it as their Opinion That the Right "of Election of a Lecturer is in the Inhabitants Men and "Women rated to the Parochial Rates.—Notice is hereby "given to such Inhabitants That the Election of a Lecturer "in the room" of the Revd. Dr. Smith deceased will begin and "be proceeded upon by Ballot in the Vestry Room of the "Parish Church on Wednesday the 3d day of February next "from the hour of ten o'clock in the forenoon untill two in "afternoon and continued during the same hours on the two "following days. The Candidates for the Lectureship are the "Revd. T. A. Attwood, the Revd. W. W. Dakins and the Revd. "Josiah Pratt." Thursday, 11 Feb., 1802.—The following account of the proceedings and result of the Ballot for a Lecturer to succeed the late Dr Smith was laid before this meeting by Mr Church Warden Kew and Ordered to be entered on the Minutes of this day, viz. "At a Meeting of the Inhabitants Householders held in the "Vestry Room of the Parish of Saint Margaret, Westr. "On the 3d day of February, 1802, Mr. Jno. Kew, Senior Ch Wn "in the Chair. The Ballot for Lecturer Commenced at 10 "O'Clock, and closed at two O'Clock precisely and was "continued during the same hours on the three following "days— 1st day 2d day 3d day Total "For the Rev. T. A. Atwood 335 204 140 679 " ,, Rev. W. W. Dakins 8 8 7 23 " ,, Rev. Josiah Pratt 85 77 28 190 892 "Whereupon the said Rev. T. A. Atwood was by the Chairman declared to be duly elected." Election of ministers by the popular vote was evidently attended with disorder and inconvenience. On Wednesday, 25 Oct., 1820, six applications for the vacant lecturership 45 were laid before Vestry, when the Vestry Clerk was instructed to inform Dr. Fynes (the Rector) of the names of the Candidates, and to apply to him for the use of the Pulpit for them to preach the Probationary Sermons. Friday, Nov. 3, 1820.—A Letter was read from Dr. F ynes:— "Probationary Sermons are as I own very improper exhibitions in my opinion but as I believe Custom has made them usual upon such occasions, I cannot refuse the application of the Vestry. * * I could wish to make it a condition with the Lecturer that he should read the Afternoon Prayers on Sunday as well as preach the Lecture * * and I would likewise suggest to the Vestry that since my Incumbency I have been materially injured in the receipt of Easter Dues by the Lecturer collecting his emolument before the Incumbent begins his Collection at Easter. Mr. Stevens' Friends were very zealous in his behalf in this instance and I believe very successful." Thursday, Nov. 30, 1820.—A letter from Dr. Fynes was read:— "When I answer'd your letter which contained the List of Candidates for the vacant Lectureship I made no observation upon the name of Mr. Saunders because at that time I was not aware of his being the person who officiates at the Broadway Chapel. * * I could by no means consent to allow the use of Saint Margaret's Pulpit to Mr. Saunders, and that if notwithstanding this refusal, he should be elected Lecturer I would not give my sanction to such an Election, * * After the sound and orthodox Doctrine delivered to the Parishioners of Saint Margaret so ably by the late Lecturer, I feel it my duty to guard them against being deluded and led away by the wild and visionary effusions of those who arrogate to themselves the character of Evangelical Preachers, and I trust that the good sense of the Vestry and the principal Inhabitants will induce them to co-operate * * in our endeavours to avert such an evil, and to prevent, if possible, those disgraceful scenes which have sometimes been exhibited by Competitors upon similar occasions in other Parishes of the Metropolis. * A Notice was also laid before the meeting which had been served upon the Clerk of the Vestry, of which the following is a copy:— Cromwell, Nov, 22d, 1820. I hereby notify to all whom it may concern that I positively refuse Mr. Isaac Saunders the liberty of preaching, or in any manner officiating in the Parish Church of Saint Margaret, 46 Westminster, and furthermore declare that I will prevent his appointment to the Lectureship of the said Parishes so far as I am legally authorized. Wednesday, Dec. 20, 1820. A 'Report of Proceedings' of the election is entered on the minutes similar to the extract already given, the voting having been as follows:— The Rev. R. V. B. Sandilands 449 The Rev. J. C. Denham 16 The Rev. Robert Drought 4 The Rev. J. H, Phillips 31 The Rev. Isaac Saunders 492 No. of votes recorded 992 The Rev. Isaac Saunders was thereupon declared duly elected and chosen to be Lecturer. A letter was read from Dr. Fynes, dated l1th Dec., 1820, which is partially transcribed below:— "I request you will inform the Churchwardens that I as Incumbent disapprove of Mr. Saunders being appointed Lecturer and have repeatedly signified to Mr. Saunders and to the Vestry that I should not consent to such an Election. I wish it to be distinctly understood, that no one can be authorised to perform the duty of Lecturer of St. Margaret's Parish who is not sanctioned by the Incumbent and licensed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster." And the following was also received:— " Cromwell, December 16, 1820. " Sir,—Mr. Saunders thought proper to send me by yesterday's post, a Copy of the Minutes of the Vestry respecting his Election to the Lectureship; I have returned it to him to-day and referred him to you for the answer I sent you to that Paper. "It is with the utmost concern I heard from Mr. Rodber, and read in the Newspapers the infamous behaviour of Mr. Saunder's Partisans in Saint Margaret's Church on Sunday last. I trust the Ringleaders in this most disgraceful Riot will be brought to Justice and meet with the Punishment they justly deserve. It appears to me that the Vestry are call'd upon to express to the Public their unanimous detestation of the brutal Assault committed upon their Minister in the House of God, when engaged in the discharge of his sacred Duty; and that they ought to offer a reward for the Conviction of the Instigator and Promoter of such an atrocious unheard-of Outrage. 47 " I beg you will communicate these sentiments to the Vestry, and am Sir, your obedient Servant, To Mr. Stephenson, CHARLES FYNES. 7, Great Queen Street, Westminster." It was thereupon resolved that the Churchwardens be requested to take the necessary measures for the election of a Lecturer, the Incumbent having refused to grant the use of the Pulpit to the Rev. Isaac Saunders lately chosen, and that the Churchwardens be also requested to inform the inhabitants thereof. The second Ballot, which was taken on Thursday, 28 Dec., 1820, resulted in the election of The Rev. R V. B. Sandilands. Saturday, 6th Jan. 1821.—A letter was read from Dr. Fynes, dated 1st Jan., observing "that there appears to be a determination to resist any wish to prevent the evils of Popular Elections of a Lecturer in the Parish and there exists great jealousy lest the Inhabitants should be deprived of the most mischievous priviledge of voting upon every vacancy, my endeavours to serve the Parish in this respect must cease. "Upon the late Election I felt myself conscientiously bound to object to Mr. Saunders, and I thought a fair opportunity offer'd of conferring upon the Parishioners the greatest obligation by effectually preventing a recurrence of such scandalous outrages as were committed in the Church in consequence of a popular canvas." "The Vestry taking into Consideration the foregoing Letter are of opinion that so long as the Lecturer continue to look to the Parishioners for a remuneration of their Services that the choice of a Lecturer should still be with them ; and that the mode heretofore adopted of a Ballot is the most efficacious for determining the Choice of those Gentlemen who may offer themselves upon any Yacancy." Commencing with the coronation of Charles Churchyard. (1660), numerous references occur relating to the letting by the Yestry of the Churchyard for the provision of platforms, scaffolding, and other matters in connection with the procession of the Sovereigns to the Abbey. Some of the more interesting are:— 5 Ffeby., 1661-2.—Also ordered that Mr. Garratt does out of the 61i. 13s. 4d. in his hands of the money oweing by him for 48 scaffolding in the Churchyarde pay unto Nicholas Usher and James Current 56s. for gravelling the way att his Ma" Coronation. Wednesday, 27 April, 1670.—Whereas the ffunerall of the late Lord Gen11 Monke Duke of Albemarle is shortly to be solemnized it is thereupon Ordered That the Churchwardens doe lett (to be Skaffold) soe much of the Church Yard wall as have been formerly lett by their predecessors at times of Coronations greate ffuneralls or the like for the best advantage of the Poore of this Parish. Wednesday Apl. 1, 1685 (James II.)—Ordered that the Constables may make use of the inside of the watchhouse for the use of theire wives and friends to see the Coronation as a favour not as a right and making good what damage shall bee done to the same. 8 Apll., 1685.—Ordered that the Churchwardens doe buy a Hogshead of Clarett and all such other things at his psent Maties Coronation as have been accustomed and were done by this Parish att the Coronation of his late Matie King Charles the Second and that they take such of the Vestry to their assistance as they shall think fitt and all the charges thereof to bee allowed at passing their Accompt. Saturday, 23rd March, 1688-9.—(William III. and Mary).— Ordered that the Churchwardens doe provide a Hogshead of Clarett and other things usuall att the Coronation and the charges thereof to be allowed in their Account. At the funeral of Queen Mary (II) in 1694, the "bonehouse, conduite, watch-house, and engine house in the churchyard" were let for the erection of scaffoldings upon payment of £40. At the coronation of Queen Anne (1702) £184 was produced from the same source, the Churchwardens being charged to "provide a hogshead of claret, musick, and other usual things." A claim was, on this occasion, made by the Dean and Chapter to a right over the Churchyard, which the Vestry resented under the circumstances recited below:— April 10, 1702.—Whereas it has been represented to this Vestry by the Churchwardens that they had recd a message from the Dean and Chapter importing that it was expected that leave should be asked of the Dean and Chapter for the building scaffolds on the ground in the Churchyard for the coronation. Now We the said Vestry having inspected our Books of Precedents and discoursed several Churchwardens that have been concerned in letting the said ground at the two last coronations and the 49 funeral of the late Queen cannot find either by our books or the said persons that any leave hath at any time been asked of the said Chapter for that purpose. Therefore We, the said Vestry, being satisfied in our title to the said ground will stand by the said Churchwardens in what they have done in pursuance of the order of the six and twentieth day of March last in reference to the said ground. Following the precedents, the Vestry petitioned the Lords of the Treasury praying that the cloth, boards, rails, &c., used in connection with the Coronation might be granted for the benefit of the poor of the parishes of St. Margaret, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and St. Clement-Danes. "A small parcell of the boards and railes" was given by the Vestry to the Governors of the Grey Coat Hospital. As the Coronation of George I. approached, The Vestry Ordered on Sunday, Sept. 12, 1714, "That it be referred to the Churchwdns to Treat about letting the ground belonging to this Parish for the Erecting and building Scaffolds agst y Coronation of his Matie King George and that they report the contents of the said Ground and the Sumes offered by any person or persons willing to take the same at the next Vestry." On the following Sunday:— "The Churchwardens in Pursuance of an Order of the last Vestry Reported that the Ground wch has been usually lett by this P'ish on publick Occasions Contains One hundred eighty and four Feet in Front towards King Street and Sanctuary including the Bone house the Conduit house the Paviours Yard the Watch house and Engine house Exclusive of a passage of Seven feet by the Feathers Tavern to be left open to the North'Door of St. Margtt Church They further report they have treated with Mr. Robert Phipps and Mr. Dixon who Do offer the sume of Two hundred pounds for the Ground above mentioned to make good all Damage that may be done to the Walls or Building on the sd Ground and to leave a Passage of six Feet wide and Eight feet high for Passengers to go under the Scaffolds into the Church Yard." After these platforms were erected, a loss was sustained by the contractors in consequence of "the rudeness and insolence of the soldiers in hindering persons coming to their scaffolds in order to their taking places," in consideration of which the Vestry refunded £60 of the payment made. e 50 Although no record is preserved of the use of the Churchyard itself, a claim was based upon the user of its surroundings on the occasion of an exceptional procession towards the close of the reign of George I. 6th Jane, 1725. Ordd That the Clerk of the Vestry do forthwith draw up a petition (on the behalf of the poor of this parish) to yc Rt. Honble the Lords Commrs of ye Treasury for their grant of the Boards Rails and Cloth to be used in the procession of the Knights of the Noble Order of the Bath to and from the Abby at their approaching Installation And that the Churchwardens be desired to deliver in the same. In connection with the procession to the Abbey on the occasion of the crowning of King George II., special privileges were extended to the parish officers:— 12th September, 1727.—Ord That John Fisher Sexton, Humphrey Drew the Vestry Clerk and John Willis Carpenter have leave upon their request now made to erect a Single Seat against ye North Wall of the Church Yard containing from the Church Yard Gate next ye Engine house to ye return of the said Wall One hundred & Sixty five foot or thereabouts they paying to ye Churchwardens five Guineas for ye land and Indemnifying the parish from all charges & trouble upon that Account. Ordd. Also That ye sd. John Fisher & Humphrey Drew have leave to erect three Rows of seats against ye West Wall of ye Church Yard and that ye Churchwardens do set out how much they shall have in front so as not to Obstruct ye Vew of the Conduit & Indemnifying the Parish upon that Acct. In preparation for the Coronation of George III. the Vestry empowered the Churchwardens to let the Churchyard for erecting scaffolds, subject to a space being reserved for Vestrymen. Instructions were also given in other respects:— Thursday, 6th November, 1760. Ordered that the Church-Wardens do provide a Hogshead of Port, Musick, and all such other things as have been accustomed and were usually done at former Coronations, and the charge thereof shall be allowed on their account. A claim made by the Dean and Chapter to a right over the Churchyard was again renewed:— Sat. 15 Aug. 1761—The Church Wardens acquainted this Vestry that they had received a Message from the Dean & Chapter of Westminster purporting that no Person whatever has any right to 51 Erect any Building in the Church Yard of St. Margaret Westminster or in the Broad Sanctuary without their previous consent for that Purpose. Resolved unanimously that the Ground in St. Margaret's Church Yard which the Churchwardens have let for erecting Scaffolding for Persons to see the Procession at the Coronation of his present Majesty for the benefit of this Parish, was so let by the Order and consent of this Vestry and that the Churchwardens and this Vestry have an Indubitable Right to let the same for the purpose aforesaid. Resolved that this Vestry will Indemnify the Churchwardens and Contractors for the said Ground from all Damages and Expenses whatever that shall or may happen to them or either of them on Account of the Premises. Resolved that the following Notice be given to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster by serving a Copy thereof on Mr. Gell their Chapter Clerk and that the like Notice be served on the persons now Erecting Scaffolding in the Church Yard at the West End thereof and that such Notices be signed by the Clerk. You are hereby desired to take Notice that the Churchwardens and Vestrymen of the Parish of St. Margaret Westminster in Vestry assembled, Insist that no Person has any Right to Erect any Building in the Church Yard of St. Margaret Westminster without their previous consent for that Purpose [so far to the Dean and Chapter and the following words to the Builders] and they do hereby give you Notice to desist from the Erection of any Building whatsoever thereon. as you will Answer the contrary at your Peril. Resolved that the following Notice be also given to the said Dean and Chapter:— You are hereby desired to take Notice that the Churchwardens and Vestrymen of St. Margaret Westmr in Vestry assembled Insist that the Highway round St. Margaret's Church Yard belongs to the said Parish and that they have a Right to Erect such like Buildings at the West End of the said Yard as the said Vestry have usually erected at the Coronation of former Kings and Queens of England. The financial result of the Vestry's action may be gathered from the subjoined:— Fri., 4ith Dec., 1761. The Churchwardens laid before this Vestry an Account of the Monies they received for the Ground in St. Margaret's Church Yard Let to erect scaffolding thereon for e 2 52 persons to see the procession at the coronation of their present Majestys, by which it appeared that they had Reced the sum of £628 9 6 And that they had Disbursed 196 16 2¾ Clear gain to the parish £431 13 3¼ This amount was on Monday, 17th May, 1764, appropriated to the reduction of the parish debt. The fountain of wine was omitted from the programme at the time of the accession of George IV., but the revenue to the parish did not suffer:— Wed. 31 May, 1820.—This Vestry was summoned to take into consideration & adopt such measures as may be necessary preparatory to the approaching Coronation. Resolved that the same be referred to a Committee to treat for letting the Ground belonging to the Parish in the Church Yard for viewing the Procession to the best advantage, To make the necessary accomodation for the Gentlemen of the Vestry & their Friends. The Committee submitted a Report upon which the following Resolutions were made:— "That with respect to the usual erection of a Fountain as it appeared to be the wish not only of the Officers of the Board of Works and the Dean and Chapter as it might give rise to tumult which it is understood was the Consequence at the last Coronation It was Resolved that the same should be abandoned but that the music should be retained. Resolved also That the Church Wardens and Committee be authorized to enter into an arrangement as a mutual accommodation between the Dean and Chapter and the Parish." Sat. 14 July, 1821. The Committee reported the appointment of the Coronation ceremony for the 19th inst., further details as to the scaffolds &c., and concluding:— "The Committee have provided a Military Band and refreshments for the Gentlemen of the Vestry and their friends and arrangements are making to enable the Company to partake of them with Comfort and Convenience." Thurs. 27 June, 1822. Mr. Churchwarden Trollope reported that he had in his hands the Sum of .£'453 5s. 8d. on account of the proceeds of the Coronation. Objection was taken in this instance, as previously, by the Dean and Chapter, on the ground that their right to be consulted had not been recognised; but the Vestry declined 53 to surrender the prerogative successfully maintained for nearly two hundred years. Claims of other kinds were resisted by the Vestry with equal concern for the parochial interests:— 7th December, 1670. Dr. Owtram haveing this day made Report touching an Application and Complaint lately made by Mr. Warder unto the Deane and Chapter concerning a Right which he pretendeth to have to bring Loaden Carts, or other Carriages through ye Church yard to his House or Houses situate therein. And the Vestrie haveing deliborately Considered of the Annoyance that will thereby arise to the sayd Ground by Rowting ye Graves and discovering and tearing up the Corps of Persons enterred there The Doctor is desired to Represent unto the sd Deane and Chapter That the Designe of this Vestrie by their endeavouring to keepe the sayd Church Yard as private as conveniently may be, is not for anie particular ends they have for themselves or to deprive anie person of his just Right But onely to preserve and keepe the sayd Churchyard in such decent condition as becomes ye place, and as all other Consecrated Grounds in this Kingdome is and ought to be kept. Notice having been given to ye Rt. Honble Ld BishPp of Winton then liveing in this parish church yard of damages done to several Graves Gravestones and the Pavemts in the sayd Church Yard by the frequent goeing in and out of his Losp Coach and Horses, and of the evill consequences that might ensue by such a bad president. And his Lordsp being very sensible thereof did send unto this Vestry the sume of ffive pounds with his desire of their acceptance thereof for and towards the Repaire of such Damages as had beene done in the Church Yard as aforesayd with his Lops serious promise not to comitt the like Errour againe together wth his Lops harty thankes for the notice they had given him thereof. Ordered That the Churchwardens doe take Care that all the Passages into the Church Yard be forthwith made up with Posts Railes or otherwise as they shall see good soe that noe Coach Cart or Hors may passe in or out thereat. And That all Graves Gravestones and Pavemts endamaged by his Lops Coach or Horses as aforesayd be forthwith Repaired and amended. And the charge thereof to be defrayed out of the 5£ I0sh his Lordps did give for that purpose Nevertheless the condition of the Churchyard does not appear to have reflected credit upon its guardians:— Wednesday the7th Sept. 1670—The Vestrie taking notice in what undecent condition ye Church Yard belonging to the Parish 54 Church is at present in by unevenes in many places & by Rubbish and other Filth that lyeth under ye walls & other parts thereof, to the dishonour of ye place and the annoyance and dissatisfaction of all persons that way passing. It is thought fitt & accordingly Ordered by the Vestry That the Gravemaker doe forthwith with in seaven daies from ye Date hereof Levell the sayd Church Yard & cleanes it from all ffilth & Nestynes, & from time to time to keepe the same in sweet & cleanly condition or in default thereof the Churchwardens are desired to imploy some other person or persons in doeing the same & Defrey ye Charge thereof from time to time out of such Moneys as they shall Receive upon Account of Graves makeing in the sayd Church & Yard. With two further extracts the notice of the control the Vestry exercised over the churchyard must be concluded, in so far as the present chapter is concerned. The first of these extracts shows that the poor were buried without coffins, and throws light on the condition and disposition of the people of the day:— 2nd August, 1693. Ordered That no Overseers from hence forwards presume to give any coffin for the burying of any person, and no coffins for which the Churchwardens do not give their vote to be allowed in any account. 6th Feby., 1694. That the Churchwardens do not provide coffins for drowned persons, or shrouds where coffins are given. Shrouds were at this time made of a woollen material. An Act of Parliament was passed in the reign of Charles II. (1667-8) "for the encouragement of the woollen manufactures of this Kingdome and prevention of the exportation of the moneyes thereof for the buying and importing of Linen." The stringency of the restriction will be best understood by a perusal of one of its sections :— "No person or persons whatsoever shall be buryed in any shirt shift or sheete made of or mingled with Flax, Hempe, Silk, Haire, Gold or Silver or other than what shall be made of Wooll onely, or be putt into any Coffin lined or faced with anything made of or mingled with Flax Hempe Silk or Haire upon paine of the forfeiture of the summe of Five pounds to be imployed to the use of the Poore of the Parish where such person shall be buryed for and towards the provideing a Stocke or Worke house for the setting them at Worke to be levyed by the Ghurch Wardens and Overseers of the Poore of such Parish or one of them by Warrant." 55 The distress was first to be levied upon the goods and chattels of the party interred contrary to the Act, and in default upon those of "any who had a hand in the putting such person into such shift, sheet, or coffin or did order or dispose the doing thereof." The only exemption was in cases of death from the plague. That the poor-rate derived considerable benefit is shown by the Churchwardens' Accounts for upwards of forty years, in which numerous receipts from this source are entered; and that a vigilant eye was kept by the Vestry on the matter, the following minute will suffice to evince :— Sunday, 16th Mch., 1689-90.—Ordered that the Parish Clerk bring in an account of all persons who have not certified ye Burying of People in Linnen in due time on every Munday morning to the Overseers of the poor for the time to come. Such negligence by the sextons or beadles had taken place as to admit of the desecration of the churchyard by its use for carpet beating and for the feeding of pigs, to remedy which the Vestry relied upon inanimate "notice boards" preventing that which the officers had failed to do:— Friday, 7th June, 1776. Resolved that two Inscription Boards be placed up in the Church Yard under the direction of the Church wardens, offering a reward for any Persons giving Notice of any Persons hanging Lines about the Trees in the Church Yard to beat Carpets on, or of the owners of Swine suffering them to run and strole in the Church Yard. Even the patriotism of the parishioners did not prevail with the Vestry over their regard for the churchyard and the venerable buildings contiguous to it:— Friday, 16th Sept., 1803. An application was made from the St. Margts and St. John's Volunteers for leave to erect a depot for their ammunition in St. Margaret's Church Yard adjoining the Watchouse. It was resolved That this Vestry will be happy at all times to concur in any measure that may be serviceable to the St. Margt and St. John's Volunteers consistent with their duty. But as the place pointed out for the Depot in question is in the neighbourhood of Buildings which might be materially injured in the event of an explosion, they feel it necessary to decline giving their sanction to the measure. 56 A few years later found the churchyard so deplorably kept as to provoke a public remonstrance. The subjoined letter was read to the Vestry in May, 1816:— Carlisle Street, Soho, 9th May, 1816. Gentlemen, The Church Yard of Saint Margaret, Westminster having become very offensive to the public from the great quantity of fresh Sculls Bones and Fragments of Coffins constantly thrown up on opening the Ground which for a longtime past has not been capable of admitting with propriety or decency any further Interments ; I have been directed to inform you that under the advice of Sir Christopher Robinson and Sir Samuel Shepherd, His Majesty's Advocate and Solicitor General, the Commissioners under the Act of Parliament of the 46th George 3d Cap. 89, have determined to institute a Proceeding in the Ecclesiastical Court to compel you to desist from depositing more Bodies in the present Ground, but I am at the same time also to intimate that the Commissioners are desirous that you should voluntarily take effectual means for preventing any more Burials there, without obliging the Commissioners to have recourse to any legal proceedings for that purpose. The favour of an early answer will oblige, Gentlemen, Your most obedient and very humble Servant, E. ALLEN, Cleric to the Commissioners. To the Church Wardens of the Parish of St. Margaret. A Committee was appointed to investigate the subject of this letter, upon which a report was shortly afterwards presented:— Friday, 21st June, 1816,—The Report of the Committee appointed on the 28th of May last to ascertain the state of the Church Yard was again laid before the Vestry and the result thereof ordered to be entered in the proceedings of this day. ST. MARGARET'S CHURCH YARD. There are Coffins. 636 Super Yards of unoccupied Ground in the six divisions* which calculating there is room for two Coffins in depth will hold 636 320 Do Do. In the center path leading from East to West which calculating there is room for three Coffins in depth will hold ... ... ... ... 405 * The Plan of the Church Yard was divided into six parts. 57 Coffins 108 Do. Do. In narrow path on South Side of Church Yard calculating there is room for three in depth will hold 138 250 Do. Do. On South side of Church calculating that there is room for two coffins in depth will hold 250 There are 424 Grave Stones above ground with names upon them which Graves will hold 574 45 Do. Do. not having any legible name under most of which there are no coffins. 54 Grave Stones Buried having names upon them most of which have no Coffins under 57 Do. Do. not having any names upon them the same as last. Resolved That a Copy of the said Report be transmitted to Mr. E. Allen, Clerk to the Commissioners under the Act of Parliament of the 46th Geo. 3d, Cap. 89., for the information of the said Commissioners. Resolved also That it be respectfully submitted to the said Commissioners for the improvement of Westminster that as it appears by the Report of the Committee appointed to examine the state of the Church Yard, there is now room for the funeral of 3045 Bodies, they do not therefore deem it necessary to desist from burying therein as upon an average of the number of Funerals which have taken place for the past five years there will be room for further interments nearly thirty years to come; and that from the natural decay of bodies before the now vacant spaces are filled up, the present Church Yard will admit of funerals for a much longer period. The Commissioners shortly afterwards stated, in reply to a letter communicating the substance of the foregoing resolution, that they would "abstain from any further proceedings to obtain a grant from the Crown of the ground near the Penitentiary in Tothill Fields for the use of the parish as a Cementary." Returning, as it were, to the interior of the Church and the services therein, the Vestry are found purchasing books for the use of the Ministers and Congregation, and volunteering the conditional payment for a penance. Wedy., 2nd Apl., 1690.—Ordd that upon producing the Parators Bill the Church-wardens pay him only 6d. a piece for the Prayer Books and that they pay him 13s. 4d. for a penance in 58 case he will swear that he hath not recd any money in satisfaccon by any means on that account. July 26, 1709.—Ordd That the Church-wardens provide a large Bible and prayer Books for the reading desk for the Parish Church, Two prayer books for the Churchwardens Pew, and prayer books for the new Chappie. Another of the internal affairs of the Parish Church, in which the Vestry claimed to have control, was the receipt and disposal of the Sacramental Money." So complete was the supervision in this respect that neither the Duke Street Chapel nor the Broadway Chapel (now Christ Church) escaped the Vestry's jurisdiction. On the 3rd August, 1747, the Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that Dr. Broderick had given directions to the Rev. Peirson Lloyd not to permit them to receive the money collected at sacrament at the Broadway Chapel. The complaint was referred to a Committee with instructions to draw up a remonstrance to the Dean and Chapter:— To the Rt. Reverend Father in God Joseph Lord Bishop of Rochester Dean of the Collegiate Church of St. Peter Westmr and Chapter of the said Church. Wee the Churchwardens and Vestry of the Parish of Saint Margaret Westmr on behalf of the Poor of the said Parish beg leave to Represent to your Lordship and this Chapter, That time Immemorial the Churchwardens of the said Parish have visited the New Chapel in the Broadway Westmr to receive and apply the Money given at the Offertory without the least obstruction, untill an Order lately given in a Letter by the Reverend Dr. Broderick the present Minister of the said Chapel not to permit or suffer the present Churchwardens of the said Parish to Exercise their said Antient Rights which was signified to them by the Revd Mr. Lloyd and was occasioned as Wee conceive by the Churchwardens objecting to Allow Bills of Expences for Mops, Brooms, Gowns, Washing Surplices, &c., as an application out of the said Offertory Money, which Wee apprehend to be contrary to the Direction of the Rubrick. Wee further beg leave to Represent that in the said Order Dr. Broderick menaced the Churchwardens with Suits at Law either as Plaintiff or Defendant in any Court in case they refused to comply therewith. Wee therefore appeal to your Lordship and this Chapter as the Supreme Judges for maintaining and preserving the Antient 59 Rights of this Parish, and pray a speedy determination for the Benefit of the Poor whose necessities require the same. (Signed) HENRY SHEERE THOMAS SMITH Churchwordns and 7 other Vestrymen. The remonstrance was so far recognised as to lead the Dean and Chapter to issue a mandate as follows:— The Acts of a Chapter held on Friday the fourteenth day of August in the Year of Our Lord 1747. The Dean The Subdean and others being then present. Application being made to the Dean and Chapter as Ordinary to determine the Disposition of the Offertory Money at the Chapel in the Broadway, Wee do Appoint that the Offertory Money should be disposed of by the Minister and Churchwardens of St. Margaret's Parish to Pious and Charitable uses according to the Rubrick. DAN. GELL Regr The remedy was only temporary, however, for within five years a revival of the difficulties led to the advice of counsel being taken:— Apl 21, 1752.—A case relating to the application of the Offertory Money collected at the several Chapels within this Parish was read & Dr Lee's Opinion thereon. Resolv'd That the Churchwardens be desired to wait on the Officiating Ministers of the said Chapels & acquaint them with the said Case & Opinion, & if they shall refuse or neglect to account for the offertory money remaining in their respective hands & to pay over the same to Dr Kenrick & the Churchwardens, the Churchwardens are to cite them as directed by the said Opinion. Standing firmly by their purpose, the Vestry induced or compelled the Churchwardens to obtain the citation, in consequence of which prospects of submission by the offending Minister began to dawn:— Jany. 12, 1753. A Proposal from the Rev. Mr. Pettingall was made to this Vestry by which he offered to pay to the Churchwardens as a Composition for the Offertory at Duke Street Chapel the sum of Five pounds Provided the Churchwardens and this Vestry would stop all proceedings in the Commons and remit the arrears due from him for sixteen years past. Resolv'd unanimously—That this Vestry will accept of no Composition from the said Mr. Pettingall relating to the said offertory 60 money, and that the Churchwardens do proceed against him until the same shall be determined by law. Proceedings were accordingly commenced, the Decree of the Prerogative Court being in favour of the Churchwardens, tempered, nevertheless with conciliatory suggestions. An amicable settlement not having been arrived at, a monition, copied at great length on the Minutes of the Vestry, was served on the Minister in September, after which the differences appear to have been adjusted. The introduction of gas as an illuminant in place of candles may be deemed worth a passing notice. Thursday, 8 Oct., 1818.—This Vestry was summoned to take into consideration the necessity of altering the mode of lighting the Church and to determine in what manner the same shall be done Whereupon It was Resolved that in future the Church be lighted with Gas. Mr. Thomas Edge of Great Peter Street proposed to perform the Works necessary for that purpose and provide the necessary standards and brackets for 32 Lights according to patterns produced and to be answerable for any defect in the workmanship for seven years for the sum of .£151 8 6 * * * Tuesday, 17 Nov., 1818—The Churchwardens stated that the lighting of the Church with Gas appeared to give general satisfaction but that more lights were necessary particularly four in the Middle Aisle and two in the Speaker's Pew which Mr. Edge agreed completely to fit up at .£6 10 each and were ordered accordingly. Solicitude for the refreshment of the preachers next shows how attentively detail was cared for by the Vestry; though evidence is wanting as to whether the supply was regulated in proportion to the degree of exhaustion or of the obesity of the preacher, or of merit in the discourse: — Sept. 7, 1697.—Ordered that the Churchwardens for the time to come allow but a pint of Canary to any Bishop that shall preach in our Church and noe more than halfe a pint of Canary for our owne ministers and others. The next care of the Vestry as registered in the minutes is to appoint morning prayers to be read at six o'clock, subject to the petitioning inhabitants defraying the cost thereof Regulations were framed in 1770 with respect to interments 61 in the Church, though the Minister of the day disapproved of the arrangements:— Friday, 6 April, 1770. The Clerk laid before this Vestry a Letter which he received from the Revd Dr Thomas Wilson Minister of this Parish relative to the late Order of Vestry for the Burying of Corps in the Great Vault of this Parish Church in Leaden Coffins. And the same being Read Resolved that the Clerk do wait on the Revd Dr Thomas Wilson and acquaint him that the true and only Motive for this Vestry's coming to the said Resolution and Order was on account of the Smell of the Bodies buried in Wood only begining to be offensive, and for prevention thereof in future And that this Vestry will take the Contents of his Letter into further Consideration. Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to take the best advice they can touching the Legality of the Resolution and Order of the last Vestry concerning the Burying of Corps in Lead Clerk to make enquiry of other Parishes in Westminster. Friday, G Apl., 1770. Mr. Churchwarden Webb reported that in pursuance of the Resolution of last Vestry he and his Partner Churchwarden had taken advice concerning the Resolution and Order of this Vestry taken the 19th day of March last relating to the Burying of Corps in Lead in the Great Vault of this Parish Church, and that they are advised the said Resolution and Order is legal. The Clerk reported that in pursuance of the Order of the last Vestry, on enquiry he had been informed as follows (Vizt)— That St. George, Hanover Square, is prohibited by Act of Par liament from Burying in the Church. That St. James Bury in the Vault in their Church in Lead only. That St. Paul, Covent Garden, Bury in the Vault of their Church in Lead only. That St, Martin's, St. Clement's, and St. Ann's Bury in Lead or wood. Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to acquaint Dr. Wilson that advice having been taken and enquiry made of the Custom in other parishes touching the burying of the dead in Vaults in Churches, This Vestry are fully satisfied in what they have done. According to Mr. Walcott, a triumphal arch was erected in the Church annually, in commemoration of the Restoration of the Royal Family, which arch was taken down, and the annual erection discontinued in consequence of a 62 portion of the structure having fallen upon a carpenter with fatal consequences. The following extract from the minutes is confirmatory of some part of the story:— 9 March, 1738. Ordered that the Church Wardens be desired to cause the Triumphal Arch (behind the Pulpitt) erected by Sir William Playters, Knt. and Bart., decd., to be taken down. The materials of the demolished arch, after being stored away for ten years, were by a vote of the Vestry, handed over to the Master of the Workhouse (22nd April, 1748) for use about the said Workhouse. As conservators of the fabric of the Church, the Vestry found inconvenience to result from the occupants of the adjoining houses, whose windows opened on to the roof, establishing a "drying ground" on the leads, to remedy which a resolution was passed: — 10th June, 1691—That Mr. Hyler suffers no persons to goe on and hang cloathes on the Church Leads and that the Churchwardens do make a ffence whereby to keepe any persons from coming on the Church Leads from St Margts Lane Houses. A volume might be devoted exclusively to the minutes of the Vestry's proceedings on the subject of the maintenance of the fabric, and of alterations in the arrangement of the interior and the pews, so carefully is everything of the kind noted, from the transposition of a candle holder or the repair of a broken window to the rebuilding of the tower. Topics of interest are presented by almost every page; but the temptation to make anything like a continuous and complete history, strong as such temptation is, must be resisted. A few subjects only have therefore been chosen:— Wednesday 6th July, 1670—That the present Churchwardens doe cause a Sunne Dyall to be placed on the west side of the Tower belonging to the Parish Church and the charge thereof shall be allowed in their accompt. After the constitution of the parish of St. John the Evangelist, doubts arose as to the interpretation of the enactment so far as it related to the repairs of the Mother 63 Church. Counsel were therefore called upon to advise. The "case" and opinions are worthy of perusal:— 26th June, 1734. Q. 1. Whether the Church Wardens and Vestry of St. Margaret's Parish have not a right in themselves to Direct all Necessary Repairs to be done to the Church of the said parish as they did before St John's was Erected into a parish without the Concurrency of Consent of the Vestry of St John's ?— Serjeant Hawkins's Opinion. It is my opinion that the Churchwardens and Vestry of Saint Margaret's have the same power in relation to this matter as they always have Exercised, for, there being nothing said in the Statutes to restrain them, they must be intended to continue as before. Serjeant Eyre's Opinion. I apprehend that the Churchwardens and Vestry of St. Margaret's Parish have a right in themselves to direct all necessary Repairs to be done to the Church of the said Parish as they did before St. John's was Erected into a parish without the Concurrence or Consent of the Vestry of Saint John's. Q. 2. Whether when a rate is become necessary for defraying the Expense of the Repairs of the Church of St. Margaret's, the Churchwardens of that parish, the Overseers of the Poor and Surveyors of the Highways or some of them with or without the Vestry of Saint Margaret's may not Lawfully Assess Collect and Levy the same upon and throughout the Limitts of both parishes, though the Vestry of St. John's should not attend the before mentioned Annual meeting appointed by the said Act of the Tenth of Queen Anne or should not come to an Agreement for a Rate (when proposed) for repairing the Old Church ? And how farr the law extends the power of a Negative in the Vestry of the New Parish against a Rate for the Repair of the Mother Church ?— Serjeant Hawkin's Opinion. I am of Opinion that the Overseers of the Poor and Surveiors of the Highways have nothing to do in this matter, but that if the Churchwardens and Vestry of Saint Margaret's have time out of mind made Church Rates, they may do so still by the Express Words of the 25th Section, which in case that such Agreement shall not be made as is mentioned in the 24th Section, gives the same power to the Church Wardens of the Old Parish as they had before the Division. But before the making of such rate I would advise the Summoning of another meeting of both parishes in pursuance of the said 24th Section, and in such meeting it will be proper to propose the Ascertainment of the Monys to be 64 raised for the said Repairs of the said Church, and the Apportioning thereof, and in case that there shall be no Agreement, the Churchwardens and Old Vestry may proceed as formerly, without the New Vestry, who seem to me to have no Negative. But since the Statute gives only such power as the Churchwardens had before, great care must be taken in making the Rate to pursue the Ancient Method. Serjeant Eyre's Opinion. I apprehend that in default of Meeting in pursuance of the Act or in default of an Agreement at such meeting the Churchwardens of St. Margaret's may make Rates to charge both parishes for the re pairing of Saint Margaret's Church in like manner as they might have done before any Division made. 17th July 1734. The Clerk laid before the Board a letter prepared pursuant to an Order of the last Vestry stating the Reasons of the proceedings of this Vestry in relation to the Eepair of the Parish Church in Answer to a paper from the Vestry of St. John. [The letter was a conciliatory explanation of the facts in which the foregoing opinions were recited.] Mr. Walcott, in his "Memorials" (page 104) states that "a serious and most unjust suit was now (1759) brought against the Churchwardens because they had put up that splendid addition to the Church—the great East Window. The prosecution was instituted in the name of Daniel Gell, the Registrar of the Ecclesiastical Court of the Dean and Chapter, who was in consequence struck off the list of Vestrymen." Beyond this incidental allusion to the feeling of the Vestry, no reference has been made to the decisive action of that body by the various writers who have described the artistic merits and the remarkable vicissitudes of this magnificent window until its fame has become almost world-wide. The parochial chronicles,as hereafter reproduced, will leave little doubt but that the retention and preservation of the window is due to unwavering attachment of "the parishioners in vestry assembled" to all that concerned their Church. The first entry relates to the removal and sale of the East Window and "Altar Piece," said to have been put up but sixty-six years 65 viously (1692), in order to make room for the new window:— Saturday, 5th August, 1758. Ordered—That the Church Wardens do cause the sale of the Altar-piece and great East Window to be Advertised, and the Church Wardens have hereby Power to sell the same for the best prices they can get. Monday, 29 January, 1759. The Church Wardens acquainted this Vestry that they had been Menaced with a prosecution in the Ecclesiastical Court for suffering the painted Window at the East end of St. Margaret's Church to be put up. Resolved That this Vestry will indemnify and save the Church Wardens harmless against any Prosecution or other proceedings that may be commenced against them, on account of the putting-up the said Window or any thing relating thereto. Resolved That Mr. Roger Altham be employed a Proctor in defence of the Church Wardens. Resolved That Mr. Altham do immediately retain Dr Hay and Dr Smalbroke as Councel for this Parish, in an intended prosecution against the Dean and Chapter of Westminster. In the accounts presented by the Churchwardens on 8th, February, 1759, of the expenditure upon the repairs recently executed out of the Parliamentary Grant of £4,000 there is the following item:— To John Conyers Esq of Copt Hall in Essex for the purchase of the large painted glass window in the east end of the Church over the altar, Stone Frame, iron work, and appurtenances £420 0 0 The record of the proceeding were continued for more than three years. Thursday, 31 May, 1759—The Revd Dr Thomas Wilson acquaint11 the Vestry that the Lord Bishop of Rochester Dean of Westminster was determined to cause Articles to be exhibited in the proper Ecclesiastical Court against the late Church Wardens for putting up the painted Window at the East end of the Church unless this Vestry was disposed to compromize the Affair by removing such parts of the window as were most offensive to him It is the Unanimous Opinion of this Vestry, that they have not power, nor would it be safe for them to take down any part of the said Window, or to alter the same in any manner whatever. Monday, 15 Dec. 1760—Resolved—That the Church Wardens be desired to cause the Court of King's Bench to be moved the next term for a Prohibition to stop the Prosecution in the Ecclesiastical Court against the Churchwardens 1758 F 66 Wednesday, 21 Jany. 1761—Mr. Churchwarden Peirson acquainted this Vestry that the Judge of the Ecclesiastical Court of the Dean and Chapter of "Westminster having refused to Admit several Allegations in Answer to the Articles Exhibited against him in relation to the late Repairs of St. Margaret's Church, he had been advised to Appeal against the said Judge's proceeding to a Court of Delegates. Resolved that Mr. Peirson do Exhibit such an Appeal accordingly and take such other steps from time to time as he by his Councel shall be advised in his defence, and this Vestry will Indemnify him in what he shall do therein. Saturday, 21 March, 1761. Ordered that the Churchwardens be desired to send to the Earl of Bath, Lord Pulteney,* and Lieut1 Gen1 Cornwallis,* the Book lately published relating to the Ornaments of Churches. Thursday, 8 May, 1761. (After the election of Churchwardens)— Resolved that the unanimous Thanks of this Vestry be. and they are hereby given to the Rev. Dr. Thomas Wilson for his Learned and excellent Treatise on Ornaments of Churches, wherein he has unanswerably justified the Acts of this Vestry in causing the late Ornaments to be made in St. Margaret's Church, and more especially their putting up the Painted Glass Window at the East end of the Church over the Communion Table. Tuesday, 18 May, 1762—(John "Wilkes, Esqr, in the Chair.) The Church Wardens acquainted this Vestry that Mr. Gell the Promoter in the Cause in the Ecclesiastical Court against the Churchwardens of this Parish respecting the great Painted Window at the East end of St. Margaret's Church had delivered into Court his Proxy signifying his Intention of Proceeding no further in the said Cause which had been admitted and the Churchwardens of St. Margaret's have accordingly been dismissed from the same. The Revd Mr. Ballard from the Dean and Chapter of Westminster having made a Proposal to this Vestry that no new Proceedings against the Churchwardens respecting the great Painted Window at the East end of St. Margaret's Church should be commenced if this Vestry would agree to Pay all Costs which they have been at except the Sum of Fifty Pounds already paid by them. Resolved Unanimously that the said Proposal be rejected. Resolved Unanimously that in Case the Dean and Chapter of Westminster should cause any fresh Suit to be commenced against the Churchwardens in respect of the said "Window, that the Churchwardens do immediately apply and move for the Costs of the late Suit. *Members of Parliament for Westminster. 67 Mr. Walcott, evidently writing on unreliable authority, mentions that "this vexatious suit lasted seven years," whereas the foregoing copies extend over a period of three years and four months. The conclusion of the trial in favour of the Vestry was commemorated by the presentation of a very beautiful and richly chased cup, stand, and cover, in silver gilt, weighing 93 oz. 15 dwt., now known in St. Margaret's parish as "the Churchwarden's Loving Cup." Saturday, 17 Deer., 1763. Samuel Peirson, Esq. (a Member of this Vestry) In Testimony of the great Regard he bears to the Parish of St. Margaret, Westminster, of which he had the honour of being chosen Churchwarden for seven successive years, this Day in Person Presented to the Vestry as his Free Gift, a large Silver Cup and Cover, Gilt with Gold, To be used at all Parochial Entertainments of the Minister, Churchwardens, and Vestrymen of this Parish, as they occasionally may happen for time to come. Resolved that the Unanimous Thanks of this Vestry be and they are hereby returned to Mr. Peirson for this signal and valuable mark of his favour and regard for this Parish. Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to cause the following Inscription to be engraved on the said Cup and Cover, (viz.):— Round the Cover—In the year of our Lord, 1764. On the Body of the Cup—This Cup and Cover was given to the Churchwardens of the Parish of St. Margaret, Westminster and their successors for ever (to be made use of by the Vestry at their Parochial Entertainments) by Samuel Peirson, Esq. In Testimony of his great regard for the Parish of which he was Unanimously chosen Churchwarden for seven Successive Years. In January, 1764, the Vestry paid £8 8s. 0d. for making a "rough draft" of their vote of thanks to Mr Peirson and for "writing the same on a tine skin of abortive vellum" with a seasoned board for stretching the same. Engraving the inscriptions on the cup and cover cost £2 12s. 6d.; for the figure of St. Margaret with the inscription under it £2 was paid, 15s.was expended upon the engraving of Mr. Peirson's coat of arms on the cup, and 21s. for similar work on the stand. Looking from east to west the circumstances which led f 2 68 up to the erection of the present portico at the west end of the Church are narrated in the following transcript:— Monday, 6th October, 1777. Mr. Church Warden Glanvill laid before the Vestry a Letter to him from the Revd Dr Thomas Wilson Minister of this Parish respecting his Intention of Subscribing One Hundred Pounds towards the Building of a Portico at the West Entrance of this Parish Church (according to a Plan or Design laid before the Vestry by Mr. Ch Warden Glanvill) wherein the Doctor Recommends to the Church Wardens and Vestry the waiting on the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as Rectors and Patrons of the said Church for their Approbation as he apprehends the Dean and Chapter if they approve thereof will Subscribe thereto, and also Recommending the waiting on Sr Henry Cheere, Bart, who Dr Wilson also signifies he thinks will also Subscribe thereto. Resolved that the Church Wardens be desired to wait on the Dean and Chapter of Westminster and in the name of this Vestry desire their approbation of Building a Portico at the West Entrance of this Parish Church agreeable to the said Plan or Design and the Church Wardens are requested to lay the said Plan or Design, as also the Letter from the said Dr Wilson before the Dean and Chapter. Resolved that the Church Wardens be desired to wait on Sr Henry Cheere, Bart, and also shew to him the said Plan or Design with the letter from the said Dr Wilson. An appeal was made to Parliament by petition, in accordance with numerous precedents, for a grant in aid of the expense of a general repair of the Church. Neither the detailed report of the survey, nor the copy of the petition and the organisation of support for its prayer can, owing to their length, here be given The result of the appeal and the gratitude of the Vestry, were recorded as follows:— May 2, 1799—Mr. Fox reported that the Parliament had been pleased to grant the Prayer of the Petition of this Vestry for the sum of £6,721 18 4 for the Repair of the Church It is unanimously Resolved—That this Vestry is under the highest and most lasting Obligation to Sir Alan Gardner, Baronet one of the Members for the City and Liberty of Westminster for his kind and ready Compliance with the desire of the Parish in presenting their late Petition to The Honourable House of Commons And for his very active exertions in the support thereof during its progress thro' the House unto its ultimate success 69 Resolved unanimously—That a Transcript of the above Resolution be immediately forwarded by the Revd. Dr Fynes as Chairman of this meeting to the said Sir Alan Gardner And that the most grateful thanks of this Vestry accompany the same. As on previous occasions, resolutions of thanks, couched in the warmest terms, were passed and conveyed to the Members of Parliament who had supported the application. In the present instance the recipients of such votes were— George Rose, Esq., The Speaker, Lord Arden, Lord Viscount Belgrave, Sir William Dolben, Bart., William Wilberforce, Esq., John Blackburn, Esq., H. Bankes, Esq., Christopher Saville, Esq., John Fare, Esq., Scrope Bernard, Esq., and others. Keenly sensible of the special countenance given by Parliament to the Church from time to time, and recognising the prescriptive right of the Official Head and Representative of the House of Commons to such seats as he might require, the indignation of the Vestry was excited by an inadvertent application for pew rent having been made to the Speaker—so momentous was the oversight that a special meeting was summoned to repair the injury:— Wednesday, 10 April, 1799. This Vestry was convened for the purpose of enquiring how and under what authority the Right Honble the Speaker of the Honble House of Commons has been applied to for Rent of Pews in the Church, heretofore and anciently set apart as solely appertaining to him and his Attendants. Resolved unanimously—That this Vestry never did or could sanction that measure, a measure opposite to the past professions of former Vestries, evidently injurious to the Parish and an ill suited return for the frequent aids granted by Parliament for the Repairs of the Parish Church, and it appearing to this Vestry that such Payment originated in the Collectors considering the Speaker as a private Inhabitant upon his first coming to reside in this Parish. Resolved also unanimously—That such Payment in future be discontinued. Resolved also unanimously—That a copy of these Resolutions signed by the Revd Dr. Fynes, as Chairman, be sent to the Right Honble the Speaker, accompanied with the respectful 70 Compliments of this Vestry, and an assurance of their readiness to provide seats in the Church for him and his Attendants in any manner that he may wish. Echoes from the bells in the Church Tower from years long past might be produced here in varied tones. Sometimes the Vestry direct the solemn toll at the season of national mourning, at other times the ringers are ordered to perform a merry peal in celebration of a royal birth, or marriage, or coronation. Repairs are sanctioned, charges are made, ringers are engaged, bells are re-cast, and other matters pertaining to the management of the belfry are regulated from time to time to the minutest detail by the Vestry, whose loyalty and patriotism still resounds in the minutes:— Mch. 18, 1740.—Ordered that the Church Wardens bo desired to pay Mr. Bradley his Bill of £25 for altering amending and fixing the Clock and Chimes when and as soon as he shall have altered and set the Chimes to the Tune of "Britons strike for home," &c. to the approbation and satisfaction of the Churchwardens and the same shall be allowed them on their accompt. 15 Oct, 1748.—On the 17th Octr, 1748, the Churchwardens are authorised to cause the repair of the Chimes, they to be set to " the Tune of that Loyal Song called 'God save the King.' " When "hard times" dictated the exercise of economy the chimes were discontinued:— Thursday, 11 Feb., 1819.—Resolved that it is the opinion of this meeting that the Continuance of the Chimes is attended with a considerable Expence which might with great propriety under the present circumstances of the Parish be avoided and that the Churchwardens be desired to take the measures necessary to meet the Opinion of this Vestry thereon. The suspension of the music discoursed from the belfry does not appear to have been noticed by the Rector till two years had elapsed:— Thursday, 22 March, 1821. A Letter from Dr. Fynes was read :— "I am much surprised at hearing that Mr. Pepper, the Senior Churchwarden has by his own authority taken down and disposed of the Chimes belonging to St. Margaret's Church. I wish the Vestry should be made acquainted with this Matter, and that Mr. Pepper be informed that he will be called upon by the Ordinary immediately to replace the Chimes, which cannot legally be removed without a Faculty from the Ecclesiatical Court to allow it and to notify it to the Parish.'' 71 A Resolution was thereupon passed reciting the order of the Vestry on the 11 Feb., 1819, and stating that "the articles sold is a preparatory measure for restoring the Chimes when the state of the Parochial Funds are flourishing enough to bear the expence." Religious Persecution. Among the multitudinous matters in which authority was exercised by the Vestry, one, at least, stands out as being wholly repugnant to the mind of the present day—that of assisting in the punishment of those who, for conscientious reasons, did not attend the services of the parish church. In this matter, as in some others, the power exercised was simply assumed, there being no statutory obligation upon the Vestry to exercise it. As a legal offence, refusal to attend the services of the established Church had been punishable since 1 Eliz. cap. 2(1558); but its prosecution was attended with singular rigour and tyranny in the Stuart dynasty, before and after the Restoration. In the 3 James I. (1606, the year after the discovery of the Gunpowder plot), an Act was passed "for the better discovering and repressing of popish recusants." After a long preambulatory denunciation of "the wicked and devilish counsel of the jesuits * * * who, the better to cover and hide their false hearts, and with more safety to attend the opportunity to execute their mischievous designs, repair sometimes to the church to escape the penalty of the laws," it was enacted:— II. For the better discovery therefore of such persons be it enacted That every popish recusant convicted or hereafter to be convicted shall once in every year at the least receive the blessed sacrament of the Lord's supper in the church of that parish where he or she shall most usually abide. III. And if any recusant shall not receive the said sacrament he or she shall for such not, receiving lose and forfeit for the first year twenty pounds, and for the second year forty pounds, and for every year after threescore pounds. Monthly presentments were to be made by the Churchwardens and constables of all persons, including children 72 above nine years of age, absent from church, in default of which the Churchwardens were to forfeit twenty shillings; while a reward of forty shillings was to be paid to those officers on each recusant convicted. Another Statute, 25 Charles II., cap. 2, 1685, prohibited the acceptance of any public office by any persons who had not previously taken the oath of allegiance and subscribed the declaration against the doctrine of transubstantiation. This recital of the state of the law will render the following entries in the Vestry minutes easily intelligible:— Wednesday, 6th November, 1678.—The Burgesses Assistants Constables, Churchwardens, and Overseers of the Poore are desired to meete at ye Vestry Roome, on Thursday, ye 7th November instant, at 2 of ye Clock, in order to the putting in execution (on ffriday next) of his Matics Proclamacon touching Popish Recusants. Thursday, 15th May, 1673.—It appeareing that there is much more Wine used now at Sacraments then formerly was, by reason of ye extraordinary numbers of strangers and others, that doe Receive the Sacrament in pursuance of the Act of Parlamt. touching Recusants. And the Doctoe. desireing the same may be considered and not Charged on him in regard hee doth not Receive any manner of benefitt thereby. It is thought fitt and accordingly Ordered That the Doctoe. bo not charged wth paying for more Wine then usuall by reason of the sayd Extraordinary occasion. 10th September, 1690.—The Churchwardens did this day make report that they have appointed Ann Alwyn to be a searcher in the Roome of the widdow Cooper decd, and they had plac'd her in the Roome belonging to the Searchers in Tuttlefields which was approved by the Vestry. 5th November, 1690.—Ordered that the new Searcher Ann Alwyn have time given her till the first Sunday of the next month to receive the Sacramt. and Conforme to the Church of England Or otherwise that another be admitted in her roome. 21st December, 1690.—Ordered that the Widdow Langstone be admitted into the place of Searcher in the roome of the Widow Alwyn. Ample evidence is thus given of the extent to which the law was carried out. Nevertheless judgment must not be passed upon the severity of the Vestry without bearing in mind the enthusiasm of the Parliament of the day, Hallam (Vol. I., p. 491) narrates as an illustration of the 73 excess to which the House of Commons was carried, an instance which must have been within the knowledge of, if not actually witnessed by many of the inhabitants of Westminster, since the pillory maintained by the Churchwardens in the Old Palace Yard was brought into requisition. He names a Roman Catholic gentleman who had been overheard to make some slighting observation concerning certain persons in high estate, and says that "Nothing could "exceed the fury into which the Commons were thrown by "this very insignificant story. A flippant expression below "the cognisance of an ordinary court grew at once into a "portentous offence which they ransacked their invention "to chastise." Regardless of a remonstrance from the King, in which he reminded the house that they were seeking to sentence a man who had made no breach of its privileges, who had denied the accusation, and had not been convicted by evidence on oath, and overcoming objections raised by the upper house to the Commons' jurisdiction, the offender was adjudged to be "degraded from his gentility, "and to be held an infamous person; his testimony not to "be received; to ride from the Fleet to Cheapside on horse"back without a saddle, with his face to the horse's tail "and the tail in his hand, and there to stand two hours in "the pillory, and to be branded in the forehead with the "letter 'K'; to ride four days afterwards in the same man"ner to Westminster, and there to stand two hours more in "the pillory with words in a paper in his hat showing his "offence; to be whipped at the cart's tail from the Fleet to "Westminster Hall; to pay a fine of £5000, and to be a "prisoner in Newgate during his life." The infliction of the whipping was a few days afterwards remitted on the motion of Prince Charles, but the unfortunate culprit seems to have undergone the rest of his sentence. It may here be mentioned that the stocks and whipping post were in the Old Palace Yard, where they remained down to, and probably later than 1765. On the 26th May, 74 1715, the Vestry passed a resolution requiring the Churchwardens "to putt the Stocks and Whipping Post in good "repair and make all the locks good, and provide a strong "bench for criminals to sit on." Custody of Registers. Arrogating to themselves powers which the Church wardens might have hesitated to yield, the Vestry undertook the provision of the Register Books, as well as the direction of the persons by whom the same should be kept:— Mch. 16, 1743.—Ordered that the Churchwardens provide a large Folio vellum book bound in calf and embossed with brass for the Register of Marriages, Births and Bury \ls within this Parish for the use of this Parish Church the same being absolutely wanting. Mch. 22, 1749.—Order'd that the Churchwardens be desired to wait on Dr. Kenrick to know how it happens that the Register of Births, Weddings, &c., is kept by his Curate. Feb. 20, 1750.—The Churchwardens laid before this Vestry the Reverend Dr. Ken rick's answer to an Order of Vestry of the 22nd March, 1749, relating to the Register of Births, Burials, &c., within this parish, of which answer the following is a copy: "Dr. Kenrick's Answer is, that he apprehended when he put "the above-mentioned Register into the Hands of his Curate that "he had a right so to do but if the gentlemen of the Vestry claim "any share in the direction (as to the custody of it) He shall "be glad to (know) what grounds, and to settle the Affair in "the most easy and amicable manner."—Scawin Kenrick. Ordered That the Churchwardens be desired with the Vestry Clerk to wait on Dr. Kenrick to lay before him the claim this Vestry makes to the right they have to choose a Register for this parish. The next entry on the subject leads to the inference that the opinion of Counsel had been taken:— May 1, 1751.—Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to write to the Reverend Dr. Kenrick and acquaint him that this Vestry has taken into consideration the case and opinion relating to the Register of this Parish and have resolved to support their right in choosing the keeper of such Register, and desire that Dr. Kenrick will give orders to the person who has the custody of the Register Books to deliver them up to this Vestry. July 31, 1751.—Resol'd and Ordered that the Register Books of Births and Burials belonging to this Parish be kept according to the directions of the Rubrick till further ordered. A difference of opinion had existed seventy years 75 previously between the Minister, Dr. Spratt, and the Vestry; but the subject of dispute on that occasion was the keeping of the Register of those Touched for the Evil, of which evidence is supplied by the Vestry minutes of 5th April, 1682:— Register for Touching. Upon reading an Order of his Matie in Councell made in the yeare 1672 whereby the Minister of every parish is appointed to keepe a register of persons touched for the evell this Vestry is of opinion that the Right of keeping the said Register is in Dr. Sprat and the Minister of the parish for the tyme being and that he ought to have the keeping of the said Register booke and the disposall thereof. Whether this entry be interpreted as permissive or mandatory there can be no doubt that the duty it refers to involved more than appears at first sight. Nowhere, indeed, but in Westminster, could an order of this kind have been necessary. To Westminster it was that, during the Jacobean period, thousands of scrofulous sufferers attended by their surgeons and accompanied by their friends, were attracted by the Orders in Council issued from time to time appointing "sittings" of the King specially for the purpose of "touching" those who sought their cure at the hands of his Majesty. The sittings were occasionally held at Windsor in the summer season, but nearly always during the residence of the Court at Whitehall. Although the ceremony was frequently performed by James I., the number of applicants had so increased by the time of Charles II., that weekly sittings were appointed on Fridays, subject to the number not exceeding 200 on any day. From 1660-64, inclusive, 23,601 persons were "touched." In 1665-6 the King removed from the metropolis on account of the plague; but on his return the superstitious rite was resumed so actively that from 1667 to 1684 no less than 68,506 persons availed themselves of it. Thus the necessity for the above mentioned order will easily be conceived, if only on account of the labour which the keeping of the Register involved. During the reign of William III. the solemnity was, in a great measure, suspended, the King "being persuaded that 76 he should do no injury to persons afflicted with the disorder by not touching them." Queen Anne countenanced the practice, however, towards the latter end of her reign. The celebrated Dr. Johnson, who was born in 1709, was brought from Lichfield to Westminster, when only two years of age* to he touched by the Queen for the scrofulous evil, though the ceremony was of no avail.† Parish of St. John the Evangelist. The sketch of the proceedings of the Vestry in Church matters would be incomplete without a reference to the exercise of power by the United Vestries in relation to the Church of St. John the Evangelist. During the reigns of Edward III. (1327) and Richard II. (1377) a chapel dedicated to St. John the Evangelist had existed in Westminster. Mr. J. T. Smith, in his "Antiquities of Westminster," 1807, refers to a contention as to jurisdiction between the Abbot of St. Peter's and the Dean and Canons of St. Stephen's, which difference was settled by deed of compromise in 1394. In that deed the chapel of St. John the Evangelist was specially reserved. After a close examination of local details the author of the valuable work just named (pp. 104 and 127) fixed the position of the chapel as being to the south of the chapel of St. Stephen, and on the site of Cotton Garden, close to the Painted Chamber. The chapel, which was suppressed by Edward VI. (1547), had an annual revenue of £1085 10s. 5d. The present church may have derived its title from this chapel. By an Act passed in 10 Anne (1711-12) the appropriation of the duties on coal towards the cost of erecting fifty new churches in and near the Metropolis was authorised. The Church of St. Mary-le-Strand was the first built under the * Mrs. Piozzi, in her Anecdotes of Samuel Johnson, says, "As Mr. Johnson had a remarkable memory I asked him if he could remember Queen Anne? 'He had,' he said, 'a confused but somehow a sort of solemn recollection of a lady in diamonds and a long black hood.' " † Mr. Murphy, in his biographical preface to Johnson's Works observes that the child was "afterwards cut for the humour, and the under part of his face was seamed and disfigured by the operation." 77 provisions of the enactment, ten years elapsing before the Church of St. John the Evangelist was commenced, and seven years more expiring before its completion. The proposal to form a new parish was first brought to the knowledge of the Vestry in October, 1711, by a letter from the Commissioners constituted by the Statute:— To the Revd the Minister Churchward" and Vestry of the parish of St. Marg" Westmr The Comrs appointed by her Matie (pursuant to a late Act of Parliamt Intituled an Act for Granting to her Matie sevll Duties upon Coals for Building Fifty New Churches in and about the Cities of London and Westmr &c) being desirous to proceed in soe Pious and Usefull a Work withall possible Expedition have thought fit hereby to request that you would Inform them Concerning the Number and Condicon of your Inhabitants that they may the Better be Enabled to Judge what New Church or Churches will be necessary to be Erected in yor Parish. You are alsoe desired to inform them of proper places for the Scites of the said Church or Churches and for Churchyards and alsoe houses for the Habitacon of the Respective Ministers; and lastly wheter there be in yor parish any Chappell or Chapplls fit to be made Parish Churches. All which you are desired to signifie under your hands with all Convenient Speed that the Comrs aforesaid may proceed accordingly. By Order of the Comrs Tho: Rouses Setry Octor 4th 1711. Copie. An enquiry as to the population and requirements of the parish was in consequence set on foot:— Upon Reading of an Order to this Vestry from the Com" appointed by her Matie pursuant to an Act of Parliamt Intituled an Act for Granting to her Matie sevllDuties upon Coals for Building Fifty New Churches in and about the Cities of London and Westmr and Suburbs thereof, and other purposes therein menconed. Ordd That the Churchwardens Request the sevll Burgess's and Assistants of this Parish to make a Return of the Numbers of the Inhabitants in their sevll Warls and Divisions in this Parish to this Vestry on Saturday the 20th day of this Instant October by Three of the Clock in the afternoon. On the 5th November, 1711, a second letter was received from the Commissioners pressing for an immediate return upon their former enquiry, and requesting the Vestry to supplement the same by information as to suitable sites 78 and the cost of land. The Vestry agreed upon the reply and representations given below:— To the Most Revd Father in God Thomas Lord Archbishop of Canterbury and the rest of the Honble Comrs appointed by her Matie Pursuant to a late Act of Parliamt (Intituled an Act for granting to her Matie severall Duties upon Coals for Building 50 New Churches in and about the Cities of London and Westminster). The Representacon of the Minister Churchwardens and Vestry of the Parish of St. Margtt Westmr in the County of Midd'x in Answer to a Letter Recd. bearing Date the 4th of Octor 1711. That the Number of Souls in the Parish of St. Margtt Westmr as near as can be Computed is about Twenty Thousand. That the Condicon of the Inhabitants is such that the Rates with other monys allotted to the maintenance of the poor amount at this time to Three Thousand pounds p ann. & is still likely to encrease. That in sevll of the out parts of the sd Parish there are great number of Poor people which will make it very Difficult to allow due proporcons of the Poor and Rich in case it shall be thought fit to erect any new Parish or Parishes within the said Parish of St. Margtt Westminster. That there is a peece of Ground of about Seaven Acres near Milbank in the said Parish which is freehold and the Estate of Henry Smith Esqre who has Declared his willingness to Dispose of an acre and a Quarter of the said Ground for the sume of Five hundred Pounds. That there is alsoe another peece of Ground at the end of Marsham Street being the Freehold Estate of Sr Robert Marsham Barrt Containing about an Acre fit for the same use, which Ground Sr Robert has sent word to the Vestry he is willing to part with but he being not in Town the Vestry dont know the price thereof. There is in the said Parish one Church commonly Called the New Chappell which holds upwards of 1200 People & in our Judgment the said Chappell is fit to be made Parochial. That there are Two other Chappells one in or near Queen Square & the other in Duke Street, neither of which in our Judgments are fit to be made Parochial. Cha: Battely, Thomas Blissett, Tho: Wisdome, Edward Tufnell, Samll. Brown, Emery Arguis, Geo: Mortimer, Robert Jeffes, Edward Clift, NICHO. ONLEY, D.D. JAMES HUNTER, RICHD. FILER, Church Wardens. [Copie.] It is desired by this Vestry that the Revd Dr Nicho: Onley with the Churchwardens wait on the said Comrs & p'sent the said Representation. 79 The Vestry were taken into counsel by the Commissioners as to the boundaries of the new parish:— 24th July, 1724—The Comrs for the New Churches having transmitted to this Vestry a plann of the Parish of St Margaret, Westminster, wherein ye district of the New Intended Parish to be taken thereout is Limited, And the said Comrs having referred the same to the Consideration of this Vestry. Ordd That the Churchwardens do wait on ye Revd Dr. Nichos Onley Minister of this Parish with the said Plann and desire his Opinion thereupon which they are desired to Report at the next Vestry. A note in the Minute of the Vestry records the date of the Consecration of the Church aud of the Burial Ground:— The Church of St. John the Evangelist was Consecrated the 20th of June 1728 by Dr. Bradford Bishop of Rochester and Dean of Westmr and the Burying Ground was consecrated the 29th of July 1731 by Dr. Wilcox Bp. of Gloucester at ye request of the Chapter. H. D. C. V. (Humphrey Drew, Clerk to the Vestry.) Although constituted a separate parish, the Vestry of the senior parish were slow to surrender their regard for the concerns of the area so long under their jurisdiction:— 6th June, 1733.—That all Moneys arising from ye Pews in ye Parish Church of St. John the Evangelist in Westmr, or from Burials in ye said Parish, or that become any otherways paiable to ye hands of the Churchwdns of St. John's, for the use of the said Parish and not appropriated be applied in the manner following viz. In the first place to pay £125 p. Ann. to ye Rector of St. John's for ye time being, Then to ye Repairs of St. John's Church, and then to ye paying the Servants Wages, Tradesmens Bills, and other demands and if there be any overplus that to be paid to ye Churchwardens of St. Margaret Westmr in order to increase the publick Stock of both Parishes in ye hands of the Churchwardens of St. Margarets. But in case of any deficiency that to be made good by the Churchwardens of St. Margarets in regard the Churchwardens of St. Margarets have all the publick mony in their hands to which mony the parish of St. John's is intituled to a proportionable part And out of that mony all publick parochial expences are paid. This may probably make a demand of £15 or £20 p. Ann. upon St. Margarets for St. John, and 'tis thought not more. To which proportion this Vestry doth agree in case the Vestry of St. John do likewise agree to ye same and that a Copy of the Resolution of this Vestry be delivered to ye Churchwardens of St. John. 80 Uncertainty soon presented itself as to the extent of the powers of the separate Vestries* in relation to the repair of the Church. 30th May, 1734.—Ordd That the Opinions of Mr. Serjeant Hawkins and Mr. Serjeant Eyre be taken upon the Act of Parliament of the Tenth of Queen Anne for Building Fifty New Churches and that for dividing Saint John the Evangelist and making it a Parish Whether the Vestry of Saint John have a Concurrent right and how farr with the Vestry of this parish in carrying on the said repair; And whether if the Vestry of St. John should not concur, this Vestry have not a right to proceed in the necessary repair of their Church without them. The Vestry of St. Margaret's parish meanwhile consented to a contribution from their funds towards defraying the cost of repairs in St. John's Church. 5th April, 1737. The Vestry being Informed that the Parish of Saint John the Evangelist hath at Sundry times by the Churchwardens and Vestry of that Parish laid out a Considerable Sume of Mony in the repair of their Church, which this Vestry now taking into their consideration Do Resolve—That the Sume of One hundred Sixteen Pounds and Three shillings be paid by the Churchwardens of this Parish to the Churchwardens of St. John's for and toward the Reimbursing the Charge of the Repair of the said Church, and the same shall be allowed our Churchwardens on their Accompt. Passing over questions and cases submitted to counsel on a variety of details as to the application of balances in hand, raising money by a rate to meet deficiencies, the rights of pew holders, and other points of minor interest, the minutes tell of a serious strain in the relationship between the two Vestries in 1815. By an ill-advised and peremptory notice the Churchwardens of the parish of St. John the Evangelist convened a meeting of the two Vestries to be held in the Vestry Room of St. Margaret's Church on Easter Tuesday of that year, for the purpose inter alia, of "ascertaining the "monies and rates to be assessed within the limits of the "said two parishes for the repair of the said (St. John's) "Church." * The incorporation of the "United Vestry" for duties in relation to rating, street repairs, &c., is noticed hereafter. 81 The Yestry of St. Margaret's passed a resolution directing that the customary method of summoning the Vestries be observed, and that the notice from the St. John's Vestry be ignored. At the Easter Tuesday meeting of the two Vestries, the representatives of St. John's parish failed to gain their end; albeit the Yestry of St. Margaret's resolved to state a case for the opinion of counsel "on the application "by the officers of St. John to the officers of St. Margaret "to give notice in St. Margaret's Church for making a rate "for the repair of St. John's Church, and on the intimation "by St. John's parish to move the Court of Queen's Bench "for a mandamus to compel this parish, jointly with them"selves, to make such rates." By another resolution the Vestry of St. Margaret agreed to retain the Solicitor-General on behalf of the parish. On the 11th May, 1815, the Vestry Clerk of St. Margaret's reported that the Court of King's Bench had granted a Rule Nisi on the application of the Vestry of St. John the Evangelist for a mandamus. On the 26th June the defendant Vestry of St. Margaret were informed that the mandamus had been issued, a copy of the writ being laid before the Vestry in the following October. The Churchwardens, who were the nominal defendants, "wished to be favoured with the advice and "opinion of the Vestry as to the course of proceeding "proper to be adopted under the present circumstances. "The Vestry deliberated a considerable time upon the "several matters relating thereto, and as the Church. "wardens were thereby in possession of their sentiments, it "was not thought necessary to enter into any specific "resolutions thereon." The Vestry of St. Margaret's parish continued to recognise the needs of their neighbours in St. John's parish long after the severance. They paid some of the debts incurred for the repair of the church, and they placed seats in St Margaret's church at the disposal of the inhabitants of St. John's when the latter were temporarily deprived of their place of g 82 worship by the calamitous fire which occurred in 1742. The senior Vestry objected, however, to ambiguity, for they persistently refused to convene or attend a meeting of the joint Vestries which their younger neighbours deemed to be urgently necessary "on matters of great consequence to both parishes." After repeated efforts to obtain a joint meeting of the two Vestries had failed, it transpired that the object of the St. John's Vestry was "to request of St. Margaret's Vestry to assist them in a subscription to raise money to repair their church." Still relentless on the point of the meeting, the older Yestry promised their best assistance in promoting the object in view, whereby amicable relations were preserved. The subjoined resolution, passed by the Vestry of St. John nearly forty years afterwards, testifies to the continued amity between the two bodies:— 31st May, 1781.—Resolved, that the Thanks of this Vestry be, and are hereby given, to the Vestry of St. Margaret, for their ready Assistance in Supporting the Rights of this Parish, against the Claims set up by the Rector, and that a Copy of this Resolution be transmitted by the Vestry Clerk of this Parish to the Vestry Clerk of St Margaret's to be laid before that Vestry at their next Meeting. A Parliamentary Grant was obtained for the restoration of St. John's Church from the disastrous effects of the fire in 1742:— Mch 16, 1743—Ordered that the unanimous thanks of this Vestry be, and the same are hereby given to Sr John Crosse, Bart.,* and to Sr Robert Grosvenor Bart for their extraordinary regard shewn this parish, by their great pains taken in obtaining the sum of Four thousand pounds from Parliament for the re-edifying the parish church of St. John the Evangelist. At the meeting of the two Yestries a Committee was appointed on 24th Oct. 1816 "to conduct the repair of St. John's Church" at an estimated outlay of £2,000; and a rate of Eightpence in the £. upon three-fourths of the rack rent was levied to raise the required amount. * M.P. for Westminster 1754-1761. Also contributed £l00 towards the cost of erecting new galleries in the Church, 1757. 83 Church-wardens. For full four hundred years Churchwardens have borne important part in the application of the principle of local self-government. Though primarily called into office, and more immediately concerned in the ecclesiastical affairs of the parish, ancient usage and statute law have imposed upon them functions in relation to almost every change and improvement, introduced since the Reformation, into the machinery for the government of the civil parish. Ample evidence of this in respect of Westminster may have been gleaned from the minutes of the Vestry, and from the selections from the Statutes so far as already reproduced. Custom from time immemorial has recognised a day of election of these officers peculiar to Westminster, where in the two civil parishes, as well as in the ecclesiastical districts, the appointments are made on the Thursday preceding Whit-Sunday, as distinct from the general practice of holding such elections in Easter week. From the ancient accounts, as well as from the "Roll of Fame" in the Vestry Room of St. Margaret's Church, the names of these worthies from 1458 may be learnt, and many of the benefactors of the parish recognised. For three hundred years the Churchwarden's accounts are inscribed on parchment. Some contain inventories of the church goods, chattels, ornaments, and effects; others (1594-1618) are remarkable as having artistic initial letters incorporating the arms of the Brown-Bakers', White-Bakers', Brewers', Vintners', Grocers', Butchers', Haberdashers' and Upholsterers' Companies, with which one or other of the Churchwardens for the year had been associated. Members of Parliament for the Borough, Justices of the Peace, Members of the Royal Household, Chief Burgesses, and others filling prominent local positions in their day and generation are readily called to mind as the list is unfolded. In 1644 a practice commenced of promoting the "junior" churchwarden of the expiring year to the "senior" office for the g 2 84 ensuing year, so that, with only occasional exceptions, each churchwarden served the parish for two years. This custom extended over two hundred years. From "time immemorial" to 1853, the choice of both Churchwardens was vested absolutely in the majority of the Vestrymen present. In the last-mentioned year "An Act for the appointment and regulation of Vestries in the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, Westminster," (16 and 17 Vict., cap. 225) prescribed a course to be followed in case the Rector and Vestrymen should disagree, in which case "the Rector shall nominate and appoint one of the Churchwardens, and a majority of the Vestrymen present shall then and there elect the other Churchwarden." In 1853 the Vestry appointed both Churchwardens,* in 1854 one was appointed by the Hector, although no "disagreement" is recorded or implied by the minutes. The rule thus established has been followed without exception, and governs the procedure at the present day. After the illustrations already given of the onerous demands made upon the Churchwardens, further reference to their duties may be omitted without apology. It is only proposed, therefore, to allude to the formalities attending the appointment, some of which are still observed, and to present two or three instances possessing exceptional interest. In 1669 an attempt was made to conduct two elections of churchwardens simultaneously—one in the Vestry at the east end of the church, the other in the porch at the west end. As the record recites the formalities then ordinarily observed, it is given in extenso:— In the Parish of St. Margts, Westmr, The Churchwardens are Chosen according to ye Antient Custom of ye sd Parish Tyme out of Mind, the Thursday before Whit Sunday at 2 of the Clock, in manner following. There is A Bell appoynted to be Tolled that ye Parishioners have * Mr. John Lettsom Elliot and Mr. Edgar Horne were the two gentlemen last chosen under the old régime. Both gentlemen happily survive, and continue their interest in the affairs of the parish, Mr. Edgar Horne still retaining his seat on the Vestry. 85 Notice, and thereupon doe Repayre to ye Church to seeye Churchwns, who be goeing forth of their Office, deliver up their Accoumpts and Ballance Moneys, and also to understand who be Chosen Churchwns for ye yeare ensueing. Then they have A Table sett in ye Chancell at which ye Dor or Minister of the parish, and ye rest of the Vestrey Men doe sitt. And thither ye Churchwardns in bringing their Accoumpts fairely engrossed and bound np in Veilam, together with ye Ballance Moneys, the Antient Vestrey Men at ye upper end of the Table Receiving them, and Inspecting at least ye Totall Sumes of what hath beene received, what pd, and what Remaines to Adjust ye sd Churchwns Acct. Then they Older and appoynt some that have already Executed ye same Office of Churchwardne to Audit ye sd Accoumpt, and within one Moneth to make Report thereof. This being done ye Vestrey men Adjourne from thence into ye Vestrey Roome and there take out of ye Records of the Names of former Overseeres of ye poore the Names of 8 or 10 persons and sett them down in this manner— A B C D alwaies setting down ye Younger of ye present Churchwardens first. Then they Debate ye fittest Man for that office and soe every one Crossing those whom they Judge the Meetest for it, he that hath the most Crosses stands Churchwarden for ye yeare. As soon as this is done they give ye paper into ye Hands [of] ye Reeder who immediately goeth therewith into ye Reading Pew and there in ye open Church and audience of the Parishioners psnt Publisheth and Declareth ye names of ye persone elected for Churchwardens to ye end they may have notice of ye same. After this ye Churchwns expired doe used to Invite ye Dor or Minister together withe ye Vestrey Men & other antient Inhabts of the Parish to A Supper at ye Charge of the sd Churchwardens. Now Whilest ye Minister and Vestrymen were in the Vestry Roome Electing ye Churchwns after ye antient manner for ye year 1667 Mr. Samuel Baker and Mr. Thomas Edwards having A Mind and Longing desire for ye Office of Churchwns believing (as well they might) That ye Vestreymen would not now choose them, procured those few that were Remaining in ye Chancell when ye Minister and Vestreymen withdrew themselves from out of the Chancell into ye Vestrey Roome who as the sd Mr. Edwards and Mr. Baker say chose and Elected them in ye church porch to be Churchwns of the psh of St. Margts Westmr for ye yeare 1667 by which they would Act, and accordingly declared abroad that they indeed were the Churchwardens which were chosen for ye said psh, though few or none would own it but themselves. And thereupon with Confidence they Enter A Caveat that ye Churchwns which were lawfully and justly chosen should not 86 be sworne untill they were heard. Which accordingly was done agnst Mr. Mich. Arnold and Mr. John Tyson, the undoubted lawfull Churchwns chosen by the Minister and Vestrymen according to the aforesd Antient Custom ye Thursday immediately before Whit Sunday. But upon full hearing and Debating ye whole Matter before ye Rtt Wopll Thom Exton Dor of ye Civil Laws and Judge of ye Officialle Court belonging to ye Dearie of the Collegiat Church of St. Peter Westmr. The sd Judge did declare That he saw noe Cause why ye sd Mr. Arnold and Mr. Tyson should not be Admitted & sworne to Execute ye Office of Churchwardens & pronounced Sentence on their side and did swere and Admit ye sd Mr. Arnold & Mr. Tyson to ye Execuson of the Office of Churchwns accordingly as being duely chosen by ye Vestrymen of the sd parish according to their antient Custom on Thursday next before Whitsunday in the Afternoone. Whereupon ye sd Mr. Baker & Mr. Edwards did appeale from ye sd Sentence to ye King's Matie And a Court of Delegatts was appoynted & Commissioned by ye King's Matie to heare and Determine ye Matter in Difference and so void and make Null ye Sentence aforesd if they found just Cause for ye Same.

In March, 1685-6, a difference of opinion arose between the Vestry and Messrs. England & Boult, in reference to the assignment of a seat in the new gallery of the church to Mr. Squier, an inhabitant, and a member of the Vestry. An information was thereupon laid before the Court of Charitable Uses, and a special Vestry was summoned at the instance of the Dean to take the matter into consideration. After a debate at this meeting ''the said Churchwardens "did, in contempt, depart from the Vestry, and being sent "to by the Vestry to returne they answered by Mr. Henry 87 "Roberts, Sexton, who was sent to them, that they would "not come." Objection was taken by the Vestry to the jurisdiction of the Ordinary in the matter of the information, and the Vestry disowned the proceedings thereon. The Vestry Clerk was thereupon instructed not to deliver any of the books in custody to any person whatsoever without an order of the Vestry, and an adjournment for a week was agreed upon. When the business was resumed, the Church, wardens offered an explanation as to the cause of their leaving the former meeting; but their statement was contradicted and ignored by the Vestry, who recorded their opinion that the conduct of the Churchwardens was contrary to the sense of the Vestry, an order being at the same time given that Articles be exhibited against the Churchwardens in the Spiritual Court for "their Contempt "of the Ordinary, this Vestry, and their Orders." The question of the employment of a sweeper and cleaner in the church was at this time imported into the dispute, and was included in the articles exhibited. The trial took place in April, 1687—more than two years later—when numerous witnesses, whose evidence is preserved, were examined. The Court suspended Mr. England from the office, and admonished Mr. Boult "for the future to "behave himself more modestly, and with more respect to "the Deaue and the Vestry, and to doe his duty." The decree also installed one Mary Stroud in office as a sweeper, and restored to the Vestry three books which Mr. England had "by a surprise" taken to his custody. After the conflict which the foregoing describes, it is a little surprising to find the Vestry sanctioning the act of the Churchwardens for the same year recorded in the Vestry Minutes of 23rd August, 1685:— The Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that they have granted to Madam Jepson libertie to make a casement to look into the Churche for her convenency of hearing prayers as long as she inhabitts in ye house adjoining to ye Church and passage in St. Margarett's Lane. 88 Without assigning any reason, the Vestry of a few years later ordered the casement to be built up. In this connection a notice of the appointment of the notorious John Wilkes as Churchwarden may be admitted. While sitting as Member of Parliament for Aylesbury, he was elected upon the Vestry on the 27 June, 1758. His first attendance as Vestryman was on 14th December, 1758; within five months he was chosen Churchwarden, with Mr. Samuel Peirson as his colleague. At the end of the year a cordial vote of thanks was unanimously accorded to Mr. Peirson for his "great and most signal services done in the faithfull execution of his office." Not a syllable is recorded concerning the retirement of the great agitator, nor is he nominated for re-election, in which respect he is an exception to the custom prevailing at the time. Whatever his success in other spheres, the Vestry minutes imply that he was voted a failure as churchwarden. The following record is unique. The culprit might possibly have been found among the disappointed applicants for charity gifts or relief, looking to the season of the year Monday, 5th January, 1778.—Mr. Glanville one of the Churchwardens of this Parish having this Day laid before the Vestry several anonymous Incendiary Letters which he has received within these five Months wherein his Life has been Threatened which Letters appear to the Vestry to have been sent to him merely as being Churchwarden of this Parish. Resolved and Ordered That for the better discovery and bringing to Justice the Person or Persons who wrote the said Letters or especially the last received, that a Reward of Twenty Pounds be given to any Party or Parties who shall give Information so that the Offender or Offenders may be brought to Justice and Convicted thereof. A specimen of other liabilities to which the Churchwardens were subject is met with a few years onwards:— Wednesday, 8th October, 1788.—Mr. Loton, Church Warden, laid before the Vestry a Notice which he received, whereof the following is a copy: "In the King's Bench. Take Notice, that this Honorable Court will be moved on the 89 first day of Michaelmas Term next, or so soon after as Councel can be heard, for a Rule to shew cause why an information should not be filed against you, for having on the 2nd day of September Instant illegally discharged out of Custody two Persons (being idle and disorderly persons) who were apprehended under and by virtue of a Search Warrant regularly issued under the hands and Seals of Edward Parker and George Ried Esquires two of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Middlesex, thereby acting in defiance and opposition to the said Magistrates, and contrary to Law. Dated the 22nd day of September, 1788. (signed) Frederick Smith, Solicitor, No. 7, Grays Inn." To James Loton. Resolved that this Parish will defend the said Churchwarden. In a review of the chronicles of nearly four centuries, the discovery of repeated references to the office of Churchwarden becoming vacant by death is not astonishing. In nearly all such instances the Vestry appointed gentlemen to the office for the unexpired portion of the parochial year. Only one entry occurs of a Churchwarden having become incapacitated during his term of office by loss of reason. In 1788-9 a report was made to the Vestry that one of the Churchwardens had been conveyed "to a place for the reception of Lunaticks at Clapton." The Vestry at once requested the colleague of the afflicted gentleman to take upon himself all the duties of the position until the close of year. Abundant as are the materials at hand from Relief of the Poor which an interesting history of the poor law system might be compiled, the present notice is necessarily confined to such information as the Minute books of the Vestry contain; and nothing more than a cursory selection from that source can be given in the space available. A thoughtful perusal of the extracts selected, will, however, throw light upon the manners and customs and conditions of the people, upon the curious means adopted to relieve the poor rate, and upon the remarkable resemblance borne by the present system to the principles recognised two centuries-and-a-half ago. With this introductory observation, the extracts from the Minutes must be left to "tell their plain unvarnished tale." 90 At a Vestrie holden at the parish Church of St. Margretts Westm. the 19th daie of December, 1644, it is ordered that in respect of the hardnes of these times, the Churchwardens shall supplie the Overseers for the poore wh. such monyes as they can convenientlie spare for the use of the poore. At the same Vestry it was also ordered That the Churchwardens shall make sale of the rich velvett pulpitt Cloath given by the Lady Hervy at the best rate they can and to accompt for the money received for the same for that is subiect to be moth eaten and decaye. That the Churchwardens shall make sale of the brass taken off from the Tombstones and otherwise being lose in a chest to the best value they can and to account for the money. The 20th Ffebruary, 1645. Ordered by His Maities Justices of the peace for the Citty and liberty of Westmr. and dyvers of the Inhabitants that the Burgesses and Assistants of their several! Wardes be desyred by themselves or other Assistants to goe and desyre a voluntary contribucion for and towards the raysing a stocke for setting of the poore on worke in these hard tymes. Under date 16th May, 1653, a Royal Warrant, which is still preserved at the Town Hall, was issued, delivering to the Churchwardens of St. Margaret, Westminster, "the louer room of the late King's Slaughter House, wherein to store coals for the poor." The storehouse was used for many years, and annually replenished at the expense of a bequest by Mr. Emery Hill. In December, 1660, the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor petitioned the King praying that the customary allowance to the poor upon the death of a prince might be granted on the occasion of the decease of the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess of Orange. The Vestry, by the Churchwardens, petitioned Sir Henry Bennett, Secretary of State, in Nov., 1664, praying for a restoration of the Royal grant of £100 which had been discontinued since 1661, and urged in support of the appeal, "that the Court of Whitehall is mostly in St. Margaret's "parish, and that the poor have encreased by reason of "soldiers, their widows and children having settled there, "in order to be close to the coast and parliament." 91 Another petition, in somewhat similar terms, was presented to the King in February, 1664-5. Other entries illustrate the supervision exercised by the Vestry over the collection and disbursement of the funds:— 4th March, 1668.—That a Petition be prepared to be presented to his Matie prayeing that ye summe of 100£ yearely given by his Matie for ye use of the Poore of this Parish may be continued & thus disposed of vizt. [50£ thereof to be Imployed yearely for ye Support of the Hospitall of Greene Coat Boyes in Tothull Fields in this parish founded by his Late Matie King Charles the first of ever blessed memory, & the other £50 to be Imployed by the Churchwns for the Tyme being for the use ot the Poore of this Parish as formerly it hath beene]. And that his Matie would be Gratiously pleased to grant a Privy Seal for the receiving of the sd £100 yearely & Imploying ye same as above expressed. 1st March, 1670.—That the Churchwardens doe give Ticketts to such of the Poore People of this Parish as they shall thinke fitt aske and receive the Almnes by broken Bread & Meate of such well disposed Housekeepers as will please to bestow the same. 6 Feb. 1660-1.—It is Ordered that the present Overseers of the Poore or any of their Successors Att any time hereafter shall not pay any money monthlie to the Poore of the parish of St Margarett's or unto any of them except only to the Nurses; and that the present Overseers of the Poore and their Successors doe continue their Care of the Poore of this Parish to the verie last day of their being in their Office And it is further Ordered that upon moneth daies when the present Overseers of the Poore or their Successors shall pay the Nurses the said Overseers or their Successors shall not then pay any money to the Poore as formerly they have done But shall goe to the houses of the Poore and there relieve them according as they shall see cause or ells send reliefe unto them It is also ordered that whatsoever Overseers of the Poore shall doe contrary to this Order the moneys well they shall in such wise disburse shall not bee allowed in their Accompt And of this the Clerke of the Vestrie is to take notice soe that such moneys bee not at anytime soe much as entred in their Booke of Accompt; And that this Order be entered in everie Overseers Accompt. At a Vestry held on the 18th Apl., 1659, an order was passed directing the Churchwardens to receive from Michael Arnold, William Wilkinson, and William Herbert, the sum of thirtysix pounds, the amount of their fines for not serving the office of Overseer,* and to pay the same to the succeeding Overseers for use in the discharge of their duties. *This is the first recorded case in which a fine was imposed for refusing to serve the office, although 98 years had elapsed since its creation. All the 92 7th October, 1674. Upon the application of Marie, the wife of Edward Arnold, prisoner (for debt) in the King's Bench prison It is thought fitt that the Churchwardens doe endeavour to free the sayd Edward Arnold from prison att as easy Rates as they can And the charge thereof shall be allowed in their Accompt. An entry in the Minutes of 17th Nov., 1674, following shows the Churchwardens to have freed the unfortunate prisoner by payment of forty shillings. Similar action was taken at frequent intervals. In the 2 and 3 of Queen Mary (1555-6) an Act of Parliament was passed requiring those who received relief to "wear openly on the breast or back of their outermost garment some notable badge or token to be assigned by the parish authorities or justices." The practice was soon introduced into Westminster, and, under the orders of the Vestry, renewed from time to time for at least a hundred and fifty years:— 6th Jany 169½.—That the Churchwardens and Overseers of the poor cause all psons who receive Alines of this parish to wear Badges or not relieve them. 6th July 1692.—That Mr Peter Rudge pay to Mr Fouler for badges for the poor ffour pounds tenn shillings and eight pence. 26th Aug., 1694. Whereas the poor of this parish are unknown to ye inhabitants, and several receive alms who are not really necessitous, It is ordered (nemine contradicente) that all such persons who are in any sort of pension or pay payable by the Overseers of the poor shall constantly wear badges on the outer part of their garment, and that if they or any of them shall by ye Beadles be found in the streets without such badges, that they be immediately discharged of the allowances usually paid them. Such preliminaries as an examination by two medical gentlemen and application to two justices were dispensed with in respect of the confinement of lunatics in asylums. The Vestry accepted both the scientific and judicial responsibilities:— 13th December, 1647. Ordered that James Timberley be fforthwith gott into Bedelham for the avoydinge of such further danger as may ensue upon his libertie he being a mad man and having four Overseers nominated in 1669 refused to serve, and were fined by the Vestry £12 each. In 1681 another fine of £12 was imposed; in 1685 two more of £12 each. 93 done much hurte, and what charges shall be laydd out for the same shall be allowed off. 3rd September, 1662. Ordered that the present Overseers of this parish doe take care for the present reliefe Goodwyfe Connorway, a person distracted, and that they inquire of the usuall course taken for getting such people into Bedlam, and do endeavor her speedy admittance accordingly. 17th Jany., 1690. Ordered that the Churchwardens cause Thomas Daniell to be put into Bethlehem. But skilled treatment was not always allowed in such cases:— 1st March, 169 2/3. That Mr. Redding, Governor of the House of Correction doe provide a Roome for one Pudsey, a Lunatick, committed to his custody, his ffriends providing him Victualls, and psh allowing the straw. A variety of expedients was resorted to by the Vestry during William III.'s reign to avoid increasing the compulsory poor rate. An experiment was made by way of a collection at the Church doors" on every first Sunday in the month in the morning"; but nine months saw it abandoned. The King was then appealed to, and with good effect. On the 13th July, 1698, the Churchwardens announced that His Majesty had been pleased to grant" for the use of the poor of the parish, towards defraying the great debt of the parish, the Bell* commonly called Great Tom of Westminster," and the tower or steeple in which it was suspended. The matter was taken in hand without loss of time, for within a few days the Charter under the Privy Seal was produced, and the machinery for "realising" set in motion. 1 Aug., 1698.—This day the Churchwardens produced his Matys Grant under the Privy Seal for the steeple near the New Palace and the Bell therein called Great Tom of Westminster, and desired this Board that they may have liberty to pull down the said steeple and bell. Ordered that the thanks of this Yestry be given to the Churchwardens for their care in procuring the said Grant and that they do forthwith cause the said steeple and Bell to be pulled down and to make the best advantage of lead, stone and other materials as they can and that the sole care therein bo left to the Churchwardens to take the advice of Sir Christopher *Mr Walcott (pp. 197-9) gives an interesting notice of this Bell. 94 Wren, Mr. Oliver &c. and what damage shall happen by pulling down of the said steeple, the Churchwardens shall be indemnified by this Vestry. The Charter was brought to light a short time since, and may be seen at the Town Hall. It contains a recital that "our trusty and well-beloved Sir Christopher Wren" had estimated the value of the gift at £224, so that the net result was greater than expected. By January in the next year the tower had been demolished, and in March a certificate, of which the subjoined is a copy, was produced to the Vestry:— We whose names are under written did on the third of February 169 8/9 cause the great bell called the Edward of Westminster to be weighed at St. Paul's Church and we do find it to weigh eighty two hundred, two quarters, and twenty-one pound. JO OLIVER Mastr Mason of St. Paul's EMERY ARGUIS ROBERT CHURCHILL Churchwardens Which bell at Ten pence pound amounts unto the sum of three hundred eighty-five pounds 17/6. Ordered That the aforesaid sum be made up four hundred pounds and that the Churchwardens pay the same in discharge of part of the debts due upon bonds and orders of this Vestry to such persons as shall be willing to receive the same. Besides the £385 17s. 6d. received for the bell, the materials of the tower produced £278 10s. 4d. Every detail relating to the demolition of the tower and the removal of the Bell to St. Paul's Cathedral is carefully recorded in a foolscap book of 100 pages; but interesting as some of the particulars might be, mention can only be made here of the total receipts, £664 7s, 10d., the cost of the demolition and removal, £233 7s. 1d., and the net sum gained for the relief of the poor. £431 0s. 9d. The produce of the sale having been expended, new sources of relief for the parochial burthens were sought in vain. The next transcript depicts the fiscal situation of the Vestry:— 23rd November, 1709—It being Represented to this Vestry that the number and necessities of the poor of this Parish are abundantly Encreased & it being proposed that an Additional Rate be made for the further and better Reliefe of the poor 95 A Special Meeting was summoned to discuss ways and means, with the result that application was made to the Justices to sanction an additional rate of sixpence in the pound. The Overseers were thereupon enjoined speedily to bring in their collections as often as they amounted to £50, towards discharging the money taken up at interest. An additional rate of sixpence in the pound was made under similar circumstances on many subsequent occasions. Out-door medical relief was dispensed under the Vestry's supervision:— 7 May, 1668. That the Church Wardens doe give unto John Sinclere' Chyrurgeon, the summe of Vs for his Redinesse and Care in Cureing the arm of one Walter Best, a poor Man of this Parish whose Hand was Cutt off by a Souldier, and the same shall be allowed in their Accoumpt. Sunday, 8th Sept., 1689. That the Churchwardens pay three pounds for ye Cure of Mary Cooke when she be cured & in the meantime to Releife her. 17th January, 1690. Ordered that the Chdns do pay Mrs. Lucey Tenn poundes in full for Cures till this day. 16 Jan. 1711.—Ordd—That the Church Wardens doe Recommend Mr. Booth Chyrurgeon to the Overseers of the Poor to employ him as Surgeon to ye Poor of this Parish and that he or any other Surgeon hereafter doe not undertake any cure without a Note undr the hand of one of the Churchwardens or Overseers of the said Parish for the time being. Odrd—That the Churchwardens Inspect Mrs Rogers's Bill Relateing to Cures of the Poor. Heavily as the parochial exchequer was pressed in order to meet parochial requirements, the Vestry extended a helping hand to foreigners. Sunday, Aug. 14, 1709. This Vestry has considered of the Proposal made by the Lords Comrs to the severall parishes, for setling the poor palatines: which was this day communicated to them by Tho Railton Esqre (a member of this Vestry). And are (as well out of their great Zeale to serve the Governmt as Charity towards the said poor people) very well disposed and affected to receive and take some of the said poor Palatines into this Parish. But not having come to any final Resolution touching the receiving and settling a certain Number of the said poor within this Parish (there being not so full a Vestry as was expected), Have 96 thought fitt to take some further time to consider of the same, and to that End have Adjourn'd this Vestry till Sunday next Four of the Clock in the afternoone: Against which time it is ordered, That Summons's be sent out intimateing particularly the Bussiness this Vestry is to meet on, Desiring them to come to a Final Resolution touching the receiving and settling some of the said poor palatines Upon the good Disposition of this Vestry for receiving and settling some of the poor palatines within this parish. William Green Esqre (a member of this Vestry) has proposed to take Two Families of the said poor palatines consisting of Ten Persons or thereabouts; which said Two Families he promises to take care of for Two Years, so that they shall not any wayes be troublesome or chargeable to this parish. Sunday, Aug. 21, 1709. Resolved That the number of the poor Palatines to be recd into this parish be Ten Families consisting of Fifty persons. The benevolence of Westminster might, indeed, almost be said to be world-wide. At least one of the flourishing States of America is indebted to the parish for material help at its foundation :— 10th May, 1733. It having been requested by the Trustees for Establishing a Colony in Georgia for the Minister, Churchwardens and principal Inhabitants of this parish to take Subscriptions and to gather and collect money for the said Charity. It is Agreed That this Vestry will give them Assistance therein provided the said Corporation do furnish them with proper powers. A warrant under the Seal of the State was received by the Vestry in the following year, appointing the Churchwardens, and other parish officers, treasurers for the raising of funds. This warrant, mounted on crimson silk, with its curious seal in clay, bearing a design of a silkworm on a mulberry leaf, was brought to light at the Town Hall a few years since, and suitably framed for preservation. A striking antithesis to the foregoing is afforded by a series of resolutions passed by the Vestry, on Sunday, 8th February, 1712. The Beadles of every Ward to make a Return Weekly or every fortnight of all Inmates or New Comers into the parish and of all others not haveing a Legall Settlemt.* * The practice of returning paupers to the place of their legal settlement has been in operation in Westminster since 1590. 97 To keep a Book for entring the examinations of all Persons last Settlemt. That Notice be given to all Landlords not to Entertain Inmates or Lodgers who have not a legall Settlement and likewise to the Inmates and Lodgers themselves in order to remove out of the Parish And upon not produceing a Certificate of their last Settlemt either to indict the Landlords or remove their Remnants by passing them away. The poor rate estimate made in the Spring having, as in several previous years, proved to be insufficient as the winter advanced, an appeal to the King (Geo. IT.) was forwarded, and a voluntary house to house collection instituted. His Majesty was "graciously pleased to bestow his most Royal Benefaction of One hundred pounds to be laid out in coals." Seventeen chaldrons were purchased (23 January, 1739), the "poor objects to receive the same" being recommended by the Churchwardens and Seventeen Vestrymen present. Mr. Churchwarden Haselar acquainted the Vestry that himself with Dr. Kenrick & some other gentlemen of the Vestry (in compassion to the deplorable circumstances of the numerous poor who are now reduced to the utmost distress by the extremity of the weather) had made a collection of £27 18s. 6d. for their relief; Therefore desired the Vestry to direct the distribution of the said benefactions for the relief of the said poor whose necessities are almost inexpressible. Ordd That each Vestryman present & Churchwardens be desired to recommend poor objects of charity, & to send a note to the Vestry Clerk but no member to order above Five pounds. Further sums, amounting to £60, were subscribed during the two succeeding weeks, and disposed of in like manner. Voluntary subscriptions were set on foot in January, 1767, and again in January, 1768, with the sanction and approval of the Vestry. £371 1s. 3d. was collected and disbursed in the first of these "severe seasons"; but in the second the Members of Parliament, Earl Percy and the Hon. E. Vernon, who contributed £70, were the only subscribers whose names are recorded. In 1743 the Vestry adjudicated upon a claim asserted by the watermen resident in the parish for a continuance of H 98 an exemption enjoyed by them for upwards of fifty years from payment of poor rates. The claim had been admitted on the passing of the Statute of 11 & 12 William III., wherein certain existing concessions were reserved to watermen in respect of the moneys earned on the Lord's Day. The Vestry consulted Counsel on the construction of the particular Section, and on the question whether the watermen of the parish were thereby relieved from the payment of rates. In reading the section, which is here reprinted, it will be necessary to bear in mind that Sunday labour was at the time a penal offence : — "Provided always that this Act or anything therein contained shall "not extend to hinder or prevent the Watermen of the parish "of St. Margaret, Westmr from plying or working across the "River of Thames from Westminster Bridge to Standgate, and "from the Horseferry to Lambeth Bridge on every Lords day "in there severall turns, as they have lately accustomed and "used to do; and that the moneys earned by them or any of "them on that day, is hereby Directed to be from time to time, " Imployed for the use of the Poor, Aged, Decayed, and maimed "Watermen and their Widows of the Parish of St. Margaret "Westmr " In the statement of case laid before Counsel, a point was made of the large rents paid by the watermen for their houses in the parish, and that men having other trades and callings followed sufficient business on the river to enable them to adopt the description of "watermen." In a full review of the law and facts, Counsel advised in effect that the watermen were simply allowed to follow their calling at the Lord's Day upon their presenting the gains therefrom to a private charity, and that the justices ought to grant distress warrants in default of payment when applied for. Anxious as the Vestry were for the relief of the poor in their own parish, they exhibited practical sympathy more than once with the misfortunes of the inhabitants of other parishes and towns in distant parts of the country, of which the subjoined may be taken as an illustration:— March 17, 1742. William Lowndes, Esq., on behalf of the Poor Sufferers by the late dreadful ffire at Stony Stratford in the 99 County of Bucks, Applied to this Vestry for leave for the inhabit" of Stony Stratford aforesaid to ask relief for the said Poor Sufferers within this parish. And this Vestry taking into consideration the deplorable circumstances of the said sufferers, Ordered that such relief be given, and that it be left to the Revd Dr. Kenrick and the Churchwardens to conduct the same. 27th June, 1731. This Vestry taking into their consideration the deplorable Circumstances of the poor Inhabitants—sufferers by the two late dreadful fires at Blandford, in the County of Dorset, and Tiverton, in the County of Devon; and being well assured that many persons in this parish and the neighbourhood are charitably inclined, and would contribute to the relief of those poor sufferers were a proper person appointed to receive their contributions; For the furthering of so good and charitable Intension, It is Ordered That the Churchwardens of this parish be (and they are hereby) desired to take upon them the receipt of such Charitable Benefactions for the relief of the said poor sufferers, and that a book be open'd for that purpose to-morrow morning at the house of Mr. John Williams, Grocer, in King Street, Westmr (one of the Churchwardens) and that they cause to be entered therein the names of such benefactors with their benefactions as well in words at length as in figures, whereto all persons may have resort. And lastly it is Ordered That this Order be forthwith published in some one or more of the Newspapers at the discretion of the Churchwardens, and as often as they shall think fit, and the charge shall be allow'd on their Account of Office and not out of the said benefactions, from which no manner of expense shall be deducted. 22nd August, 1731.—The Churchwardens acquainted this Vestry that the Benefactions paid into their hands for the relief of the poor sufferers at Blandford & Tiverton Amounted to Two hundred & Seven pounds & Nine shillings, besides Nine pounds eleven shillings given particularly for Blandford And fifteen pounds Six shills & Six pence, given in like manner for Tiverton, making in all the sume of Two hundred thirty two pounds Six shillings & Six pence, they also acquainted the Vestry that they had sent two letters to each of those places to desire Estimates of their respective losses and read one from Blandford undr their Corporation Seal certifying ye loss of that Town to be upward of One hundred thousand pounds, but had reced. no Estimate from Tiverton. And the Churchwardens having deferred this Vestry to direct the payment of the said Benefactions for ye relief of the said poor sufferers, whose Necessities (especially at Blandford) are almost inexpressible. Ordd That the Churchwardens do cause ye sume of One hundred & Twenty pounds part of the before menconed £207 9s. Od. to be remitted to the said Town of Blandford for the Poor sufferers H 2 100 there And likewise the said sume of £9 11s. 0d. which was given particularly to that Town as abovesaid making in all One hundred twenty nine pounds & Eleven shillings; and this Vestry when they shall receive an Estimate of the loss of Tiverton will make an Order for a final distribution. Ordered That the Book of Benefactions be kept open by the Churchwardens until such Order shall be made by this Vestry. 27ill Augt. 1731.—The Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that (pursuant to their Order) they had paid into the hands of Mr. Alderman Child the sum of One hundred & twenty Nine pounds & Eleven shillings to be remitted by him to ye sufferers of Blandford And that they had since Recd an Estimate from Tiverton of their loss amounting to ye Sume of £56,056 4s. 9d. And this Vestry having now determined to make a final distribution of the money paid to ye Churchwardens for ye poor sufferers of those Towns, Do Order That the Churchwardens do pay to Mr. Cooper Goldsmith in ye Strand the sum of Eighty five pounds for the relief of the poor sufferers of the Town of Tiverton the same being the full proportion now allotted them. And the Sume of Seventeen pounds fifteen Shillings & Six pence to Mr. Alderman Child being the remainder of what is now allotted for the poor sufferers of Blandford. Spontaneous contributions were occasionally made to the funds for the relief of the poor. On Tuesday, 20th January, 1795, The Churchwardens laid before the Vestry a Letter from his Grace the Duke of Northumberland, of which the following is a copy:— Lyons, Jany. 15th, 1795. Gentlemen, As I am convinced the present very severe Weather must greatly distress the lower Class of People. I have taken the liberty of sending enclosed Thirty Pounds in Bank Notes, which I beg you will do me the Honor of distributing in my name, amongst the Poor Inhabitants of your Parish. I am, Gentlemen, Your most obed' Serv', NORTHUMBERLAND. To the Gentlemen of the Vestry of St. Margaret's, Westminster. In the distress occasioned by the war, and increased by the winter, relief in kind was distributed upon payment by the recipients of a part of the cost:— Tuesday, 21th Jan, 1795. Resolved that Bread be sold to Poor People who shall be Recommended by Subscribers at Six pence the 101 Quartern, and Meat, (viz.) Thin Flanks, Briskets, Leg of Mutton pieces, Clods, and Breasts of Mutton at Three pence the pound, and the difference to be Paid by the Treasurer, the Bread according to Assize price, and the meat after the Rate of Three Shillings p. stone. In-door relief may be taken to have been introduced in 1572, by Statute of 14 Elizabeth, cap. 5,* sec. xvi. "And forasmuchas Charitye would that pooro aged and ympotent persons should as necessarylye be provided for as the said roges vagabounds and sturdye beggars repressed and that the said aged ympotent and poore people should have convenient habitacons and abydinge places throughout this Realme to settle themselves upon to thend that they nor any of them should hereafter begge or wander about it ys therefore enacted that the said Justices shall within lyke convenient tyme devise and appoynt meete and convenient "places by their discretions to settle the same poore people for their habitacons and abydinges." Westminster had its workhouse established probably under this enactment in 1655. In the north-east corner of the Sessions House a stone tablet, removed from the original workhouse, is built in the wall, bearing the inscription :— Here are several sorts of work for the poor of this parish of St. Margarett's Westminster as also the County according to Law and for such as will beg and live idle in this City and Liberty of Westminster, Anno 1655. The first allusion to the workhouse in the Vestry Minutes is nine years later:— 6 Oct. 1661. That the Eighty Eight Pounds to be payed by Margaret Smyth unto Mr. Dorington and Mr. Andrews present Churchwardens of the Parish of St. Margaret's Westmr as in the next preceding Order is expressed be forthwith on Receipt thereof payd unto Sr Wm Playters (in respect of a former Engagement of the Parish to Sr Willm as by an Order of the Vestrie of the 19th of December 1663 relation being thereunto had may appeare) for and towards the building of a Worke House and provideing of a Stock to set the Poore at Worke. Thursday, 5th January, 1664. That the Churchwardens doe call to their Assistance such persons (Members of this Vestry) as they shall thinke fitt who are to meete once every weeke at the least to Consider of Matters touching the New Workehouse in *This is the earliest Act in which "Overseers" of the poor are appointed by that name, although they had been called into existence under the title of "Collectours" in 1551-2 by Statute 5 and 6, Edward VI., cap. 2. 102 Tuttle ffeilds and other Affaires of this Parish. And to make Report of their severall Proceedings at the Genl Vestry next following. Their first meeting to be at the sayd Worke House and thence to Adjourne as they shall see good. Wednesday, 6th August, 1G73. The proposalls of Thorn Ealey of ye Burrow of Southwarke, Weaver made to ye Vestry this day to be p'sented to ye President and Corporation for ye Poor of St. Margts in Westmr for Imploying ye said Poore at ye Workhouse in Tuttle ffeilds. To Card and Spinne Cotton and to allow the same Rates that is now at ye same House to the Poore now Imployed there. That hee will Imploy such persons in Spinning of fflaxe as cannot doe other worke, and to allow such Rates for ye same as is now given at the same House. To Imploy the poore that doe not Spinne Cotton or fflaxe in Spinning of Woole or Wosted and Knitting the same as they shall be Capable of. And to Allow such Rates as is Allowed for such Worke in ye Citty of London. THOMAS EALEY. That the Churchwardens be desired to attend ye President and Corporation for the Poore of the Citty and Liberty of Westmr and acquaint them with the proposition of Thomas Ealey touching his Imploying the Poore of this Parish at worke. On the 12th June, 1674 the Vestry desired the Churchwardens "to provide cotton and fflaxe for Manufacture in the Workhouse and to imploy such persons thereabouts as they shall thinke fitt." By degrees the provision and management of these establishments passed into the more representative hands of the Churchwardens and Overseers, albeit in Westminster the responsibility was exercised by the Vestry. Supplies for the parish workhouse were first obtained by Contract in 1743 :— Easter Tuesday, April 5, 1743. Resolved and Agreed That the Workhouse of these Parishes be for the future served by Contract from half-year to half-year, and that those in every Trade or Profession who shall propose to serve it at the cheapest rate shall be admitted as Contractor, with this Distinction only That those who have served offices in either of the said Parishes shall have the preference, in case two or more persons shall make the same offer, and that no person shall be allow'd to sit or vote in any Committee for managing the said Workhouse during the time of their serving the same with any Provisions or Materials whatsoever. 103 A singular instance of maladministration in the workhouse was brought to light in 1750, when it was discovered that out of 106 infants under 20 months old, 16 had been discharged with their parents and 83 had died, leaving only 7 in the workhouse alive. The report of a Committee of investigation attributed this great mortality "to the neglect and bad management of the nurses," and advised, as a remedy, the discharge of the nurses who were "most of them capable of providing for themselves," and the removal of the surviving children, with such others as might be admitted, to "Country Nurses, not to exceed 2s. 6d. per week for children that feed, and three shillings for sucking children, the parish to provide proper clothing," until the infants reached two years of age. The Vestry adopted the suggestions of the Committee but gave the mothers the option of nursing their own children at the above rates of payment. The "boarding out system" propounded in the report was not new. It had existed, as shown by the Overseers' accounts of payments, in 1562—nearly two hundred years previously. An outbreak of fever, fifty years later, caused renewed anxiety. 19 March, 1801.—Mr. Churchwarden Dawes reported that the Vestries of the Joint Parishes upon an application from the Board of Governors of the Poor had Resolved that a seperate House should be procured for the reception of Persons afflicted with Fever in order to prevent Contagion among those who were admitted into the Workhouse and had appointed a Committee for carrying the said Resolution into effect The Committee being of Opinion that the Spot where the Coal Shed stands in the Horsferry and belonging to the Parish of St. Margaret would be the most eligible for the above Purpose Had Resolved to apply to the Vestry of the Parish of St. Margaret for leave to erect the necessary Premises & the Church Wardens had at the request of the said Committee Summoned this Meeting to Consider and determine upon such Application Accordingly—Upon motion regularly made and Seconded It was unanimously Resolved That the Church Wardens & Overseers of the Poor of the Parishes of St. 104 Margaret & St. John the Evangelist have leave to erect the necessary Premises for the reception of the Sick of the said Parishes over the Coal Shed aforesaid Upon Payment of the Sum of 20/-ss P. Ann. to the Church Wardens of the Parish of St. Margaret for the time being. A very large number of entries relating to the workhouse system might be transcribed were space available. A lack of method in the recovery of the Poor Rate existed at a comparative recent date. On Thursday, 12th September, 1776, the case of a widow was brought before the Vestry in which the annual sum of £1 6s. 0d. had been allowed to fall into arrear for 23 years The debtor attended with her solicitor, and pleaded that as no demand had been made no liability on her part existed. The Vestry were advised otherwise; but agreed to a compromise on ten guineas being paid down. Upon the minutes of a joint Meeting on Wednesday, 13th August, 1823, a classified statement of the moneys applicable to the Relief of the Poor for the year then ended is entered, showing the following:— Collected in the Grand Division £4330 16 9½ „ „ Absey „ £4088 15 8 „ „ St. John's,, £3513 19 9 Cash recd by Ovrs of the Poor for Basty and or matters £349 6 1 Cash received for Work by the Poor in the House:— Flocks and Hair Picking £27 13 6 Making Paper Bags 13 4 2 Spinning Worstead 40 12 3 Picking Oakum 31 0 0 Winding Cotton 79 10 10 Needle Work 322 7 0¼ £514 7 9¼ Mem.—960 Pr of Shoes were manufactured and the Shoes of the Poor in the House repaired, but being distributed to the poor they do not form a Cash Account. Assessment Almost inseparable from the question from the of Property, compulsory rate for the relief of the poor is that of the basis upon which the rate was calculated and levied. For fully two hundred and fifty years after the compulsory 105 principle was recognised, certain exemptions were allowed by an 'unwritten law,' varying at different periods according to the class of property occupied, or the office of the occupier. The control and regulation of these exemptions was taken in hand by the Vestry:— 27 July, 1693. Ordered That from hence forwards no Overseers presume to lessen any of the Rates and Assessments charged on any of the inhabitants within this parish for Relief of the Poor without order from the Justices of the Peace or at least an order from this Vestry, and if any such sum shall be by them abated such Overseers shall be liable to make good the same to the poor and that from time to time the Clerk of the Vestry give notice to the Overseers of such Order. After the severance of the parish of St. John the Evangelist, the Church Rate as well as the Poor and other Rates, was levied "within and through all parts and districts of the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist," the introduction of the practice commencing on Easter Tuesday, 31st March, 1730. The principle was confirmed on 18th February, 1735, in consequence of which a demand was made on 16th May following, upon the Joint Vestries by the Churchwardens of St. John for payment of £116 3s 0d. for their church expenses. Although the necessity for a general and uniform system of assessment, "without distinction," was proposed by the Justices, the Vestry resented any interference with their own prerogative in the matter, and directed the Overseers to "collect only from those persons who are not likely to become burthensome to the parishes " :— 20 Mch, 1749. Whereas this Vestry hath been Informed that the Overseers of St. Margaret's and St. John's have been served with a paper signed by the Clerk of the Petty Sessions purporting to be, an Order of the said Sessions for the said Overseers to Collect of all persons rated in the present Assessment for the Relief of the poor which paper contains as follow. "St. Margaret's At a Petty Sessions held. " Vestry-room "Tuesday, February, 21st 1749. " Ordered, That the several and respective Overseers of the poor of the "parishes of Saint Margaret and Saint John the Evangelist 106 "do demand and Collect of all and every Person and Persons "rated and Charged in the present Assessment made for "the Belief of the poor of the said parishes, and that the "said Overseers where they find any New-comer or any "Person Living in any House not charged in their proper "Names or any person omitted in the said Assessment, that "they note the same in the Margin of their Collecting "Books in order to their being Assessed, and that Copies of "this Order be delivered to the said Overseers. "by Order of the Justices, "JOHN FEARY, Clerk Resolved unanimously, That it is the opinion of this Vestry that the Contents of the said paper are Unprecedented, without Foundation in Law, and not proper to be Complied with, and as the Collecting of all persons Rated without distinction is contrary to custom, and may be attended with great Inconveniencies by making many persons and their Families who have no Settlemt in these parishes burthensome to the same and Consequently Increase the poors Rate, It is the desire of this Vestry that the Overseers would not comply therewith but Collect only of those persons who are not likely to become Burthensome to the said parishes and this Vestry will Indemnify them from all Charges on Account thereof And it is further Ordered that a Copy of this Resolution be immediately served on the several Overseers. Upon the adoption of the window tax, the inhabited house duty, and the tax on watches and clocks, in 1798, as aids and contributions for the prosecution of the war, the Commissioners called upon the Vestry to assist them in relation to the assessment of properties for the purpose, and to investigate and settle the securities to be given by the collectors of the taxes. On an Act being passed in 43 Geo. III. (1804) for the relief of those unable, through poverty, to discharge the heavy fiscal burthens of the day, the Vestry were entrusted with the examination of the Assessors' reports on such cases, and with the issue of certificates of discharge from the taxes, a duty which was performed for many years in succession. Maintenance of Highways and Bridges. By Statute of 22 Henry VIII. Cap. 5 (1531) the Justices of the Peace were constituted the highway authority in "every shire, franchise, cittie, or 107 borough." They were commissioned "to enquire here and determyne in the Kinge's gen'all Cessions of Peace of all man' of anoysances of bridges broken in the highe wayes to the damage of the Kynges liege People; and to make such pees and paynes upon every presentement afore them for the reformacion of the same agayne such as owen to be charged for the makynge or amendynge of such bridges." The justices were also empowered to call the constables to their assistance in fixing the responsibility for the repair upon the inhabitants of "the Cittie or Towne Corporate or Shire, or Ryddyne," and to apportion the cost of the works upon the parties found to be liable. Where uncertainty existed as to the shire, riding or hundred in which the outlay was required, the Justices were authorized to "taxe and settle every inhabitante to such reasonable ayde and summe of money as they shall thynke convenient and sufficient." Two collectors of the tax were to be appointed for every hundred, and two surveyors of highways were also to be appointed for the same area. Further legislation took place in 2 and 3 Philip and Mary (1556), when an Act (cap 8) was passed " for amending of highways, being now both very noisome and tedious to travel in and dangerous to all passengers and carriages." By this measure the aid of the parishioners in Vestry assembled is invoked, and the parish becomes a recognised area for local administration. (2) Be it enacted by the authority of this present parliament, that the constables and churchwardens of every parish within this realm, shall yearly upon the Tuesday or Wednesday in Easter week call together a number of the parishoners, and shall then elect and chuse two honest persons of the parish to be surveyors and orderers for one year, of the works for amendment of the highways in their parish leading to any market-town. The surveyors and orderers so appointed were invested with discretion as to what persons and conveyances should be employed in repairing the roads. These officers were also to name and appoint fourdaysfor the execution of the work,of which notice was openly to be given in the Church the next 108 Sunday, and "upon the said days the parishioners shall endeavour themselves to the amendment of the said ways." The labour was to be apportioned upon the parishioners according to the extent of their lands :— "Every person for every plow-land in tillage or pasture that he or she shall occupy in the same parish, & every other person keeping there a draught or plough, shall find & send one wain or cart furnished after the custom of the country with oxen, horses, or other cattle, & all other necessaries meet to carry things convenient for that purpose, & also two able men with the same, upon pain of every draught making default, ten shillings, (5) & every other householder, and also every cottager and labourer of that parish able to labour & being no hired servant by the year, shall by themselves or one sufficient labourer for every one of them, upon every of the said four days work and travel in the amend of the said highways, upon pain of every person making default, to lose for every day twelve pence." Every person and conveyance so employed was to have and bring all necessary picks, spades, shovels and other tools; they were to be employed for eight hours on each of the four days; they were liable to answer their neglect before the court-leet, and to have the amount of the fine doubled if not paid within 20 days. The forfeitures were to be applied by the Churchwardens to the cost of maintaining the highways, and the bailiffs or collectors were to be allowed eightpence in the pound on the amounts collected. Owing, it may be, to the increasing number of houses in Westminster, and to the consequent decreasing number of "plough lands, tillages, and pastures," if not also to the large area of low-lying lands occasionally submerged by high tides, the application of this Act was attended with unsatisfactory results. Nevertheless requisitions upon the inhabitants to supply teams were in operation a hundred and seventy years afterwards:— 21 st June, 1726.—Ordered that the Churchwardens do endeavour to inform themselves of the number of teams that are liable to statute work in this parish and of the amount of their value for one year. Towards the end of Elizabeth's reign the people of 109 Lambeth complained to the Secretary of State of the common nuisance arising out of the broken down "banck that leadeth from Westminster to the horse ferric"; but the parish endeavoured to fix the liability to repair upon the proprietors of the ferry. From the Vestry minute book, commencing with the year 1591, the following selections are made as illustrative of the manner in which public business was then transacted :— To my loving friendes the balie and Burgessie of the cittie of Westm'ter. After my hastie comendation I send yon here inclosed a peticion lately presented unto me by the inhabitantes of Lambeth whereby you may perceive what it is they complaine of, for my owne parte I will impose nothing upon you in particular not knowing how farre you are tyed to satisfie theim in their demandes Onlye in generall I have thought fitt to advise you to consider amongst yr selves what is to be doone on yr pte, which I wish forthwith to be performed. The rather for that it concernes the reperation of a comon Nusaunce whereof every man doth participate that have occasion to mak usse of the ferrie and I have heard it heartofore much complained of, though I am ignorant wheather it be yr part to see reformation. And soe I bid you farewell fro the Court att Greenwitch this 20th May 1602. yr Loving friend ROB. CECILL. The petition to which the foregoing letter to the Vestry relates is entered upon the minutes, as follows:— To the right Honble Sir Rob. Cecill Knight, principall Seacretaire to the Queen's most excellent maiestie. The Humble peticion of Abraham Merrick and others the Inhabitaunces of Lambeth. Whereas about ij yeares past a peticion was delivered to yr house toutching the reperation of the banck that leadeth fro Westminster to the horse ferrie boate, which by yr Honors good meanes was then somewhat mended, but yet in such slender manner as that the same is still in winter time in some places unpassable. And moreover the said banck is so exceedingly annoyed by reason ef the milditch there adjoining and the spring tides, that if yr Honor be not a meanes for redressee in this behaulfe, noe subject by any meanes can have passage that way. And for that the said banck is in the parish of Westminster, yor Suppts most Humblye beseeche yor Honor to cause the Surveior for the highways of Wesmre aforesaid to whom it appertaineth that without delay they doe repaire and amend the said 110 bancke soe sufficiently that without danger or hindrance her maiesties subjects may have free passage.

And, whereas, yor honor hath directed your letter to us to consider amongste orselves what is to be done on or parts, we have accordingly mett togeather & find the Inhabitance of Westminster have not beene chardged herewith heretofore, but they which have the profitt of the ferrie which by due proofe we are redy to show have heretofore usuallie repaired the said bancke. And have had license of the late Dean of Westminster by the mediation of frendes to dig gravill in Tuttell for the repaire thereof they both paieing for the digging & carriadge thereof. And have at sundrie times brought furres & other stuff from Lambeth to repaire the same. The farmors of the ferrie have heretofore maid like suit unto yor Hoble deceased father who hath taken notice of their uniust request, & being satisfied therein gave them answer accordingly. Even soe with remembrance of or dutye to vor Honor, We humbley take our leave, Westminster, 31st May, 1602. No improvement having been made during twelve montlis following this representation, the parishioners of Lambeth appealed to the Privy Council through the instrumentality of the Archbishop of Canterbury:— To the reverend father in God the lo. Archbishop of Caunterberrie primat & metropolitan of all England & one of her maiesties most Hoble Privie Counsel], Whereas we the Inhabitantes of the parish of St Margretts in Westminster have been chardged & required by Mr Deane of Wesminster by the mediation of yor Grace to amend and repaire the banck that leadeth from Westminster to the horse ferrie the same banke beinge very fowle & in great decay May it please yor Grace to be advertised that the said bancke hath not beene att any time repaired by the Inhabitantes of Westminster but hath allways since it was first maid a way or passage to the ferrie been repaired and amended by those who have had the profitt of the said ferrie as we can sufficiently prove by the testimonie of divers witnesses the same being noe ancient highway but was taken out of the close next adioying for the advantage of the ferrie and notwithstanding the 111 ferriemen at severall times by their humble peticion long since maid to the right Hoble the lo. Burghley late lo. Treasurer of England & since that time to the rightHoble the lo. Cecill have much importuned their lordships to cause the surveiors of high wayes in Westminster to repair the said bancke Yet it was sop plainly & evidently proved that the said Inhabitantes weare not to be charged with the repairing of the said bancke as their Lordships weare therewith verie fully satisfied And now the said bancke is soe ill kept & maintained by the ferriemen as in the winter time it is not passable and therefore it doth proceed that the said ferriemen doth continew his chalinge & accusation against Westminster not for any hope or expectation he hath that the parishioners of Westminster can or ought or will intermedle in the repairing thereof but that he may have a shadow or colour to excuse himself of his deserved blame which otherwise ho can not excuse but by his uniust & wrongful imputinge the fault to others And if the said ferriemen or any others doe make any question or doubt of the truth of the premisses we the said parishioners are redie to make our iust defence by a tryall at the comon law whensoever we shall be drawne thereunto Written and subscribed by us the Inhabitantes of Westminster aforesaid 16th day of May 1603 William Godard, Christopher Ricrofte, Ed Doubleday, Morris Pickering, Marmaduke Servant, Cutberd Linde, Tho Skinner, Rob. Goulding, Willia. Man, Tho Tickeridge The like controversie being betweene chelsey and battersea for the ferrie there it was tried in the chequer chamber & there adiudged that the ferrieman having the profitt on both sides should maintaine the ferrieway on both sides which in chelsey having the profitt maintainetli both the wayes. Another approach to the ferry shortly afterwards (1604) occasioned the service of a requisition, at the instance of the King, upon the Burgesses, by whom it was transferred to the Vestry; but the steps taken upon it are not recorded:— The Earl of Worcesters letter to the Burgesses of Westminster. Whereas the way from Tuttell in Westminster that leadeth to the Ferry is so decayed and so rotten that his Mates Horses Coaches and Servants and Noblemen's servants that are to attend his Mates cannot pass in safety and have thereof made sundry complaynts unto me These are therefore to require you forthwith to take such order that the said Way may be repared and sufficiently mended according to the Statutes and Laws provided in that behalfe as you will answer to the contrarye 112 upon further complaynt. And so with my very hearty cornmentions I bid you right well to faire from Court this 20th of May, 1604. From your loving friend, E. J. WORSESTOR. Forty-five years later the liability to repair the Mill bank was still in question, in consequence of which a conviction was obtained against the parish :— May 12, 1647.—Ordered that the Churchwardens shah paie to Nicholas Wisby twentie shillings for an amerciament for not mending the Bridge at the Mill, and that mr Arnold shall have twentie shillings dd to him wh hee paid to Thos. Vincent for serving the place of Surveyor of the highwayes the last yeare in the stead of mr Ffuller who refused the place. Indictments were also laid on account of the neglected state of other highways, and the opinion of counsel was taken :— . 12th August, 1654. Whereas the parish hath bene heretofore presented for not repaireing the High wayes (vizt) from Knightsbridge to Westm. and from Kensington gravole pitts to Baynard's watering place And whereas there was a tryall had by the Churchwardens at the upper Bench the said wayes and this parish was freed thereof for the charges, of wch tryall the Churchwardens are to have allowance in their accompt, and Whereas there are severall presentments upon this parish in Generall for not repaireing the Mill bridge wch is considered ought to be repaired & maintained by some pticuler Inhabitante adioyneing to the said Bridge It is ordered that the Churchwardens gett the state of the case truely sett downe and thereupon if they be soe advised by some Learned Counsell in the Lawe that they goe to a tryall for the same with all convenient speed. 8th April, 1656. The Churchwardens are desired to take the advice of learned Counsell touching the Indictment brought and found against this parish for the not amending of the pavement leading from Tuthill Street to the new Chappell whether it bee fitt to traverse that Indictment or not and what is fitt to bee further done in the busines. The Vestry shortly afterwards raised money for repairing the highways :— 24th Apl., 1656. It was ordered that the summe of One hundred ffiftie three pounds sixe shillings & eight pence bee forthwith Assessed upon the Inhabitants of this parish for the repairing of the highwaies belonging to the same for this yeare 1656. The surveyors and the Justices were nevertheless active 113 in their endeavours to maintain the thoroughfares in a fair degree of efficiency, as is proved by the imposition of further fines, and the Vestry manifested a disposition to carry out their obligations more readily :— 23rd February, 1675. The Churchwardens report (viva voce) That they have made some progresse in the Busines of discharging the fines layd on this parish for Defects in the Highways It is ordered That the said Churchwardens be desired to proceed therein effectually and compleate the same. ls£ June, 1675. That yc Churchwardens doe desire some of his Matics Justices of the Peace to view the Highwaies in this parish and certifie That ye Defects therein (for which the parish are Fyned) are well and sufficiently Repayred And gett the said ffynes Discharged. 28th November, 1677. That Mr. Nehemiah Arnold* be desired to speake with Mr. Atherley Clerke touching the Indictments that lye against the parish for Defects in the Highwaies. Sunday, 4th March, 1679. That the Churchwardens go to an Attorney about the parish busines touching the Highwaies. The Vestry also found it necessary to take measures to suppress obstructions :— 5th January, 1675.—That the Churchwardens doe take effectual course against such as doe annoy the way between the new Chappell and Sturton Ground. 1st Feby., 1675.—The Churchwardens this day (viva voce) Report That they have already Indicted one person for annoying yc way between the N. Chappell and Sturton Ground and are resolved to proceed further therein. A proposal to divert a public road is closely and successfully watched by the Vestry :— Wednesday 12th Oct., 1681. The Churchwardens are desired to take care to Informe themselves when the jury do meete touching the turning of the King's Highway at Pimlicoe and imploy Mr Rampaine thereabouts when occasion shall require. Sunday, 18th Decr., 1681. Touching the altering of the Rode at Pimlicoe it is ordered that Mr Augier be desired to attend Sr Christop Wren and pray his Advice in the case. Sunday, 23rd July, 1682.—Ordered that Sir John Cutler Sir George Dowing Mr Newman Mr Laurence Mr Squire or any three or more of them be desired to waite on the Rt Honble the Earle of Arlington Lord Chamberlaine of the King's Matics Household to acquaint him with the ready & ffree Consent of this Vestry for the altering of the Highway at the West end of St James's * One of the Justices and a Member of the Court of Burgesses acting as Vestryman. I 114 Park leading from the Towne of Knightsbridge to this parish And to make report thereof at the next Vestry. The gentlemen reported at the next Vestry that his Lordship "was pleased to returne this Answer that he tooke it very kindely from them and that he would represent and Report the same to his Matie in such manner as might conduce most to the best advantage of this parish." The attention of Parliament being called to the unsatisfactory condition of the streets and roads in London and Westminster in 1664-5, an important and comprehensive addition was made to the Statute Book in 14 Charles II., whereby the repairs, obstructions, rates, traffic, scavenging drainage and lighting of the highways were entrusted to a Commisson of 21 Members, with a place of meeting in Scotland Yard. Each householder was thereby required to repair, pave, and keep in good order the street or way before his house and walls, to the middle of the street or way, under a penalty of 20s. for each perch or rod, and 20s. per week until repaired to the satisfaction of the Commissioners. The interests of Westminster were guarded by the appointment of the Dean, the High Steward, the Deputy Steward, and the two chief Burgesses as Commissioners. Amendments and extensions of this Act were made in a Supplemental Act passed in 22nd Charles II. (1681—2). "For the better repairing and amending of the highways, now generally spoiled by the extraordinary and unreasonable lading of waggons and other carriages; and the neglect of repairing and preserving the same." The power to require the inhabitants to send men and horses on to the road was renewed and extended to six days, on which days, after notice publicly given some convenient time previously, "all persons liable to the said work shall attend and work accordingly." The Justices were invested with authority to enforce payment of such rates as might be levied, and to determine any disputes between inhabitants or others as to 115 their liability to repair. No travelling "wanes" carrying goods were to be drawn by more than five horses in length, and a number of minor directions were given. From this time the Legislature added such numerous regulations affecting highways to the Statute Book, that they cannot be separately noticed here. Bearing in mind that the Vestry had formerly required to be satisfied of their legal liability to repair roads within their own parish, it is not surprising to find that they resented the claims made upon them to bear the cost of repairing highways miles beyond their jurisdiction. The first recorded payment was made under protest:— Tuesday, 7 May, 1672.—Mr Nehemiah Arnold High Constable Applying himselfe unto the Vestry this day, and produceing a Warrt signed by Nine of his Matles Justices of the Peace for ye County of Midd's for the Levying of the Sume of Tenn Pounds upon the Inhabitants of this Parish towards Repayreing the Bridge at New Brainford over ye River Brent in the sayd County The Vestry takeing ye same into their Consideration and not findeing anie president for makeing a Taxe of the like nature And for preventing the Clamour of the people in this case have thought fitt and doe accordingly Order That the Churchwardens doe pay the sayd Sume of Ten pounds unto the sayd High Constable out of such moneys as are remayneing in their Hands as Churchwardens of this parish And the same shall be allowed at the passing of their Accompt. In 1686 a precept appears to have been made upon the Vestry, requiring them to contribute to the cost of maintaining bridges outside the parish, a liability which was strenuously resisted. A conference with the Churchwardens in the parishes forming the liberties of Westminster was arranged (.3rd February, 168 6/7), but was not successful in procuring relief from the charge. The minutes for Thursday, 5th May, 1687, record, with reference to a fine levied upon the parish for the cost of repairing the Bridge at Brentford, that:— Upon a debate of the whole matter concerning the ffine of 100 £ sett upon the whole County whereof 58 £ is already leavyed in this Parish and being informed that the Sheriffe is intended to leavye the other 42 £ likewise in this Parish It is thereupon ordered I 2 116 that the said 42 £ hee paid forthwith to the Sherriffe upon his Distresse And that a mocon be made after such Distresse tomorrow morning in the Court of Excheqr for the stopping of the 100 £ in the Sherriffe's handes untill the matter relating to the Bridge bee decided by Law And that the Churchwardens who hath or shall pay the said 100 £ shall be indempnified and repaid by this Vestry And that it bee moved att the same time that the money collected for the Bridges in the Petty Constables handes shall bee paid into such handes as Councell shall think fitt to move the Court for. So promptly was the matter followed up that within a week the Vestry appointed three of its Members "to meet "at the Sessions at Hickshall and discourse the Justices for "the County to stop the monies in the Constables hands "for Brainford Bridge." A fortnight later (1st June, 1687) the Churchwardens were ordered "upon any occasion relateing to the Tryall "concerning Brainford Bridge * * to assist Mr. Ram"paine with money and waite upon Councell to prosecute "the same." The process of the law was almost as tedious two centuries ago as at the present day, for after an interval of three months an attorney was instructed by the Vestry to "draw up the Case relating to the Bridges and to take "advice thereupon of Sir Francis Pemberton and Mr. "Pollixfen, and in case he refuse then to bring the papers "and abstracts to Mr. Newman (a Justice of the Peace and "Vestryman) who is desired to take it upon him." Eleven months after the first resolution to proceed to trial the following entry occurs :— Wednesday, 4th Jany., 1687. Upon reading the Case abt Brentford case concerning Brainford Bridge drawne up by Mr. Bridge. Steward Bonython Ordered that the Churchwardens doe take the Opinions of Mr. Sergt Lewis, Mr. Sergt Pemberton and Mr. Sergt Pollixfen and according to theire advice to proceed upon a Tryall. The result of the trial is not recorded. The concluding entry on the case is on 10th November, 1688, when the Churchwardens are requested to pay Mr. Rampayne Attorney, the Bill of due to him on account of a suite 117 for Brainford Bridge. Fifty years later (8th January, 1739) resolutions were passed sanctioning payment of £43 8s. 4d. assessed upon the "Joint Parishes" for the repair of Brentford and Chertsey Bridges; and in 1742 (10th February), £86 16s. 8d. was paid for Brentford Bridge under a precept from the High Constable. That the trial resulted adversely to the Vestry may thus be safely assumed. The statement of case submitted to counsel in 1687 is not preserved; but it will be remembered that the Act of 1531 already quoted, empowered the High Constable of the Hundred to charge the cost of the repairing the bridges upon the several parishes within the limits of his jurisdiction. Towards the end of the seventeenth century the obligations upon the inhabitants, cottagers and others to engage themselves upon the roads for six appointed days in each year were superseded, the work being thenceforwards executed under contract. On the 6th December, 1699, the Churchwardens were ordered to agree with any person within the parish for the repair of the highways for seven years at the cheapest possible rate. So far as price was concerned—no specification of the work to be done is preserved— they succeeded; the contract sum as reported at the next meeting was ninety-four pounds for seven years. 23 Dec., 1706. Ordered that Henry Goslyn repair and amend the Highways of this parish for seaven years and a Quarter, to commence from Christmas next at the rate of £118 p. ann. to be paide at two half yearly payments, vizt at Midsomer and Christmas, and that Articles be drawne according to the former agreement with the same clauses and provisoes that are incerted in the said agreement betweene this Vestry and Mr. Wright decd. Tuesday, 26 Oct., 1708. Ordered that it be referred to the Churchwardens to view the pavemts belonging to this parish and make a report to this Yestry what condicion they are in. Thursday, 11 th November, 1708. Ordered that the Churohwardens enter into Articles with Geo. Norris, paviour, for repairing the pavemts belonging to this parish at the rate of Twenty Pounds per Ann. with usual Coventsts for Seaven years to commence from Midsomer last. With an annual outlay of about £138, it will not be 118 expected that the whole of the streets, measuring probably some eighteen. or twenty miles, were maintained in a constant state of perfection. Even the main streets were at times scarcely passable. In describing the formation of Parliament Street across the site of the "Privy Garden" and the "Bowling Green," Walford says: "Previously the only access from Charing Cross to Westminster was by King Street, a narrow way, muddy and ill-paved, which ran from the corner of Downing Street to the Abbey. So bad was King Street, as a thoroughfare, that we are told that when the King (Geo. I.) went to open Parliament in the winter, in the early part of the eighteenth century, it was often found necessary to throw down a supply of fagots in the ruts in order to allow the royal coach to pass along." On the constitution of Turnpike Trusts the Vestry availed themselves of the facilities thereby afforded and contracted with the Trustees with respect to certain of the main roads:— 25 June, 1741. Ordered that the present Surveyors of the Highways Do Contract and agree with the Trustees appointed to put in execution the Acts of Parliaments for repairing the roads within the Parishes of Kensington, Chelsea, Fulham, &c., in the County of Midd" To keep such part of the highways within this parish as was formally contracted for, in a good and sufficient repair for the present year for the sum or consideration of Fifty pounds. Two years later a similar agreement for seven years was entered into at £30 per annum. In 1743 some of the streets were paved under the immediate direction of the Vestry—probably by pauper labour. October 14, 1743. Ordered that Fourteen ton of Ragg stones (they being offered very cheap) be purchased. Any notice of the proceedings of the Vestry in reference to the highways of the parish would be incomplete without an allusion to "the New Bridge at Westminster." So ample is the information upon this subject, which was watched with great public interest at the time, that a chapter might 119 be occupied in the narration of the changes wrought upon the face of Westminster in carrying out the scheme. Even were space to permit, the province of the historian might be usurped in such a survey. Two short transcripts only have been made from the minutes, the one as sounding the death knell of the Woolstaple, the other as throwing light on the value of land in Westminster a hundred and fifty years ago :— April 10, 1739. Ordd That it be left to the Church Wardens for the time being to treat and agree with the Commissioners of the intended new Bridge at Westmr for the conveying to them such Ground and Houses belonging to the parish in the Woolstaple (now in the possion of Mr. Charles Carpenter) and also two annuities, one of Forty shillings and the other Twenty shillings a year issuing out of three tenements in King Street so as they cause the present ground rent of such Houses in the Woolstaple and such said annuitys to be reserved and made payable to the parish that the intent of the respective Donors' Wills may not be defeated. Apl. 21, 1739. Mr. Churchwarden Haselar Reported that he with his partner John Lawton, Esq in pursuance of an Order made last Vestry * * had met Thomas Lediard Esq, Agent for the said Com" and were acquainted by him that the Commissioners were willing to give twenty-six years purchase for the said ground rents in the Woolstaple and would reserve to the parish the said two annuities the better to answer the intention of the respective donors. And this Vestry having considered of the said report Do unanimously agree to accept Twenty-seven (sic) years purchase for the said ground rents in the Woolstaple, and the said Thomas Lediard Esq attending was acquainted therewith * * * The action of the Vestry in paving the footways in specific places, as distinct from the general repairs of the highways, is constantly chronicled in the minutes. A very few specimens are, however, reproduced :— The Eleventh Day of November 1610. At a Vestrye holden the saide xjth daie of November 1G10 It is ordered and agreed by the psons whose names hereunder are subscribed that the churchwardens shalbe allowed upon theire accompte for the paving of the way in the Sanctuary all along before the wall of the churchyarde on the North side And also for the paving of the ground on the South side of the sayd churchyarde betwene the sayd churchyarde and certeyne houses 120 adioyninge to the Collegiate Church of St. Peter in Westm and for the removinge Liestall and newe makinge of the same. Att a vestrie holden the Ninth day of September 1642. It is ordered that Leonard Braford and William Mason the psent Churchwardens of the parish of St. Margarett in Westminster shall forthwith provide soe many chaines and posts and other things necessary thereunto as shalbe thought fitt for the safety of this Town And the said Churchwardens are to disburse the money for the same untill the same may be Collected of the Inhabitants by order of Parliament or otherwise. Ordered at a Vestry held on 19th December, 1644, "that the Churchwardens shall paie for the paving of the Kaynell at the new Chappell in Tuttlefields about 80 yards in length and a yard in breadth. A certificate under the hands of three Justices filed in the Public Record Office is interesting as showing that neglect to comply with the law in respect of paving, &c., was not confined to those whose means might have been urged as an excuse :— Certificate concerning Paving in Westminster. Jany. 26. 1639-1640. To the Right Honorble the Lords & Others of his Maties most Honble Privie Councell, May it please yor Lopps According to an Order of the 4th of December last wee forthwth gave direcons to the High Constable, Scavengers & Rakers to see the Matters therein contained to be duly executed by ffriday the 20th of the said Decr or in default thereof the Monday following to retorne us the names of all such as refused or neglected to pforme what yor Lopps required by the said order and by the said retornes wee finde that the Right Honorble the Lords or their Stewards and other the great prsons hereunder menconed have had sufficient warning to amend their Pavements and to cause the Streets (as much as to them apperteyne) to be cleared and freed from all dirt and foulnes whatsoever although the annoyances are not as yet fully removed. In the pish of St Margrett's the pavement in St Margarett's lane before the ffish pond wch ought to bee amended att his Maties chardge (as we are informed). The Rt Hon. ye Countess of Essex—For not paving. Sir Thomas Porter Knt—For the like. Sir Edward Bishopp Knt. The Conduit against Mr Brigham's house wch is to bee amended at his Maties chardge (as we are informed). The Pavement before the Lords Ambassadors house in Tuttle Street. 121 Wee further Certifie that it appears by the said retorne of the Constable that of late since yor Lopps order the pavements have been in most places well repaired and that wee have directed Warrants to the sev11 Constables to apprehend such as have not conformed themselves to yor Lopps comands and intend to proceed against them for their contempts therein. All wch we humbley leave to yor Lopps further consideracon. The Pavement from King Street to Charing Crosse is very ruinous but wee know not who should see it amended. (Signed) M. ASHTON, JOHN HOOKER, PETER HEYWOOD. A representation was made to the Vestry on Sunday, 1st February, 174-6, "that the highway leading from the Horseferry to the hither end of James Street is so bad and out of repair that several parts are quite impassible." The Commissioners of Turnpikes were requested to undertake the necessary work for £50, but the proposal being declined, the Vestry resolved to expend that sum on repairing the road " from Market Street to Mr. Hutchins' Farm House." Although the authorities—High Constable, Commissioners, Scavengers, Surveyors of Highways, Vestry, Trustees, and others—having jurisdiction over the streets had increased in number at this time, the goal of perfection was yet far from being reached. An Act of Parliament "for the better relief and employment of the poor in the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, in the City of Westminster, and for cleansing the streets and repairing the highways within the said parishes" was passed in 1752, 25 Geo. II., Cap. 23. The original intention of the Vestry, when they appointed a Committee to draw up a Petition to Parliament for the introduction of the Bill, was to annex the Highways and Scavengers' Rate to the Poor Rate. The project was successful, the Bill being taken charge of by Sir R. Lloyd. The scheme was before the Vestry on 5th December, 1751, 22nd January, 1752, and 28th February, 1752, when a resolution was passed requesting the Churchwardens to pay the fees of the House and all other expenses incidental to the 122 progress of the Bill. In due course the Bill was passed, and for many years an amalgamated rate for all purposes was levied in conformity with it; but the passing of the Highways Act of 1835 and subsequently of the Metropolis Management Acts, rendered a return to the former practice of making separate rates necessary. The Act is, nevertheless, still in force in respect of the poor rate, the appointment of Collectors and matters connected therewith. The design of the Act, as indicated by its title just quoted, was not realised, unless the punishment of the poor who refused to work "by moderate correction and by distinguishing them in dress" secured the better employment of the poor, and unless the abolition of the offices of "scavenger" and surveyor of highways within the parishes resulted in an improved condition of the streets. The chief benefits conferred by the Act were in relation to the rating of the inhabitants, and the more equitable assessment of property. The preamble recites "that the rate for repairing the highways in the said parishes is so small that divers persons refuse the payment thereof." No instance of subsequent refusal for this reason appears on record, from which it is to be inferred that the grounds of objection was effectually if not satisfactorily removed. Except providing for the prosecution of contractors for neglect to properly cleanse the streets, the Act gave the Vestry no new powers. It is not surprising therefore to find that amendments were soon found necessary, Within ten years another Act was passed, 2 George III. cap. 21, for paving, cleansing, and lighting the squares, streets and lanes within the City and Liberty of Westminster * * * and for preventing annoyances therein. In the next following Session, and again in the 4th and 5th Sessions of Geo. Ill, further Statutes were passed "to explain, amend, and render more effectual" the Act of 1702. Another Bill, introduced at the instance of the parish authorities of St. James, was discussed by the Vestry in 123 1770. The main object of the measure was the constitution of a general Commission to regulate the paving, lighting, and cleansing of the streets, with certain specified exceptions, in parts of the City and Liberties of Westminster, the choice of the Commissioners, who were to be possessed of real estate to the value of £100 a year, or personal estate of not less than £5,000, being entrusted to the Vestries of the several parishes. The Bill sought to empower the Commissioners to levy a rate for their purposes, not exceeding eighteen pence in the pound. Parliament passed the measure early in 1771, and the Vestry forthwith and subsequently appointed three Commissioners to carry its provisions into effect. Then came a debate in the Vestry upon yet another Bill introduced, "for obtaining amendments and alterations, or further and more extensive powers, to the paving, lighting, and cleansing, not only the streets within the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, already included within the present Acts of Parliament, but also to all those which are not comprised therein." A Committee was deputed to confer with the Commissioners with a view to opposing certain clauses which were deemed objectionable, and on 27th February, 1782, a Resolution was passed instructing the Solicitor to oppose the Bill, so far as it affected St. Margaret's parish. Opposition was, however, unavailing, and the Bill, consisting of fifty-seven sections, passed into law in a much more comprehensive form than either of its predecessors. From the preamble a glimpse at the condition of the parish may be obtained:— "And whereas the pavement in such streets, lanes, ways, and other places, is in general in so ruinous a state as to be extremely dangerous for the passage of carriages and foot passengers; and for want of proper levels and drains some of them cannot be effectually cleansed: And whereas the said streets, lanes, ways, and other places, are very insufficiently lighted in general, and in many parts not at all, and are excessively annoyed by night soil, and other offensive things being laid or cast therein, or in the neighbourhood thereof, and by several other nuisances 124 and obstructions: And whereas the pavement of several of such streets, lanes, ways, and places is rendered more ruinous than it would otherwise be by the great number of heavy carriages passing through the same during the sitting of Parliament, which at that time are not permitted to go the direct and usual way to the wharfs and manufactories situate beyond Old Palace Yard:" The Act sought to remedy these things through the agency of commissioners, who were thereby constituted with power to appoint inspectors and other officers for carrying the act into execution. After a brief operation extending over eight years, Parliament was again asked to "alter, explain, amend and render more effectual" the existing Acts relating to the paving, lighting and cleansing of the streets in Westminster. One more Act (30 Geo. III., cap. 53) was thereupon passed for the objects named, and for "putting certain streets therein mentioned, commonly called Optional Streets, under the management of Parochial Committees subject to the control of the Commissioners appointed by or in pursuance of the said several Acts." Twenty-nine years elapsed before the Legislature was again appealed to; but the Act then passed (59 Geo. III., cap. 23) had for its principal object the removal of the exemption from poor rates enjoyed by the occupiers of houses in certain of the "optional streets," and only slightly affected the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John. All these and other local acts not calling for special mention were repealed wholly or in part in 1835 by Act of 5 Will. IV., cap. 18, which created new bodies of Commissioners for each of the parishes therein named. The Vestries of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist were severally to meet on the second Thursday in February each year for the election of householders as Commissioners, twelve by the Vestry of St. Margaret and eight by the Vestry of St. John the Evangelist. The qualification was the occupation of a residence in the parish rated at forty pounds per annum, or the possession of real or personal estate to the value of a thousand pounds at least. Besides 125 incorporating all the more valuable provisions of the repealed Acts, this new measure regulated the laying of gas and water pipes, the levels of streets, urinals, sewers, nuisances, and a variety of other matters not hitherto embraced in the local acts. Its application was extended over nearly the whole of the parishes, whereas the preceding Acts had their operation limited to areas, or to streets and places specially named. This enactment also declared in more express terms than had previously been done, that "the parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, Westminster, shall in all respects be considered as one parish only." Under this Act, and the General Paving (Metropolis) Act which it incorporated, very many of the powers necessarily assumed by the Vestry in former years were withdrawn, and marked strides towards a more efficient administration were made, albeit the existence of several trusts and commissions, created from time to time for certain specified areas, retarded the approach to uniformity and solidarity. Street Lighting. With the exception of the ineffective "ordinances" of the Burgesses adopted in 1585 (see p. 22 ante), the little that was done in the direction of lighting the public streets dated from 1674 (14 Chas II.), when Parliament ordained by Statute (cap 2) that each householder should every night between Michaelmas and Ladyday set or hang out candles until nine o'clock, under a penalty of one shilling for every default, the person discovering the omission to be entitled to half the penalty. The properties over which the Vestry had control duly furnished their lights:— Thursday, 7th October, 1686.—Ordered that the Churchwardens doe cause a Lamp to be provided to be affixed on the farther corner of the Engine house for the Convenience of Light for the Inhabitants in Nights. Tuesday, 14 Dec., 1686. Ordered that the Churchwardens doe provide another Light to be sett in the corner of the Church Yarde next the Old Pallace Yard. 126 The Vestry entrusted the beadles with the duty of reporting cases of non-compliance with the law, with the result that very little was done. By Statute of 2 William and Mary, cap. 8 (1690) the former obligations were re-enacted, with an extension of of the hours until twelve o'clock midnight and an increase of the penalty; but with an exception which render the law capable of easy evasion:— And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid That every householder within any of the parishes places or precincts in the counties of Middlesex and Surrey, and city and liberty of Westminster, comprised within the weekly bills of mortality, whose house adjoins unto or is near the street, from Michaelmas unto our Lady-day yearly, shall every night set or hang out candles or lights in lanthorns on the outside of the house next the street, to enlighten the same for the conveniency of passengers, from time to time, as it shall grow dark, until twelve of the clock in the night, upon pain to forfeit the sum of two shillings for every default; excepting such person or persons as shall agree to make use of lamps of any sort, to be placed at such distances in the street, as shall be approved of by two or more Justices of the Peace. Private enterprise then stepped in, aided by the "common informer," with one eye directed to the moiety of the penalties and the other to the profit to be derived by the use of a particular description of lamp. The subjoined is borrowed from the Minute Book of the Justices:— 15th June, 1711. Several Informacons offered against psons who have not Lighted their houses according to the Statute. "Mr. Hart ye Undertaker of Conick Lamps declare that he will not expect any thing of People who by reason of Poverty are excused from paying to the Church and poor. "Time to be given to the Inhabitants to acquit themselves of their Informacons by paying to the Public Lamps. "Agreed that Informacons will be reced and psons summoned only concerning houses that stand in the same street at one time to avoid crowd and confusion and soe on till the whole of the defaulters be gone thro." The Justices called the constables to their assistance in detecting infringements of the law :— 21 Oct., 1714. Ordered that the sev11 Constables of and belonging to this parish do go abt their Respective Wards and give notice to all and every the Inhabitants to hang out lights as the Law 127 requires (provided they do not pay or contribute towards keeping lamps permited by law) and that they make their Returns and bring in the same this Day 7 night Tenn in the Morning. 7 Nov., 1714. The Patentees of the Convex Lights having sumoned sev11 Inhabitants to hang out Lights as the Law requires under pain of being convicted and forfeiting two shillings a night for each neglect and sev11 of the said Inhabitants appeing and agreeing to contribute towards lamps with their neighbours they were discharged and those Inhabitants that did not appear are to be sumoned a new to appear here this day 7 night 10 Morning till wch Adjd. [These are followed by numerous records of orders made either for payment, for hanging out, or for excusal.] As lately as 1761 Whitehall was only lighted during the winter, the service being performed by the Government:— Vestry Minutes, 8th May, 1761. Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired in the name of this Vestry to apply to the Board of Works by Memorial to cause Whitehall from the Banquetting House to the footway on the East side of Parliament House and also the East side of St. Margaret's Street before the Fence and Exchequer Bill Office and other Places formerly lighted by that Board to be lighted as well during the Summer as the Winter Quarters for the greater safety of the Publick It is worthy of note that although the gas works in Horseferry Road and Peter Street were opened about the year 1807, the streets of Westminster were not illuminated by gas until 1829. watching The Vestry and the Court of Burgesses appear to have exercised concurrent jurisdiction at times with respect to the nightly watch. Among the earliest entries on this subject which meet the eye is one relating to the erection of a watch-house (presumably on the Churchyard) in which the Vestry give consent subject to the expense being defrayed by the Burgesses or the Justices:— 7th May, 1663.—Ordered upon the mocon and desire of divers of ye Conables of this Parish that ye Vestry doe hereby declare their leave and consent as much as in them it lies for the erecting of a Watch house on ye place now designed for that purpose, 128 but think not fitt to advance any money towards ye building thereof but advise ye said Conables to make their addresses or applicacon to the Lord High Steward and the Justices of ye Sessions as most properly belonging to them. The two corporations were, nevertheless, unable to keep ' the watch ' in order:— 25 Feby., 1G90.—Att the request of this Vestry complaining to Richard Newman and Nehemiah Arnold Esqr two of their Maties Justices of the Peace of the great negligence of the Watches and particularly of the abuses of the beadles the said Justices doe order that the Justices of this parish have notice to meet on the first Thursday in every month to regulate abuses of officers and other things relating to the well Government of the parish. June 19, 1745.—The several Watchmen attended this Vestry and received direction not to go off from watch until after the hour of four & until they had proclaimed that hour throughout their several walks on pain of being removed. During the year ended at Michaelmas, 1725, the receipts from the Watch Rate in St. Margaret's parish were £544 16s. 0d, and the expenditure, £556 12s. Od. There were at this time six beadles and 32 watchmen engaged in the parish. The Beadles received £25 per annum each, with two guineas for collecting the Watch Rate; the Watchmen were paid £12 per annum each, and the Clerk was awarded £10 for keeping the books. On the 14th February, 1735, owing to difficulties on which the minutes are silent, the Vestry appointed a Committee to petition Parliament "for an Act to Regulate the nightly watch and beadles in this parish." A special Act was passed in the following year (9 Geo. II. cap 17), from the preamble of which it may be inferred that the benefits of 'the watch' had been withdrawn from the area of the parish of St. John the Evangelist on its constitution as a separate parish. This Act declared that "the well regulating the nightly watch and bedels is of great importance for the preservation of the persons and property of the parish and very necessary to prevent as well the mischiefs which may happen from fires, as murders, burglaries, robberies and other outrages and disorders." 129 Vestry Minutes, Monday, 19th March, 1770. Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to consider of and Report concerning the expediency of removing the Watch Box from the Plasterer's Arms in St. Margaret's Street to the opposite side of the way by the Record Office. The Minutes of the same day enable the public opinion on 'the watch' to be gleaned:— Mr. Sayer having acquainted the Vestry that in a Committee of the Honourable House of Commons for taking into consideration the cause of the great increase of Burglaries Sir John Fielding had informed the Committee that the Pay of the Watchmen of this Parish was only 8½d per night and that they were paid Quarterly. Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to attend the said Committee at their Sitting to Morrow, and inform the said Committee that the Watchmen have an additional Gratuity of Two Guineas a Year, and that they are paid monthly. Thursday, 12th July, 1770. Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to provide three new Watch Boxes. Friday, 8th Oct., 1773. Resolved that the Inspectors of the Nightly Watch have foul Weather Coats provided for them. As instances of the vagaries of the watch, and, it may also be said, of the troubles of the Vestry, the two following entries have been copied:— Thursday, 16th July, 1778. Mr. Alexander of Dartmouth Street Apothecary attended this Vestry and complained that Mr. Lane one of the Bedels of this Parish had greatly abused him on the 8th Instant upon his Application at the Watch-house to Enquire why the Watchman at the top of Queen Street was not on duty. Mr. Churchwarden Girdler signifies to the Vestry that on hearing of the said Complaint he had advised Mr. Lane to ask Mr. Alexander Pardon for the said Offence, but that Mr. Lane had absolutely refused so to do. The Vestry took the said Complaint into Consideration, and having heard Witnesses and Evidence on both sides A Motion was made and Seconded and the question put That Mr. Lane for his said offence be Suspended from his said office. It passed in the Affirmative. Resolved that Mr. Lane be suspended from his said office accordingly. A motion was made and Seconded and the question put That Mr. Lane's Suspension be continued for Two months. It passed in the Affirmative. Resolved that the suspension of Mr. Lane from his said office be for Two Months. K 130 A Motion was made and Seconded and the question put That Mr. Lane be not Restored to his office when the Two Months Suspension is ended unless he do make proper Submission to this Vestry and also to Mr. Church Warden Girdler and Mr. Alexander for his said Misbehaviour. It passed in the Affirmative. Resolved that Mr. Lane be not Restored to his office when the Two Months Suspension is ended unless he do make proper Submission to this Vestry, and also to Mr. Church Warden Girdler and Mr. Alexander for his said Misbehaviour. Resolved and Ordered That Mr. Lane do immediately deliver to Mr. Church Warden Girdler his Coat Hat and Staff of Office. Monday, 5th January, 1789. Resolved that a joint Vestry be called to take into Consideration the matter concerning a Man found dead on Saturday Morning in one of the Holes of the Watch House. Wednesday, 21st January, 1789. The Church Wardens reported the cause of suspending Mr. Ashdon from the office of Beadle of Saint Margaret Westminster which was in consequence of Depositions before the Coroners Inquest respecting the Death of Thomas Perkins who was refused Admittance into the Watch House on the third of the Month being a very inclement Night and the said Thomas Perkins being in a very poor and deplorable State. The Depositions before the Coroner were read. Mr. Ashdon was called in, but not being able to justify the Charge against him A Motion was made, seconded, and the Question put That Mr. Ashdon be immediately dismissed from his Office. It passed in the Affirmative. Resolved therefore that Mr. Ashdon be immediately dismissed from the Office of one of the Beadles of this Parish. It appearing to the Vestry on reading the Depositions before the Coroner, that Mr. Skirving, the Watch-house Keeper had acted very improperly in the matter respecting the said Thomas Perkins. A Motion was made seconded and the Question put that Mr. Skerving the Nightly Beadle, be suspended from the said Office until Friday in Easter Week next ensuing being the usual time for Annual Election of Beadles and Watchmen. It was passed in the Affirmative. Resolved therefore that the said Mr. Skerving be suspended from his said Office until Friday in Easter Week next ensuing. The Churchwardens desired to appoint a Person to act in the place of Mr. Skerving during his Suspension. A Vestry to be summoned next Wednesday at 12 o'clock to choose a Beadle in the room of Mr. Ashdon. 131 The parochial 'force" was 80 strong in 1819. This included Go watchmen, of whom 43 were attached to St. Margaret's parish, with Knightshridge, and 23 to St. John's, 10 patroles, 4 beadles and a "Regulator." The wages of the watchmen was 14s. per week in the winter, 12s. in the summer; the regulator received 18s. and 17s. 6d. for the respective seasons. The beadles in the home wards were allowed £31 10s. 0d. per aun., at Knightshridge, £23 2s. 0d. per annum. In 1824 the numerical strength of "the force" had increased to 92 besides a 'wardour.' An order passed by the Vestry at this time suggests that 'the watch ' had its weakness:— Ordered that a Circular Notice be printed and distributed to the several Victuallers within the Parishes warning them against harbouring Patroles and Watchmen during the hours of Watching and expressing the determinations of these Vestries to enforce the Penalties which they are liable [to] in consequence thereof. The proceedings of the Vestry on one of the annual 'watch days' is here presented:— Easter Tuesday, April the 26th, 1791.—This day being appointed for a Yearly Meeting of the Vestries of the Parishes of St Margaret and St John the Evangelist, Westminster, for putting into Execution an Act of Parliament made in the Ninth Year of His late Majesty Intituled an Act for the better regulating the Nightly Watch and Bedels within the Parishes of St Margaret and St John the Evangelist in the City of Westminster, Also an Act of Parliament made in the Fourteenth Year of His present Majesty Intituled an Act for the better Regulation of the Nightly Watch and Bedels within the City and Liberty of Westminster and parts adjacent and for other purposes therein mentioned, and also of an Act of Parliament passed in the Twenty sixth Year of His present Majesty's Reign Intituled an Act for raising a competent Sum of Money to defray the Expence of a proper Number of Watchmen Patrols and Bedels within the said Parishes of St Margaret and St John the Evangelist in the City of Westminster, The Gentlemen now Present Unanimously Agreed and Ordered That 52 Watchmen be appointed for the Parishes of St Margaret K 2 132 and St John the Evangelist, Westminster from this Tuesday in Easter Week 1791 to Tuesday in Easter Week 1792. 35 for St. Margaret. 17 „ St. John. 13 Patroles 9 for St. Margaret (one for Knights Bridge). 4 „ St. John. 4 Bedels 3 for St. Margaret (one for Knights Bridge). 1 „ St. John. That 1 Nightly Bedel be appointed for both Parishes to attend the Constable of the Night at St. Margarets Watch House. That a proper Person be appointed to Controul and Superintend the Bedel Patrole and Watchmen of Knightsbridge. That each of the said Watchmen be Allowed Eighteen Pence p Night for their Attendance from Michaelmas to Lady day and from Lady day to Michaelmas one shilling per Night they finding thereout their own Candles, and that their said Wages be Paid to them Weekly. The Watchmen Presented a Petition to these Vestries praying an Augmentation of their Wages in the Summer Half Year which Petition was rejected for the Present. That 14s. P Week be allowed to the Regulator of Patroles and 12 s. P Week to his Assistant and that each of the other Eleven Patroles be allowed 10s. 6d. per Week for their Attendance and that their said wages be Paid to them weekly. That the 3 Bedels to be appointed for the Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist have an allowance of .£24 a year each, and that they do attend at the Watch House in Rotation every night. That an Allowance of £20 a year be made to the Nightly Bedel of Both Parishes. That an Allowance of £18 a year be made to the Bedel of the Hamlet at Knightsbridge. That 2 of the Watchmen of St. Margaret's be appointed for the Hamlet of Knightsbridge. That a Sum not exceeding £6 be allowed to the Bedels for Coals and Candles for the year ensuing. That the Watch Boxes in the said Parishes do remain where they are now fixed. That the Principal Patrole be paid £2 2s. 0d. and each other Patrole £1 11s. 6d. as Gratuities for Early Duty in the Winter Evenings. That each of the Watchmen be paid 7s. 6d. as Gratuities for Early Duty in the Winter Evenings. That the Pound Rate to be made for defraying the Charges and Expenses of the Nightly Watch and Bedels be after the Rate of Sevenpence in the Pound by the year at a Rack Rent. 133 Resolved and Ordered That in future no New Watch Boxes be made, or old ones repaired, without an order signed by the Church Wardens, and that the Church Wardens be acquainted herewith, as also the Persons who do the Work, and that such Orders be produced when the Bills are audited. The watchhouse erected in 1663 had become so dilapidated in 1791 as to occasion anxiety to the Watch Committee and the Vestry:— Tuesday the 21st day of June, 1791.—The Committee upon viewing the present Building do find it not only very much out of Repair, but also so very inconvenient and dangerous to the lives of the Persons who may be confined there, and considering the Expence that would attend the Alterations necessary to make it answer the Purpose, are of opinion that the present Building should be taken down and the Materials used in Erecting a Substantial and convenient Building near the spot, and centrical with the Market, and that the difference of the expence when compared with the Utility, Necessity and Safety of the Parish, appear to Your Committee a trifling consideration. Admittedly dangerous, the place was allowed to stand fifteen months longer, when a remonstrance was addressed to the Vestry by the Magistrates at the Police Office at Queen Square, alleging that the persons confined in "the cage" were in imminent danger of being suffocated. In October, 1792, orders were given for the detention of disorderly persons in the Tothill Fields Bridewell during the contemplated enlargement and improvement of the Watchhouse and Cage. The work was expeditiously carried out, for within a few weeks the Dean and Chapter complained that the enlargement had been made without their previous consent. The contention which is duly entered at its various stages, may be passed over. Here is the conclusion:— Tues: 22 Jan. 1793.—Letter read from Chapter Clerk notifying leave for inspection of Chapter Book for the years 1701 and 1709 relating to the Watch-house, stating "that unless the Vestry apply to the Dean and Chapter as formerly for permission on account of the enlargement they have lately made of that building, the Chapter will think it necessary to put the business into the hands of their Proctor as well as that other of the Porch they have lately built to the Church without any leave." 134 Resolved—That the Dean and Chapter of Westminster be thanked for their very handsome offer to the Vestry, and that the Vestry decline troubling them, being already in possession of all that the Vestries of this parish did in the years 1701 and 1709. And as to the Church Torch the Vestry conceive the Dean and Chapter as a very respectable Body will never feel inclined to make an objection (if in their power to do it) to an Act the Parish at large much approve. The subjoined resolutions are introduced as evincive of the scrupulous care with which even trivial details were guarded:— 18th August, 1793.—Resolved That Two Candles be placed in the Watch House instead of one, in future. Resolved That the Churchwardens be desired to examine the Grate in the Watch House and to endeavor to have the same Contracted with Brick or otherwise in order to lessen the Consumption of Coals. During the disorderly times of 1795-6, the watchmen were provided with pistols and cutlasses on the order of the V estry. An impending strike of "the watch," in 1801, brought prompt offers of help from the local volunteers :— Easter Tuesday, 7th April, 1801.—The Vestries taking into consideration the late alarming intention of the Watchmen of these Parishes to with-draw themselves from their duty on the 29th of March last by which the Inhabitants and their property would have been left unprotected But for the timely and spirited interference of the Church Wardens in preventing the same Resolved That the thanks of this Meeting be given to the Church Wardens of the United Parishes for their exemplary conduct on that occasion. Resolved That the thanks of these Vestries be given to Capt" Cosser of the Westminster Volunteer Cavalry for the offer of his Services if necessary. Resolved That the thanks of these Vestries be given to Capt" Jones of the Saint Margaret and Saint John's Association for the like Offer of his Services. In 1804 another strike was averted:— Thursday, 10th May, 1804. This Meeting was Convened in order to determine upon the Application of the Watchmen for an increase of their pay. 135 It was Resolved, as it does not appear there is any reasonable ground for such Application that the same be refused. Resolved also that in consideration of nearly all the Watchmen having cheerfully returned to their Duty at the present pay that they be allowed 2s. 6d. each for their loss of time upon the present Occasion. All the vigilance of the Vestry in the control of the watch failed to procure public safety and order:— Wed., 15th June, 1825. A representation having been made to the Vestries that frequent Robberies have been committed in the road leading from Milbank Row to Vauxhall Bridge where no Watchman is stationed Ordered that the Vestry Clerk do write to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests in whose district the same is requesting that they will take the necessary measure for the security of the public in that part. Street Cleansing. Incidental reference to street cleansing has already been made under the head of ways," and in the "Ordinances" of the Burgesses of 1585. It is, therefore, only necessary here to recollect that the scavengers were originally unpaid officers appointed by the Justices, and subsequently by the Commissioners, constituted in 1674-5 by the Act of 14 Charles II., cap. 2:— And that within the City of Westmr the said Officers shall be chosen and the rates made and paid accordingly. And in all other the Parishes and places aforesaid upon every Tuesday or Wednesday in Easter Week, the Constable Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor and Surveyors of the Highways &c. or the greater number of them giving notice unto or calling together such oilier inhabitants of their respective parishes as have formerly borne the like Offices therein they or the greater number of them shall make choice of and shall nominate and appoint two or more -able persons who are tradesmen of their parish to be Scavengers for the year ensuing. The appointment was to be made subject to the approval and confirmation of the Justices, and was to be accepted under a penalty of £20 for refusal, recoverable by distress, or in default the person refusing was to be imprisoned. The scavengers were responsible for the cleansing of the streets by the paid "raker." According to Maitland there were 16 scavengers iu the parish in 1770, while the payments to the raker amounted to £451. The removal of 136 ashes and other refuse was contracted for by the Commissioners, who were empowered by Statute of 2 Wm. and Mary, 1691, cap. 8, to require the inhabitants to sweep the streets before their respective houses on every Wednesday and Saturday, and to have the refuse ready for removal by the raker, on penalty of 3s. 4d. for each neglect. The scavengers were to cause carts to be brought into all the streets every day by bell, horn, clapper, or other distinct and loud noise. Comparatively little can be gathered from the minute books of the Vestry in relation to this service, owing to the superintendence having been vested in an independent Commission. Occasional examples were, however, made even prior to the power being' vested in the above Commissioners, of which an instance has been supplied from the Public Record Office by Mr. T. C. Noble:— The Petition of Joseph Rea, Deputy Bailiff of Westminster, 1633. To the Rt Honble the Lords and others of His Maties most Honoble Privy Councell. The humble Peticon of Joseph Rea deputy Bayliffe of the Libty of Westmr Psonr in ye ffleete. Humbly Sheweth That he is comitted by yor honors for his deficiency in his office in not p'forming his maties Writts and yor Lopps order for Clensing the Streets. Hee humbly acknowledgeth and sorry for his remisnes therein yet hee hath made publicque and daylie proclamacon throughout the whole liberty and often caused the same to be made cleane since the receipt of his Maties Writt and of yor honord Order and two Men thereto appointed bringing in the names of offenders above Sixty have beene since att the towne Courtt for the Citty of Westmr Punisht by fine to the Poore and Informer. Most humbly beseecheth yor honors to vouchsafe him libty and he shall dutifully execute his Ma1'" Writts and yor honors Orders as he hopeth his diligence therein will be immediately and continually manifested to yor honors And yor Petr as in duty bound humbly Pray for yor honors JOSEPH REA. Neither the local justices nor the Vestry were satisfied with the state of affairs under the Commissioners, for the 137 two bodies combined to assist in the introduction of a remedial Bill:— Wednesday, 4th February, 1690. Ordered that the Churchwardens pay to Mr. Reynolds for presenting a Bill for cleaning the street, &c., towards the charge and pains by order of the Sessions of the County of Middx the sum of Eight pounds. Again and again during the next fifty years complaints are recorded, and orders passed similar to the following:— June 19, 1745. Ordd That Mr. Churchill the Sexton do (in case the scavengers of the Sanctuary and Deanery Wards neglect to clear the filth and soil from about the stocks and bone-house in the churchyard at least once a month) cause such filth and soil to be taken away and deduct so much as he shall pay for the same out of the Scavengers' Rate. From the fact that in the rating Bill introduced into Parliament in 1751-2 a clause was inserted abolishing the office of Scavenger it may be concluded that the Vestry attributed the unsatisfactory condition of the parish to those officers without, however, providing for the appointment of others to perform the duties. Sewers As early as 1532-3 Commissioners of Sewers were appointed by Statute of 32 Henry VIII., cap. 5. Tne reasons for, and the method of tne appointment, with the duties assigned to the Commissioners will be seen from the extract from the Act given below:— Anno vicesimo tertio Henrici VIII., cap. 5. Our soverign lord the King, like a virtuous and most gracious prince, nothing earthly so highly weighing, as the advancing of the common profit, wealth and commodity of this his realm, concerning the daily great damages and losses which have happened in many and divers parts of this his said realm . by occasion of land-waters and other outrageous springs, in and upon meadows, pastures and other low grounds adjoining to rivers, floods and other water-courses. Wherein albeit that divers and many provisions have been before this time made and ordained, yet none of them are of sufficient remedy for the reformation of the premisses, hath therefore by deliberate advice and assent of his lords spiritual and temporal, and also his loving commons, in this present parliament assembled, ordained, established and enacted, That commissions of sewers, and other the premisses, shall be directed in all parts within this realm from time to time, where and when need shall require to such substantial and indifferent persons 138 as shall be named by the lord chancellor and lord treasurer of England, and the two chief justices for the time being, or by three of them whereof the lord chancellor to be one. Then follows the form of the "Letters Patent," appointing the Commissioners:— "A B & C to be our Justices to survey the said walls, ditches, gutters, sewers, gates, bridges, calvies, trenches, milldams, flood-gates, ponds & other impediments lets & annoyances aforesaid and the same cause to be made, corrected, repaired as case shall require; to enquire by the oaths of honest and lawful men, place or places where such annoyances be, through whose default the said hurts and damages have happened, & who holdeth any tenements &c. or hath or may have any hurt loss or disadvantage by any manner of means by the said impediments & annoyances; and to tax, assess, distrain & punish after the quantity of their lands & rents by the number of acres & perches or in such manner and form most convenient. To appoint bailiff, collectors, surveyors. The Commissioners, who were not allowed to act until sworn, were paid four shillings per day, and their Clerk two shillings a day. A limit of three years was placed ou the continuance of the Act; but by 25 Hen. VIII., cap. 10, 3 and 4 Ed. VI., cap. 8, and other Acts, it was renewed from time to time, and was continued for twenty years by 13 Eliz., cap. 9, sec. 1 (1571-2). A revival of the enactment was made in 1672-3 (12 Charles II., cap. 6), the powers of the Commissioners being extended by another Act two years later. Among the earliest references to repairs of sewers may be classed the account given hereunder, copied from the Lansdowne MS.:— "Ffor the Clensing of the Comon Sewer and Making of a New Sluice Westminster.'' 1580. The Quenes Mats Sewers. Ffirste the Sewer wche beginneth from the house of Mr Baptist on the South side of the Tennis Court and soe along Southwarde to the retorne of the Parke Wall unto John Tilores ground towards Pettie Callis.

That they were not may be interred from the Commissioners applying to the Vestry for the drawing of a plan of the sewerage service. The terms of the request also suggest that the service covered a considerable area and that the financial position of the Commissioners was by no means flourishing:— Md that whereas yt is thought very convenient by the Commissioners of the Seawers for the Citty of Westm That a Plott (plan) should be Drawen for the sayd Seawers & thereupon agreed to pay the some of viij li for the drawinge therof wch they requested myght be disbursed by the churchwardens and the vestrie untyll yt myght be otherwjse levyed by order of the sayd commissioners it is therfore this daye agreed by us whose names are subscribed in the sayd vestrie that the sayd some of viij li shalbe disbursed out of the churchwardens accordinge to the Request of the sayd commissioners dated ix die Aprill A° Rni Rie Elizabeth xl mo 1598. Evidence is furnished by the Exchequer Rolls that the Commissioners were responsible for the cleansing, if not for the construction of the above-named sewers:— For Cleansing the Common Sewer, 1617, Sept. 27. By Order dated 6 Decr 1616. To Peter Hayward Treasurer appointed by the Commrs of Sewers the sum of £24. 17. 3 for so much by him disbursed for Cleansing the Common Sewer under St. James Wall, Petty Callis gate from the Clowson in King Street to the River of Thames under the Orchard Wall being his Maties Charge for Cleansing driving and Scouring the Common Sewer, 140 besides the charge of the inhabitants in the City of Westminster for exceeding His Maties Charge appearing by Certificate there of under the hands of the Commrs By Writs— 25 July 1614 29 June 1616 Inconveniences were occasioned in 1638, not only to the commonalty, but to the King, by the flowing of the sewage from the higher ground of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, into Westminster, as appears by an explanatory certificate filed with the State Papers of the time:— A Certificate of the Comittee touchinge the Sower wch cometh fro St. Martin Lane to Whitehall, and for the avoydinge of the Nuisance. 1638. To the Rt Honble the Lords of His Maties Most Hoble Privie Counsell.

The making of wch vault prtended to bee a sufficient Sower was the first and Principal Cause and continuance of the nuisance to the Streete and King's house at Whitehall And this some of us of the Comittee and divers of the antientiest of the Parish Know to bo true of their Own Knowledge Since wch time the officers of His Maties workes have made severall Complaintts of the nuisance 141 wch came thereby to the Lords of his Maties most Hoble Privie Counsell in the time of King James of blessed memory And both before and since that his Matie hath been at great charge in making severall grates neare Charing Crosse to Stay the Soyle fro coming downe to Whitehall wch notwithstanding did not have theffect ffor nevertheless his Matie hath bene att a continuall charge for many yeares in carrying away the soyle and after that there being no course taken for redresse therein it was chargd upon the parishioners of St. Martins in the ffieldes. This water and soyle cominge fro St. Martins Lane hath also beene founde and Prsented as a nuisance to his Maties house of Whitehall by severall juries of Sewers. That the water prceeding fro ye buildings lycensed to be built in Covent Garden came never downe to Whitehall and was never any nuisance thereunto neither was it founde in any of the saide Prsentments to be a nuisance. That to avoyde the nuisance aforesayde wee thought fitt by yr Lopps direcon to have a subtanciall Sewer made fro St. Martins Lane to ye River of Thames and to that ende wee respectively assessed all such psones whose houses did or might issue into the said sewer The receypts and payments wherof may appear by nootes given unto Mr. Mewtas by yor Lopps Comandement. And forasmuch as the sewers intended are not yet finished nor the money wholly paid for that wch is already done for want of the said money wch is yet behinde and uncollected (a greate parte whereof is assessed upon my Lord of Salisbury and not paid) the worke hath staied above theis twelve months and cannott be finished so as a greate pte of the nuisance to His Maties house still contiueth. INIGO JONES* THOMAS BALDWIN PET. HEYWOOD HENRY WICKS. 19 Sept. 1638. [At a Privy Council held at Hampton Court the 23 Sept., 1638. Order was made upon the aforesaid certificate, and the evidence of Mr Inigo Jones' Surveyor of His Matys works and others. That the Messenger Lewis at once call upon all those persons who have yet not paid their assessments towards the making and completing the sewer, and that after due notice and default they be immediately proceeded against for recovery thereof, and warrants issued accordingly That the Earl of Salisbury denies that the Sewer made by his father, & the houses erected in St Martins Lane have caused the nuisance, but that the nuisance has arisen through the buildings erected by others who stopped the Sewer running under Northampton house. But as the *Architect of St. Martin's Church, and master of Sir Christopher Wren, 142 missioners had certified that this nuisance existed before the new buildings of other persons were commenced, Therefore the said Earl of Salisbury was to have notice to attend the Council and to give such evidence necessary in order that a speedy settlement may be arrived at. The Commissioners are also ordered to certify there doings and proceedings therein by or before all hallow tide next.] A separate sewers rate was not made by the Vestry at the time now under notice; but their minutes shows the amount of the rate levied by the Commissioners:— Thursday, 17th Apl., 1684.—Ordered that the Churchwardens do pay the Tax rated by the Coms of Sewers for Bridewell and the two Searchers houses according to the rate of 3½d. in the pound att 40 1. p. Ann. The local drainage was under the control of the Vestry:- 13th July, 1692.—That the Churchwardens cause a drain to be stopped up which is made Crosse the Road into the Ditch by the Workhouse. 12th Oct., 1692.—Memd. this day a pson appeared on the Accompt of a Drain laid into the Workhouse Ditch for the benefitt of severall houses and stables against the same the Parish requiring satisfaccon for the same and argueing the matter this Vestry doe think fitt to take twenty shillings p. ann. for the use of the same. In case the pson who hath the right to the houses doe contract for the payment of the said rent & to keep the said Drain in good repair which drain shall be made use of soe long as this Vestry shall think fitt and noe longer. Water Supply. Advances having been made shortly after the Reformation towards the improvement in the systems for the relief of the poor, the tenance and cleansing of the highways, and the main sewerage, an expectation that the water supply would also be taken in hand naturally arises. No such action appears to have been taken, however, for nearly a hundred years, the urgent necessity notwithstanding. This is singular, at least, since statutes relating to the water supply had been passed in 35 Henry VIII (1544), 3 James I (1606), 7 James I, (1610), and 8 George I (1722). It will be borne in mind that the parishioners relied upon four several sources for their water supply—the service brought from 143 the springs at Knightsbridge, the river Thames, the King's Conduit in the palace yard, and ordinary wells. The importance of the Knightsbridge supply is seen by reference to a petition in the State Paper Office:— Petition of the Inhabitants of Westminster to the King praying for a restoration of the Water Supply lately taken from them. May 1631. To the Kings Most excellent Matie The humble Petition of all the Inhabitants of ye Maties Cittie of Westminster Sheweth unto ye Most excellent Matie That all the Water wch serveth the said Cittie as well for the use and health of yor Maties People there as also for the cleansing and cleering of the said Cittee hath it beginning from the Springs and Wastes of yor Maties parke of Marybone and Tyborne and is thence conveyed in Pipes through Hide Parke, the benefitt whereof hath ben found so good to us yor Maties said subjects that under God wee conceave hath ben and is the only Prserving of us from the Plague and likewise danger of fyers of both wch wee have had fearfull experience of late. The wch water is now taken of from us by ye Keepers of yor Maties said Parke of Hide under a pretence that the Ponds there lack water for yor Maties deere wch Pondes wee know to be soe filled that the water runneth at waste downe the Comon Ditches. Most humble beseech yor excellent Matie gratiously to consider the p'miaes and the necessity wee are in, And that yor Matie will be pleased to reserve the examming and fynall determining thereof the Right Hon. the Lord Chamberlaine, High Steward of this yor Maties Cittee of Westminster and Wee as in all dutie bound shall ever pray for yor Most excellent Matie [Endorsed:—] At the Court of Greenewich, 22 May 1631. His Matie is graciously pleased to reserve this Peticon to the Lord Privy Seale, Lord Chamberlayne, Earle of Holland and the Viscount Dorchester who are to call before them on Wednesday next in the afternoone at Whitehall both the Peticoners and Thomas Baldwin Comptroller of the Works and having heard whch they can say concerning this Complaint to settle such order therein for the Comodity of the Citty of Westminster as they shall judge fitting or otherwise to report the same unto his Matie DORCHESTER. From an entry in the Vestry minutes fifty years later, the 144 supply from these springs appears to have been restored. Public attention had meanwhile been called to the demand for improvement. A petition dated 17th January, 1637-8 was presented to the King (Charles I) reciting that "many towns in England require a good water supply to keep them free from smells, infection and fire," and praying his Majesty to grant licence to erect water works throughout England and Wales upon payment to the King of £50 per annum from Lady Day, 1640, when the proposed works were expected to be finished. A grant was made the following year to Archbishop Laud and other Commissioners of his Majesty relative to a new aqueduct undertaken by Sir Edward Stradling and others to be constructed of brick or stone, for the bringing of water from Hoddesden to Westminster. With the foregoing grant is preserved at the Public Record Office an indenture between the King and Sir Edward Stradling, Carew Ralegh and others reciting that £7,000 towards the aqueduct had been raised by lottery, that £5,000 more were ready when required, and that a further sum of £20,000 would be available for the work when commenced. If this important point was ever reached, the benefits of the scheme were never extended to Westminster, a failure which might have been due to the fermented state of the public mind at the time, and to the memorable events which shortly afterwards happened. In the recorded proceedings of the Vestry the local water supplies are frequently referred to in orders and resolutions of which the following may be taken as specimens:— Wednesday, 8th Sept., 1669. Whereas several Complaints have been made unto ye Vestrey of this parish That John Row and R. Wilson doe cary away and sell ye water of the Conduit mainteined by ye sd parish and Intended for the Use of the Neighbourhood insomuch that they cannot be supplyed for their own Use And That they the sayd Row and Wilson doe Occasion severall Quarrell there and abuse persons that come to fetch water for themselves The Vestry doe therefore thinke fitt and accordingly Order That the sayd llow, nor Wilson, nor any other person shall fetch water thence to Sell from St Mich. 145 day to our Lady-day before the Hours of 8 in ye morning nor from our Lady-day to Michs till 7 of the Clock in ye morning That soe ye neighbourhood may be Supplied And that after those Hours they shall stay their Turns till those shall be supplyed That shall be there before them And they doe further Order That ye sd Row, nor Wilson nor noe other person shall bring any tubbs to fill to Cary away afterwards but yt every person take his or her Turne as they Come that soe al quarrells for the future may be prevented. Thursday, 12th Aug. 1669. That noe person who doth fetch Water from the Conduit for profitt by Selling thereof doe presume to fetch water from the sayd Conduit to sell before 8 of ye Clocke in the morning in ye Wintertime vizt from Mich to our Lady day or before 7 of ye clock in the morning in ye Summer Tyme vizt from or Lady Day to Michs 1st June, 1675. That the Churchwardens doe cause a new Wodden Pumpe to be made and placed at Mr Cornelius Vandons Alme's Houses, the old leaden pumpe being stolen away. 5th April, 1682. Ordered that Esqr Wardour have libertie to lay a leaden Pipe from King streete across the chinch yard to bring water to his houses there, underneath the Channell which carrys the water from the Abbey to King streete to bee continued during the pleasure of the Vestry. Wednesday, 24 Oct., 1683. Ordered that the Churchwarden doe cause a new pumpe to be made att the Pesthouse and the charge thereof to be allowed at the passing of their accompt. 26th July, 1700. Ordered that the Churchwardens cause the Thames water to be laid in for the use of the Church. 28th April, 1703. Ordered that the Churchwardens agree for the laying of the Conduit water into the Church at as cheap a rate as they can. Sunday, 14 August, 1715. Ordd that the Erecting a new Pump at Tuttle Side be referred to the Churchwardens Discretion. The entries made at this period relate to the sinking of wells in various positions in the highways, and the fixing of pumps for the common use of the parishioners; but the sites were not always absolutely beyond the reach of contamination:— 24th July, 1741.—Ordered that the Pump in the Church Yard* next King Street be taken up and the well sunk deeper. In 1722 the service of the Chelsea Water Works Company *The Interments were being made in the Churchyard almost daily at this time. The well was first sunk in 1735. L 146 was introduced into the parish, to the prejudice of one or two speculations already existing:— 23rd February, 1730.—The Vestry being informed that the proprietors of the Hyde park Water Works had disposed of their patent and that their pipes were no longer supply'd with Water. Ordd That for the security of the Inhabitants from any accident by Fire, the Churchwardens do cause the Pluggs fixt in those pipes, to bo remov'd to those belonging to the Chelsea Company. The Chelsea Company had not established the "constant service" system, nor had they yet secured the monopoly of the supply in Westminster:— 25th July, 1733.—This Vestry having taken into their Consideration the very great want of water, (being sensible that at this time the Inhabitants of this Parish have not sufficient for their ordinary use); whole streets having been served with very little or none for a fortnight or Three weeks together & likewise considering the Imminent danger the Inhabitants of this Parish their houses and goods are exposed too in Case of Fire. Ordd That the Churchwardens do wait upon the proprietors of the Chelsea Water Works & acquaint them with the many Inconveniences and dangers the parish lies under either from their Negligence or Inability, And that it is the Opinion of this Vestry that the Inhabitants will be obliged to make application to be served elsewhere unless the proprietors take some care that they may be served more regularly & better for the time to come. At the bidding of the legislature such improvements were made that the inhabitants of the principal streets were able to dispense with wells and rely absolutely on the Company's service:— Friday, 18 April, 1792. A Petition from the Inhabitants of Great George Street was presented requesting the removal of the Pump in the said street being of little or no use to the Parish at large is frequently an obstruction to the passing of Carriages and is particularly inconvenient to them and who hope for the above Reasons the Vestry will give orders for its Removal. [Referred to Commissioners of Paving.] From this period to 1852 the system was further perfected in obedience to new orders of the Legislature. As the demand increased also, and powers were given in 1855 for the closing of unwholesome wells, it may be inferred that 147 the supply of water so far met the requirements as to remove serious cause for complaint. Nuisances. Allusion has already been made to the powers vested by Parliament in the hands of specially constituted Commissioners for the suppression of common nuisances caused by obstruction of the highways. Such offences against the commonwealth as affect the public health will only, therefore, be noticed here. A cursory glanceat some of thestatutes will at onceshowthe importance attached by Parliament to these matters. An Act passed in 1603 (1 James I cap. 31) aimed at preventing the spread of infectious disease. It provided that "if any affected with the plague or dwelling in any infected house be commanded by the Mayor or Constable or other head officer of his town or vill to keep his house and shall venture to disobey such command he shall be enforced by the watch, men appointed on all such melancholy occasions to obey such necessary command; and if any hurt ensue by such enforcement the watchmen are indemnified." And if any person so commanded went abroad or conversed in company, having no plague sore upon him, he was liable to be punished as a vagabond by whipping and to be bound to his good behaviour; if he had any infectious disease uncured upon him at the time of such going abroad, he was to be punishable as a felon. The law in this direction was amended and extended in 1753, 1755, and 1788. Twenty years before the great plague the Vestry of Westminster had recognised the importance of the isolation of persons suffering from infectious diseases:— At a Vestrie holden the 24th day of July 1642 It was ordered that the Churchwardens shall forthwith proceed to build tenne roomes in Tuthill feilds for Pesthouses neere the Shedde now there with Garrettes over the same according to a plott (plan) in that behalfe made of Tenne houses in Rainge. Notwithstanding the powers with which the constables were armed in respect to nuisances, the Vestry were frequently called upon, for the protection of the public, to L 2 148 take action, where the Justices, Commissioners and Constables omitted to do so:— Wednesday, 6th July, 1670. That the present Churchwardens with anie three or more of the Vestriemen doe view the Ditch or Drayne leading from ye Easte end of the New Chappell Southward by the wall of the Artillery Ground, and consider whether it be fitt that the sayd Ditch should be Darned up or not and Report their opinion therein unto the Yestry in writing. That the Churchwardens doe speake with the jury of Annoyance and informe them touching the greate Annoyance occasioned by generall New Sinkes or Draynes that are lately made neare the New Chappell and Eeport what they have done therein. Sunday, 3rd Jany., 1685. Ordered that the Churchwardens do give notice to my Lord Pagitt that he may Order the Dunghill behind his stable to be removed forthwith Or if it is not forthwith removed they cause his Ldp to be Indicted or prosecuted. Thirty years later the keeping of pigs gave rise to many complaints, to remedy which the Yestry made an order, after hearing the parties, that "the said hoggs he disposed of between this and the 24th August, or the laws relating to them will be put in the strictest operation." Peremptory powers were given by Parliament in 1691 to the local authorities for the suppression of pig keeping; a practice not yet eradicated in Westminster:— 2 W & M, session 2, c 8, s 20—That no person or person whatsoever shall breed feed or keep any sort or manner of swine upon pain of forfeiting the same to the churchwardens and overseers of the poor of the parish where such swine shall be kept . .and that it shall be lawful . . for all or any of the churchwardens, chapelwardens, overseers of the poor, constables, beadles, headboroughs . . to search in all such places and all that shall be so found to seize . and the same to sell for the best price that can be had. A nuisance being apprehended from the burning of bricks in St. James's Field, led to a petition being presented to the Council of State in 1654-5 under the hands of 80 parishioners, for the prevention of the annoyance, and an Order in Council was issued on 18th September, 1655, directing that immediate steps be taken to restrain the use the user of the place as a brickfield. 149 Complaints were made to the Vestry of nuisances of other kinds:— 9th April, 1792. Robert Abington Esq having received a Letter from St. Lawrence Cox from an Inhabitant of Great Peter Street, Westminster, relative to a Nuisance practised in the said Street of Dog Fighting, Bear and Badger Baiting, which being Read Resolved—That the most effectual means be taken by Presentment Indictment or otherwise to suppress a House in Great Peter Street, Westminster where Dog Fighting, Bear and Badger Baiting are constantly practised to the continual alarm of the Inhabitants. Friday, 3rd August, 1792. Application having been made to these Vestries by Wm Ebberfield against whom a Bill of Indictment was preferred and found at the Quarter Sessions by Order of the Joint Vestries of the 9th of April last for keeping a House in Great Peter Street in which he suffered Dog Fighting, Badger Baiting, &c. to the great Annoyance and Nuisance of the Neighbourhood, praying to be forgiven and he was willing to Pay all Expences that the Parishes have been put to on this Account but it appearing to the Vestries that he did not attend the said Quarter Sessions nor traverse the same over to the next Sessions, and that he had not pleaded to the said Indictment, nor given any Notice of Tryal but on the Contrary had continued the said Practices after the Indictmt found. Resolved—That the application of the said Wm Ebberfield be Rejected. Easter Tuesday, March '29th, 1796.—That the Bedels do on the first Thursday in every Month return to the Workhouse Board an account in Writing of those Streets that are not properly cleansed by the Parish Scavenger, also of Hogs being in the Church or Chapel Yards, or of any other Nuisances. In addition to the Act of 51 Hen. III., 1257, against the sale of unwholesome food, already noticed in part I., a statute of Charles II. (1660) imposed heavy penalties for the adulteration of wine, the punishment being increased to imprisonment by an enactment of William III. The public health was also protected by stringent laws in relation to the admixture of alum with bread. Protection from fire. No provision of appliances for extinguishing tires appears to have been made in Westminster until 1657, when an order was passed by the Vestry for 150 carrying into effect a direction previously given but not recorded:— 22nd August, 1657. It is ordered by a Vestrie this day holden That Mr. Edward Martyn and Mr. Emery Hill shall, out of the moneys remaining in their hands Build, erect, and sett upp with Bricks a little house in the parish Churchyard of St. Margaretts, Westmr, to adioyne next unto the Gage or Round house there wherein shall bee alwaies kept the twoe new fire Engines well they were formerly ordered to buy and provide for the use and service of this parish. Dilapidations were soon discovered in the" little house" and defects in the engines it sheltered :— October, 1663. Whereas information to the Vestry was this day given that not only tho howse lately erected for the preservacon and Keeping of the Ingens is out of repaire about the roofe therof soe that tho Baine falling on the said Ingens doth very much preuidice them. But the said Ingens are also defective and at prsont useles. It is therefore ordered that the Churchwardens doo take the advice of able workemen touching the Amendmt or new making of tho said Ingens as shalbee most necessary And that care bee also taken by the said Churchwardens for the Amending of the Roofe of the Ingen-house as they in theire discrescion shall think meet for the future preservacon of the said Ingens. 5th July, 1670. That tho Churchwardens doe take the keys of ye Ladders, Crookos Bucketts and Engines into their owne Custodie and fasten them to an iron cheyne, and lodge them with Mr. Rogers the Sexton to the end they may be readily had upon all occasions. This provision had evidently proved itself to be insufficient:— 5th May, 1675. That the Churchwardens doe cause the Engine House to be enlarged so as to conteyne tho Engines at large ready ffixed to bo ready on all Occasions And their cisternes to be alwaies kept full of water. A fire in Cannon Row soon demonstrated the inadequacy of these additional precautions:— Sunday, 9th Aprill, 1682. Upon the humble request of the gunners of the Tower who wore very serviceable and diligent in blowing up tho houses at the late ffire in Cannon ltow It is Ordered that the Churchwardens do pay ffortie Shillings to them as a gratuity for theiro good service to be distributed equally betweene them And tho said 40s. shall bee allowed at passing the Churchwardens Accompts. 151 A new engine and escape ladders were shortly afterwards provided, and instructions given for the inspection of the same from time to time by the Churchwardens. Improvements and additions were made to the system by virtue of statutory powers at the commencement of the next century (6 Anne, cap. 31, 1708). Stop blocks and firecocks were introduced, and with them a special Fire Rate to defray the expenses of the increased service. The arrangements are set forth in the minutes thus:— Wednesday, 3rd August, 1709. The Vestry took into consideration the Act of Parliament for making more Effectual an Act made in the sixth year of the Reigne of her p'sent Majty Queen Anne For the better preventing of mischiefs that may happen by Fire And finding thereby that severall Engines, Stop Blocks, Fire Cocks, Keyes and other Implements and materials are directed by the said Act to be prepared, and upon perusal of an Estimate of the charge of the sd severall things laid before this Vestrv as follows Vizt:— An Estimate of the charge of the Fire pluggs &c. £ s. d. For a Hand Engine 16 0 0 For three brass socketts or fire cocks with three brass screws for the pipes 20 0 0 For one hundred and four yards of Leather pipe for the Engine at Five shillings per yard 26 0 0 For one hundred and sixty Fire pluggs with the iron work thereto belonging at six shillings each 48 0 0 For one hundred and sixty paintings 10 0 0 For Iron, Crows, Tubbs, and Implements 10 0 0 Totall £130 0 0 Collecting. Sallary to the Engine keeper. Rewards to the Engine keepers & turn cocks. Accidental repairs of the Engines, pipes, & other incident charge thereto belonging. It is Agreed by this Vestry that the sume necessary to be Rais'd for Defraying the charge of the things before menconed be One hundred & seaventy pounds. And Whereas the said Act of Parliamt has directed such sume & sumes of mony as shall be requisite & necessary for the Ends aforesaid, to be rais'd in such manner as by Law they may doe for the maintenance & Reliefe of the Poor. Resolved That a Rate be made accordingly upon the inhabitants 152 of this parish not exceeding Two pence in the pound (according to the Direction of the said Act). Ordd That it be left to the Discretion of the present Churchwardens and the Churchwardens for the time being to agree with fitt persons to take care & keep the engines. Aided perhaps by the produce of the special rate now for the first time available, the Vestry proceeded further towards completing the equipment:— 9th February, 1725. Ordd that the Churchwardens do provide harness for two Horses, and two Lanthorns to be kept in ye Engine house, and also Three Dozen of Leathern Buckets of the best sort to be used with ye Engines on any Misfortune of Fire the charges whereof shall be allowd them on their account. 8th May, 1725. Ordd That the charge of building the apartment over the New Engine House be paid by the Churchwardens such an addition having since the last Vestry been judged necessary for the constant being of a proper person on the spot, for the keeping the Keys thereof and for the discharge of other Parish Business. Encouragement was offered to those who assisted the parish staff:— 9th May, 1734.—The Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that severall persons who Assisted at Working the Engines at the late Fire in King Street had applyed to them for a Gratuity for their great Pains and Labour, some of them having worked for twenty four hours and others having been appointed to sit up severall Nights to watch for fear of its breaking out a fresh. And Mr. Fowkes the Engineer having also applyed for a Gratuity for his Trouble and the timely Assistance he gave (with his two Engines) in Extinguishing the said Fire he not being intituled to any Reward by the Act of Parliament, Parish Engines only being intituled to Rewards on such Occasions. Ordd That it be referred to the Churchwardens to Gratifie such persons who shall appear to them to have assisted at the said Fire as they shall think proper, and it shall be allowed them on their Account. As improvements in the construction of engines were brought to notice, the Vestry kept pace therewith. In 1742 they purchased "A New large Constant Stream Suction Engine," and had the "little squirt engine repaired in a substantial and workmanlike manner," under a contract, which included terms for the maintenance of the 153 same for seven years. In 1751 "a proper place" for the safe keeping of the fire engines way erected on the order of the Vestry, at the east side of the Church Tower, and a proper number of new water buckets was added to the plant. Three years afterwards a resolution was also passed directing that the engines should be kept at the Workhouse. Fire plugs and boxes were provided in 1739; and in 1773 the Vestry appointed a Committee to co-operate with the Directors of the Westminster Fire Office in "forming a plan to be offered to Parliament for the more effectually supplying the Town with water." Meanwhile "the small squirt engine" was superseded by a "hand stream engine," a survey of the fire plugs was made, and the tablets or plates indicating their positions were renewed. Robberies. From 1585-6 to 1735 the parish was made chargeable in respect of such robberies as were committed in the Hundred of Ossulstone, within which Westminster was comprised. Parliament passed an Act in the first-mentioned year (27 Eliz., cap. 13) reciting and remedying defects in Statutes of 13 Edward I., 1275, and 28 Edward III. (1355), under which robberies and other offences had increased. The Act of Elizabeth sought to make the inhabitants of the hundred more vigilant in the pursuit and conviction of offenders by making the parishioners "answer and satisfy the one moiety, a half of all and every such sum and sums of money, and damages," which was to be recoverable by the Clerk of the Peace, after assessment by the Justices upon the several parishes in the Hundred as they might think fit. No penalty was to be payable, however, by the parish in which the offender was apprehended The provisions of Sec. X., that " hue and cry shall be made by horsemen and footmen only, any usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding," leaves scope for speculation as to whether hounds had previously been employed in tracing offenders. Another Act passed in 1597-8 (39 Eliz., cap. 15) prescribes that " no person robbing any 154 house in the day-time, although no person be therein, shall be admitted to have the benefit of clergy." Neither of these measures specified the persons by whom the hue and cry was to be undertaken, a defect which was not supplied until 1735 (8 Geo. II., cap 16) when the constable, borsholder, head borough or tythingman was to perform the duty with the utmost expedition under penalty of £5. This act considerably modified the discretion of the Justices in levying the damages upon the parishes, and had the effect, otherwise, of reducing the number of claims made for compensation. A few extracts are given from the Vestry minutes as examples of a very large number of those relating to the subject : Wednesday, 27 April, 1670.—Mr Humphrie Grinsoll one of the present Churchwardens did this day declare unto the Vestrie, that an Officer of the High Sheriffe of the Countie of Midds hath made Distresse upon his Goods & Levyed the Sume of Seaven pounds & eight shillings for one Robberie comitted in the Hundred of Osalston in the County aforesd Whereupon it is Ordered that the Churchwardens for the time being doe advise with Councell concerning the same & know what course is fitt to be taken touching that matter (there being noe Presidence extant within this Cittie & Libertie for the like Distresse) and how to defend the parish from the like trouble for ye future. And that the sayd Mr Grinsell be reimbursed the sayd Sume of Seaven pounds Eight shillings by the Churchwardens wch shall be allowed at the passing of their Acct. 24th July, 1690. Ordd that the Churchwardens pay the sume of Forty ffive pounds to Mr Buck and Mr James Justices of the Peace for Middlesex being so much charged on this parish towards a robbery comited in this hundred and to bee allowed on their Accompt 5th August, 1691. Ordered that the Churchwardens pay to the High Constable One pound Tenn shillings towards a Bobery comitted on William Brooks, at Eeling in the Hundred of Ossulstone. And also to pay him ffifty Shillings for another Bobbery comitted on John Lord Lovlace neer Paddington. Wednesday, Nov. 4, 1713. Ordd That the Churchdns forthwith pay the sume of £'45: 7: 9 so much being alloted for the proportion of St. Margtt Parish for Robberys comitted within the Hundred of Ossulston. 155 Tuesday, 8th November, 1774. Ordered that Mr Drake the Receiver of the Watch Money do Pay to Robert Browne of Abingdon Buildings Esqr., the sum of Ten Pounds as the Reward for his apprehending and taking in St. Margaret's Street in this Parish on the 27th day of July last, William Griffiths, who in the Night of the preceeding Day Committed a burglary in the parish of St. Anne, Westminster, for which the said William Griffiths was tried and convicted at the Old Bailey last September Sessions Mention may here be made of the fact that prior to 1696 the inhabitants of Westminster were liable to serve as jurors at Quarter Sessions, but by an Act passed in that year (7 Will. III.) they were specially exempted from that duty* Beggars and Vagabonds. In addition to the relief of the poor of the parish out of the rates and benevolences, of which a fragmentary sketch has already been made, the Vestry exercised considerable powers for the punishment of vagrants and "sturdy beggars," more particularly when the constables, acting under the direction of the justices, failed to prevent the assembling of beggars and vagabonds in the parish. The severity of the law on this subject, indeed " man's inhumanity to man," is shown by the following extract from an Act of Parliament of 22 Henry VIII, cap 12 (1531). Attached to this extract is a copy of the licence given to impotent beggars to beg within certain limits, as also a copy of the warrant for passing the offender back to his parish of settlement:— Whereas in all places througheout this Realme of Englande, Vacabundes & Beggers have of longe tyme increased & dayly do increase in great & excessyve nombres by the occasyon of ydelness, mother & rote of all vyces, whereby hathe insurged & spronge & dayly insurge the & spryngeth contynuall theftes murders & other haynous offences & great enormytes to the high displeasure of God the inquetacon & damage of the Kynge People & to the marvaylous disturbance of the Comon Weale of this Realme.

That there shall be a Central office or place where proper books shall be kept with a Register and that such office shall be near Paul's Church, St. John's Hospital, Blackfriars or other convenient place—each of the aforesaid four persons to have a separate office if he prefers it. So serious was the annoyance experienced even as recently as the reign of George I. that the Vestry were led by a complaint from the Speaker to revive their Orders formerly given with a view to diminishing it:— 30th January, 1789. The Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that they had reced. a Letter from the Right Honble the Speaker of the House of Commons of which the following is a copy. Directed, To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster. Gentlemen, Complaint having this day been made to the House of Commons that great numbers of Idle and disorderly Persons do daily under pretence of asking Charity infest the Streets and publick Places of the City and Liberty of Wesmr to the great Annoyance and Interruption of the Members of the House of Commons in their passage to and from the said House, and of other Persons going on their Lawfull Occasions notwithstanding the great Collections which have been made for the Relief of the Poor during the Present Severe Season over and above the Provision of the respective Parishes for that purpose. The House of Commons have this day ordered me to Send to the Justices of the peace for the said City and Liberty and to the Vestries of the respective Parishes there that Directions may be forthwith given by them to the Bedels, Constables, and other Officers of the said respective Parishes to put the laws in Execution against all idle and disorderly Persons who shall be found infesting the 159 streets and other publick places of the said City and Libty under pretence of asking Charity ; and in Obedience to the said Order I do hereby communicate the same to you. I am, Gentlemen, Your humble Servant, Ar. ONSLOW, Speaker. From the House of Commons, Feb. 8th, 1739. And the said letter being this day Read the Vestry thereupon came unanimously to the following Resolution. That the Bedels of this parish do and they are hereby directed punctually to Observe the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Articles in their printed Orders and Directions of this Vestry made the 29th of June 1736 which are in the following words— "That each of the said Bedels shall every day constantly walk in "the Streets and other open places of his respective Ward and "apprehend all such Idle Persons as he shall find Wandring "and Begging There, or using any subtle Craft, or unlawful "Game or Play, and particularly such as Game at Wheel "Barrows; and that he carry every pson apprehended to some "Justice of the Peace, in or near this parish, to be dealt with ''according to Law." "That the said Bedels do respectively use their best Endeavours "to discover the Names of, and effectually prosecute every "Carter, Drayman, Carman, or Waggoner, whom they shall "see driving any Cart, Carr, or Waggon, in the streets of this "parish, and riding upon such Cart, or other carriage, not hav"ing some person on Foot to guide the same, The penalty for "which Offence is Ten Shillings one half for the Informer, and "the other for the Poor, by the Statute of 1 Geo. 1st Ch. 57." "That the said several Bedels do attend every Sunday, at the "parish Church, and Chapels, during the time of divine Service, "to keep the Church Doors, and Church Yard quiet, and free "from Noice, and also to keep the Beggars from disturbing the "parishioners in their passing to and from Church, and that as "soon as divine Service and Sermon is ended, they do repair to "the Vestry Room of this parish, there to receive such Orders, "and Directions as shall be given them by the Church Wardens "for the time being.'' And it is Ordd that if any Bedel shall for the future Disobey or Neglect to perform his Duty in the before mentioned or any other particulars in their said printed Orders every such Bedel for such their Neglect shall be immediately discharged from any further Service and that they may not plead Ignorance the Clerk of ye Vestry do forthwith serve them with a Copy of this Order and the said printed Directions. 100 Prisons. The Vestry actively interested themselves for well nigh two hundred years in the prison accommodation in the parish. The older of the two establishments—the Gate House*—was erected by an inferior officer of the Abbey in the reign of Edward III. (1327). It was conducted by a lessee of the Dean and Chapter as a speculation, the proprietor being dependent on the prisoners' fees, and was demolished owing to its ruinous condition, in 1776. The inconvenience of the system of maintenance by fees, and the exorbitant amounts charged at times, elicited remonstrances from the Vestry as late as 1727. The Tothill Fields Bridewell was erected in 1622 by the local Justices as a House of Correction for offenders within their jurisdiction. So long as its use was limited to local purposes, the cost of maintenance was borne by the local rates in the proportion of two-thirds by the parish of St. Margaret, and the remaining third jointly between the parishes of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and St. Clement Danes. An abridgement has been made of the agreement with the first Keeper of the Prison. The original document may be seen at the Town Hall:— Articles of Agreement dated 25th January 1622/3 Between Alphonsus Fowle and 9 others "Governors appointed for the House of Correction newlie erected in Tuttle feilds," and Richard Betts of Westminster, Hempdresser, lately appointed "Cheife Workemen in the said House of Correccon." Witnesseth that for £50 paid to Betts "as a stock to bee by him emploied and laid out in hempe as well for himself and his servants to worke upon as for the Prisoners to bee thither sent or committed," he the said Betts at his own charge and during the time he is "Chiefe Workemr shall, & will "find & provide diett and lodging for all such Prisoners as shalbee from time to time to him Comitted being above the age of 12 years by anie of H.M. Justices of the Peace for the Citie and liberties of Westmr," &c. That he shall keep a Register Book to enter the names of such prisoners & the term they are committed for; to safely keep the doors &c. of the * For an interesting notice of this prison see Walcott's Memorials, pp. 273-278. 161 said House, the 23 Blocks, 26 Beetles & other tools & implements, and upon the departure of said Betts he to pay the said Governors £50 or stock of Hemp to that amount. Also that he is to cary out the Rules & Orders as signed by H.M. Justices dated 14 Jany last. In consideration whereof the said Governors agree to pay the said Betts £4 per annum. For Blind or lame persons the said Betts to be paid 6d. each weekly. Every Prisoner on leaving the house to pay (if able) 4d. Any sick person, or those unable to work are either to be discharged or Betts to have reasonable Payment for diett, &c. Finally Betts to reside within the said house, on the north side with 6 rooms, 2 outward doors, a garden plot, store house, and 2 "large roomes for his prisoners & ffolkes to worke in and roomes for his Prisoners lodgings." Sig : by RICHARD BETTS. Witn : by JOHN PLUKENETT (Ser), & GEORGE PLUKENETT (his appe). The first registered call upon the parochial funds for repairs is twenty-six years after the opening of the prison:— 9th June, 1648.—Ordered that the Churchwardens for the tyme being shall repayre the house of Correction in Tuthill ffeilds with needfull and necessary reparacon. After forty years' operation of the system of payment indicated by the above agreement, an appeal is made to the Vestry as the controlling authority on the subject of the keeper's salary:— 28th Aprill, 1663.—Ordered upon ye desire of Mr. Taunton who hath this day moved so that something may be allowed him by way of sallary for his care in looking to Brydewell that ye Churchwardens doe consider and agree to ye settlement of Two Thirds parts of Tenn pounds per annum being ye proporcon of this parish, ye other Third to be paid by ye parishes of St. Clement Danes and St. Martin in ye Fields as formerly and that ye comencemt of such sallary bee from Lady Day last accordingly. Early in Queen Anne's reign the Bridewell became a common gaol for criminals. The Gate House prison was removed, as already stated, in 1776, in consequence of which the Bridewell was enlarged in 1778. A more systematic and direct control began to be exercised by the justices as the prison became used for criminals, and the Vestry complained of the undue proportion of the common charge levied upon them;— 12 Oct., 1711. Ordd That the Churchwardens pay to Wm. Elderton in Order to pay to Richard Rider Esq Trear appointed by the M 162 Justices for the City & Libty of Westmr at their Genl Quarter Sessions towards the repairing of Bridewell by order of Quarter Sessions made at Westmr at Midsomer last the Sume of Tenn Pounds & Four Shillings And also the sume of Nineteen Shillings & Two Pence to Mrs. Redding for keeping one Landy. Resolved that it be represented to the Justices of this parish the Hardship the Inhabitants of this Parish is put unto towards the repairing of Bridewell (over & above the other Parishes) at the next Quarter Sessions to be Holden at Westminster. 22 July, 1713. That the Churchwardens pay to Mr. Elderton Keeper of Bridewell the Sume of £18 15s. 6d. pursuant to an Order of Quarter Sessions being the proportion laid on this pariah towards repairing the same. No mention is made in the Vestry minutes of the date of the demolition of the prison, but a painted inscription on a board affixed to the north east wall of the Sessions House, in the Broad Sanctuary, above a stone doorway supplies the information:— Taken from the Gateway of the old Tothill Fields prison Westminster, Anno Domini 1836. Another board affixed immediately under the stone lintel of the above mentioned doorway bears the inscription:— Gateway lock and key of the principal entrance to the old Tothill Fields Prison Anno 1665. Removed 1836. Erected here 1884. Another place of detention, the parish "cage" or roundhouse, cast further responsibilities upon the Vestry:— 23rd October, 1727. The Church Wardens having represented to the Vestry that by reason of their being but one Roundhouse for the Confinement of persons taken up in the Night time, it often happens that ye Peace Officers when they have prisoners of both sexes, are obliged to carry one of them to ye Gatehouse to the great Expence of many poor people by the Exorbitant Fees there. And that there is room with a Small Expence to erect another Prison or Roundhouse out of the Bonehouse which will be very fit for that purpose. Ordd that the Church Wardens do cause such Room to be partitioned of with a Brick Wall from ye said Bonehouse and otherwise strengthend and made a fit place of Security and the charge shall be Allowed on their Account. After the constitution of the parish of St. John the Evangelist the expenses were levied upon the two parishes 163 jointly, of which numerous instances are recorded in the minutes. The proceedings of the Vestry upon the proposed establishment of a penitentiary in the parish are thus recorded:— Wednesday, the 9th November, 1796. Mr. Drake, Vestry Clerk of St. Margaret's acquainted these Vestries, that yesterday at the request of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, he waited on them, and that His Lordship the Dean, with several Prebendaries present, signified that a communication had been made to them by Mr. Bentham of Queen Square Place, Westminster, that an Application was intended to be made to Parliament this Sessions, and before Christmas next, for a Power to Erect and Build a Penitentiary House in Tothil Fields. That the Ground on which the same was to be Built was for that purpose proposed to be alienated that a certain Allotment of Ground in the said Fields (as should be agreed upon) was to remain with the Dean and Chapter for the use of and Recreation of the King's Scholars of Westminster, as had been from antient Custom, and that an allotment of Ground or other compensation should be made to the Parties interested for the Old Buildings in the said Fields commonly called the Five Chimnies, Originally Built by the Parish of St. Margaret Westminster. That His Lordship the Dean and Prebendaries Present further signified that the said Application would most probably meet with their Concurrence so far as their Rights and Interests therein extended, but that as the Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist Westminster, in which Tothil Fields is situated have certain Rights and Interests in the said Fields in respect to the Commoning and Herbage thereof, they were desirous that communication might be made to the Vestries of the said Parishes for their consideration of the intended Application, so far as it may affect the said Parishes, at the same time observing that in case of the acquiesence in stipulating for proper Terms and not resisting the Application an opportunity might offer for having a sufficient and convenient allotment of Ground Assigned to them for the Building of a Workhouse for the Poor of the said Parishes if they should be so disposed. That they should hold a Chapter on Wednesday the 16th instant on their own Business, but that if the Vestries in consequence of this information should wish to see them on this particular matter they will then be ready to receive them. Resolved That the Church Wardens of these Parishes be requested to convene a Joint Meeting of these Vestries on Tuesday next at Twelve o'Clock at Noon precisely in St. Margaret's Vestry Room. To take into consideration the said Message. 15 Novr., 1796. Resolved That the Thanks of these Vestries be M 2 164 given to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster for their communication of an intention to apply to Parliament for obtaining an Act to Erect a Penitentiary House in Tothil Fields. And that they be requested further to favor the Vestry as soon as the Plan shall be sufficiently ripened with the nature and extent thereof. And the satisfaction intended to be proposed to the Parishes in lieu of their Rights thereon the Parishes will naturally reflect and confer with the Dean and Chapter without any delay. Thursday, 14 Feb., 1799. The Vestry then proceeded to take into Consideration the proposed application to Parliament for Erecting a Penitentiary House in Tothill Fields. Resolved—That the Erection of a Penitentiary House in Tothill Fields will be highly injurious to the Rights Privileges and Interests of the Inhabitants of the United Parishes of Saint Margaret and Saint John the Evangelist. Resolved—That this Vestry on behalf of the said Parishioners will on any Petition or other application being presented or made to Parliament for that purpose, take such measures as may appear to them proper in opposition thereto. Resolved—That a Copy of these Resolutions be transmitted by the Vestry Clerk to Jeremiah Bentham Esquire. Suppression of Drunkenness. By an Act of Parliament passed in 1 James I., cap. 9 (1603) and by other statutes subsequently passed in the same reign, duties were imposed upon the Churchwardens, of which the Vestry took cognisance by directing, from time to time, that the "Churchwardens go abroade on Sabbath Dayes according to the antient usuage, and visite the public Tiplinge houses and keepe good Orders in ye parish." For neglect of this duty the Churchwardens were liable to a penalty of forty shillings. Space forbids more than the recital of the preamble of the first of the above-named Acts. "Whereas the ancient true and principall use of Innes Alehouses and Victuallinge Houses, was for the Receipte Reliefe and Lodginge of wayfaring people travellinge from place to place and for such Supplie of the wants of such people as are not able by greater quantities to make their provision of Victuals and not meant for entertainment and harbouringe of lewde and idle-people to spend and Consume theire money and theire tyme in lewde and drunken manner." The second of the statutes referred to above subjected brewers to a penalty of six shillings and eightpence for 165 every barrel of ale supplied to "Alehouse keepers and Tipplers not licensed," and required the Churchwardens and Overseers to employ half the penalty (one half being awarded to the informer) in the relief of the poor. Another measure passed a few years later (1607-8) for "Repressinge the odious and loathsome synne of Drunkenness" recites some of the evils of excessive drinking:— Whereas the loathsome and odyous Synne of Drunkenness is of late growen into Common use being the roote and foundacion of many other [enormious] synnes as Bloodshed, Stabbinge, Murder, Swearinge, Fornication, Adulterye and such like Be it enacted That all and every persons which after fortie dayes shall be drunk and shall be lawfullie convicted, shall, for every such offence forfeit and lose Fyve shillings . . to be paid within one weeke to the Handes of the Churchwardens of that Parish who shall be accomptable therefore to the use of the Poore of the same Parishe. And if the person so convicted shall neglect to paye Then the same shall be from tyme to tyme levyed of the Goods by Warrant and if the offender be not able to paye then he shalbe comytted to the Stocks to remaine by the space of Six Howers. For neglecting the "due correccion of offenders" contables were rendered liable to a penalty of ten shillings, to be paid to the Churchwardens for the relief of the poor. An Order in Council, bearing date 31st January 1639-40, was directed to the Justices of Westminster requiring them to suppress at once "a tavern" at a private house in King Street, "the City of Westminster being already pestered by a multitude of taverns"; and the Magistrates were enjoined not to permit any more taverns to be opened within their jurisdiction. The Vestry passed a resolution on 6th July, 1670:— That the present Churchwardens doe make what progresse they can in discovering how and howmanie Wine Licenses have usually been formerly Granted by the Cittie of Westmr and make Report from time to time of their proceedings therein. The machinery of the law fell short of the requirements, 166 however, for in 1750 the Vestry resolved to address Parliament with a view to further restraints being applied:— 5th March, 1750. Resolved That a petition be presented to the Honourable House of Commons to restrain the excessive use of Spirituous Liquors and a petition being prepared read and agreed to was Ordered to be Engrossed and Subscribed to be presented accordingly, of which petitn the following is a Copy. To the Honourable the Commons of Great Britain in Parliament Assembled. The humble petition of the Minister, Churchwardens, Vestrymen and Inhabitants of the parish of St. Margaret Westminster whose Names are hereunto subscribed on behalf of themselves and other the Inhabitants of the said parish. Humbly Sheweth That your petitioners with the deepest Concern have for some years past observed the Common Habitual and Excessive Use of Spirituous Liquors Avhich prevails amongst the lower Rank of people to the great Scandall and reproach of our Religion and Civil polity, and to the destruction of the health and strength of those poor of both Sexes which were they debarrd from such pernicious Liquors might be Industrious and usefull Subjects: but by the frequent use of these Intoxicating Spirits their Constitutions are destroyed and they are disabled from getting an honest Livelyhood and from thence arises as Your Petitionrs have the strongest reason to believe those frequent Robberies and Murders which have of late been so common in and about the Streets, Your petitrs seeing these Melancholy and deplorable Effects with numberless other Greivous disorders and apprehending more fatal Consequences if an immediate stop is not put to the Common use of these Spirits Humbly hope that this House will take the Premses into consideration and do therein as to their great wisdom shall seem meet. Hackney Coaches. And your Petitioners shall ever pray &c. The plying of hackney coaches for public hire was regulated by statute of Charles II (1660)' whereby Commissioners were to be appointed under the Great Seal for the purpose of licensing such carriages, not to exceed four hundred in number. No horse was to be used for any such conveyance under the size of fourteen hands, every coach was to bear a distinctive figure foridentification in case of complaint, and priority was to be given, in granting licenses, to ancient coachmen or their 167 widows. If the Commissioners licensed more than four hundred coaches they were each to be liable to a penalty of £100. The rates of hire were controlled by the same authority, within the limit of 10s. per day, or 1s. 6d. for the first hour, and 1s. per hour afterwards, with shilling fares between certain specified places. A duty of five pounds per annum was payable by the owner of each coach, which duty, with the fines levied under the recited provisions, were to be paid to the Commissioners for the repair of the highways. Shortly after (in 1680) the Vestry were allowed a voice in the nomination of the Commissioners of Hackney Coaches, the opportunity being then taken of offering some suggestions for the amendment of the law: Sunday, 12th Dear., 1680. That Sr Wm Waller Sr John Cutler with ye Steward & High Burgesses for the time being be nominated Commrs in St. Margarts Westmr for Regulating Hackney Coaches. Clauses to be inserted in ye Act of Parliament for regulateing Hackney Coaches Vizt. A Clause for Distreyening for ye Highwaies. A Clause to widen the passages at the Gate House prison at ye New Palace Yard & the Olde Gate House prison at the Easte End of Tuttle Streete. A Clause that no person shall be capable of electing Members of Parliament but such as paye to ye Church & Poore. Politics and Parliamentary Representation. The spirit of zealous patriotism which fired the heart of every Englishman at the time of the threatened invasion by the Spanish Armada, took practical form in Westminster. The under-written is copied from the Vestry minute book of 1588:— A note of money received by the churchwardens to the payment of robt carre, High constable, for money wh he laid out about the setting forth Soldiers, Received first of Mr. Ffyscher which remayned in his hands iijl. xijs. vjd.

When the clouds of troubles from within began to gather, the public spirit of the Vestry contributed to the local defence from the contents of the indispensable "black chest":— Att a Vestrie holden the 28th day of October 1642. It is ordered that Leonard Braford and William Mason the present Churchwardens of the parish of St. Margarett in Westr shall have lente unto them the summe of ffiftie pounds out of the hospitall money remayning in the black chest To be by the said Churchwardens for the building of Courts of guard and other worke and ffortificacons in and about this Towne for the safety hereof in theise times of dainger untill an Assessment may be made upon the Inhabitants to defray that charge and then that ffiftie pounds is to be repaid. The fervour with which the Restoration was welcomed is indicated in the resolution here transcribed:— 3rd Oct 1660. It is Ordered and Mr. Edmund Waters Mr. Phillipp Lilly the present Churchwardens are in an especiall manner desired (soe soone as ever money comes to their hands) that they prepare the Kings Mats Armes to be richly Carved made and gilded after the best manner that can bee invented and with as much grace as may bee to bee sett up in the parish Church of St. Margaretts Westminster and to bee as faire and beautifull in everie respect as the Kings Armes are sett up in any Church in and about the Cittie of London. And the said Churchwardens are desired to use their best endeavours speedily to putt the worke in hande soe soone as money can be raised for that purpose. The carved medallion referred to in this resolution now 169 adorns the Vestry Room of the Church. The excellence of the carving and gilding so completely shaded the painted arms that they were removed to the New Chapel in the Broadway:— 29th May, 1661. It is Ordered that the Kings Armes wch are painted and lately stood in the Chancell over the Communion Table in a frame shall be given to Sr William Plaiters to be disposed of as hee pleaseth. [A side note. "Which said Armcs Sr William Plaiters hath disposed of to the use of the new Chappell." As the storage of weapons was found to be inconvenient an Order was passed:— Thursday, 31st Oct., 1667 That all the Arms both Offensive and Defensive And also all the Watch Matrs now remaining in the Dark Vestry be for the better Preservation thereof Removed thence unto the House Newly Erected in the Artillery Ground in Tuttle ffields. Remarkable activity and unanimity prevailed at times in the Vestry on political questions, and in the support given in their collective capacity to candidates for election as Members of Parliament for the Borough. The City and Liberty of Westminster was created a Borough, to return two Members, in 1 Edward VI., before the system introduced by the later Plantagenets of creating new boroughs, and controlling the elections therein to the advancement of their own ends, had fallen into disuse. "There is much reason to conclude that the councillors of the King in erecting new boroughs acted upon a deliberate plan of strengthening their influence among the Commons, whose weight was now so advancing as to cause the Court great anxiety to obtain favourable elections."* In one short reign in the fourteenth century, twenty-two seats were created or restored, seven in Cornwall, and others in insignificant places. In Mary's reign of live years (1553-8) fourteen more were added, and the same course was pursued by Elizabeth's advisers. The object with which these *Hallam, Constitutional History, Vol. I., p. 60. 170 additional seats were assigned is conclusively shown by the direct and avowed interference by the Government, from time to time, with the elections. A letter of Edward to all the Sheriffs is preserved, in which he commands them to give notice to all freeholders, citizens and burgesses within their respective counties, "that where the privy council should recommend men of learning and wisdom in such case their directions be regarded and followed." Several persons so recommended were elected, all of whom belonged to the Court or were in places of trust about the King. The prevalence of these conditions renders the course taken by the Vestry less surprising. A few extracts have been made from the minute books as illustrative of the manner in which the business was transacted:— Sunday 17th Augst 1679. A letter from ye Vestry Men of St. Martine in the ffeilds was this day Read Vizt. At a Vestry of St. Martine in ye ffeilds 21st July, 1679.

The Rt Honble Charles Lord Cavendish* & Wm Clayton* Esq. were introduced into the Vestry and offered their Service as Candidates at ye Ensuing Election of Members to represent this City and Liberty in Parliament. 8th October, 1733. The Right Honble. Sir Charles Wager* and the Right Honble William Clayton Esq. were introduced into the Vestry and offered their service as Candidates at the ensuing Election of Members to represent this City and Liberty in Parliament which Ibis Vestrie did Unanimously accept and Approve of and promised to use their Interest to promote the Election of those Gentlemen. 27th March, 1734. Ordd That the Clerk of this Vestry do forthwith Issue out Summonses to the Gentlemen of this Vestry to request them to meet at the Sun Tavern in King Street, Westmr at two of the Clock to Morrow being Thursday to dine together and to appear and support the Interest of Sr Charles Wager and Mr. Clayton* who have offerd their Services at a former Vestry to represent this City and Liberty in the Ensuing Parliament a General Meeting having been Advertised. May 1, 1741. Ordered that the thanks of this Vestry be given to the Rt Honble the Lord Sundon and the Rt Honble Sr Chas. Wager for the many good services they have done this parish as well in Parliament as otherwise and the Churchwardens are desired to wait on their Honours and acquaint them therewith. Resolved unanimously that this Vestry will support the interest of the said Rt Honble the Lord Sundon* and the Right Honble Sr Charles Wager* who have offered themselves as candidates to represent this City and Liberty in the ensuing Parliament In which resolution they desire the concurrence of all the other inhabitants of this parish, and that they would meet them at Nine of the Clock tomorrow morning in St. Margaret's Church Yard, in order to attend those candidates to the place of Election. Ordd That 2000 of the above resolution be forthwith printed and distributed amongst the inhabitants of this parish. Ordd that the several Bedels of this Parish have orders to attend in their proper Livery in St. Margaret's Church Yd to morrow morning at Nine o'clock to receive the directions of this Vestry. * Elected. 173 Similar resolutions were passed in favour of Lord Trentham and Sir Peter Warren in 1747, when the last named gentleman was returned with Col. Cornwallis as his colleague. In 1753-4, upon the decease of Sir Peter Warren, Col. Cornwallis secured the support of the Vestry, and was elected. Alarmed at the defeat of the Royal troops in the north, or stimulated by the telling action of Lord Orford, a member of the Vestry, in the House of Lords, by which the sluggish pulse of both Houses of Parliament was quickened, the Vestry appointed a Committee "for discussing some special matters for the service of his Majesty and the public in general." The merchants of London had undertaken, at a crisis in which "the fate of England hung suspended on the winds and waves," to raise £250,000 for the national defence. In this the Vestry appear to have co-operated with fervour, as evinced by their Committee's report, and the action thereon:— 21st November, 1745. This Committee taking into consideration the planns pursued within this Kingdom, for the immediate support and defence of his Majesty against the Rebels & for the preservation of the publick peace; are unanimously of opinion that books shd be forthwith open'd for a Voluntary Subscription within this Parish for raising a sum of money to be employed as shall be thought most proper by a Majority of the Subscribers who shall subscribe the sum of £5, or more. Five days later a Committee was appointed to wait upon the Middlesex and Westminster Association. This interview was obtained forthwith, and in three days a paper was received from the Association and read to the Vestry:— Nov. 29, 1745. Middlesex and Westr Association. At a meeting of the General Committee the 26 Novr 1745. Agreed and Resolved—That in the several Parishes within the Bills of Mortality to which Subscription Books are sent three or more subscribers of Five pounds or upwards may be if they please a Sub Committee to manage and transact the buisness of Inlisting Men in his Majesty's Land-forces . . in such manner . . as they think fit. * * * * N .B.—The men to be Inlisted are to be above seventeen and under forty five years of Age, and at least five feet five inches in 174 height, to serve for six months from the time of Inlisting and until the present Rebellion shall be entirely suppressed and extinguished, at the time of inlisting to bring a creditable person to vouch for their good characters. A sum not exceeding Five pounds to be paid to every Man as Bounty Money. Any man above five feet six inches high to be assigned to the Guards. This proposal was unanimously approved and put forthwith into execution by the Vestry. In 1761 the excitement of an election again prevailed. Sat. 21 Mch., 1761. The Honble Lord Viscount Poultney and Lieut Gen1 Cornwallis were introduced (by Sir John Crosse Bart) to this Vestry and offered themselves as joint Candidates to represent the City and Liberty of Westminster in the next Parliament and desired the Votes and Interest of the Members of this Vestry. Resolved unanimously That this Vestry will support the Interest of the said Candidates to Represent the City and Liberty of Westminster in Parliament. Both these candidates having been returned:— Fri., 4 Dec., 1761. The Churchwardens acquainted this Vestry that the Honble Lord Pulteney and Lieut. Gen1 Cornwallis had generously offered the sum of Fifty Pounds between this Parish & the Parish of St. John the Evangelist to be disposed of in such manner as the Vestries should think fit. A new pulpit cloth of scarlet velvet ornamented with gold lace was shortly afterwards provided by vote of the Vestry in St. Margaret's Church. Viscount Pulteney died in 1763, in consequence of which the suffrages of the Vestry were solicited by, and unanimously accorded to Lord Warkworth "to the satisfaction of all parties ":— Mon. 2 May, 1763. The Churchwardens acqxminted this Vestry that the Right Honble the Earl of Northumberland having been pleased to give One hundred Pounds to be expended in the Parishes of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist Westminster upon account of the Election of Lord Warkworth, and there having only been Expended out of the same the Sum of £44 13s. 10d. the remaining Sum of .£55 6s. 2d. his Lordship has been pleased to give as his Free Gift to the Parishes of St. Margaret and St John the Evangelist Westminster to be 175 disposed of in such manner as the Vestries of the said Parishes shall think proper, and they further acquainted this Vestry that they had reserved two-thirds of the said monies for the use of this Parish and had paid one third part thereof to the Churchwardens of St. John's for the use of that Parish being the usual and accustomed proportion. Resolved that the money allotted for this Parish be applied towards the Painting the Figures of St. Peter and St. Paul in the Niches on each side the Altar of this Church; in Imitation of Statuary, and that the same be Executed by Mr. Cassali.* Resolved that the respectfull and sincere Thanks of this Vestry be, and they are hereby given to Lord Northumberland for his said Generous Gift to this Parish, and that his Lordship be acquainted herewith, and also of the manner in which this Vestry have Ordered the said Monies to be applied. The example set by his Grace was followed by Lord Warkworth, who presented the Vestry with "a generous benefaction of Fifty Pounds to be distributed amongst poor housekeepers of this parish not receiving alms who shall appear to be proper objects,"which the Vestry acknowledged with unanimous thanks. During the next thirty years, on every occurrence of a vacancy in the representation in Westminster, the Vestry were appealed to in the manner indicated by the foregoing, though the sequacious "generosity and benevolence" are not so regularly exhibited. An agitation for a change in the constitution due, as Mr. Pitt asserted, to "the effervescence which the principles of anarchy in France had produced here," made considerable way in the House of Commons in 1792. Allegations were made that widespread corruption existed among the Boroughs in almost all parts of England and Scotland, and that certain Bills had been introduced by Ministers to the advancement of their personal interests. These statements help to elucidate the proceedings of the Vestry of Westminster, for among the many charges laid at the door of the Ministry was one of their having bribed one Thomas Smith, a publican of Westminster, to procure votes for Lord Hood, the * See Walcott's Memorials, p 105. 176 ministerial candidate. A motion for a Committee of the House to investigate the charge was defeated, but the debate is said to have turned the attention of the country on " the scandalous bribery going on in boroughs." In these circumstances the Vestry, by issuing 3000 handbills throughout the parish, invited the inhabitants to assemble at the Guildhall "to decide on the mode of proceeding necessary to be adopted in the present situation of public affairs." The sentiments of the parishioners may be gathered from the following:— Mon., 10 Deer. 1792. Mr. Churchill submitted to the Vestry the following Resolutions in Writing At a Meeting of the Inhabitants of the Parish of St. Margaret Westmr called by Public Advertisemt & held at Guildhall in the said Parish on the 11th December 1792 Sir George Jackson Bart M.P. in the Chair Declared That this Meeting do consider the form of Government by King Lords & Commons to be indispensibly essential, not only to the happiness and Prosperity, but to the Existence of the Country. That the Glorious Revolution in 1688 by sowisely establishing the Constitution, ought to command the Gratitude and support of every Englishman. Resolved That this meeting, feeling most forcibly the truth of the above Declaration, engage not only to aid to the utmost of their Power, the Civil Authority but by every other Exertion to endeavour to discover & defeat that mischievous Spirit of Sedition which has of late shewn itself in various Clubs and Publications wickedly attempting to alienate the affection of the People from their Sovereign, to impress on their Minds contempt of, and consequently disobedience to those Laws (without the influence of which they cannot expect either Happiness or Protection) & ultimately to affect the Subversion of our excellent Constitution. That the following Gentlemen be appointed a Committee with Power to increase their number; and to take such other Steps as may tend to carry into effect the resolution of this Meeting. (Then follows a list of over Fifty Gentlemen.) Parochial patriotism, was however, occasionally forestalled:— Fri. 16 Novr. 1793. This Vestry was convened To take into consideration the opening a Subscription for contributing towards 177 supplying the British Forces now serving in Flanders with Flannel. It having been suggested That by Contributions already made in various places Flannel Waist Coats and other Articles has been so liberally provided for the said Forces, that it was thought necessary to adjourn this Vestry 'till further Enquiry can be made respecting this Tract. Thurs., 21 Novr. 1793. The Vestry proceeded to take into further consideration the opening a Subscription . . And it appearing to be the General Sense of the Gentlemen present, that as many of the most considerable Inhabitants of this Parish have already contributed to the Subscriptions opened at the Crown and Anchor, and others have declared their Intentions so to do—the object of this Meeting will thereby be most effectually answered It was therefore Resolved that no further steps should be taken in this Business In 1796, and again in 1802, Vice Admiral Lord Gardner* attended before the Vestry as a candidate for Parliamentary honours, and received a promise of their individual and collective support. Peculiar solicitude was shown with respect to the candidature of Mr. Lamb, who was returned as the colleague of Sir Francis Burdett: — Wednesday, 17th Feb., 1819. The Honble Geo. Lamb attended to offer himself a Candidate to represent the City & Liberty of Westminster in Parliament & requested the support of this Vestry. It was Unanimously Resolved That this Vestry will support The Honble Geo. Lamb as a Candidate to represent the City and Liberty of Westminster in Parliament. Resolved also Unanimously that the most effectual means of carrying the above Resolution into effect will be by this Vestry giving their United & individual Assistance to the Committee already established at the Swan Tavern in support of Mr. Lamb's Election. Resolved also Unanimously that in order more effectually to assist the endeavours of the Vestry in promoting the measure of The Hon. Geo. Lamb in his Election for one of the Representatives for the City and Liberty of Westminster in Parliament the Collectors of the Poor Rates be desired to attend the Hustings with their Books during the Poll as a Check upon persons offering their suffrages who have no right thereto. The Vestry met specially on Friday, 23rd June, 1797, "to consider the propriety of forming a General Association for * Lord Gardner was returned. N 178 the protection of the parish." One of the best of the volunteer corps of the day was formed as the result of this meeting, under the title of "The Armed Association of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster." For five years this corps was personally supported by a numerous section of the loyal and patriotic inhabitants, liberal subscriptions being continued to the cost of its equipment and maintenance until 1803, when it was disbanded upon the improvement of the military defence by the Government and npon the fear of the Napoleonic invasion subsiding. While these fears prevailed, and national anxieties were increased by the rebellion in Ireland, the inhabitants extended their liberality to the defence of the country as unsparingly as to the protection of their parish. In 1798, when one of these collections was set on foot the enthusiasm of the parishioners was such as to necessitate a daily sitting of the Committee from eleven to three o'clock for the receipt of contributions. Evidence of the loyalty of Westminster is not limited to defensive combinations, such as the foregoing illustrate. In May, 1800, after the attempt to shoot the King in the Drury Lane Theatre, the Vestry called the inhabitants together " to congratulate his Majesty upon the late happy interposition of Divine Providence in his favour." At the meeting, which was presided over by Mr. Wilberforce, the following address was unanimously agreed to:— To the Kings most excellent Majesty. The Humble address of the Inhabitants, Householders of the United Parishes of Saint Margaret and St. John the Evangelist, Westminster. We your Majesty's most dutiful Subjects, feel ourselves invincibly called upon by the Desperate and traiterous attempt which has been lately made on Your Majestys Sacred Life, to renew the Assurance of our unalterable Loyalty and Attachment to your Majesty's Person and Government. The Bounty of Providence so often and so largely experienced by this Country has been in nothing more strikingly displayed than in these repeated Instances in which your Majesty has been rescued from various impending Evils, and a prolongation of Your Majesty's Reign vouchsafed to the Wishes and Prayers of your faithful subjects. 170 May your Majesty's valuable Life be long spared us and may every Effort of your Enemies serve only to illustrate more clearly the gracious Protection which Providence extends over you to prove on what firm Foundations Your Majesty's Throne is established and to animate the gratitude and quicken the affection of your free loyal and devoted People. The parishioners, called together by the Vestry, also passed a congratulatory address to the King on the termination of the war in May, 1802. The subjoined transcript suggests that the last named congratulations were somewhat premature:— Saturday, July, 1803. The Church Wardens convened the Vestries for the purpose of taking into Consideration the Act made and passed in this present Session of Parliament Intituled an Act to enable His Majesty more effectually to raise and assemble in England an additional Military Force, for the better Defence and Security of the United Kingdom and for the more vigorous Prosecution of the War which being read It was Resolved That these Yestrys feel deeply impressed with the importance and necessity of rendering every assistance in their power to the Government at this momentous crisis and in giving effect to the means proposed for the defence of the United Kingdom against the daring attempts of the Enemy to overturn the happy Constitution of the Country and the threatened invasion of its shores. Resolved therefore that a Meeting of the Inhabitants at a Vestry be convened on Thursday next at 10 o'clock precisely to take into consideration the propriety of raising the quota to be furnished by these parishes under the Act lately past for the better defence and security of the United Kingdom. The Churchwardens were subsequently requested to put the Act in force. The invocation of the aid of the Vestry was not limited to the military defence, although, with respect to the augmentation of the navy, the proceedings were divested of their voluntary and discretionary character:— The Church Wardens and Overseers laid before this meeting an order of the Justices in General Sessions assembled served on them by the High Constable of Westminster for the raising of Twenty Men for the service of the Navy on or before the 15th day of this Instant to be returned to the Justices in Petty Sessions at Guildhall in King Street, Westminster. The said Order and the Acts of Parliament were read. N 2 180 It was moved by John Groves Esq and seconded by John Fox Esq, That a Bounty of Twenty five Guineas be given to any Able Bodied Man to serve as a Volunteer in the Navy of Great Britain for these Parishes. On the question being put by the Chairman there appeared Ayes ... ... ... 38 Nos' ... ... ... 2 Resolved That Notice be given by Advertisement and Papers stuck up in the said Parishes signifying the Bounty offered by these Parishes for the raising the 20 Volunteers. And that the Church Wardens and Overseers be requested to meet in St. Margaret's Vestry Room from 9 to 4 o'clock in the afternoon until the 20 Volunteers are complete. At first sight the reader of the Vestry minutes Food Supply. would be led to enquire why the Vestry should have concerned themselves about the consumption of bread or flour or pastry for themselves or the inhabitants, or of corn for the horses in the parish. Allusion has already been made to the manner in which the Vestry initiated and supported repeated appeals to the householders for contributions towards the national and local defence. No murmur of complaint or note of dissatisfaction is traceable throughout all the records. Loud complaint and widespread dissatisfaction, nevertheless, prevailed not only on account of the fearful wars and prodigious expenditure into which the country had been plunged, with their attendant crushing taxation, but on account of the scarcity and high price of provisions. Monster meetings of distressed persons had been held—it is said that 50,000 were present at the gathering at Copenhagen Fields—at which the predominant cry was ''Bread!" His Majesty had been greeted on his State procession to open Parliament with clamorous shouts for "Peace!" and "Bread!" and, beneath the shadow of the parish Church of St. Margaret the King had narrowly escaped the shot of the assassin's gun. With these facts in their knowledge, the conduct of the Vestry, as shown in the ensuing extracts, is not surprising:— Monday 21 st March, 1796. Mr. Church Warden Smith reported from the Committee who waited on the Rt Honble the Lords of His Majesty's most Honorable Privy Council at their 181 ships Commands on Thursday last, that he with his Patrons Church Wardens Mr. John Abington, and Mr. Stephen Cossor together with Joseph Moser Esq, Mr. Bray and Mr. John Cartwright had Audience of the Council, Lord Hawksbury one of the Lords of the Council being in the Chair. Their Lordships lamented the high Price of Corn—produced a Plan from St. James's Parish which that Parish had adopted for the benefit of their Poor by selling them Bread at a lower price paying the difference out of the Poors Rate—submitted that the same Plan or some other should be adopted in these Parishes that they had sent this Plan to the City of London, who meant to adopt it; that Government had at present a Stock of Foreign Corn which they distribute to the Public moderately but that they expect no more and that therefore they would wish that the Gentlemen of these Vestries would not only use bread made of wheat and other mixture of Grain themselves, but Recommend the use thereof to the Inhabitants of these Parishes That there was a jealouscy in the Country People respecting the Farmers sending their Wheat and Flour to Town and they Eating Bread made of Barley and Rye consequently less Wheat would be sent to this Town. The Vestries taking into due Consideration the Report of the Committee of their Lordships Address to them. Resolved— That these United Parishes, from their local situation are at all times, more especially in time of war exposed to very great additional Parochial expenses, by the families of soldiers from all parts of the three Kingdoms, being unavoidably imposed upon them, many of whose parochial settlements cannot be ascertained, and those which are so, being at such a distance, either in Ireland, Scotland, or the farther parts of England, that the expense of passing them home exceeds the temporal inconveniency of maintaining them in Westminster. That the Poors Rates of these Parishes are therefore very burdensome to the Inhabitants. That great as they are, though economy has been used to its utmost extent, the Parishes have been obliged to Borrow a large Sum of Money for the extraordinary Expenses of last year, and shall be under a similar necessity of doing the same this year. That therefore the Vestries, though they anxiously wish as loyal subjects and philanthropic Members of Society, to do everything in their Power for the quiet of the State and the Relief of Indigence yet they conceive these Parishes unable to do what other Parishes, whose situations are less exposed can easily accomplish. That though the more opulent Inhabitants have generally followed in their respective Families the advice of their Lordships and 182 due and proper remonstrances have been given from the Pulpit, yet the poor and lower class of People have shown no disposition of submitting to the alteration in the mixture of Bread. That the Vestries humbly conceive that unless a positive Law is passed to prevent the making of any other but mixed Bread, no remedy in these Parishes will prove effectual. That a Copy of these Resolutions be signed by the Vestry Clerk and transmitted to the Right Honorable the Lords of His Majesty's most Honble Privy Council. Friday, 11th December, 1800.—These Vestries were summoned for the purpose of taking into consideration His Majesty's most Gracious Proclamation when the following Resolutions were unanimously agreed to viz.:— That our best Endeavours shall be exerted towards carrying into full and immediate effect the salutory injunctions contained in His Majesty's most gracious Proclamation. We do therefore in conformity thereto hereby agree that we will at the utmost, restrict the consumption of Bread in our respective Families to two thirds of the quantity consumed in ordinary times, and that we will in no case suffer the same to exceed One Quartern Loaf for each Person in each week. That we will abstain from the Use of Pastry and will carefully restrict the Use of Flour in all other Articles than Bread. That we will adopt and promote, to the utmost of our power, the use of Substitutes for Wheaten Bread and a strict Economy in the consumption of every Article of Subsistence. That we will confine the allowance of Oats for Horses to five Pecks at the utmost per Week for each Horse and reduce it as far below as circumstances will admit. That these Resolutions shall continue in force until the first day of October One thousand Eight hundred and one. That the above Resolutions be made public by Advertisements in the Newspapers and be circulated throughout the Parishes, and that they be left in Saint Margaret's Vestry Room for Signature of such of the Inhabitants as may be disposed to subscribe thereto from Eleven O'clock in the Morning until two in the Afternoon. A chapter might be devoted to the history of Fields! Tothill Fields—a history by no means void of interest. The establishment of markets and fairs six hundred years ago, the sports, the duels, the maze, the Volunteer Reviews (14,000 of the trained band were drawn out in the Fields in 1651), the royal entertainments, the interment of the victims of the great plague, the 183 ing ground, the highwaymen's exploits, besides numerous other topics would form the subject of an engaging essay. But the present contracted notes must be confined to the proceedings of the Vestry. Among the earlier references to the locality is the erection of a hospital for the isolation, as was intended, of those suffering from the plague:— 14th July, 1665. That the Churchwardens doe forthwith proceed to the making of an Additional provision for the Reception of the poore Visited of the Plague at the Pest House in Tuttle ffeildes. And that they doe Treatewith & agree with such workemen for performing the same as they shall thinke fitt. And that they Defrey the Charge thereof out of such Moneys as they already have in their Hands or hereafter shall receive for that purpose by Order of the Vestry or otherwaies. Another entry recalls the residence of Cromwell and some of his relatives in Westminster, the family of the " Ffalconbergs " being related to him by marriage:— 17 Nov. 1674. Upon the application of Mr Edward Ffalconberg and Mr Edmund Woodruffe, in behalfe of the Archers, Clameing a Right in the Shooteing house in Tuttle ffields It is thought fitt that (for the future) the Churchwardens for the time being doe alwaies at the Letting of the said house Reserve liberty for the Archers to make use of the Chamber there. Claims were again and again preferred by the Dean and Chapter to the ownership of the land, yet the Vestry's title was established as to some small part of it:— 8 May 1667. That it be Referred unto the Churchwardens to take care that the Shooting house in Tuttle ffeilds being parte of the Estate of Mr John Allen late deceased be disposed off to the best Advantayge as being a Legacy by him left to this Parish. 6 July 1667. That the present Churchwardens Doe Contract for and byin the Lease of the House in Tuttle ffeilds (called the Shooting House) for the use of this parish at the most Easie Rates they can p'cure it for And what they doe pay for the same shall be allowed them at the passing of their Acc1 20 May, 1668. That the Churchwardens Doe Allow unto the present tenant in the House commonly called the Shooting House in Tuttle Feilds the Sume of 40s out of his Rent Towards the makeing of a Payre of New Butts and Keeping them in Repayre which sd 40s shall be allowed at the passeing of the Churchwardens Acct In 1696 the Dean and Chapter revived their claims to the freehold. A committee, consisting of Mr. "Justice 184 Railton," Mr. Hugh Squier, Mr. John Parker. Mr. Charles Rampayne, and others were directed to investigate the claim, and to search the ancient deeds and records relating to the title ; but as the Vestry, in 1701-1704 sanctioned the erection of Mrs. Kifford's almshouses for poor Gentlewomen on the land, the Dean and Chapter were not yet successful. All persons who did not convey stable refuse, &c., on to the land were charged 9d. per load for the soil removed by them, in 1705, and the Churchwardens were instructed to prosecute all persons conveying sand away from the Fields. The plough was brought into requisition to aid in maintaining the title of the parish:— Nov. 1, 1754.—The Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that they had caused the Buildings in Tothil Common which were built at the charge of this Parish in the time of the Plague in King Charles the 2nd Reign for Pest-Houses & the ground & trees before the same to be plowed round in order to maintain this parishes claim & right therein. Resolved that this Vestry do approve thereof & that the thanks of this Vestry be given to the Churchwardens for their care in preserving the rights of this parish. The title was put to the test by the Dean and Chapter enclosing portions of the land and letting the same for building purposes, whereupon the Vestry directed the Churchwardens, with such assistance as they might find necessary, to demolish the fence and put "a man in possession" on behalf of the parish. An action for trespass was brought against the Churchwardens and others who took part in the demolition, and the decision was against the Vestry with the exception of certain small plots. In 1803 the Armed Association of St. Margaret and St. John, or the King's Westminster Volunteers, were readily accorded the use of the fields and butts for ball-cartridge practice. In 1825 a Bill was promoted for the creation of a Board of Trustees to control the repair, cleansing, and lighting of the streets, with power to levy rates and to erect barriers at the ends of the streets forming approaches to the estates. 185 The last named provision was struck out of the bill, to which the Royal Assent was ultimately given, and which remained operative until superseded by the Metropolis Management Act of 1855. Knightsbridge. Allusion has been made in Part I. to the early condition of the Hamlet of Knightsbridge. Little can be gleaned from the parish books to indicate any development or increase in the number of houses between the date of the Reformation and the end of the seventeenth century. Then it was that William III purchased of the Earl of Nottingham the mansion subsequently enlarged by Sir Christopher Wren and known as Kensington Palace. The establishment of the Royal residence gradually attracted the attention of some few of the nobility to the locality, and led to the erection of houses according to their individual tastes and requirements ; but besides the construction of the Barracks in 1795, and the foundation of the Floor Cloth manufactory, the number of buildings increased very slowly until the present century ; indeed the march of improvement in Knightsbridge, as elsewhere, has only made great strides in recent years. Within the recollection of many who would reluctantly consent to be called old, the stream of the Westbourne was an open brook, the paving and lighting of the place had scarcely been taken in hand, and the eye still welcomed the haAvthorn hedge as recently as 1844. Maintenance of the highways. The high road which led through Knights, bridge towards Kensington was two centuries ago very badly kept and maintained, both as regards its repair and the security of those who passed along it.* Ascribing the detective state of the footway to the flowing of water from the Queen's estate, the Vestry adopted the following petition in 1712:— To the Rt Honblc Robert Earl of Orford & Earl Mortimer, Lord High Trearer of Great Britain. *Walford, Vol. v. p. 17. 186 The Humble Memorial of the Churchwardens & their Ancient Inhabitants of the Parish of St. Margaret Westminster. Sheweth That the Footway leading from Knightsbridge to her Mat. house at Kensington is so very much damaged & Impaired Occasioned by severall Springs arising in Hide Park, which for want of Drains to carry the same of does greatly undamage the wall which separates Hide Park from the said Footway, and hath likewise rendered the same Footway impassable, And Irrepairable if not timely prevented. May it therefore please your Lop to give such directions to the Master of her Maties Works to make such Drains as shall be thought convenient for carrying of the same.

WM. LOWNDES, Refd to Sr Christr Wren Kt & other Parish of St. Margtts Westm Officers of Works. A Copy. The Originall Memorial was by Mr. Richd Filer & Mr. Mich1 Farmer Churchwardns & Mr. Arguis Delivered to the Honble Wm. Lowndes, Esqre in order to be delivered to ye most HonbIe ye Ld High Treasr of Great Britain. In a letter dated 27th November, 1736, Lord Hervy wrote:—"The road between this place (Kensington) and London is grown so infamously bad that we live here in the same solitude we should do if cast on a rock in the middle of the ocean, and all the Londoners tell us there is between them and us a great impassable gulf of mud." The repair of the bridge over the Westbourne was carried out jointly between the authorities of the Parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields and the Vestry of Westminster:— Thursday, 10th April, 1684.—Ordered that the Churchwardens do cause that part of Knightsbridge belonging to this parish to be repaired and putt in the same condicon with the other part of the said Bridge belonging to St. Martin's parish. On an application being made by Mr. Lowndes iu 1735 187 for permission to "to take down part of ye bridge at Knightsbridge belonging to this parish in order to open and make the way more commodious before some new built houses belonging to him near the said bridge," a Committee was instructed to view the locality and report. Their report was as under :— 9th April, 1736.—We whose Names are hereunder Subscribed being of the Committee appointed for the purpose aforesaid Having this day (being attended by Mr. William Tufnell the Parish Bricklayer agreeable to the said Order) taken a View of the said Bridge Do Report it as our Opinion that the Alteration proposed, which is the taking down about thirteen feet of the said Bridge Westward, will not in any way indamage or Weaken the said Bridge, and your Committee having caused Mr. Tufnell to Value the Brickwork & Stone Coping of so much of the Bridge proposed to be pulled down together with the Oak posts and Rails hath Estimated the same at the Sume of Five Pounds All which is Submitted to the Vestry under our hands this 26th of March 1736. ****** And Mr. Lowndes having proposed to pay the Church Wardens Two Guineas for the use of the parish to be Excused from taking the Materials at the Price Estimated. Ordd That upon Payment of Two Guineas the Parapet Walls to be taken down to the levell of the Footway and that the Churchwardens do either dispose of the Old Materials or secure them for the use of the parish but that the two Outside Posts which were placed for the defence of the parapets be left standing to defend the footway. Owing in all probability to increasing traffic between London and the south-west by heavy coaches and waggons, this bridge was often out of repair:— Thurs 6 Mch 1766. The Churchwardens acquainted the Vestry that part of the Bridge at Knightsbridge which is in this Parish is out of Repair Resolved that the Churchwardens be desired to cause the same to be Repaired at the expense of this Parish Tuesday, 8th November, 1774. Resolved that the Churchwardens of this Parish, Mr. James Eves, and Mr. Thomas Hatch be and they are hereby appointed a Committee to meet the Gentlemen of the Parish of St. George, Hanover Square, in Order to take a Survey of the Bridge at Knightsbridge, the Commissioners of the Kensington Turnpikes having signified to the said Parishes that the said Bridge is Defective, and that the said Committee be desired to Report their opinion at the next Vestry. 188 Local Provisions. Were it not necessary to adhere consistently to the rule already observed as to references to the Churchwardens' Accounts and the Overseers' Books, very curious and interesting proofs might be adduced of the close affinity between the parish of St. Margaret and the hamlet. The Lazar House or Hospital, which was rebuilt in 4 Charles I (1629), with its chapel attached received considerable support from the parishioners, and from grants voted by the Vestry, and obtained its supply of water by underground pipes communicating with the conduit in Hyde Park, [a privilege granted by letters of James I. Many entries occur in the minutes, which seem to imply that the number of "lame and impotent folk" seeking the benefits of the Lazar House was considerable. Here is a specimen:— Sunday, 24th April, 1687. Ordered that the Churchwardens doe paye to the constable and beadle at Knightsbridge their Bills for passing cripples, they making oath to the truth of their accounts. A cage, watchhouse, stocks, and pound stood at the east end of the Green in the Brompton road, fronting the site now occupied by Messrs. Tattersall's establishment. These corrective institutions, which were probably called into existence by the periodical fair and market from preReformation times, were a source of some anxiety to the Vestry:— 4th March, 1668. Upon Reading A Petition of Thomas Hawly Const: of Knightsbridge directed to his Matics Justices of the peace at A Session for the peace and the Order of the Justices thereupon touching the Repayring of the Cage and Stocks at Knightsbridge aforesed The Vestry are of opinion That ye Churchwns of this parish are not concerned therein butt are desired to apply themselves unto ye Rt Honbl ye Ld Chamberlayn High Steward and Mr Bennett High Bayliffe of the Citty and Liberty of Westmr concerning ye same And in Case noe Redresse can be had by that way then to apply themselves to his Matics Justices of ye Peace at their next Session and pray them that ye Charge of that worke may not be layd upon this parish but upon such as of Right ought to doe ye same. 1st March, 1670. The Churchwardens haveing this day Reported (viva voce) That there is a necessity of Repayring the Cage or 189 Bound house at Knights Bridge for avoydeing the Charge and trouble of Lodging of such as are to be passed away It is thought fitt and Ordered That the Churchwardens doe cause the sayd Cage or Bound house to be Bepayred for this time until they can speake with ye Ld High Steward of Westmr or Head Bayliffe Concerning ye same. And the Charge thereof shall be allowed at ye passing of their Accompt. Thursday, 11 Nov., 1708. Ordered that it be referred to the Church wardens to repaire the .... cage at Knightsbridge and the charge thereof shall be allowed on their account. 18th Nov., 1698. Ordered that the Churchwardens doe pay the constables of Knightsbridge account for straw for the cage. Watchmen, constables, deputy constables, and beadles were assigned to the hamlet under similar circumstances to those already narrated in reference to the mother parish. Orders for the beadles' distinctive attire repeatedly occur in the minutes, in the following form:— Wednesday, 7th May, 1690. Ordered that the Churchwardens doe provide and give a Blew Coat to the Beadle of Knightsbridge. The method of appointing these functionaries is thus recorded:— Tuesday, 5th February, 1788. Resolved that Mr. Altham Corbett, late Beadle of the Hamlett of Knightsbridge, be allowed his Coat and Hat, and also his salary to Lady-day next. Resolved That the Person who may happen to be chosen Beadle of the Hamlet of Knightsbridge in the room of Altham Corbett, shall allow to the said Altham Corbett during his Life, one guinea per quarter out of his Salary, and that he do the Duty 'till Lady-day next without any Salary. The following Persons attended the Vestry and applied to be admitted to the said Office of Beadle of the Hamlet of Knightsbridge— Peter Packard John Smith John Taylor Joseph Nibloe Besolved unanimously That Mr. Peter Packard be and is hereby appointed and chosen Beadle of the Hamlet of Knightsbridge in the parish of Saint Margaret, Westminster, in the room of Altham Corbett, Resigned. Proposal to surrender the Hamlet. At a full assembly of the Vestry on Sunday, 18th November, 1711, a resolution was passed:— That Mr Thomas Wisdome & Mr Thos Yeomanes be desired to 190 goe to Mr Elridge Clerk of the Vestry of St. Martin's in the Feilds in order to treat with some of the Gents of the Vestry belonging to the said Parish relating to the Neathouses being taken into this Parish of St. Margtt Westmr & to Offer them in Leiw thereof the Hamlett of Knightsbridge within this Parish. Sheds for "cattle of the ox kind" were in existence in various parts on the outskirts of London at this time, and were known locally by the appellation of "Neat houses;" but it is not easy, at first sight, to fix the exact position of these houses in St. Martin's parish. From the description given by Mr Walcott (p. 338), who quotes Stow as his authority, the Neat houses in this outlying quarter of Westminster, consisted of " a parcel of houses mostly seated on the banks of the Thames and inhabited by gardeners." This reference being given in connection with the notice of Millbank Street and the vicinity, implies that the houses and surrounding gardens were in the parish of St. Margaret. It is obvious, however, from the entry above quoted, that " the parcel of houses " were beyond the limits of the ancient parish. To solve the problem it must be borne in mind that the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, originally taken from St. Margaret's parish, extended along the line now known as the King's Scholars' Pond Sewer, to the river side, from a point just to the west of the present Vauxhall Bridge to the junction with Chelsea, and passed northwards again along the line of the Westbourne River, now the Ranelagh Sewer, until the area was assigned to the parish of St. George, Hanover Square upon its foundation in 1725. A quotation by Peter Cuningham from the accounts of the Overseers of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, affords some confirmation of this :— The xiijth daie of Maie 1621 To the iiij bearers for bringing the drownd woman from the Thames near the Neate House ... ... ... ... ... ... ... iiijrf. Hatton, in his New View of London, 1708, says "the Parish of St. Martin extended to the Thames near Chelsea." Mr. T. C. Noble points out that Strype, p. 78-80, quoting the 191 Burghley papers, describes the Lammas lands of St. Martin's and St. Margaret's parishes as being enclosed in Elizabeth's time, and refers to "the Neat" as comprising 108 acres. The same gentleman adds that Burghley, High Steward of Westminster in 1592, ordered a special enquiry, but about forty inhabitants of both parishes with spades and pickaxes had meanwhile broken down the fence, Mr. Cole, the High Constable for Westminster, who " led the way from field to field with a written roll in his hand " being among those who thus forcibly asserted their rights. At the commencement of the last century "the Neat" of 108 acres was leased by Linde and Turner, who kept the same enclosed, converting it into pasture, and planting new hedges, whereas "the most part thereof ought to be common, and hath been usually common at Lammas until within these nineteen years." In Horwood's map of London, published about 1819, the Neat Houses and "Neat House Gardens" are clearly marked as covering the area lying between the King's Scholars' Pond Sewer, which divides the parish of St. John the Evangelist from that of St. George, Hanover Square, and the Millbank Distillery, and between the river and "Willow Walk," comprising the site of the present St. George's Square, part of St. George's Road and Belgrave Road, with some of the streets by which they are Intersected. The area of the Hamlet of Knightsbridge was 384 acres—more than three times that of the Neat Houses and Gardens—which may account for the proposed exchange not having been effected. In any case the reasons which guided the Vestry to that end are left to be inferred, for no further entry on the subject appears in the minutes of the Vestry. Miscellaneous Matters. A few examples, taken quite at random, of the diversity of subjects to which the Vestry directed their attention, are all that can be given. These are so varied as to forbid any attempt at arrangement or classification. 192 Trustees, Administrators and Guardians. The first transcript, under the head of 'miscellaneous,' implies that a surplus existed in the local exchequer, and that the Vestry were able to obtain a high rate of interest:— 24th March, 1647.—It is ordered that the five hundred and fiftie pounds wch was paide in by mr. Smith for Turnmill Street rents shalbe lent to Mr Rich Willis Mr Henry Willis Clerke and Rich yeoward upon theyr Recognisance of 1000 : deferanced for payment of the 550 li with interest at 8 p. cente for six monthes. Evidence of the confidence enjoyed by the Vestry, as trustees of private moneys, is borne by the following:— 12th April, 1647.—Ordered that threescore pounds left by Thomas Jordan deceased to the disposing of this Yestrie for the use of his children shalbee lent upon interest for sixe monethes to mr. Michaell Arnold and his sonne upon their bond wh. bond shalbee taken in the name of Mr Robert Mawer one of the Churchwardens of this parish. At a Vestery holden the 16th daye of April 1649 it is ordered that 60 li being monyes intrusted by Thomas Jordayne for the good of his children and 80 li being intrusted for Mrs Ray alias Roper shalbe lent unto William Dodson upon his and Mr William Styles theyr securities. The Yestry were recognised as administrators to the goods and chattels of intestate persons:— Att a Vestry held this xijth day of June 1652. Ordered that Mr. Emery Hill and Capt Willm Greeve the present Churchwardens of this Parish doe take out Lres of Administration of the goods and Chattels of John Galloway Butcher (who lately died suddainely intestate) to the use of his three Children John William and Richard ; And that the said Churchwardens doe deliver an inventory of his estate as they shall finde the same and doe dispose of the said children and estate as they in theyre discretions shall thinke fitt And doe make and give a pticuler Accompte of the said estate from Churchwardens to Churchwardens successively untill the said children shall attaine theyre severall ages of one and Twenty years and then to pay the same respectively unto the said Children or the survivors or survivor of them as the Vestrey and they shall thinke fitt. Another extract affords an insight into the provision made for the education of the parish children, as also into the salaries of the teachers of the day:— Sunday, the 18th day of Dec. 1681. The Peticon of Thomas Jordan 193 praying that he may be settled and continued in the Imployment of instructing the parish Poore Children being this day read was laid aside (It being the opinion of this Vestry that he is not capable of performing that undertaking as it ought to be done) And upon his further Application complayning of his poverty having ffour Small Children and an Impotent sister lying on his Hands The Vestry have thought fitt & do Accordingly Order that the said Thomas Jordan shall be relieved and have halfe a Chaldren of Coles of the stock for this yeare (he having already had one Half Chaldren of the said stock) and 2s. per weeke towards the support of his said Family Provided his said Sister doe not become chargeable to the Parish And at the same time Judith Smith wife of Thomas Smith was presented as a fitt person to undertake the Teaching of the said Poore Children which was accordingly conferred upon her And she to receive for her Care and Pains therein halfe a Chaldren of Coles (being the remainder of the Stock for this yeare) and all the moneys of Dr. Busbys yearely gift of Six Pounds that shall remaine when the Coles are paid for. Recognised by the Court at Whitehall as the guardians of the poor, the Yestry were called upon to take care of children found without means of subsistence, due precaution being taken, however, that the parish was secured against the expense likely to be incurred by the "settlement":— July 1664. After our hearty Comendacons ct. A new borne child was last night left without any Succor in that part of his Maties house of Whitehall within the Parish of Westmr And that neithr the Father nor Mother can bee discovered We have thought fitt heerwith to send the said Chyld to you And for that wee doe not know that hee is yet baptized that you take care it bee baptized put to Nurse and provided for according to Law And soe not doubting of you care heerin, We rest Yr very L° friends He WOOD Cha. Berkley Hugh Pollard Whitehall 7° July 1664 To the Churchwardens Overseers of the Poore of the Parish of St Margts Westmr July 1664 Upon Receipt of the Letter whereof a true Coppy anteceeds Mr Hamond and Mr Hill attended Sr Henry Wood therein who promised to bee Instrumentall upon his Maties giveing of his Benevolence for the future that this Parish shall have theire Proporcon thereof O 194 Court of Conscience or Requests. In 1674 the Vestry, watchful of the requirements of the parish, resolved upon taking steps for the introduction of a Bill for the ment of a Court of Conscience:— Saturday, 14 Febry., 1674.—The Busines touching a Bill for a Court of Conscience in Westmr being this day taken into Consideration It is thought fitt ye same be proceeded in with all expedition, but first St Philip Warwick's Advise to be had whether it shall be Drawne up joyntly with Southwarke &c or by it selfe for ye Citty & Liberty of Westmr onely. The Charge to be defrayed in comon proportion ably. And the Churchwardens are desired to prosecut ye same vigorously And their particidar Charge shall be allowed in their Accompt. Another resolution on the same subject was passed in December, 1749:— Deer. 28, 1749. Resolved that it is the opinion of this Vestry that the establishing by Act of Parliament a Court or Courts of Conscience within this City & Liberty for the more easy Recovery of small debts would be of great utility and benefit to the inhabitants of the said City and Liberty. A committee was accordingly appointed to meet committees of other Vestries of the Liberty with a view to preparing a petition to Parliament, which petition was no doubt favourably considered, for on the 1st February, 174/59/0, the Churchwardens reported that a bill had been ordered to be brought in with the object of establishing Courts of Conscience. The bill became law, and the following are the minutes of the first appointment of the Commissioners by the Vestry, a similar entry occurring every year in the St. Margaret's minutes, and, after 1728, for many years in those of the Joint Vestries:— At a Vestry held for the Parish of St. Margaret Westmr Pursuant to the direction of an Act of Parliament made and passed in the last Session of Parliament Entitled an Act for the more easy and speedy Recovery of Small Debts within the City and Liberty of Westmr &c. Tuesday the first day of May 1750. Thirty persons "being discreet and substantial inhabitants of the Parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster" were nominated to be Commissioners of the Court of Requests 195 for the City and Liberty of Westminster, and that part of the Duchy of Lancaster adjoining, to serve for one year ending 1st May, 1751. Amongst those appointed were:—Sir Richard Lloyd, Kt., Thomas Salusbury, Esq., Avery Vokens, Samuel Tufnell, William Lowndes, and Samuel Smith, Esq. The Plague. The silence of the Vestry Minutes upon the subiect of the Great Plague of 1665 is fessedly remarkable, not an entry or reference of any kind being observable. The accounts of expenses incurred by the Churchwardens were discovered amongst a large quantity of other manuscripts in the tower of St. Margaret's Church a few years since; but, curious as they are, their reproduction here is forbidden by the rule laid down from the first that the Churchwardens' Accounts should not be consulted. It may be stated, however, that the plague accounts were kept separately from the ordinary cash statements of the Churchwardens, and were probably lost sight of when the ancient accounts were collected and bound by the Churchwardens in 1713. In June, 1885, when a large quantity of old records and papers were removed from the tower of St. Margaret's Church to the Town Hall, the plague accounts inscribed on paper which had well nigh perished, and bearing the signatures of Emery Hill and Ffran Dorington, the Justices by whom they were allowed, were brought to light. They were at once repaired, as far as possible, and are now in the Vestry's office. An idea of the ravages of the disease in Westminster may be gathered from the fact that not less than 2,965 persons succumbed thereto, who were buried at the expense of the parish. The description given by the Earl of Craven, preserved in the Public Record Office' will also furnish an insight into the spread of the contagion in and about Westminster:— The Earl of Craven's Account of the Proceedings of the Justices concerning the Pestilence (Great Plague, 1665) 1666. [February 1665-6]. 0 2 196 Since the receipt of the letter from the Lords of the Councell there has been severall Meetings of the Justices of the Peace both to review the Orders formerly made by the Councell Board as well as their owno and many direcons thereupon given and warrants issued forth to the respective officers as the present occasion required both for the preservation of the inhabitants from the infection of the plague as well as making provision for such as were shut up and were in want. The Lord Bishop of London was consulted with all concerning buriall places who could not consecrate any ground unless a perpetuatie of the same be first obtayned. Nevertheless the Justices have directed that such persons who dye of the sicknesse shalbo buried in the late usuall places assigned for that purpose. Such infected who were removable were sent to the Pest House and others who could not have been shut up their doors were marked wth a red crosse for 40 dayes Warders appointed to guard them within as well as hinder the approach of Company from wthout, with a white crosse afterwards for the same time. There lias been no complaints brought to the Justices of any neglect herein but doe believe that due execution hath been generally made of this order having themselves made a particular observation in severall places. The Churchyards have not been so generally covered with lyme in regarde of the dearnesse and scarcity thereof there being not a sufficient quantity to be had for that end and purpose but much fresh earth and lyme has been layd in many churchyards and those bodyes wcl' have been there buryed so deep layd that we hope 110 inconveniencing can from thence arise beside special care is taken not to open the same graves again. The streets are dayly cleansed and the filth carried away by the Raker who brings the carts every morning and giveing notice thereof to the inhabitants by the sound of his Bell to the end that every Perticular house alsoe may be cleared of its filth. As to the laystalls too neere the streets and passages much care has been taken for to remove them many difficulties having arisen therein by reason of titles in law wch the proprietors had therein Not wth standing by the industry and diligence of the Justices some are already quite removed and the rest we hope in a very short time wilbe removed to the great advantage of the inhabitants as well as to the satisfaction of the Lords of the Councell order. Beggars have ben and are dayly removed and punished and provision made for the poore of each parish according to law. As to the state of the pest house the Justices have frequently and very lately considered of it and doe conceive it highly convenient for the Preservation of the adjoining Parishes that they were 197 pnlarged: that in Westminster being able to contayne but 60 persons, and that other in the Sohoe but 90 persons wch now serve for St Martins St Clements St Paul Covent Garden and St Mary Savoy ; Scarce large enough for one of the sayd parishes. That in St Gyles will contain but 60 persons wch considering the multitude of poore in that parish cannot be of any considerable use if the sicknesse brake out amongst them. Now how these may be enlarged or indeed continued as they are for the publique use of the forementioned parishes the ordinary taxes and parochial duties being so numerous the middling sort of persons soe much impoverished by the late Calamity of the Plague so few or rather none of the Nobility & gentry likely to continue here in case it should please God that the Plague brake out againe is submitted to the wisdome of the boarde whose ayde and assistance is wthall humility and speed begged herein it being the most probable meaness of hindering the Spreading of the Oontagiun amongst us. The business of inmates & inhabitants in cellars has been very often debated and adjudged upon by the Justices and although many difficulties have appeared to them by reason of particular leases and contracts between their respective householders and inmates for a certain term of yeares yet to come and in regard that severall of the said inmates most of which are poore necessitious persons and if once removed would prove excessively chargable to the parishes (which at this period are least able to bear it) the Justices have made a progresse herein having convened before them all the respective landlords wtbn the adjacent parishes and taken account of each particular case to the end that in a short tyme they doubt not but to give a good account hereof, very many being removed already and are dayly removing. Duties cf the Almost from the date of the legis]ative reVestry Clerk. COgnition of the Vestry as bearing a prominent part in the parochial administration, the office of Vestry Clerk has been regarded as one of considerable importance among the executive agents of the parish. As the duties cast upon the Vestry gradually increased with advancing time, the responsibility attaching to the position of Vestry Clerk engaged the attention of Parliament. In 1850 an O © Act was passed (13 & 14 Vic., cap. 57) commonly known as the Vestry Clerks' Act, defining the duties to be performed by this many-sided officer, subject to such additions as the Poor Law Commissioners (now the Local Government Board) may think tit to make. It is not proposed here to recapitulate these duties, but rather to turn to the references 198 made thereto in the chronicles of the Vestry of former times. Two hundred and thirty three years ago the duties of the office were thus defined by the Vestry :— Duties of Vestry Clerk, 1656. The Contract and Agree™1 with the present Churchwardens of the parish of St. Margarett Westmr (for & on behalfe of the said parish) have made with George Hare the Clerke of their Vestrie Is as followeth, viz':— Inprimis the said George Hare shall constantly attend at everie Vestrie to be Called, there to doe his service, as hee is Clerke of the Vestrie. Item hee shall doe and performe all the writing businesses of this parish wch in times past hath been done and performed by himselfe & other Scriveners at the Charge of this Parish in manner and forme following, viz' ffirste he shall fairlie engrosse the Churchwardens Accompte in good writing vellam and the Accompte of the Overseers of the Poore in good parchment everie yeare in twoe severall books to be handsomely bound as in times past All at his owne costs and charges. Item he shall everie yeare write and perfect all the Books of Assessment and Absies wch are usually made for the Overseers for the Poore and for the Surveiors of the high waies And all the warrants concerning their severall Offices Hee shall make and perfect the Accomptes also of the Surveiors of the high waies yearlie & he shall at his owne costs and charges finde & provide all such paper books wch heretofore have been usually prepared & fitted for the use and service of the Churchwardens and Overseers of the Poore. Item hee shall write All the Apprentice Indentures thatshalbee made for the putting forth of such children as are kept att the charge of this parish, and all the bonds wch shalbee made to save the parish harmless of those children ; And hee shall fairlie write out true coppies of all the deeds Charters Evidences and writings now remaining in the black Cheste in the Vestrie, and all other writings wch shall hereafter belong unto the Church or to the Poore and parish of St Margaretts Into a large booke wch is alreadie provided for that purpose. In consideration whereof the psent Churchwardens of the said parish and their Successors are to pay unto the said Clerke of the Vestrie Thirtie pounds by the yeare During the good Demeanour of the said Clerke and During the pleasure of the Vestrie. Subscribed by the Churchwardens of the said parish for the time now being and by the said Clerke of the Vestrie the said 24th day of November 1056. Bryan Barmby ^ Church Geo. Hare, Clerk of William Hawkins J Wardens. the Vestrie. 199 The foregoing duties were confirmed upon the appointment of a successor to the officer therein named ; but within six years the succeeding clerk relinquished the position exhausted and incapacitated, insomuch that his nurse petitioned the Vestry for an allowance towards his support. The Vestry granted twelve shillings a week in response to the appeal, and awarded the clerk two pounds ten shillings towards the apprenticeship premium of his son. Another minute records the dissatisfaction of the Vestry at the perfunctory fulfilment of the office, and directs that the clerk's salary shall be withheld until the arrears of accounts for seven years are entered up and the balances handed over. This class of entry is, however, quite exceptional. Again and again the eye falls on the testimony of the Vestry, in various forms, to the fidelity, the ability, and the devotion to the interests of the parish displayed by the occupants of the position—worthy men of unswerving rectitude, untiring energy, and unvarying assiduity in their responsible trust—men of whose characters and qualities and work the books bear silent witness, and in whose footprints may be traced a path dictated by an ardent attachment to the traditions of the ancient parish in which they laboured. To such men Simon Stephenson and James Rogers, wThose mural monuments are to be found in the parish church of St. Margaret, were worthy successors. Testimonials At page 91 an incidental allusion is made to to overseers. enforcement of numerous substantial fines upon parishioners who declined to take upon themselves the duties of Overseer. Until a comparatively recent date these officers were bound to perform the duties now assigned to the rate collector and the relieving officer—duties so onerous, laborious, and thankless, that the readiness to submit to a £12 penalty is easily understood. Except in so far as advancement to the dignity of churchwarden might be taken as a mark of esteem, the Overseers received no specific 200 recognition of their public service until the office had become relieved of much of its more disagreeable work. Occasional resolutions of thanks were then passed, but no more tangible testimonial was given until 1821. The o o retiring Overseer was then " requested to accept of a prayer " book handsomely bound in morocco as a testimonial of the " Vestry's approbation and thanks." In 1825 another presentation of " a quarto prayer book, handsomely bound " mas made to one of the outgoing Overseers, whose successors for several years then became the recipients of similar presents. Tithes. Owing, in all probability, to the extent to which the land was vested in the Abbots, and subsequently in the Dean and Chapter, very little is chronicled in the parish books on the subject of tithes. In fact the following, which are the only references noticeable in a search extending over three hundred years, seem to indicate that no great value attached to them :— Sunday, 17 May, 1685—Ord'1 that the Churchwardens with Mr. Howlett to speake to Mr. Henry Rogers, and to learne what they can for the settling the true value of the Tyth. Sunday, May the last, 1685—Whereas by reason of the Uncertainty of the profitts of Tyths of Hey and Corne of this Parish and the Difficulty in gathering the same, the Parsonage and Viccaridge Tyths being in two severall hands It is now ordered (nemine contradicente) that Dr Nich. Only shall and may have and enjoy the said Tyths of Hey and Corne for the tearme of Tenn yeares if he shall soe long continue Viccar of this Parish at the yearely Rent and Acknowledgment of One Shilling P Ann. and that the Dr may have libertie to take Course in the Leassees names for all arrears of Tyths. nay Market Ibc circumstances under which the hay-mar- Broadway. ket in the Broadway was established are thus recorded:— 24th October, 1733.

Ordd That the Hackney Coachmen have Notice to remove their Stands from of the said Markett. The Patent under which the market was granted, being a magnificent specimen of the caligraphic art, and bearing the Great Seal attached, is preserved at the Town Hall. The Sessions Although it does not appear, from the minutes, that the Vestry took any steps towards obtaining the grant, they nevertheless recognised the public benefit conferred by the gift of the Court House in the Broad Sanctuary:— Thursday, 10th March, 1763. Resolved that the Unanimous and respectfull Thanks of this Vestry be and they are hereby given to the Right Honble the Earl of Northumberland for his Generous Benefaction of the New Court House or Guildhall situated within this Parish for the Accomodation of this City and Liberty. 202 A few notes have been made of the action of Coroner. the Vestry in relation to the coroner and the accommodation of his juries :— Tuesday, 11 th Ma7j, 1708.

The following entry relates to the transfer of the set of standard weights from the Vestry to the Court:— Wednesday, 10 Aug., 1763.—Resolved that the Weights remaining in this Vestry which were made in the 30th year of Queen Elizabeth and Purchased by this Parish, be Presented to the Court of Burgesses of Westminster upon their Paying as an Acknowledgement the sum of Twenty Guineas to the Churchwardens for the use of this Parish. With the object, it is to be inferred, of interestManufacture. in8' the workhouse children in the handicraft, the Vestry occasionally ordered the matron to conduct them to the linen manufactory in Dean's Yard. The Vestry also manifested a desire to encourage the industry in the parish :— Tuesday, 10th Sept., 1668.

Mr. Walcott in his Memorials (page 309), gives the number of houses in St. Margaret's parish in 1708 as 3,079. In 1735 there were 3,950 houses in the two parishes of St. Margaret and St. John—2,850 in the former, and 1,600 in the latter. In a paper entitled " Observations and. Considerations upon the New Paving Bill, 1769," preserved in the British Museum, the number of houses in the two parishes is set down as 2,804; but the accuracy of these figures is to say the least, doubtful, since a decrease of 1146 houses in 34 years is implied. A schedule to the " Observations " gives some interesting particulars. There were :— 1,365 houses rated at £10 or under. 612 „ between £10 and £15 207 „ „ 15 „ 20 201 „ „ 20 „ 25 149 „ „ 25 „ 30 41 „ „ 30 „ 35 51 „ „ 35 „ 50 44 „ „ 50 „ 60 8 „ „ 60 „ 70 27 „ „ 70 „ 80 5 „ 80 „ 90 3 „ „ 90 100 3 „ „ 100 „ 110 7 „ „ 110 „ 120 8 „ „ 120 „ 130 2 „ „ 130 „ 140 10 „ „ 140 „ 150 3 „ „ 150 „ 170 1 „ at 190 2 „ at 300 In 1761 the rent charge upon which the poor rate was calculated for the two parishes was £50,000 ; in 1815, the rateable value was £142,387, in 1828, £129,926, and in 205 1801, £27-1 500.

From 185G to 1888, the period during which Westminster was under the regime of the District Board of Works. At the close of the period reviewed in the preceding Part, the autonomy of Westminster was vested in a number of distinct authorities, each exercising powers over some special branch of local government or over some small area within the parochial limits. The Court of Burgesses and the Vestry, it is true, retained general jurisdiction over the whole parish for certain purposes; but the numerous local Acts already cited so effectually sub-divided the control and distributed it among Boards, Commissioners, Trustees, Committees, and other independent bodies, that uniformity, efficiency, and economy in local administration had become impossible. It is not proposed, ,however, to enlarge here upon the evils arising from the absence of cohesion and solidarity, nor is it intended to recapitulate the proceedings of the Board of Works for the Westminster District year by year for the period covered by this chapter. Indeed, little more than a reprint of the general retrospect given in the Thirtieth Annual Report of that Board will be attempted, commencing with the brief allusion to the circumstances which, in 1855, led the Legislature to call into existence the Vestries, elected by the popular vote, and the District Boards, for the remedy of what Lord Ebrington then described in the House of Commons as "the evils "arising from the anarchical and anomalous state in which "the government of the Metropolis was left." Long before Parliament seriously grappled with the subject, public attention had been directed to the extent to which the health of London suffered from the absence of 209 any efficient system of sanitation, and various Governments at different times had promised to bring remedial measures before the House, but ministry after ministry passed away without any attempt at legislation in that direction. In 1848, the year of the appalling visitation of cholera, to which upwards of 53,000 persons in England succumbed, Lord Morpeth, who was then Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, intimated his intention to introduce a preparatory measure for the government of London within a very short period; but seven years elapsed without effect being given to the intention. Meanwhile, in 1854, a second visitation of cholera, with upwards of 20,000 deaths therefrom, had occurred, and the late Sir Benjamin Hall, who then held office in the Government as President of the Board of Health, grasped the question in the masterly manner which its magnitude and importance demanded. Persistently combating the opposition with which his "motion for leave" was assailed, he succeeded in obtaining, on the 17th March, 1855, authority to introduce his "Bill for the Better Local Management of the Metropolis," by which the local government of London was to be placed in the hands of the ratepayers. Having two months previously laid before the House the "Bill for the Removal of Nuisances and for the Prevention of Diseases," he may justly be regarded as the pioneer of the improved health of London, and when it is remembered that the Metropolitan Building Act was passed in the same year, it will be conceded that the Parliamentary Session of 1855 set in active operation a threefold machinery which has produced advantages to the Metropolis which are simply incalculable. Within the metropolitan limits the local administration was carried on by no less than three hundred different bodies, deriving their powers from about two hundred and fifty local acts, independent of general acts. Of the parishes, no fewer than thirty, containing 80,000 inhabi- P 210 tants, ancl representing nearly half the value of the metropolis, were governed by bodies self-elected, or elected for life, or both, and under no responsibility to the ratepayers. "The results, as a matter of course," says an accepted authority, "included enormous expenditure, extravagant waste, perpetual conflicts of jurisdiction, and an absolute want, all the while, of anything approaching to efficient municipal administration." Among the many objections with which the Bill was met, it was contended that unprofessional men, such as vestrymen, could never satisfactorily superintend works which, like sewerage and drainage, demanded special qualifications ; but the argument lost much of its force when the promoter of the Bill informed the House that in one case the official surveyor was a tailor, and in another a law stationer. When Sir Benjamin Hall took office on the 12th August, 1854,there was,as he subsequently assured the House,"hardly an inspector in the whole of the metropolis, and he had the greatest possible difficulty in making some of the Boards appoint inspectors." In demonstrating the necessity for some such reform as the Metropolis Local Management Bill was designed to effect, the same statesman adduced it as a regular fact that in Westminster all the limits of the parishes and the boundaries of the different jurisdictions were in the middle of the streets, so that while one side or half of the street was paved by one authority, the opposite side was paved by another. Constant quarrels arose between the different Commissioners from this circumstance. There was one great thoroughfare (in Westminster) where the centre of the road was under one head so far as regarded the paving, but the lighting and watering, unfortunately for the inhabitants, rested with two other Boards, one on the north and the other on the south. These two Boards disagreed'—one saying, "We will have the watering done in the morning," and the other, "We will have it done in the 211 evening," so that both sides were, in fact, covered with dust the whole of the day. One parish had sixteen paving Boards, yet a great part of the parish had no paving at all. Lord Palmerston, who was then Leader of the Government, claimed for the Bill that it was founded upon that principle of local self-government which was most congenial with the feelings of the people of this country. His lordship continued, " I am under no apprehension that the sewerage of the different metropolitan districts will be mismanaged by the local bodies to which it will be confided. Everybody who has looked at all into this matter must be perfectly aware that it is impossible for the general commissioners of sewers to direct simultaneously the arterial drainage of the metropolis, and apply their attention properly to the defects of the branch sewerage of every separate district. I will only say that instead of the Bill being calculated to create chaos, I think it will dispell it, and substitute for the extreme confusion which now prevails, a system of order and regularity from which the metropolis will derive great benefit." That the public feeling was fully in accord with the Government will be seen by the following extract from o the Times of 20th March, 1855:— " Nothing can be plainer, more confessed, and more imperative than the necessity for some such measure, while, at the same time, nothing can be more obvious than the difficulties attending the new enactment. The metropolis is at present governed, with respect to lighting, paving, and sewerage purposes, on a system so cumbrous, so costly, and so inefficient as to admit of no possible defence—in fact, the absurdity of the affair, if it did not entail quite so many and such serious evils, would be utterly ludicrous. Not only is there no unity in London itself, but it is actually hard to discover any such feature even in its component parishes or streets. What the case requires is, first such a consolidation of all the different Boards as shall secure uniformity and efficiency of jurisdiction while terminating the waste of money now prevailing; and secondly, such a method of appointment as shall render the new Boards truly representative and responsible bodies. The main point is whether it is not expedient to substitute for the system of irresponsibility, of jobbing, and mis-management, which now exists in the metropolis, a simple uniform system which has been found to work well elsewhere." 212 Considering the extent to which the time of Parliament was absorbed in dealing with affairs in Russia, the Bill made rapid strides through the House, and became law early in August. Certain preliminaries prescribed by the new Act having been carried into effect in the following November, its provisions came into actual and practical operation on the first of January, 1850, when the ratepayers of the great city, by their representatives in the new system, entered upon the consideration and execution of a great sanitary work of the utmost importance to the public weal, and under auspices, and with a machinery so simple, and yet so poweiful, as to remove its ultimate and successful completion from the region of doubt or insurmountable difficulty. That very machinery, indeed, invested the operations which it had to conduct for the common good, with additional interest and consideration, for its motive spring lay in a principle as venerable as the British constitution itself—that of local self-government, with which the citizens of the metropolis of the world were then entrusted for the management of their own affairs, though it had been conceded for at least twenty years to the inhabitants of every municipality or corporate town throughout the country. That ancient principle, associated as it was with the kindred one of representation, was from that day put upon its trial on a far more extensive scale than it had ever previously been, and under circumstances which augured well for its complete success. The members of the new Metropolitan Board of Works and of the various District Boards and Vestries throughout the metropolis and its suburbs were left, by their public conduct and acts, to vindicate the wisdom and utility of the measure, and to justify the grounds on which it had been entrusted to their keeping. 1855. 1885. The population of London was 2,547,039 4,083,928 The number of inhabited houses was 305,933 480,186 The death-rate per 1,000 persons was 243 19 7 213 No records of the death-rates in the large provincial towns were published in 1855, but in 1885 the death-rate of Manchester was 26'5, and of Liverpool 23'8 per thousand nersons. Changes in the condition of W estminster since 1855. A closer and more permanent interest attaches to the subject when the review is concentrated upon the Westminster District, and the application within it of the principle of local selfgovernment for thirty years. Outside the City of London no one of the local authorities constituted under the Act of 1855 can lay claim to the charge of a district so immeasurably rich in historical association. Small, it is true, in area, yet it is distingished as containing the places of Her Majesty's birth, accession, coronation, and marriage, as the locale of the Palace of the Legislative Assembly of the Empire, as the seat of the Government, and the headquarters of its several departments, and as closely identified with the historical, ecclesiastical, political, legal, and educational concerns not only of the metropolis, but of the kingdom. Whether viewed as to character, statistics, topography, or sanitary condition, the change which Westminster has undergone in thirty years can only be adequately described as a complete transformation. In the St. Margaret's portion of the district whole streets of fine houses which were occupied by the nobility and the wealthy for residential purposes are now let out in offices for the transaction of legal, scientific, or mechanical business, while narrow streets, wretched courts, and melancholy homes of squalid poverty and misery have been replaced on the one hand by " mansions," containing " mezzanines," " entresols," " flats," and floors reaching to the seventh in number, used either as self-contained residences or professional chambers, and approached by hydraulic lifts, and on the other hand by huge blocks of artizans' dwellings, comprising upwards of 1,200 homes. 214 As indicated by statistics the mutability is not less remarkable. The resident population, which was 65,609 in 1851, had declined to 59,926 in 1881—a decrease of 5,68*3. The number of "inhabited houses" was less by 437 in 1885 than 1855, the figures being 6,205 and 6,642 respectively. The number of separate assessments had risen from 7,429 in 1855 to 8,602 in 1888; while the rateable value had increased from £251,226 to £740,596—an addition of £489,370. The poor rate, which in 1855 was 3s. in the £, was Is 7£d. in 1888, notwithstanding the heavy demands in the latter year to meet the requirements of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, the Couuty, and the largely developed police force. The general and district rates in 1855 amounted to Is. 6d. in the £, as against 2s. 7d., in 1888, in which latter was included 9d. for the purposes of the School Board and 8£d. for the Metropolitan Board. The death-rate per thousand for the first mentioned year was 27.5, or 32 above that of the metropolis, for the lastmentioned year it was 19.1 so that in the thirty-two years it had fallen 8.4, and had become 0.6 lower than the general average for London. Of the condition of the District when the Board entered upon its duties it may be stated that there were six miles and three quarters of streets and places not provided with sewers, 152,624 square yards of carriage-way unpaved and 25,390 square yards of footway unpaved. No less than 1,115 cesspools were emptied and filled up during the first two years of the Board's existence, in which period also 615 open privies were converted into water-closets, 382 new closets were constructed, 968 closets were first fitted with water-supply apparatus, and 543 dust bins were constructed. In his first annual report the medical officer of health remarks that "in houses surrounded by an atmosphere of deadly gases, imperfectly ventilated, barlly supplied with water, damp, and dirty, it was not a matter of surprise that death should have made such ravages; and the influence of 215 these poisonous exhalations has yet to be appreciated in the determination of how far they may originate the development of consumption, scrofula, cancer, and other diseases, from which a large number of our fellow parishioners annually die." On the subject of the water supply an extract from the Registrar General's quarterly supplement to the weekly returns of births and deaths, published on 10th January, 1856, may here be fitly reproduced. He says: "It appeared from the mortality returns both of 184-9 and 1854, that a great excess in the deaths from cholera occurred wherever bad water was supplied. Subsequently to the first period, a Parliamentary Committee sat, and an act was passed on July 1st, 1852, to enable and to compel, if necessary, the water companies to supply London with pure and wholesome water. The districts of Chelsea, Westminster, and Belgravia still derive their water from the impure source that has been abandoned by the other companies." In his report to the Board in January, 1857, the medical officer of health states that "among the dwellings of the poor, water is, and must always be contaminated until more fitting receptacles are provided them. The method of supply is, in many instances, very objectionable, as, from the absence of any receptacle, the inhabitants are obliged to catch their daily supplies in any convenient vessel, which, being stored in the already too closely packed apartments, speedily becomes tainted and unfit for drink." One hundred and ninty-tive new water butts and cisterns were fixed by order of the Board before the 1st January, 1858. Unlike the work of the Metropolitan Board of Works in laying out imposing new thoroughfares, or in constructing magnificent bridges or embankments, the work of a District Board is unobserved in a great measure by those who enjoy the benefits of it. So long as the sewerage system, the lighting, the roadways, and the footways are all maintained in a satisfactory condition, and so long as a 216 moderate standard of sanitation is preserved, there is little to attract attention. It may not therefore be out of place to state here that during the thirty-two years, although the district only comprises an area of 815 acres, and 25 miles of streets, 5£ miles of brick and pipe sewers have been constructed, and the entire sewerage kept in good working order at a cost of £28,041; the 830 lamp columns transferred to the board at its commencement have been supplemented by 553 others; the expenditure on general sanitary works, exclusive of sewerage, had been £104,765, on general paving works £264,312, and on public improvements, £22,363. The total expenditure for these purposes between 1st January, 1856, and 25th March, 1888, thus amounted to £419,481, not to speak of a considerable sum disbursed in office expenses and a variety of miscellaneous matters. Interesting as would be a description of the topographical changes which the interior of the district has undergone, it must suffice for the purposes of this retrospect simply to mention the principal of them. Commencing at the river boundary, the splendid bridge and the Victoria Embankment deservedly find themseves at the head of the list, and are joined by the costly block which includes St. Stephen's Club and Palace Chambers, the site of which was formerly occupied by Manchester Buildings. Proceeding westward across Parliament Square, which was laid out in connection with the construction of the Metropolitan District Railway in 18(i9, and noting the costly improvement effected at St. Margaret's Churchyard in 1880, Flood Street and Dean Street (a portion of which is now incorporated with Great Smith Street) are called to mind as places of the past, removed to form a better approach to the west door of the Abbey, on which approach the monument erected to former Westminster Scholars who fell in the Crimea now stands. The site of the Almonry, famous as the spot to which Caxton brought the first printing press with 217 moveable types, is now covered by the Westminster Palace Hotel, opposite which, on the ground now occupied by the block of offices known as Westminster Chambers, stood the Dean Street Workhouse and the New Way. Continuing along Victoria Street, Victoria Mansions now cover the site of Cooper Street, while, a little further to the west, the Churchyard of Christ Church was curtailed, and a part of Brewer's Green and Providence Place was removed, to be subsequently replaced by the Hotel Windsor and Queen's Mansions. Partly on the site of the Hotel stood Palmer's Almshouses. Goodman's Green and Fugeon's Row were demolished to make room for the palatial buildings designated Alexandra Mausions and Princes Mansions. William Street, which was widened and taken over by the District Board, was subsequently incorporated as an extension of Palace Street, in which Isabella Court was absorbed. South of the then newly-formed Victoria Street were laid out Philip Street and Francis Street, the last-mentioned not having been completed and opened as a public way until 1882-3, when the Board paid £2,000 to remove a barrier and make the connection with Vauxhall Bridge Road Passing across the land now rendered vacant by the recent demolition of the Tothill Fields Prison, erected in 1834 at a cost of £186,000, on which land Ambrosden Avenue awaits the builder's busy enterprise, and deviating to observe the improvement in the Horseferry Road and the St. John's Burial Ground, opened as a Public Garden in May, 1884, attention is turned to the benefits derived by the district by the Lambeth Bridge, opened in 1862. Thence pursuing the survey northwards, and passing the Victoria Tower Gardens, the next change is noted at the spot from which the Law Courts were transported in 1882. Crossing into the oft-threatened Parliament Street, the magnificent pile of Government Offices in Whitehall, completed in 1874-5, next bear witness of the march of improvement. Leaving this via King Street and skirting Parliament 218 Square again, the next thoroughfare calling for notice is Tothill Street, under the entire length of which the District Railway was built in 1805-7. The works connected with this undertaking led to the widening of the street, the partial re-building of the south side, and subsequently, in 1875, to the erection of the Aquarium on an area nearly three acres in extent. Just off the Broadway, close by, stood St. Ermin's Hill, with its workhouse, and in York Street, Vandon's Almshouses, almost on the site of which the new Town Hall casts its shadow. Looking south-west from the windows of this building (a description of which was given in the Board's twenty-eighth report) several of the present members of the Board, who were resident in Westminster in 1855, readily recall a strange ill-assorted mixture of the rural and urban district which, as it seems to have escaped the notice of local historians, is entitled to more than a passing mention. Cut off by bricks and mortar from the neighbouring fields of Tuttle or Toot-hill, or more recently Tothill, it retained all the characteristics and the name of a village—Palmer's Village—so called after the Rev. Edwin Palmer, B.D., for many years a preacher at St. Bride's Fleet Street, who, in 1560, founded with a chapel and school attached, the almshouses already mentioned as having preceded the present Hotel Windsor, the name of the founder being preserved in the present Palmer Street on the west of the Town Hall. Surrounded by crowded streets, dark narrow lanes, and fetid courts, and in the very midst of the district (its principal boundaries may be roughly stated as parts of Artillery Row, Coburg Row, St. Margaret's Place, Francis .Street, Brewer's Green, and James Street) it was thus described by a writer five and thirty years ago. "It had still a village green, though the narrow strip of dusty grass which justified the appellation was finally trodden out under our own eyes It had an old-fashioned wayside inn, the "Prince of Orange," which was a model of a village inn as village inns are found in rural districts. It stood 219 away from the road, and retired modestly a few paces from the footpath The house itself appeared at the first glance to be three parts roof; but beneath that homely crust the wayworn traveller found order and cleanliness, wholesome fare, the whitest linen, ready and cheerful service, and all at an honest price Next to the inn, if, indeed, it ought not to rank before it, the most remarkable feature in our metropolitan village, was the shop. Of what goes to the constitution of the village shop, such as it was in our day, and such as multitudes are at the present hour in remote country districts, the Londoner, born within the sound of Bow Bells, has not for the most part the remotest idea It is grocer and tea dealer, and stationer and bookseller, and draper and haberdasher, and chemist and druggist, and jeweller and ironmonger, and seedsman and toyman, and egg merchant and butterman in short it does the work of Cheapside, Holborn, and the Strand all under one roof. Such was the shop of our village." After pourtraying the village baker, "who was nothing but a baker," the butcher, "who was nothing but a butcher," the dressmaker, the tailor, and the blacksmith, who might be heard "on a Sunday afternoon hammering out upon a set of pendant bells the psalm tunes he has heard at Westminster Abbey in the morning," the writer quoted proceeds :— "Our village, in appearance, does not much resemble the rest of the brick and mortar paradise of London. Properly speaking, there are no regular streets in it; rows of houses, chiefly cottages, there are; but they do not stand face to face, like the two sides of a street proper, but face to back, like the ranks of soldiers in a regiment; and it is thought that, like a regiment, they will be marched off the ground some day. There are little, odd-shaped, and triangular pieces of ground here and there, which might perhaps by a stretch of courtesy be called streets ; but nobody calls them streets—they are Palmer's Village, all of them, and nothing else; the postmaster and the postman lump them all together, and the latter has to learn the whereabouts of each inhabitant We cannot say much in favour of the pigs: they are voted a nuisance, and seem to be conscious that they are not in good odour; but they are learned in their way, and know the map of Westminster as well as the postman. They invade Petty France, which is not half-a-mile off, every morning, and amidst the ineffable filth of that indescribably filthy district they growl and grunt and snufile through the livelong day. We have met the village pig before now as far north as the Broad Sanctuary; but we never knew of his losing his way, or failing to return at night to his supper or his sty." 220 The interesting sketch from which this quotation is made seems to have answered the twofold purpose of the history and funeral oration of the village. Victoria Street thrust its way through it, pushed on by the powers vested by Parliament in the Westminster Improvement Commission, though phoenix-like, there has risen out of its ashes, within the thirty years, a new "Prince of Orange," a few yards only from the site of its predecessor, but shorn of every vestige of its character as a village-inn. The village shop is replaced by that conglomeration of business under one roof known as the Army and Navy Stores, where even more trades than those depicted in the sketch are carried on to the extent of a yearly turnover of more than £2,500,000. The ancient Pound House of the parish, with several adjoining buildings, disappeared in 1864-5 to make way for an improvement at the approach to Rochester Row from Grey Coat Place. The Engine House in Regent Place was improved out of existence shortly afterwards. The topographical changes in that portion of the district known as the "Hamlet of Knightsbridge" have been far less remarkable than in the Home District. The principal alterations are, indeed, only those due to the extension of the building works authorised by the Albert Gate Act, which became law some years prior to the Metropolis Management Act, and to the development of the Kensington Palace Gardens, Rutland Gate, Princes Gate, and Kensington Gore, on which latter the Albert Hall stands, and in the rear of which the buildings used for the purposes of the Fisheries, Health, Inventions, and Colonial and other Exhibitions are within the boundaries of the district. The alterations in the street nomenclature during the thirty-two years have consisted for the most part of the abolition of subsidiary names of terraces and places in some of the principal thoroughfares, and the re-numbering of the houses in each case. A few only of the instances in 221 which old-established names have been obliterated call for notice, such as Holywell Street, joined to Page Street under the latter name in 1864, Dean Street, already mentioned, added to and named with Great Smith Street in 1865, when also Duck Lane was designated St. Matthew Street. Bowling Street took the name of Tufton Street, of which it formed part, and Vine Street was merged in Romney Street in 1869-70. 222 PART IV. ANNUAL HEPOHT. Lady-day, 1888, to Lady-day, 1889. The Vestry have now to present their report for the past year to the ratepayers of the united parish. Monday, the 26th of March, 1888, will be remembered as an important day in the annals of the local government of Westminster. On this day came into operation the Act, granted in the last preceding session of Parliament, being the Jubilee year of Queen Victoria, by which Act renewed vitality was imparted to the local governing system of Westminster. In the final report of the Board of Works for the Westminster District, at pages 28 to 35, is recorded the action taken by the United Vestries to obtain in the place of a dual authority, one which should have the entire and independent management of the local affairs, and which should be directly elected by and responsible to the ratepayers. The first meeting of the Vestry, as newly constituted, took place on Wednesday, the 28th day of March, 1888, when the Rector of St. Margaret's, the Venerable Archdeacon Farrar, D.D., occupied the chair. The minutes of the last meeting of the United Vestries on the 9th March, and of the District Board on 11th March having been confirmed, the Chairman addressed the Vestry as follows:— This is, as you know, an exceedingly busy week for all clergymen, and I shall be obliged myself to leave the Vestry at half-past twelve for duties in my church; but, I should like to say, I came here in order to have the honour of presiding on this very important and interesting occasion. It is now 136 years since, by the Act of the '25th year of George II., the United Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John the Evangelist was constituted a 223 public body, to meet on Easter Tuesday and discharge their public business. Very many momentous changes have taken place since then—most important and interesting changes in our constitution. It is now thirty-three years since, by Sir Benjamin Hall's Act of 1855, the Board of Works was constituted; and during those thirty-three years they have discharged a great many ever-increasing, important, and responsible duties. They have spent four hundred and fortyfive thousand pounds in watering, lighting, paving, sanitation, and in various street improvements; and I think we should be ungrateful if we did not recognise the fact that their duties have been those of an ever-growing and responsible character, and that they have discharged the duties laid upon them in a highly satisfactory, laborious, and zealous manner. Henceforth, by the Act of last session, the duties will devolve on the Vestry itself, the Board of Works having ceased to exist on Saturday last. The Act of last session was an endeavour to consolidate and simplify our local government. Henceforth the Vestry will be individually and directly responsible to the parishioners by whom the members are elected. It will no longer be a body to collect funds for the disbursement of the smaller body, but it will be immediately responsible for the manner in which the money is applied from the rates which the Vestry itself collects. I therefore take the opportunity of marking this change by recognising the labours of the Board of Works, and by expressing an earnest desire, as I am sure I shall do, in the common name of you all—in the hope and prayer of you all—that the principle of local self-government—a principle of which Englishmen may be justly proud—may by no means be allowed to suffer in our hands, and that we may discharge our duties with dignity and honour, and with harmony, and public spirit, and self-respect. constitution of the vestry. Upon the inauguration of the new system "the Vestry" comprised those who had been, prior to that day, the Members of the " United Vestries." Pursuant to the 7th section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, the 23rd day of May, 1888, was appointed for the election of Vestrymen and Auditors. On this day 1G Members of the St. Margaret's Parish and 16 Members of the St. John's Parish vacated, by the effluxion of time, their seats upon the Vestry. The result of the 224 Ward Elections, as declared by the Churchwardens of the respective Parishes, was as follows:— Ward No. 1 St. Margaret. (Hamlet of Knightsbridge.) Vestrymen. Until 1891. William Abel Birch .John Burman Colonel John Barton Sterling George James Lough *William Cleghorn Until 1890. *Henry Lovett Cameron Auditor— Richard Thomas Lewis Ward No. 1 St. John. Vestrymen. Until 1891. Thomas Adams John Leach James Margrie *Benjamin Francis Conn Costelloe *Alexander FitzGerald Until 1890. James Gibson Until 1889.

Until 1891. William Samuel Birch Thomas Horn Charles Christmas Piper Frederick Rose *George Bailey Auditor— Thomas Henry Hobbs The names marked with an asterisk indicate the new members. 225 During the year under review the following resignations were received by the Vestry, viz:— 1. By Mr. G. E. Saunders whose period of office would have expired at the Ward Elections in 1890. 2. By Mr. John Leach, whose term of office would have expired in May, 1891. 3. By Mr. George Bailey, whose seat was tenable until 1891. In the first year of the new constitution the ratepayers were not deprived of the services of any one vestryman, by the hand of death. Votes of thanks and personal resolutions. Upon the presentation in June of the report of the Elected Auditors on their examination of the late District Boards' Accounts, and, in October upon the accounts of the late United Vestries, the Vestry recorded its thanks to the Auditors for their careful and painstaking examination of the financial affairs of the two bodies alluded to. At the meeting of the Vestry on 11th July an announcement was made of the retirement of Mr. C. St. Clare Bedford, whose district as Coroner included the entire parish, whereupon it was unanimously Resolved—That this Vestry do place on record and convey to Mr. C. St. Clare Bedford, who has recently resigned the office of Coroner for the City and Liberty of Westminster—an office which he has held for the last forty-three years—an expression of cordial recognition on the part of his fellow citizens of Westminster, of the ability, fidelity, and dignity with which he has discharged his onerous and important duties; and do assure him of their best wishes, that he may long enjoy in happiness the repose he has so well earned. This resolution was duly forwarded to Mr. Bedford, who acknowledged its receipt in the following terms:— Sanctuary, Westminster, S.W., 18th July, 1888. Dear Sir, I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 16th instant, with (and to thank you for your kind words in transmitting to me) a copy of the Resolution passed by the Vestry of St. Q 220 Margaret and St. John, Westminster, on the occasion of my retirement from the office of Coroner for the City and Liberty of Westminster. It is not easy to express adequately what my feelings were on reading such a resolution, but I can sincerely say that they were those of extreme pleasure and gratification, however little I may have felt that such kind and flattering expressions were deserved. Coming however from such a meeting, they must ever be highly estimated by me, and the possession of the elegant transcript of the resolution must always be regarded by me with much pride and satisfaction; to have won such expressions, after long years of laborious and important public duties, will also be to me a comforting reflection that so far I have not laboured in vain. Kindly present this to the Vestry at a convenient opportunity. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, J. E. Smith, Esq., (Signed) CHAS. S. C. BEDFORD. Vestry Clerk. Upon the receipt of a letter from Major-General C. A. Sim, on the 9th January, 1889, tendering his resignation as a member of the Works and General Purposes Committee, in consequence of his duties at the School Board for London, the Vestry ordered its thanks to be conveyed to MajorGeneral Sim upon his withdrawal from the Committee. The retirement of Mr. Thomas John White being occasioned by the passing of the Local Government Act, the Vestry marked its sense of the services rendered to the parish by its representative at the Metropolitan Board of Works by passing the following resolution:— That as the time is near at hand when by the operation of the Local Government Act, 1888, the dissolution of the Metropolitan Board of Works will bring to an end the connection which since 1855 has existed between that Board and the Westminster District Board of Works, and this Vestry successively, this Vestry desire to convey its thanks to Mr. T. J. White for the valuable services which he lias rendered, and its appreciation of the intelligence and uprightness which he has displayed as representative of this United parish upon the Metropolitan Board of Works during the period of 23 years: That the Vestry also desire to take this opportunity of bearing testimony to the zealous interest Mr. White has taken in the welfare of the parishes, and to the assiduous and successful manner in which, for upwards of thirty years, he has filled numerous and responsible offices in the parochial administration, 227 Attendances of Members. Appended to this report is given a summary of attendances of Members at the Vestry and Committee meetings during the year. Committees of the Vestry. At the first meeting of the Vestry after its re-constitution in May, the Standing Committees were revised in compliance with the Bye Law No. 32. Two of the Standing Committees (the Works and General Purposes Committee and the Street Cleansing and Sanitary Committee) were amalgamated to consider a reference from the Vestry having for its object the establishment of a system of street cleansing, watering and dusting, entirely controlled by the Vestry, in preference to the execution of such service by contract. The proceedings of this Committee are summarised hereafter. The Works and General Purposes Committee. The United Vestry, consisting of one hundred members, having taken the place of the late District Board of Works with its fifty-seven, it was deemed advisable to enlarge this Committee from eighteen to twenty-four members, as provided in the 32nd Bye Law. The Committee underwent revision at the meeting of the Vestry on 13th June, the following being its composition, viz.:— St. Margaret. John Burman Thomas Butler Joseph William Hiscox John Kent Zephaniah King George James Lough Hon. A. G, J. Ponsonby, J.P. William Mailes Power Major-General Charles Alexander Sim George Francis Trollope David Verity Charles Wright St. John. William John Bennett William Davis Herman Olsen Hambom John Hayler Thomas Horn Frederick Seager Hunt, M.P. William Lewis Josephs James Margrie Charles Christmas Piper Frederick Rose Christopher Sweeting Charles Wright Q 2 228 At the first, meeting the Hon. Ashley Ponsonby was reelected chairman, and Mr. Thomas Horn re-elected vicechairman. Twenty-eight meetings were held, at which the ordinary street repairs, the general works, and the periodical reports of the surveyor were dealt with. These, with the special matters, upon which reports were submitted to the Vestry, were of the usual multifarious character. As authorised by the Vestry from time to time the Committee obtained tenders for the execution of various street and other works, the following being accepted by the Vestry, viz.:— The Limmer Asphalte Paving Company, for laying asphalte in various courts and places in the district. Boyce, C. J. & Co., for fiushers' hose. Neal, Messrs., for planting and maintaining plane trees in Grosvenor Road. Improved Wood Pavement Company, for laying with wood the carriageways- of King Street, Dacre Street, Bessborough Gardens in Vauxhall Bridge Road (margins of), and for the general maintenance and repair of wood paving. Neave, J. H., for general sewerage works. Among the matters which engaged the attention of the Committee may be mentioned the proposal to widen the Kensington Road by the Alexandra Gate. A letter was received from H. M. Office of Works on the 18th October stating that "the Board contemplate effecting an improvement at Alexandra Gate by altering the position of the gates and fence adjoining." The Committee were authorised by the Vestry to wait as a Deputation upon the First Commissioner of Works to urge the desirability of extending the improvement beyond the limits proposed by that department. The Committee were successful in gaining an interview with the Rt. Hon. David Plunket, M.P., the First Commissioner, at which they suggested an 229 alternative plan of effecting an important widening of the carriageway and footway at the place in question. Encouraged by the promise of the First Commissioner to consider a definite proposal in writing if one were submitted to him, the Committee, in December, drew up a scheme for setting back the wall and railings of the park. In reply to the proposal the Committee received a letter from H.M. Office of Works on the 31st December, disapproving of the plan prepared by the Vestry, stating that "it would involve the removal of several well-grown trees," but adding that if the Vestry were disposed to submit an amended scheme for setting back the footpath on a higher level, from a point a little to the west of the Albert Hall, the First Commissioner would consider whether the proposal could be recommended to the Crown and the Government for adoption. Upon the receipt of this letter the Committee viewed the locality and unanimously recommended the Vestry to adopt the suggestion of Her Majesty's Office of Works. The scheme and the amended plan received the approval of the Vestry, and the latter was forwarded to the First Commissioner, whose decision had not been communicated to the Vestry at the close of the year. As the result of negotiations with the Surveyor of the Metropolitan Police, the Vestry, upon the recommendation of the Committee, agreed to surrender a piece of land at the north end of Cannon Row, for the purposes of the new police offices, upon the payment by the police of a sum of £200 as a contribution towards the cost of erecting a urinal elsewhere in the parish. The Committee, as reported in previous years, again received numerous complaints which compelled thein to call the attention of the Metropolitan Board of Works to the incapacity of the main line sewers, with a request that some steps might speedily be taken to prevent the flooding of basements during heavy rains. Here, as in previous years also, the matter ended, the central board not having 230 taken any steps, so far as the Vestry were informed, towards providing a remedy. An important application engaged the attention of the Committee at various sittings, viz., that of Messrs. J. & A. E. Bull, on behalf of the Army and Navy Co-operative Society, for the construction of an enclosed bridge across the highway of Howick Place. Although the Vestry suggested to the Metropolitan Board of Works that the application should not be granted, a communication was ultimately received from that body stating that the proposal had been acceded to. A reference from the late District Board on 14th March, 1888, as to the possibility of effecting an important street improvement by widening Caxton Street, between the Medical School and the Livery Stables, repeatedly engaged the attention of the Committee throughout the twelve months, but the subject was in the hands of the Surveyor at the close of the year. Amongst other important matters which called for the Committee's judgment during the year may be mentioned:— General line of buildings at Albert Gate. Vacant land fronting Ambrosden Avenue. The Barlow Bequest. The lighting of Bremner Road. The re-naming of numerous thoroughfares and renumbering of houses. A proposal to light Victoria Street with Electricity. Ditto at Hyde Park Gate. Subway under Howick Place. Formation and drainage of Imperial Institute Road. Proposal to widen a portion of Strutton Ground. The suggested incorporation of Westminster. The erection of public retiring rooms and "Kiosks." The removal of the cab-rank and urinal at Knightsbrige Green. 231 As to continuing the line of thoroughfare from Marsham Street to Vauxhall Bridge, across the site of Millbank Prison. The planting of plane trees in the Grosvenor Road. The Street Cleansing and Sanitary Committee. At the re-election of this Committee thirty-five members sought seats upon it, the Vestry's choice falling upon the following, viz.:— St. Margaret. Joseph Keech Aston George Barber James Brend Batten Thomas Bond,M.B.,F.R.C.S. Thomas Butler Henry Lovett Cameron William John Cooper James Fergusson Zephaniah King William Mailes Power William Swingler George William Tallents St. John. John Ashby William Henry Baker William John Bennett Thomas William Davies William Davis Herman Olsen Hamborg William Lewis Josephs James Lane Charles Christmas Piper John Hopkins Pugh,M.R.C.S. Henry Smith Christopher Sweeting Mr. William Lewis Josephs was re-appointed Chairman, and Mr. John Fergusson, Vice-Chairman, at the first meeting of the Committees. During the year the Committee met twenty-three times and at each ordinary meeting the usual reports of the surveyor and inspectors as to the manner in which the contractor for street cleansing, watering, and removal of dust, was fulfilling his obligations to the Vestry were considered and dealt with. The entries in the registers recording the work done by the inspectors in the sanitary supervision of the parish were also read to. and acted upon by, the Committee from time to time. The Committee have continued to give effect to the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, 232 whereby the following articles have been purchased and reported upon by the Public Analyst, Dr. A. Dupre, viz.:— Articles purchased. Genuine. Adulterated. Convictions. Butter 12 ... ... Milk 20 1 1 Tea 6 ... ... Coffee 7 ... ... Preserved Peas 1 ... ... Pepper 1 ... ... Lard 1 ... ... The penalty incurred in respect of the adulterated sample was 12s. 6d. and 2s. costs. Towards the close of the year the grave attention of the Committee was called to a complaint (No. 34,) as entered upon the Inhabitant's Complaint Book, on behalf of the Justices in Pettty Sessions, by their Clerk, Mr. Warrington Rogers, founded upon a statement that five cases of diphtheria, three being fatal, had occurred in a house in York Street, and that no steps had been taken by the inspector to obtain the proper disinfection and fumigation of the place. Immediately the chairman and vice-chairman were authorised to make careful inquiry into the facts of the case, the result of which was duly laid before the Vestry. The attention of the Committee was eno-asred on several i ) o occasions upon communications from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the People forwarding reports made by that body upon an inspection made by them as to the sanitary condition of upwards of 500 houses in various parts of the parish. The Committee called the special attention of the Medical Officer of Health to the properties in Smith's Rents, Horse Shoe Alley, Lewisham Street, Artillery Square, and York Buildings, and requested him to inspect the same and report thereon as contemplated by 233 the Artizans' Dwellings Act, 30 and 31 Vic., cap. 130, sees. 5 and G, and the amending Acts, and instructed the inspectors to visit the places and report upon each of the defects specified. The inspectors submitted, from time to time, their reports as to the sanitary condition of the places mentioned by the Mansion House Council, and the Committee gave instructions as to the remedial measures to be adopted. The consideration by the Committee of a letter from the Coroner, alleging misconduct on the part of the mortuary keeper led, after a painstaking inquiry into the circumstances of the case, to the framing of regulations for the use of the mortuary, which received the approval of the Vestry on the 14th November. Joint Committee Acting upon a reference by the Vestry on 27th June, 1888, the Sanitary Committee sat jointly with the Works and General Purposes Committee to consider and report upon the question of improving the system of inspection, of obtaining a service of street cleansing, watering, and dusting more commensurate with the present payments and requirements, and of rendering the general sanitary administration of the parish more efficient. The Committee, on 28th November, submitted a lengthy report to the Vestry, of which the following is an abstract, viz.:— The desirability of "obtaining a service of street cleansing, watering, and dusting, more commensurate with modern payments and requirements" having been assented to by the Vestry, your Committee applied themselves at once to the consideration of the probable requirements of the Vestry in the matter of wharf accommodation for such a service. Your Committee next received plans from the surveyor, and by their Sub-Committee inspected the premises named below, with reference to their suitability for the requirements of the Vestry:— Wharf No. 1.—Approached by an easement from High Street, Vauxhall: superficial area, 17,000 feet; river frontage, 170 feet; no stabling; rent, £800 per annum. Wharf No. 2.—In Grosvenor Road, opposite Bessborough Place; superficial area, about 20,600 feet; river frontage, 130 feet; 234 large residence at entrance; stabling for six horses; rental, £700 per annum. Wharf No. 3.—In High Street, Vauxhall, adjoining flour mills: superficial area, 18,500 feet; river frontage, 100 feet; rental, £500 per annum. Wharf No. 4.—In Grosvenor Road, facing Ponsonby Place: superficial area, 17,000 feet; river frontage, 117 feet; two houses on wharf; stabling for 12 horses; covered sheds, and steam engine; lease, 20 years; rental, £250; premium, £4,500. Wharf No. 5.—In Millbank Street, adjoining the Vestry's present wharf on the south : superficial area, 6,795 feet; river frontage, 45 feet; small stable buildings ; rent, £320 per annum. The whole circumstances were reviewed in a report of exceptional length. Upon the following motion being submitted to the Vestry, viz.:— That the acts, proceedings, and recommendation of the Joint Works and General Purposes Committee and Sanitary Committee as now submitted in paragraph No. 4 of their report be and they are hereby approved and adopted, and that the offer of the lessor of the Pimlico Wharf, in Grosvenor Road, opposite Bessborough Place, to sell his interest therein, including the surrender of lessee's unexpired term of 40 years, for £3,500 be accepted. An amendment was proposed and carried by 51 votes to 7, viz.:— That the debate be adjourned to this day fortnight to enable the Committee to prepare 'a case' immediately, and to take Counsel's opinion on the effect of the covenants of all the leases of the proposed wharf, in view of all the circumstances. Subsequently, at the meeting of the Vestry on the 12th December, the Solicitor read "the case" which he had prepared for the opinion of Counsel, and the opinion of Mr. W. Co well Davies, Q.C., thereon. The Vestry, in view of the opinion of counsel, as to the acquisition of Pimlico Wharf, resolved, upon the motion of Mr. T. J. White, seconded by Mr. T. Horn, That it is urgently necessary that the contract system of street cleansing, watering, and removal of dust be discontinued, and that the work be undertaken by the Vestry at the earliest opportunity; and that so much of the Committee's report as relates 235 thereto be referred back with instructions to obtain more suitable premises than those now proposed, and to report thereon without loss of time. In view, however, of the difficulty of submitting a recommendation to the Vestry in time to admit of the resolution of the Vestry being carried into effect so early as Lady-day, the Committee were authorised to ascertain from the present contractor upon what terms he would be prepared to continue the existing contract for six, nine, or twelve months, at the option of the Vestry, from Lady-day next. Accordingly the Committee after an interview with the contractor was enabled to submit terms to the Vestry, who decided to accept the offer of Mr. Cookson to continue the street cleansing, watering and dusting for a further period of four months from the 25th March, 1889, for the sum of three thousand pounds. The Committee subsequently held five meetings in the discharge of the further duties imposed upon them, and, after causing enquiries to be made as to suitable wharf and stable accommodation within a reasonable distance of the parish, viewed the undermentioned premises:— Lambeth Vestry Wharf, Belvedere Road The Gas Light and Coke Company's Wharf in Millbank Street Ludford's Wharf in Millbank Street, and stables in Tufton Street Yard and Premises in St. Ann's Street Burnett's Wharf, High Street, Vauxhall Carter's Yard, Horseferry Road Messrs. Trollopes' Wharf, High Street, Vauxhall Providence Wharf, High Street, Vauxhall. The Committee submitted their unanimous opinion that the last-named premises, which have been used for several years for the deposit and loading of manure and refuse of various kinds, are admirably adapted to all the purposes of the Vestry, as contemplated by the reference, and as may 236 hereafter be required for storage of materials for the paving of the carriageways or footways, as well as for the general purposes of the Vestry. The wharf has a river frontage of 150 feet, a depth of 200 feet, substantially built stablincr for 25 horses, dwelling house for foreman, stores, sheds, and weighbridge, and is well paved and drained. The present tenant, who is stated to have expended some £6,000 upon the premises, holds under a lease of which 14 years are unexpired, at a rental of £550 per annum, and is prepared to assign his interest, including all the buildings, the weighbridge, &c., to the Vestry for £4,500, with possession at an early date. The solicitor, under the instructions of the Committee, perused and reported upon the covenants of the existing lease ; and the Committee were unable to find anything to prevent the use of the premises for the purposes of the Vestry. The Committee were also informed that in the event of the Vestry hereafter desiring to obtain an extension of lease, or a new lease, there was no reason to apprehend any difficulty in obtaining covenants for purposes similar to those for which the Lambeth Vestry wharf, under the same freeholders, was used. Guided by these circumstances and by the resolution of the Vestry on the 12th December last "That it is urgently necessary that the contract system . . be discontinued and that the work be undertaken by the Vestry at the earliest opportunity," the Committee were unanimous in recommending that the lessees of Providence Wharf, Vauxhall, be offered the sum of £4,000 for the remaining 14 years of their lease at £550 per annum, the Vestry to bear the lessees' costs to the extent of £105. The recommendation of the Committee was, upon a division, agreed to by 40 votes to 11. The further proceedings of the Vestry on this question taking place after Lady-day, cannot be dealt with by this report. 237 The remaining part of the reference, viz.: "that of improving the system of inspection . . . and of rendering the general sanitary administration of the parish more efficient" engaged the attention of the Committee at their various sittings, the following being the recommendations which received the approval of the Yestry, viz.:— That having regard to the increasing age and infirmity of Inspector Williams, he be relieved from duty as from the 31st January, 1889, and that a competent person possessing the necessary qualifications be appointed in his place, that it be referred back to your Committee to define the qualifications for the officer so to be appointed, to issue advertisements and to select not less than four candidates for the choice of the Yestry. That a superannuation allowance, calculated at the rate of £52, be granted to Inspector Williams, under the provisions of the Act, 29 Vic., Cap 31, and that the necessary steps be taken for confirming the same. That each inspector be henceforth provided with a uniform, and be required to wear the same at all times when on duty as inspector of nuisances. That the following be added to the duties of the inspectors, next after No. 183 That a register of the places specified in the foregoing order be provided for use in each inspector's district, and that the inspector be required to enter the date of his visit to each place so registered within 24 hours of the time of visit, and that such registers be laid upon the table at each ordinary meeting of the Sanitary Committee. The Yestry on the 13th March appointed, from eight candidates selected by the Committee, Thomas Ashdown and Thomas George Dee to be inspectors of nuisances, pavements, &c., vice Owen Williams, (superannuated,) and Charles Joseph Hughes, at a salary of £120 per annum, rising by annual increments of £5 to a maximum of £150. Inspector Lightfoot, who had been in receipt of a salary of £100, was also placed upon the same footing as the newly appointed inspectors. Other matters which engaged the attention of the Sanitary Committee during the year may be mentioned:— Obstruction of thoroughfares. 238 Reports from Mansion House Council as to sanitary condition of parish. Removal of bodies to mortuary. Voluntary notification of infectious disease. Inspection of cow-houses and slaughter-houses. Removal of snow. Standing of cabs on carriageways. Finance Committee. The Churchwardens and Overseers being ex- officio members of this Committee, it became necessary for the Vestry to select sixteen other members to make up the required number of seats, viz., 24, in accordance with Bye-Law No. 32. The sixteen seats were filled by the Vestry on 13th June in the following manner:— St. Margaret. Walter Bonwick Solomon Hymen Cohen Joseph William Hiscox George James Lough Walter Moseley Scudamore Colonel John Barton Sterling William Swingler Charles Wright St. John. Thomas Adams John Ashby William Henry Baker George John Chappie John Hayler James Lane James Margrie Charles D. Steel The ex-officio members were:— St. Margaret. Churchwardens. Henry Arthur Hunt Joseph K. Aston Overseers. Zephaniah King James Benjamin Barnes St. John. C hurchwardens. M. Holman Bishop Charles Christmas Piper Overseers. Frederick Rose Thomas William Davies At the first meeting of the Committee after its re-election, Mr. Churchwarden C. C. Piper was appointed Chairman, and Mr. W. M. Scudamore, Vice-Chairmau, for the ensuing year. 239 The duties of this Committee which occupied much of the time at their ordinary meetings were the examination and checking of the Vestry's account books, and the contractors' and other creditors' accounts, the payment of instalments under precepts, of wages and salaries, and generally the supervision of the financial business of the Vestry. The Committee, towards the end of the financial year, gave their close attention to the preparation of the estimates of the sums required from the ratepayers for the relief of the poor (including the expenses of the recently created London County Council vice the Metropolitan Board of Works), the School Board for London, and the requirements of the parish for paving, lighting, street cleansing and sewering, as well as for meeting the wants of the Library Commissioners in the maintenance of the Free Public Library. The Committee were authorised to invest the sum of £615, bequeathed by the late Mr. Barlow for the maintenance of public urinals, £631 11s. 7d. of new 2¾ per cent. Consols being purchased. A scheme for the consolidation of the parochial charities was forwarded to the Vestry by the Charity Commission on the 19th December, 1888. The Finance Committee were authorised to make such representations thereon as they might deem expedient. The Committee reported their proceedings upon the draft scheme and the amendments which they had proposed to the Charity Commission, to the Vestry at its meeting on 27th February, 1889, their action receiving the approval of the Vestry by 34 votes to 8. In order to give effect to the resolution of the Vestries on the 26th July, 1886, as to the examination of the accounts by chartered accountants, the Committee enquired of Messrs. E. Moore & Son as to the terms upon which they would perform the service upon the specification approved by the Vestries on December 22nd, 1884, and accepted their 240 offer to carry out the examination of the accounts of the Vestries and of the late Board of Works, to 25th March, 1888, for £58. In the exercise of the authority conferred upon the Committee by the Vestry on the 14th November, 1888, they prepared and submitted under the Seal of the Vestry a series of representations to Sir Thomas Chambers, Q.C., &c , &c., Recorder of London, and Returning Officer for the London County Council Election, with the object of obtaining the business relating to the Election of County Councillors for Westminster being conducted at the Town Hall. In response to the request, Sir Thomas Chambers received a Sub-Committee, consisting of Mr. Churchwarden J. K. Aston, Mr. Churchwarden C. C. Piper, Mr. Overseer Z. King, Mr. Overseer F. Rose, and Mr. Baker, Chairman of the Town Hall Management, as a Deputation, attended by the vestry clerk, on the 6th December, when Sir Thomas Chambers handed to the vestry clerk a document appointing him Deputy Returning Officer for the Electoral Division of Westminster, and expressed his full concurrence in the representations made on behalf of the Vestry, which he hoped would be fully carried into effect as the result of the appointment then made. Upon the receipt of the renewal notices in respect of the premium on the guarantee policies of Mr. Aldin and Mr. T. E. K. White the Committee had their attention called to the practice of some of the offices of reducing the rate of premium in cases where the policies had been in existence for periods of five years and upwards, and of reducing the rate where collective policies are taken for two or more officers. The Committee thereupon caused enquiries to be made of the Guarantee Society, and of the Employer's Liability Assurance Corporation, and received offers which represented a reduction upon the present rates of £4 10s. per annum by the first named office and of £12 10s. per annum by the latter. The Committee therefore, caused 241 a collective policy to be taken out in the Employers' Liability Assurance Corporation in favour of the Yestry in the sum of £1,000 for each collector, at the annual cost of £37 10s. in lieu of £50 as hitherto. The Committee in January reported that they had deemed it desirable in view of the altered constitution of the Yestry to take the opinion of Counsel upon the question of the form in which the rates levied by the Vestry should in future be made, and that the substance of Counsel's opinion was that no alteration would be called for. Consequent upon the dissolution of the District Board of Works, the Committee had under consideration the matter of the Treasurer's and the Bankers' security in respect of the Poor Rate and the General Rates respectively, the question having been provisionally reported upon in connection with the conversion of the stock from 3 to 2¾ per cent. The security given by Mr. Joseph Crosthwaite upon his appointment as Treasurer in June, 1880, was £10,000 in Consols in respect of the Poor Rate; the London and County Bank at the same time being appointed Treasurer in respect of the District Rates, and giving security to the Churchwardens and others on behalf of the Vestries in the sum of £5,000 in Consols. The District Board, in March, 1878, appointed the London and County Bank Treasurer, on the Bank investing £5,000 in the name of the Board in their corporate capacity, by way of security. The total investment was thus £20,000. The Vestry, upon the recommendation of the Committee, resolved that under the altered constitution of the Vestry Mr. Crosthwaite, as Treasurer of the Poor Rate, give security in the sum of £10,000, and the London and County Banking Company, Limited, as Treasurer of the District Rates, give security in a like sum of £10,000, both amounts to be invested in Consolidated 2f per cent. Stock in the name of the Vestry in their corporate capacity, and the stock receipts R 242 to be deposited in the inner safe in the strong room as the Bye-law No. 44 directs. The Committee considered a reference by the Vestry upon a letter of Mr T. E. K. White, dated 7th July, submitting an application for an increase of his salary. Having regard to the number of assessments in Wards Nos. 1 and 3, St. John, and to the qualifications required for the successful collection of the rates therein, the Committee recommended that the maximum salary attaching to the appointment of collector for those wards be increased from £200 to £250 by annual increments of £10: and that the salary of Mr. T. E. K. White, the present collector, be increased to £210. Upon amotion that the Vestry adopt the recommendation of the Committee the following amendment was submitted and carried by 25 votes to 14, viz.:— "That the present maximum fixed for the payment of rate collectors is sufficiently high, and be for the present retained." Parliamentary Committee The eighteen members elected upon this Comnittee were as follows:— St. Margaret. Joseph Keech Ashton James Brend Batten Thomas Bond,M.B.,F.R.C.SDavid de Pinna John Fergusson Edgar Horne Hon. Ashley G J. Pon- sonby, J.P. George William Tallents William Edward Murray Tomlinson, M.P. St. John. Thomas Adams George John Chappie Benjamin Francis Conn Costelloe, M.A., B.Sc. Alexander FitzGerald Thomas Horn Frederick Seager Hunt, M.P. Charles Palmer Frederick Rose Alfred Wright Mr. J. B. Batten was elected Chairman, and Mr. Thomas Horn, Vice-Chairman. The Committee held seven meetings for the consideration of schemes more or less directly affecting the parish, as also 243 for the examination of numerous bills in Parliament, of which the following may be mentioned:— Advertisement Rating Bill. Beer Adulteration Bill. Electric Lighting Acts Amendment (ILL.) Bill. Horse Guard's Avenue Bill. Housing of the Working Classes (London) Bill. Local Government (Electors) Bill. Local Government (England and Wales) Bill. London Coal and Wine Duties Continuance Bill. Metropolitan Board of Works (Local Management, &c.) Bill. Metropolitan Fire Brigade Expenses Bill. Metropolitan Improvements Bill. Monumental Chapel (Westminster Abbey) Bill. Parliamentary and Municipal Electors (Registration) Bill. Personal Property (Exemption from Sale) Bill. Smoke Nuisances Abatement (Metropolis) Bill. Technical Education Bill. Vacant Grounds (Nuisances Prevention) Bill. Vaccination Bill. Vestrymen's Qualification Bill. Throughout the year the consideration of the Committee was necessary upon the general question of Electric Lighting. The approval of the Vestry was sought to applications for licenses or provisional orders on behalf of the following companies, viz:— House to House Electric Light Supply Company. South Metropolitan Electric Lighting Company. Kensington Court Electric Lighting Company, and Kensington and Knightsbridge Electric Light Company. London Electric Supply Corporation. Westminster Electric Lighting Company. The Vestry confirmed the resolution of the late District r 2 244 Board on 14th March, 1888, giving their consent to the Kensington Court Electric Lighting License subject to the applicants depositing with the Yestry before the commencement of the works a sufficient sum to protect the district against loss in respect of damage to the roadways or footways under the Vestry's jurisdiction, but so as not to create a monopoly. On 27th June, 1888, the Yestry gave its consent to the transfer of the license held by the Kensington Court Ellectric Lighting Company, to the Kensington and Knightsbridge Electric Lighting Company, Limited, as applied for by Messrs. Deacon, Gibson, and Medcalf, and the Board of Trade were informed accordingly. Later, the Vestry received a report from the Works Committee on a letter from Messrs. Deacon, Gibson & Medcalf, on behalf of the Kensington and Knisfhtsbridffe Electric Lighting Company, Limited, dated 20th June, requesting the consent of the Vestry upon their application to the Board of Trade, for a license to lay down wires in certain parts of the Knightsbridge Ward, and confirming an offer made by letter, dated 12th June,in respect of the Kensington Court Electric Lighting Company, of a contingent participation by the Vestry, by way of reduced terms for public lighting, in the profits of the undertaking, and gave its consent on the merits of the application, and without reference to the profits of the Company, for a license in so far as it affected the Knightsbridge part of this Parish. The Committee reported to the Vestry in October that they had had under their consideration the statutory notices of intention by various Companies to apply to the Board of Trade for electric lighting licenses and provisional orders in pursuance of the provisions of the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, referred to the Committee by the Vestry on 11th July, 1888, when the recommendation of the Committee with an 245 addition by the Vestry was agreed to in the following terms, viz.:— That the applications for licenses by the London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited, and the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, now before the Vestry, be objected to on the ground that the Vestry should retain the control of the lighting of the parish in its own hands ; and that it be referred back to the Committee to consider and report as to the desirability of the Vestry applying to the Board of Trade with that object in view. The Committee considered the reference on the question of the desirability of the Vestry applying for a license or provisional order for the lighting of the parish by electricity, and had their attention called to the provisions of section 1 of the Act of last Session (1888) amending the Electric Lighting Act, 1882, by which section it is expressly provided "that the grant of authority to any undertakers to supply "electricity within any area, whether granted by license or "by means of a provisional order, shall not in any way " hinder or restrict the granting of a license or provisional "order to the local authority, or to any other company or "person within the same area." Having regard to the provisions of the foregoing section, and to the circumstances generally, the Committee reported their opinion that it would not be expedient that the Vestry should, at the present time, make application for a license or provisional order for the lighting of the parish by electricity. The Vestry, however, passed the following resolution, viz.:— That the recommendation now submitted be referred back to the Parliamentary Committee, with power to enquire fully into the whole question of electric lighting, and with authority to enquire of the Lighting Corporations of London and the Provinces ; the Committee to have power also to inspect the works of any of the Companies in or near London formed for the purpose of supplying the light. The Committee in the course of their sittings up to Ladyday made active progress in their enquiry of the lighting 246 authorities of London and the provinces where the electric light had been tried, and shortly after Lady-day were enabled to submit to the Vestry a tabulative analysis of the replies received. The Vestry, on the 6th March, instructed the Solicitor and Parliamentary Agents to lodge objections to the several Provisional Orders and Licenses applied for by the following Companies, viz.:— Provisional Orders— Kensington and Knights bridge Electric Lighting. Metropolitan Electric Supply (Mid London). London Electric Supply Corporation Electric Lighting. Westminster Electric Lighting. St. George, Hanover Square, Electric Lighting. License— The House to House Electric Light Supply. At the same meeting the Vestry received communications from the Board of Trade, notifying that the Board had refused the applications for licenses by the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, and the London Electric Supply Corporation, Limited, on the ground that in matters of such magnitude Parliament should be afforded an opportunity to review the Board's decision. At the close of the year notification was received from the Board of Trade that they had appointed Major Marindin, R.E., to hold a public inquiry into the various applications for powers under the Electric Lighting Acts, 1882 and 1888. The Vestry petitioned Parliament in favour of the Advertisement Rating Bill, which was introduced by Mr. Burdett-Coutts, the Member for Westminster, with the object of rendering places used as advertising stations liable to contribute to the local rates. A "block" placed upon the Bill, in the interests of the bill posters, and the pressure of business in the House of Commons, prevented the Bill making progress during the year. In November the Vestry received statutory notice and plans from the Metropolitan Board of Works, of a proposed 247 Metropolitan Improvement of some magnitude at High Street, Kensington, the greater part of which is in the parish of St. Mary Abbotts, Kensington, and, on the recommendation of the Committee, instructed the Solicitor and the Parliamentary Agents to take all necessary steps to protect the Parish against loss of rates during the transition period in connection with the proposed widening and improvements. The Committee examined and reported upon the Monumental Chapel (Westminster Abbey) Bill, and the deposited plan and book of reference relating thereto, referred to them by the Vestry on the 12th December, 1888. The Bill provided for the erection of a chapel, and the maintenance therein of a burial ground, and in connection therewith necessitated other improvements in the vicinity of the Abbey. Provision was made for the compulsory purchase of lands, the application of portion of the surplus from the Coal and Wine Duties, the levying of rates, &c. The Vestry adopted the following recommendation of the Committee, viz :— "That the Solicitor communicate with the promoters of the Bill, and take such other steps as may be deemed necessary, with a view to securing the parish against loss of rates by the carrying out of the provisions of the Bill." Town Hall Management. The Churchwardens and Overseers have continued to exercise the obligation vested in them by statute relating to the management of the Town Hall, and they submit for the information of the ratepayers, a statement of their receipts and expenditure for the year ended at Lady-day, 1889, appended hereto. Accounts. Statements of the receipts and expenditure tor the year, of assets and liabilities, of contracts entered into, and other financial matters also form Appendices. Receipts and Expenditure. Exclusive of the Poor Rate, £42,973 7s. 8d. was expended by the Vestry during the year for the strictly local purposes of the parish, while the sum 248 of £51,502 8s. 1d. was paid under precepts to the Metropolitan Board of Works and the School Board for London. The total receipts from all sources inclusive of the Poor Rate, but omitting balances at the commencement of the year, was £155,932 4s. 1d., and the total expenditure amounted to £153,166. Rates. The Rates made by the Vestry to meet the various financial requirements for the year were as follows:— Poor Rate 1s. 7½d. in the pound. General Rate for local purposes 1s. „ „ General Rate for School Board 9d. „ „ Consolidated Rate 9d. „ „ Local Sewers Rate ½d. ,, „ Montpelier Square Rate 3d. „ „ Library Rate ½d. „ „ Executive. Pursuant to the 198th Section of the principal Act. the names and addresses of the Officers of the Vestry are published herewith (see pp. xix and xx). An Appendix, No. 4, is also given showing the dates and salaries of the several appointments. ORDINARY WORKS EXECUTED BY THE VESTRY. The principal works carried out during the year having been noticed in the report of the Works and General Purposes Committee and in the Surveyor's report (Appendix No. 3), it is only necessary here to give a brief reference as to the cost Paving. Irrespective of the carriageways laid with wood and asphalte, the repairs to roadways and footways have cost £3,909 3s. 9d., the work having been carried out by Messrs. Mowlem & Co., under a contract and schedule of prices. 249 Wood Paving and Asphalte. The following figures extracted from the audited accounts, show at a glance the expenditure under this head during the year :— Cash paid for new works £4,127 11 9 Ditto for maintenance and repairs 5,178 15 6 Ditto in repayment of principal of outstanding loans 7,396 9 0 Ditto in repayment of interest on outstanding balances 821 11 3 £17,524 7 6 Lighting. For lighting the public lamps throughout the parish, for providing and maintaining the lamp posts and lanterns, and for all other purposes connected with the public lighting, the Vestry paid the sum of £4,728 18s. 2d. in respect of the lamps under their control. The Gas Light and Coke Company have continued to supply the parish with gas at the rate of 2s. 2d. per 1,000 feet. Street. Cleansing, Watering, and Dust Removal. For these services, which are performed by Mr. George Cookson under contract, the Vestry paid £8,616 17s. 4d. The Vestry also provides for the use of the Contractor, at a rent of £500 per annum, a shoot at the wharf in Millbank Street, where there is a residence for the contractor's foreman, to ensure the more efficient execution of the work. STREET IMPROVEMENTS. Several street improvements have engaged the attention of the Vestry during the year. In alphabetical order may be mentioned the suggested improvement by Alexandra Gate, the proceedings upon which have been already noticed. As stated at page 47 of the previous report, the question of the possibility of acquiring certain properties in Caxton Street, between the Town Hall and James Street, for the purpose of widening that portion of the thoroughfare, occupied the time of the Works Committee at intervals throughout last year. The negotiations remained in the hands of the surveyor at the close of the year under review. Consent to the formation of a new road to be known 250 as the "Imperial Institute Road," leading from Exhibition Road to Queen's Gate, was communicated to the Vestry by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the approval of the Vestry was given to the construction of a sewer under the new road in question, the invert of the sewer to be in Portland cement and the remainder in hydraulic mortar. The Vestry at its meeting in October received intimation through its representative that the Metropolitan Board of Works had passed the following resolution, viz.:— "That the Board do apply to Parliament in the next Session for powers to carry out, as a Metropolitan Improvement, the widening of Kensington High Street, between Kensington Church and Palace Gardens, at an estimated net cost of £169,500, and that it be referred to the officers to prepare the necessary plans, estimates and books of reference." The rateable property in the parish affected by the proposed improvement amounted to about £2,650. The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Committee to watch the scheme in the interests of the parishioners. Their report on the subject has already been given. Arising out of a communication from the Earl of Meath, Chairman of the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, dated 10th August, relating to the approaching disposal of the site of Millbank Prison, the Vestry made representations to the Metropolitan Board of Works as to the desirability of continuing a line of thoroughfare from Marsham Street and Earl Street to the foot of Vauxhall Bridge whenever the site of Millbank Prison shall have been cleared. A communication was however received from that Board to the effect that at this period of the year (November) it was too late for any action to be taken in the matter. The question was referred to the Works and General Purposes Committee for consideration and report in the spring of 1889. In February the Vestry instructed the surveyor to make enquiries with a view to acquiring a piece of the forecourt by the side of the Riding School, for the purpose of widening Park Place, Knightsbridge. 251 The consideration of the Vestry was given to a letter from Mr. C. Spencer Smith, Clerk to the Governors of the Grey Coat Hospital, dated the 24th November, in the matter of a suggested widening of Strutton Ground, and a further letter from Mr. C. Spencer Smith, dated the 18th December, explaining that "some ten or twelve years ago the then surveyor to the District Board informed the Governors that the widening of Strutton Ground on the eastern side might at any time be undertaken," and that for that reason, "the Governors being always desirous of assisting such improvements," they had since declined all applications to renew old or to grant new leases ; adding that the additional rent derivable from the land proposed to be given up would amount to more than the interest on the purchase money if sold to the Vestry. The Vestry confirmed the opinion of the Works Committee that the proposed improvement would not be worth the suggested outlay, and the Governors were thanked for their disinterested consideration of the public interest shown in their letter. RE-NAMING STREETS AND RE-NUMBERING HOUSES. During the year several changes have taken place under this head. The Vestry in choosing new names for certain thoroughfares have been actuated by a desire to perpetuate the names of philanthropists and others who had taken a prominent part in the welfare of the parish during or prior to the last century. Formal requests were made to the Metropolitan Board of Works who, in acquiescence with the views of the Vestry, issued sealed orders for the re-naming of the undermentioned thoroughfares, viz.:— Old Name. Allington Street. Little George Street. Douglas Street (portion of). Ship Court. New Name. Arneway Street. Vandon Street. Walcott Street. Kifford Court. 252 Little Boar's Head Yard was incorporated with Boar's Head Yard, Brewer's Row with Brewer's Green Mews, Dartmouth Row with Lewisham Street, Lack's Cottages ' with Douglas Place, and Devon Place with Grosvenor Street. Streets in which houses were re-numbered:— Arneway Street. Bucking-ham Mews. Chapel Place, two houses in. King Street. Delahay Mews. King's Head Court. Laundry Yard. Queen Square Mews. Strutton Ground. Victoria Street. Great Peter Street. Grosvenor Street. Millbank Street. St. Ann Street. Great Smith Street. Edward Street. Brewer's Green Mews. Lewisham Street. Francis Street. Unhealthy Areas. SANITARY MEASURES. The Medical Officer reported upon the sanitary condition of certain premises in the parish referred to in a report received from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the People, as follows :— To the Members of the United Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster. Gentlemen, In compliance with your request I have examined all the places you have referred to me. First, with regard to Lewisham Street, I am sorry to say that the statement of the Inspector of the Mansion House Committee, with one or two trilling exceptions, is correct, and that the houses show a want of due inspection on behalf of your Inspector of a very grave character. Not only do the defects that are enumerated in the printed particulars exist, but the premises are filthily dirty, and in my opinion, in a disgraceful condition. The houses 27, 25, 24, and 22, are, in my opinion, not fit for human habitation, and ought to be at once demolished. I next visited Horse Shoe Alley, and found that the statement was mainly true. The yards were badly bricked, the drinking cistern was in almost every case connected with the eloset, and so far rendered exceedingly dangerous. None of the 253 dust bins had any lid, but I was informed, I do not know how truly, that the Sanitary Committee did not consider lids necessary. From this I entirely dissent. Smith's Rents.— I entirely concur in the opinion expressed by the Mansion House Committee that "This property should be dealt with under Torren's Act, and that the houses, closets, &c., should be at once demolished." Artillery Square.— This place is in precisely the same state as it has been for many years. I could not detect that there had been any illness, and the closet accommodation was in the same condition as when it was passed four years since by your Surveyor. The landlord employs a man to flush the closets, as directed by the Sanitary Committee, twice a day. The ventilation, although there are no back windows, is sufficient, as the Square is large and well-paved. I see no occasion to interfere with these premises. York Buildings.— These houses are cleanly, and generally in good repair, although there is no back ventilation. Ventilators such as I suggested some years ago, are placed sideways in each upper floor room. The only defect I think it necessary to draw attention to is that the water closet is supplied with water from the same cistern as the drinking water is drawn from, and that the drinking tap is directly over a drain. With these exceptions, I think the houses are fairly good. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, (Signed) BARNARD HOLT. The report of the Medical Officer of Health, in so far as it related to the houses in Lewisham street and Smith's Rents, was referred to the surveyor for the action contemplated by the Artizans' Dwellings Acts; the surveyor's report to the Vestry advised the demolition of the buildings. The Vestry forthwith ordered that copies of the reports of the Medical Officer of Health and the Surveyor be transmitted to the owners of the respective properties. All the parties were subsequently heard, upon which the Vestry passed and sealed Orders requiring the demolition of the whole of the houses. Mansion House Council. Four further reports were received during the year from the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the People, calling attention to sanitary defects at 520 houses and premises in the parish. 254 The Vestry gave the Medical Officer of Health authority to engage forthwith temporary assistance to inspect the premises referred to and others, and to take such immediate steps as might be necessary to ensure the remedy of the defects specified. The Medical Officer in a later report to the Vestry summarised, as under, the amount of work done by the temporary Inspectors. The number of houses examined were :— St. Margaret's 250 St. John's 659 Knightsbridge 63 Total 972 and as a consequence of the examination notices were served as under :— St. Margaret's 234 St. John's 152 Knightsbridge 63 Total 449 Underground Rooms. The Vestry were not called upon to take any action on the half-yearly reports of the District Surveyors of underground rooms or cellars used as dwellings, or sleeping places contrary to the 103rd section of 18 and 19 Vict., cap. 120. Public Mortuary. The total number of bodies received at the mortuary, Millbank Street, during the year, was 39. A few only were removed to the mortuary to await burial, in consequence of insufficient accommodation in dwelling houses or apartments, the majority being taken to the mortuary by the Police (riverside, street accidents, suicides, &c.), to await coroner's inquests. Cow-houses and Slaughter. houses. Notices of intention to apply for renewal of licenses were received in respect of eight cowhouses and ten slaughter-houses. The premises referred to in the notices were, as usual, inspected by the 255 Sanitary Committee, and having been found generally in a satisfactory condition, the Vestry offered no objection to the renewal of any of the licenses. Urinals. The Vestry submitted a proposal to the Vestry of St. George, Hanover Square, for the construction of a urinal and retiring rooms for women at the junction of the parishes over the King's Scholars' Pond Sewer, but that Vestry declined to entertain the suggestion or to appoint a Sub-Committee to meet a Committee of the neighbouring Vestry to confer upon the question. The urinal standing in St. Ann's Street " during the pleasure of the Governors of the Grey Coat Hospital "was ordered to be removed in consequence of the Governors having disposed of the land adjacent thereto for the erection of a clergy house for the St. Matthew's Church. Considerable attention was paid to a proposal received from the International Hygienic Society to erect Public Retiring rooms or a "Kiosk" in the parish, upon certain conditions and in accordance with plans submitted. The Works Committee granted an interview with the Managing Director of the Society, and after consideringalternative sites, the Vestry, upon the recommendation of the Committee, passed the following resolution :— " That the Vestry give their consent so far as they legally may, to the erection by the International Hygienic Society, of a kiosk on the proposed site by the Sessions House, according to plans to be approved by the Committee and subject to the execution of an agreement in such form as the solicitor to the Vestry may approve." Although the above resolution was passed in October, 1888, no "Kiosk " had been erected at the site in question by Lady-day, 1889, when the matter remained in the solicitor's hands. In November, 1888, representations were made to the Vestry by some 40 ratepayers at Albert Gate, Knightsbridge, urging upon the Vestry the desirability of demolishing the urinal at Knightsbridge Green. The Memorialists 256 stated that the urinal situated at the west end of the cab stand, having regard to its situation, was a standing disgrace and a most offensive nuisance; that the residents on both sides of the road at Knightsbridge were "unable to look out from their windows without encountering scenes and exhibitions of a character disgusting and repulsive to delicacy, unfit for adults to witness, and demoralizing in the extreme to the younger branches of the residents' families—no one with any propriety of feeling could countenance the continuance of such sights." Ultimately, in March, 1889, after the matter had been thoroughly considered by the Works Committee in con. nection with negotiations with the Chief Commissioner of Police for the removal of the cab-stand, the Vestry ordered that the urinal at the west end of the cab stand be forthwith removed. This urinal was erected in 1878 under a contract with Messrs. Mowlem & Co., at a cost to the ratepayers of £165. Its removal cost £59. METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. Representative of the Parish. Mr. T. J. White, who was originally chosen in October, 1866, and who was re-elected in June, 1886, continued to hold the office of representative of the parish until the Metropolitan Board of Works succumbed to the operations of the Local Government Act, 1888. Precept and Rate. The call made upon the ratepayers of the parish for the purposes of the Metropolitan Board of Works was for £24,365 11s. apportioned as follows:— Main Drainage £3,505 7 7 Fire Brigade 2,261 13 9 Bridge Expenses 2,785 4 9 General Improvements 9,571 15 3 All other purposes 6,241 9 8 £24,365 11 0 257 A further call of £2,071 16s 5d. was made on account of the Government property in the parish, and of the grant made by H.M. Treasury in lieu of rates thereon. In anticipation of the expiry of the functions of the Metropolitan Board of Works by the operation of the Local Government Act, a further demand was received on 1st February, requiring the Vestry to raise and pay over by the 1st March the sum of £7,246 6s. 3d., being for the three months ending 31st March, 1889. It may bo explained that this extra demand was due to the fact that the financial year of the Metropolitan Board of Works expired at Christmas, whereas that of the newly elected County Council commenced at Lady-day. The contributions made by the ratepayers in the parish to the funds of the Metropolitan Board of Works, in satisfaction of their precepts since the commencement of their operations in 1856, to the present year, are shown by the undermentioned figures :— Year. £ s. d. 1857-58 1,357 12 10 1858-59 1,510 15 7 1859-60 5,188 10 0 1860-61 5,680 10 0 1861-62 5,879 15 8 1862-63 5,475 9 8 1863-64 4,651 12 3 1864-65 11,041 7 7 1865-66 7,046 18 6 1866-67 3,673 16 10 1867-68 8,935 16 10 1868-69 7,780 17 0 1869-70 8,073 0 3 1870-71 9,609 19 6 1871-72 6,123 6 11 1872-73 5,229 5 9 Carried forward £98,258 15 2 S 258 Year. £ s. d.

ANNUAL REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION OF THE PARISH of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminister, Ending March, 1889, By BARNARD HOLT, F.R.C.S, Medical Officer of Health. To the Members of the United Vestry. Gentlemen, The present report will present only a portion of the advantages that will accrue to the United Parishes by the appointment of fresh Inspectors, whose main duty will be to devote their time to sanitary improvements. The varied duties have heretofore mainly prevented such a constant survey of the parishes as is absolutely necessary, not only to add to the comfort of the poor, but to protect them from recurrent illnesses, to which they have been hitherto subjected A great portion of the property in Westminster is of so old a date that patching and repairing only temporarily remedy the evil, and ere long it must become necessary to pull down very many of these old houses and re-build them with more modern improvements. Since the new Inspectors have been appointed a very much larger number of houses have been visited, and very considerable improvements have been effected, which must eventually decrease the death rate. The number of births registered during the present year has been 811 males, and 725 females, or a total of 1,536 births, while the deaths have numbered 509 males, and 461 females, or a total of 970 deaths; from these, however, must be deducted 45 as having occurred through accidents, which reduces the actual number to 925. The deaths during the year 1888 were 1,241, thus showing a decrease of 316 deaths as compared with the previous year.

The death rate for the year is 19 per thousand, the previous year being 19.1. In October, 1888, several cases of Diphtheria were met with, many of them terminating fatally, and this continued more or less until January of the present year, when the disease practically subsided. In January, however, a special epidemic of Measles occurred, resulting in no less than 21 deaths, out of which 15 cases were communicated to me by the local surgeons, this information being of such value that I was enabled to have all the houses in which the disease occurred critically examined, and the sanitary defects remedied. Diphtheria has now quite subsided, but the epidemic of Measles continues. Every effort is being made to arrest its course, and strict injunctions have been given to parents to prevent the intermingling of children so affected as far as is possible. The principal Infant School has been for a time closed, and every house has been inspected, and, where necessary, has been disinfected and cleansed. 271 The cow-houses, slaughter-houses, and bake-houses have been from time to time examined, and found generally to be in a satisfactory state. The following is a summary of the Improvements that have been made during the year :— Drains cleansed and repaired 295 Defective drains destroyed and new ones constructed 53 Water closets repaired 69 Water butts cleansed and repaired 32 New pans and traps fitted to closets 2 Water laid on to closets 92 Sinks trapped 116 New cisterns or water butts constructed 30 Dust bins constructed and repaired 192 New manure bins constructed 6 Stables cleansed and repaired 4 Yards paved and repaired 59 Walls of yards and wash-houses lime whitened 29 Interior of houses cleansed, disinfected, and white-washed 464 Occupants removed from over-crowded houses. 15 Cellar flaps and area gratings repaired 9 Bakehouses cleansed and repaired 49 Dangerous structures removed and repaired 3 Bodies removed to mortuary 39 I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, Your faithful Servant, BARNARD HOLT. 272 APPENDIX No. 3. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SURVEYOR TO THE UNITED VESTRY OF ST. MARGARET AND ST. JOHN, WESTMINSTER. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report upon the works and services executed under this department, together with various other matters relating to the general business. maintenance of street carriageways. The quantity of materials used in maintaining and keeping in repair the carriageways throughout the district is as follows, and this quantity includes the gravelling of wood paving in frosty weather :— Broken Guernsey Granite1528 yards ,, Stones 69 ,, Flints 781 ,, Hogging 501 ,, Gravel 479 ,, WOOD PAVING. I am still enabled to report favourably upon the condition of the wood paving generally, and, with the exception of a few repairs, am under the impression that very little will be required for the next few months, upon some of that first laid, but to make it more clear I submit the following table :— When laid. Road. Quantity Yards. First Cost. Cost per yard for this year. £ s. d. Aug., 1880 Buckingham Gate 1,274 698 15 4 10d. per yard.

MASONS AND PAVIORS' WORK. Messrs. Mowlem & Co. have executed, as your contractors, new works and repairs to footways, channels, crossings, and roads under my superintendence and at the contractors' schedule of prices in the following streets :— Victoria Street York Street Bridge Street Great George Street Vauxhall Bridge Road King Street Francis Street Lowndes Street Rochester Row Knightsbridge Grubb Street Brompton Road Great Smith Street Ennismore Gardens Tachbrook Street Montpelier Square Caxton Street Hill Street HOARDING AND ROAD OPENING LICENSES. During the year 35 licenses for erecting hoardings upon the public highways for repairing or building purposes were granted ; also 100 licenses for opening roads or footways, for laying or relaying drains, repairing water pipes, and other purposes, and 3 for laying down straw. The whole of the surfaces disturbed and drains constructed were charged to the applicants, together with straw removal. STREET LIGHTING. The lighting of the district is carried out by the Gas Light and Coke Company, and at the present time there are 1,323 lamps, the greater number of which are lighted and cleansed for £3 0s. 8d. per lamp per annum. This does not include the 45 lamps in Parliament Street and Whitehall. MAINTENANCE OF SEWERS. All brick and pipe sewers have been flushed, cleansed, and disinfected, and the gullies have been regularly emptied and disinfected. During the hot weather they were flushed by T 274 means of water every week, and all courts, passages, and narrow roads were also thoroughly washed with water. The sewers throughout the district are in a tolerably good condition, although small repairs have been necessary from time to time, but owing to our sewers being subject to fioodings or holding back of flood water, the district is not at present given the outlets desirable. The following improvements and alterations in gullies have been carried out, and new pans inserted, which form a better system of trapping, but are more frequently stopped by mud being swept into them by road-sweepers. Stanford Street St. Matthew Street Wheeler Street Old Pye Street Grubb Street King Street New Tothill Street Hessborough Gardens. But while touching this matter I would submit that it is necessary that certain streets should be properly sewered, as the present system of drainage is unknown, as it is by a back and combined system far from perfect, and sooner or later will bring sickness and trouble in these streets, of which the following are the principal:— Carey Street, No. 12 to Vincent Square Vincent Square from Carey Street to No. 5 ,, ,, (East side of St. Mary's Church) ,, ,, (South side) from Edwards Street ,, ,, to Bloomburg Street ,, ,, No. 53, Bentinck Street ,, ,, (West side) the whole length. Fynes Street Earl Street Hudson's Terrace Buckingham Cottages from Rochester Row Regency Street, from Dorset Street to Vauxhall Bridge Road Vauxhall Bridge Road, from Mr.* 10 to Dorset Street Little Smith Street Bell Street from Rochester Street Kensington Road, between Gloucester Road and Princes Gate. public urinals. The public urinals in various parts of the parish, which are supplied with water, are cleansed and disinfected daily, and are in the following positions :— Trevor Square Vauxhall Bridge Road 275 Grosvenor Road Horseferry Road by St. John's Garden Horseferry Road by Grey Coat Hospital Laundry Yard Little George Street Broadway by St. James's Park Station Lewisham Street. I hope before long to erect urinals in parts of the district that will prove remunerative, clearly and entirely out of sight, and, while filling a great sanitary requirement, will repay for any extra outlay or any supervision necessary. SPECIAL WORKS AND APPLICATIONS. Give-and-take line, Sloane Street.—A give-and-take line was arranged at the corner of this street, at Messrs. Harvey, Nichols & Co., in which 25 feet superficial was given to the public way and about 5 feet taken for building purposes. Imperial Institute Road.—A new road nearly 1,200 feet long was formed across the Horticultural Gardens, which has been properly sewered. It connects Queen's Gate with Exhibition Road. The application was made by Henry Hunt, Esq. Bridge, Howick Place.— An application was made on behalf of the Army and Navy Stores to construct a bridge across this Place, but when it came before the Building Act Committee of the Metropolitan Board of Works, at which I attended, it was unanimously refused. James Street Site for Soldiers' Institute.—It was thought desirable that an improvement should be affected here by purchasing a strip of land, but after many months treaty it was found impossible, and the scheme had to be abandoned. Trees. Grosvenor Road.—Tree in this road have been planted, and I have every hopes of their going on well, for they will, if they thrive, form a nice feature to this long stretch of river frontage. "Kiosks," Hygienic Company.—After submitting designs for Kiosks to be erected in several parts of this district, the arrangement required for them to enter into was too stringent, and they had to abandon the idea, which I am sorry, as they are doing well in several of the Metropolitan Parishes. T 2 276 Bessborough Place, Sewer Ventilators. Having received several complaints of bad smells arising from the road level sewer ventilators, I received the consents of the owners and have fixed two ventilating shafts in front of two of the houses. Improvement, Kensington Road by Alexandra Gate. Having submitted plan and model to the First Commissioner of Works, I hope to be able to report shortly that this improvement is in hand. Proposed Refuge, Tachbrook Street and Vauxliall Bridge Road.— The Vestry of St. George's, Hanover Square, having submitted a proposition for erecting a refuge at the junction of these two roads, on the boundary line of the two parishes, asked that we should assist in the maintenance; our half share would have been £20, and £7 per annum for gas, it was thought unnecessarv. Strutton Ground, Land proposed to be given up.—The Governors of the Grey Coat Hospital offered to throw in 8ft. of the footpath, at the south east side, at a cost of about £935, but the offer was not entertained, as the other side was thought best for such an improvement. St. Ermiris Hill.— Complaints having from time to time arisen from the nuisance at the north corner.it was ordered that a wall be erected, with a doorway, to be used for the storage of gravel, tools, &c. Improvement, St. James' Park Station.—Mr. Powell, Manager of the Metropolitan District Railway, state they are willing to carry out the give-and-take line, subject to the removal of the urinal. Demolition of Smith's Rents and 16' to 24, Lewisham Street.— The whole of this property was without any proper means of ventilation, the rooms were small and dilapidated, and the Medical Officer of Health and myself found that the defects could not be reinstated by any alteration or improvements, and that, in the interest of the public health, the premises ought to be demolished. Floodings in District.—I must again call the attention of the Vestry to the serious inconvenience caused by the backing up of the sewage into the basements of several houses in the district, and until main line sewers are more quickly relieved from storm water during high tides, by the erection of a pumping station, this district will be a greater sufferer, as every day contributes additional sewage and waste water from new 277 districts. This I look upon as a metropolitan improvement necessary for the better drainage of a Metropolitan parish, which has contributed to the main drainage scheme, which in this particular case is not effectual. I must also point out the great evil that arises from the gas that germinates from the quantity of sewage which is held back sometimes for hours through the want of proper relief from the main sewers, and until this defect is remedied, the great inconvenience which we suffer, together with the danger of sewage percolating and permeating the ground under and around the residences in the district, will still exist. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, G. R. WHEELER, A.M.I.C.E., Surveyor to the Vestry. 278 APPENDIX No. 4.

REPORT OF THE ELECTED AUDITORS, upon their examination of the vestry's accounts for the year ended at lady-day, 1889. To the Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster. Gentlemen, We, whose names are hereto subscribed, being auditors elected by the parishioners for the discharge of the duties specified by Sections 192, 195, and 196 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, have attended at the office of your Vestry, and have caused to be produced to us tbe books, vouchers, statements, and documents necessary to enable us to make a thorough investigation of the accounts for the year ended at Lady-day last. We have not, however, for the reasons stated in previous years, made such an investigation. It would be impossible for us, and, we had almost said, for any ratepayers to devote the necessary time from day to day, from 1st June to 8th July, to check the multitudinous details of the accounts. Between these dates the staff of the Chartered Accountants was engaged in checking the thousands of postings and castings on account of the different rates, work to which, while it is absolutely essential to the audit, we cannot be expected to apply ourselves for several successive weeks. Since the completion of the examination by the professional accountants we have seen their report, yet we have not relied upon it entirely as the basis of our certificate of allowance. We have tested for ourselves sufficient of the entries to enable us to certify on our own responsibility that the expenditure is properly vouched, that the accounts are neatly kept, and that the supervision of the entire system by the Finance Committee is both close and constant. We have to present herewith a summary statement* prepared in the same form as last year of the amounts given in collection, and the amounts recovered, to which is added, this year, an analytical statement with reference to the amounts not recovered in each of the collectors' districts. A similar statement to this was, See Appendix No. 6a, page 282. 280 we find, presented to the Finance Committee by the Vestry Clerk after our audit last year. In our judgment such an analysis is of great value as showing the wards in which the " losses " (so-called) are heaviest, and as specifying the causes to which such "losses" are attributed. The ratepayers are to be congratulated upon the very small per-centage (.27) of avoidable losses sustained, as shown by columns 8 and 9 of table II. We also note that the amount of recoverable rates outstanding at Lady-day was £1,648 6s. 10¾d. this year as against £3,733 2s. 4½d. last year, and that the total per centage of sums not collected (empties, &c.) is less this year by .65 per cent. Every readiness has been shown by the official staff to assist us to penetrate as thoroughly into detail as we might wish. RICHD. T. LEWIS, HENRY W. BUDD, ROBERT E. H. GOFFIN, T. BULL, THOS. H.

Vestry Offices, Town Hall, Westminster. Gentlemen, Pursuant to the order of your Committee we have examined the books and accounts of the United Vestry of St. Margaret and St. John, for the year ended at Lady-day last, in accordance with the specifications prepared by the late Vestries and District Board, modified to meet the altered circumstances. We find the summary Statements and Balance Sheet prepared for the Elected Auditors to be duly vouched, and true abstracts of the several accounts from the books of the Vestry. The creditable manner of keeping the books, upon which we observed from time to time in the case of the late Vestries and District Board is fully maintained under the new system. We are, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servants, (Signed) EDWARD MOORE & SON. 282 APPENDIX No. 6A.

Such larger amounts are included in the " additions." COLUMN 4.—These being statutory allowances made by the Vestry are not calculated in the total in Column 10. The two columns, 1 and 10, make up the total in division III. of Table I. COLUMN 5.— A very small portion only of this is excused on account of poverty. It includes such cases as where a public-house or other hereditament is rebuilt, during which a partial occupation of land by a temporary structure is continued, and a part only of the Rate is charged, as ordered in each case by the Committee. COLUMN 6.—This does not include Government occupations, but represents premises occupied by Ambassadors and Foreign Ministers, and other places exempt by statute.

Sir,— I beg to present to you my first Annual Report of the work done in factories and workshops from February 12th to December 31st, 1900. The number of workshops, &c. registered has been :— Bow. Registered 117 Removed from Register 11 Now on Register 106 In deference to the wish of His Majesty's Factory Inspector, the distribution of cards showing number of persons permitted in each workroom, has been discontinued, and at present only those rooms are measured which are likely to be occupied by the full number for whom they are adapted. During the year two work rooms have been overcrowded, but in each case the nuisance has been abated on serving an intimation. Sixty-eight workshops have been reported to His Majesty's Factory Inspector, the majority of these, though established for years, having previously been unknown and uninspected. In 4 workshops in Bow there was found to be no separate sanitary convenience for each sex. In 3 cases an additional one has been constructed, and in the remaining case, a convenience formerly 18 reserved for the family residing on the premises has been made available for the females. The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— Tabulated, statement of Inspections of insanitary conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, arc., duritig the year ending December 31 st, 1900.

San. Inst, 19 Public Health Department, December 31 st, 1900. To the Medical Officer of Health, Bom District. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my eleventh Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending December 31st, 1900, as follows :— Inspections on complaint of nuisances 487 Do on notifications of infectious diseases 143 Do. on house-to-house visitation 884 Re-inspections 2617 Making a total of 4131 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the " Public Health (London) Act," 1891. Of the total number (1514 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that 51.9 per cent, of the premises thus inspected various works of sanitary amendment—requiring the service of 786 intimations and 560 notices—were needed to be carried out. In many of these cases the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, on the service of the usual written intimations which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices; but in 12 cases it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating 9 attendances at the police-court to ensure their enforcement. The details and nature of Sanitary IVorks executed in the West Division during the year are as follows :— Walls and ceilings of houses cleansed throughout 26 partially 111 Drains opened and cleansed 162 Defective drains repaired 93 Inlets to drains properly trapped 15 Sink waste pipes properly disconnected from drains 3 Rainwater pipes do. do. 19 Water-closets re-constructed 4 20 Water laid on to soil pans of W.C.'s 94 Ventilation of W.C.'s improved 3 New soil pans provided where broken or unsuitable 22 Foul soil pans cleansed 27 Yards, areas, and forecourts, paved 37 Yards and areas drained 3 Nuisances from dampness remedied 88 Roofs made watertight 108 Eaves guttering of roofs and rainwater pipes repaired 106 Water supplies to houses reinstated 44 Water services for domestic purposes altered or improved 2 Water service fittings repaired 14 Public House urinals repaired and cleansed 5 Animals improperly kept (removed) 2 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 33 Bye-laws enforced 3 Other nuisances remedied, chiefly dilapidations 156 Overcrowding abated 2 Drains tested* by the application of the smoke drain test, of which 14.8 per cent, were proved defective 628 * Primary tests only. House to House Visitation. The house to house inspection referred to above comprised the whole of the houses in the under mentioned roads and streets— Beale Road. Candy Street. Chad Street. Clark's Place. Dane Place. Jodrell Road. Lamprell Street. Locton Street. Milton Road. Prince Arthur's Avenue. Ranwell Street. Ruston Street. Victoria Cottages. Wendon Street. Wright's Road. and sections of Appian Road and Parnell Road. New drainage systems, of which plans and particulars were submitted to the Board for approval, have been laid at the undermentioned premises:— Saxon Road, 17, 18. ftont areas only, Old Ford Road, " Lady Franklin," P.H., entire syste m. Libra Road, 92, new w.c. Old Ford Road, 225, new w.c.'s. Lefevre Road, "The Horns," cellar drain only. Roman Road, 270, new w,c. 21 Monteith Road, Board School, new w.c. Ford Street, 31, new w.c.

The following particulars show the work done in connection with infectious cases within my Division during the year :— Infectious patients removed to hospital 51 Rooms fumigated after infectious diseases 82 Infected bedding, clothing, &c., removed to the Board's apparatus, there disinfected and safely returned to their respective owners 82 Number of Disinfections certified by private medical practitioners to have been done on premises 7 In each house where an infectious case occurred, disinfectants have been supplied (gratis), the premises inspected and the drains tested by smoke, with the view of detecting insanitary conditions; the results of such inspections, together with other particulars, have been duly recorded on special forms and submitted to you, invariably within 24 hours of the receipt of each individual notification. One verminous bed was destroyed by request. During the early part of this year, on the demise of Mr. Raymond, late Inspector of Nuisances in Manufactories, very important increased duties have been imposed upon me, consisting of the attention to nuisances, &c., in 79 factories and workshops, constant periodical inspection of 22 bakehouses, and continued and close attention to smoke nuisances likely to arise from the various factories within the district. In the latter part of the year, by reason of the changes in local government, it has further devolved upon me to enforce the Regulations and Bye-laws of the London County Council (previously entrusted to that body) relating to offensive trades, slaughterhouses, cowsheds, and dairies; the periodical inspection of 69 registered milkshops in the district, and the enforcement of the regulations made by "The London County Council" on that behalf for the purpose of obtaining cleanliness in premises and utensils. 22 Parish of St. Mary Stratford, Bow (West Division).

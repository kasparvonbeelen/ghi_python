Pop7 Board of morks for the popular district. ANNUAL REPORT, YEl(R 1897, ON The Sanitary Condition with Vital Statistics of the Parishes of POPLAR and BROMLEY within the Poplar District, BY FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Diplomate in Public Health, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAL 0FFICER 0F HEALTH for the SOUTH DISTRICT. Comprising the Parishes of All Saints, Poplar, and Bromley St. Leonard. To the Chairman and Members of the Board of Works for the Poplar District. Gentlemen, I have the pleasure of placing before you my fifth Annual Report, which includes the annual reports of the Sanitary Inspectors for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley and the report of the Inspector of Nuisances in Manufactories and Workshops. This report, in 2 accordance with the regulations of the Local Government Board, deals with the year 1897, which year, for registration purposes, ended on 1st January, 1898. VITAL STATISTICS. The populations of the two parishes, estimated to the middle of the year 1897, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1891 and 1896 being maintained, are— Registration Poplar. Bromley. London. (a) 4,463,169 58,126 69,759 being 59.8 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 49.9 per acre in Poplar and 114.7 in Bromley, and these estimated populations are the pures used in calculating the various rates in the present report. In calculating the birth and marriage rates, also the general death and zymotic detail rates, as well as using the above-mentioned estimated populations, the same rates have been worked out with populations estimated in another manner, in order to be as accurate as possible when dealing with important rates which can only be arrived at for the year 1897 by dealing with estimated populations. The census, i.e. the enumerated population, was taken in March 1896, and it was found that the estimated population of the Parish of Poplar had been slightly under-estimated, and that of Bromley considerably over-estimated. The Registrar General makes up his returns to the middle of the year, and always estimates populations to the same period. The second manner in which the populations for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley have been estimated for purposes as stated above is as follows The unknown figures relating to emigration and imigration concerning the parishes have been eleminated. 3 Poplar. Bromley. Census 1896 5 7,759 69,821 Deaths in second quarter of year 1896 282— 338— 57,477 69,483 Births in second quarter of year 1896 457 + 666 + 57,934 70.149 Deaths last two quarters of year 1896 and first two quarters of year 1897 1,252— 1,39I— 56,682 68,758 Births last two quarters of year 1896 and first two quarters of year 1897 2,045+ 2,532 +- Estimated population (b) to middle of year 1897 58,727 71,290 For convenience the rates as mentioned above will be styled (a) or (b) according to the respective estimated population used. Poplar. Bromley. (a) 58,126 69,759 (b) 58,727 71,290 It is curious to note how the estimated populations (b) differ from the estimated populations (a) which last mentioned numbers are based upon the figures of the enumerations of the years 1891 and 1896, and estimated as if the populations increased in the same ratio per million of the metropolitan population for the year under observation. As no insanitary spaces were cleared in the parish of Bromley during the year 1897, it is more than probable that the estimated population of this parish would be represented by the larger figure. 4 Of course it is obvious that where there are two estimated populations the rate under observation will always be higher when the lower estimated population figures are used, and vice versa, but in order to compare the various rates in this report with those of London and its sanitary areas, the (a) populations except where mentioned— have been used as the populations of the Metropolitan sanitary areas are estimated upon the same theory. The births during the 52 weeks were:— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 952 960 1912 Bromley 1312 1209 2521 Totals 2264 2169 4433 Of these births 64 were illegitimate in Poplar, 36 males and 28 females. In Bromley there were 33 illegitimate births, 18 males and 15 females. The annual birth rate per 1000 living being;— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. Poplar 33.3 347 35.1 (A) 32.8 (B) 32.5 Bromley 36.3 37.9 37.4 (a) 36.1 (B) 35.3 During the year the marriages of 2164 persons were registered in Poplar and Bromley, giving an annual rate of 16.92 per 1000 of the estimated population, the rate for England and Wales being 16.0* and for London 18.5.† * The Registrar General states that 16.0 per 1000, is the highest rate in any year since 1876 and 0.9 per 1000 above the mean rate in the ten years 1887 96. † 18.5 per 1000 of the population is the highest rate recorded in any year since 1878. 5 The annual marriage rate per 1000 living being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. Poplar and Bromley 14.07 13.7 16.0 (a) 16.92 (b) 16.64 In the 52 weeks 968 deaths were registered in Poplar, and 1835 in Bromley; from the 968 deaths which took place in Poplar there must he deducted 55 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 317 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions making a total of 1230 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 835 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner viz., deducting 652 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 194 deaths in outying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1377. The 1230 deaths in Poplar include. 20 illegitimate children, 12 male and 8 female, and the 1377 deaths in Bromley included 16 illegitimate children, 7 male and 9 female. Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 672 558 1230 Bromley 720 657 1377 Totals 1392 1215 2607 The excess of births was as follows:— Males. Females. Total gain. Poplar 280 402 682 Bromley 592 552 1144 Totals 872 954 1826 The male births in the two parishes exceeded those of the female by 95, but the male deaths exceeded those of the female by 177, so that there is a gain of 82 females in the two parishes, 6 The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 13 years:— Poplar. Bromley. London. 1885 22.0 20.1 20.4 1886 21.7 15.6 20.6 1887 20.6 170 20.3 1888 21.5 18.9 19.3 1889 20.4 18.0 18.4 1890 27.4 15.9 21.4 1891 21.8 22.6 21.5 1892 23.8 21.3 20.7 1893 22.7 23.4 21.3 1894 19.4 19.2 17.8 1895 24.7 22.7 19.9 1896 a) 21.6 20.3 18.6 (B)21.5 20.2 1897 (A) 21.1 19.7 18.2 (b) 20.9 19.3 Although for comparison the death rates of London as a whole have been given, yet as pointed out in a former annual report the death rates ought to be compared with those of districts, the inhabitants of which belong mainly to the same class. In considering the variation of the death rates study ought to be given to any special conditions or circumstances which happened in the years under observation. Table V. page 13 gives the death rates of the various metropolitan sanitary areas, and it will be seen that the death rates for the year 1897 of the sanitary areas of the parishes of Poplar and Bromley compare most favourably with those of sanitary areas, the inhabitants of which exist under like conditions. The following are death rates per 1000 living from the seven principal zymotic diseases (see Tables VIII. and IX., pages 17 and 18 and respiratory diseases:— 7 ZYMOTIC DISEASES. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897.[##] Poplar 2.4 4.3 3.6 (a) 3.06 (B) 3.03 Bromley ... 3.3 4.0 3.6 (a) 2.9 (B) 2.8 RESPIRATORY DISEASES. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897[##] Poplar 3.3 5.2 4.0 3.6 Bromley .. 4.3 6.0 4.4 4.0 There were 330 deaths of children under one year of age, belonging to Poplar, and 414 deaths under one year of age, belonging to Bromley.

Notifications and Hospital Accommodation, Outworkers, and Port Sanitary Authorities' Notifications. There were 668 notifications of infectious diseases in Poplar and 1012 in Bromley; these do not include 65 second notifications. The notification rate per 1000 living being:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. Poplar 10.6 13.6 11.3 (A) 11.49 (B) 11.37 Bromley 12.9 11.9 13.8 (A) 14.50 (B) 14.19 Three of the scarlet fever cases notified were connected with milk shops, as follows:—In two instances the patients were reported from premises where milk was sold, in the third instance, the son of a scarlet fever patient was found to work at a milk shop. The usual steps were taken to prevent any likelihood of milk contamination. The difficulty in obtaining the prompt removal of infectious cases commenced about the beginning of July and continued very nearly to the end of the year, when the Park Hospital was opened at Hither Green on the 9th November. There is no question but that very great hardships were endured by the poor of the district, and infectious diseases were rendered liable to spread. The usual steps were taken during these times of want of modation as mentioned in previous reports. The Clerk to the Asylums' Board wrote on 21st December, asking, that, in the event of pressure upon the Board's accommodation again necessitating the temporary refusal of diphtheria cases, whether the Medical Officer would be willing to receive and distribute anti toxic serum, as the managers have reason to believe that in some cases (from causes beyond their control) delay has occurred before antitoxin is in the hands of the medical practitioner. A supply will be 23 sent, directly the emergency may he expected to arise, from the laboratory at the Examination Hall of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Surgeons, Victoria Embankment, W.C. Fourteen outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified, 1 in Poplar and 13 in Bromley. The usual notices were served. Five notices from Port Sanitary Authorities were received as follows: —Three notices from the Southampton Port Sanitary Authority; one notifying that a passenger was coming into the Poplar District from a troopship on board of which a death from plague had occurred, and two notices giving information that two passengers were coming by the troopship "Shanghai" from Bombay. One notice was received from the London Port Sanitary Authority of a passenger by the "Britannia" from Bombay and another notice was received from the Bristol Port Sanitary Authority of a seaman coining from a ship on which there had been a patient with small-pox; but in this instance, as well as in the case of one of the passengers by the "Shanghai," upon calling at the address given the persons did not arrive, although in the case of the seaman he was known at the premises stated on the notice. Several times the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums' Board has been communicated with respecting notifications received from the institutions in the district. Section 55 (1) (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requires, incase of an inmate of a hospital, the name of the place from which the patient was brought and the date of such bringing to be inserted on the notification. Patients who doubtlessly contract a notifiable disease in a hospital, even if they have been inmates of such a building for months, must have their complaint notified to the Medical Officer of the district from which they were brought. It is clear, from the strict rendering of the Act that the Medical Officer of Health of a district in which a hospital is situated may not know of the outbreak of an infectious 24 disease if the first cases occur among non-residents, and only the Medical Officers of Health of the districts to which those patients belong are notified. On the other hand one remembers a case where a child, brought into the district on a visit (at a private house), developed an infectious disease on the first day of his stay, and there was no question but that the disease was contracted outside the district; yet, under the Public Health (London) Act, Section 55, such cases would not be notified to the Medical Officers of Health of the districts from which they came but to the Medical Officers of the districts in which they were taken ill, and the Medical Officers of the districts where the diseases were contracted would not know of the cases. The medical attendant is only bound to notify an infectious disease once. The question arises, are infirnaries such as the Sick Asylum and the City of London Union Infirmary hospitals under the Act, and would the sick wards of the Stepney Union Workhouse and the Poplar Union Workhouse also be considered hospitals? It would appear that the Asylums' Board consider the Sick Asylum as a hospital. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT. The following figures give the number of premises disinfected, and the number of times the Board's apparatus was used for the two parishes, some thousands of articles being disinfected - Private premises. Board's apparatus. Poplar 460 392 Bromley 745 604 1205 996 Upon the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, the Board resolved that their steam disinfecting apparatus at Glaucus Street should be fitted with a patent "Automatic Recorder," which gives a graphic representation of the day's work, and the charts can be so used that the whole process of disinfection can be readily seen at a glance, viz., the time of day that the articles are put in the apparatus, 25 the steam pressure, temperature, and relays of steam used in each process. The instrument is under the control of the chief disinfector. The charts are brought daily to the Board's offices, and are, together with the book kept by the boiler-man for recording the premises from which articles are brought and the time of going out and the return of the vans, a great help to accurate supervision over the disinfecting work. The Committee have still under their consideration the fixing of an arrangement to the steam apparatus in order to make it impossible for both doors to be open at the same time, so that there can be no possible communication between the infected and disinfected compartments of the disinfecting house. There is also under consideration the fitting of some sort of vacuum apparatus for sweeping away the steam out of mattresses and bedding, so as to hasten the drying process and prevent the moisture which is sometimes of an unpleasant nature escaping into the house where the men are working. During the year the disinfecting vans were repainted of different colours in order to distinguish the van collecting infected articles from the one delivering disinfected clothing, &c. The Medical Officer of the London County Council wrote asking if the Poplar District Board would give opportunity to common lodging-house keepers in the district to free the bedding of their houses from vermin by passing it through the disinfecting oven of the Board. The Committee directed that the request be complied with, provided that such disinfection should not at any time interfere with the regular work of the department. A great step in the advance of sanitation was taken by the Board in agreeing to the recommendation of the Committee to build a bathroom in connection with the disinfecting house, so that the men engaged in the disinfecting work can undress and wash and have a place to remain in whilst their clothes are being disinfected or freed from vermin, which they sometimes get upon their clothing whilst removing articles from dirty houses. 26 A bath built in connection with the Disinfecting Station will not only be useful in enhancing the health of the Board's employes engaged in sanitary and disinfecting work, but can also be used by men employed in factories etc. before returning to work after infectious cases in their homes; they can be recommended to have a bath and their clothes disinfected at the same time, this being far better than making use of the public baths. SMALL POX. Three cases of small pox were notified during the year, one in Bromley and two in Poplar. The case in Bromley was from the Sick Asylum, the patient having been admitted from the Greenwich Hospital. The two cases in Poplar were from the Scandinavian Sailors' Home, and were seamen who had been admitted into the Greenwich Hospital from the Home. Mr. Hitchins, the Vaccination Officer, has kindly furnished me with the following statistics which are copied from those forwarded to the Local Government Board:— Births notified. 1896.—January to December. Vaccinations. Insusceptible. Dead. Poplar 2003 1219 7 213 Bromley 2559 1371 8 296 Total 4562 2590 15 5°9 1897.—January to June. Poplar 973 548 3 96 Bromley 1270 665 1 144 Total 2243 1213 4 240 During the time that this report was being written, the Vaccination Acts Amendment Bill was read for the first time in the House of Commons. The provisions of the Bill, which follow mainly the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Vaccination (which sat for seven years) 27 were expounded by the President of the Local Government Board. Arm to arm vaccination is to be abandoned and vaccination with gly???erinated call lymph is to be substituted. Calf lymph mixed with glycerine has now became universal in great continental centres, and it is found that admixture of the lymph with glycerine destroys all extraneous microbes without impairing the vaccinal activity of the lymph, so that there is security against possible risk of inoculation of other morbific germs. Vaccination is to be domiciliary, the vaccinator will be required to attend at the house of the child as in Scotland, and no parent is in future to be bound to submit his child to vaccination by any other means than calf lymph, and only calf lymph vaccinations will be recognised in the compulsory enforcement of vaccination. Vaccine stations will be unneccessary. The statutory age limit is to be extended from three to twelve months: the Royal Commission had reported in favour of an extension from three to six months. Repeated penalties are to be abolished: this was a recommendation made by the Commission in their ''ad interim" report. It will be remembered that the majority of the Commissioners in their final report advised that those who had a conscientious objection to vaccination might be exempted from their legal obligations by making a statutory declaration of the grounds of their objection, but Mr. Chaplin stated that he was unable to accept the recommendation that any one objecting to vaccination may escape the obligation by simply making a statutory declaration to that effect. SCARLET FEVER. The number of scarlet fever cases notified for the two parishes was slightly in excess of the notifications for the year 1896, but the total deaths were the lowest for the past five years. 1893.

One hundred cases were removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Board's hospitals from Poplar, and 204 cases from Bromley. The Committee, at their meeting on the 25th March, considered the question raised by the Vestry of St. Mary Islington, as to the alleged premature discharge of a scarlet lever patient from a hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board; the Islington Vestry had written suggesting that the Local Government Board should hold an enquiry into the practice of the Metropolitan Asylums' Board with reference to the discharge of patients. The Committee recommended to the Board that no steps be taken in the matter. A case of scarlatina occurred in a house at Cordelia Street. The mother failed to recognise the gravity of the case and allowed the child to run about the streets, but, as the neglect to isolate was not wilful, the Committee directed that on disinfection of the premises, no further action be taken. CONTINUED AND TYPHOID FEVERS. Two cases of continued fever were notified in Poplar and one in Bromley. The typhoid fever cases were:— 1893. 1894. '895. 1896. 1897.

The prevalence of diphtheria in this portion of the district caused a large amount of anxiety and was brought under the notice of the Sanitary Committee. Cubitt Town was the principal sub-division on the Island where the inhabitants suffered mostly from the complaint. The Cubitt Town and Glengall Road Board Schools were the schools in the affected area, but most of the cases were in attendance at the former school. It was pointed out to the Committee that a mild case of diphtheria could be easily overlooked, and, if considered by the parents as an ordinary cold and the child allowed to attend at a school, diphtheria would very likely break out. The Medical Officer of the School Board for London was informed of the large number of diphtheria cases happening among the scholars attending the Cubitt Town Board School. In the letter to him it was stated there was a rumour in the district that the disease was spread through the slates and pencils, and it was requested that he would lay this matter before the School Board in order that each E 34 child might have his or her own slate with pencil attached so as to limit any infection, as children are very apt to put the pencils in their mouths. The head master had taken the precaution to have the slates washed with a disinfectant. Fortunately there was no need to close any part of the school and after the Christmas holidays the disease much diminished on the Island. As there is a very strong opinion among certain authorities that diphtheria and other contagious and infectious diseases are spread through the attendance of children at schools, and that diphtheria has been very prevalent in towns since the passing of the Education Act of 1870, a very grave question to be considered is whether school rooms are properly ventilated. The London School Board have given in a general schoolroom 10 square feet of floor space per scholar and the height was ordered to be 13 feet, making 130 cubic feet. With 200 cubic feet per head the air would require changing six times per hour to keep the carbonic acid due to respiratory impurity down to 0.25 per 1000 volumes. One hundred and thirty cubic feet per scholar are little enough indeed when it is a fact that the amount of air required hourly in cubic feet for human beings in repose is as follows:— Adult males 3000. Adult females 2000. Children 1500. Therefore for an adult an air space containing 1000 cubic feet per head the air must be changed three times in an hour to provide the necessary 3000 cubic feet, but, if the space is not more than 500 cubic feet, obviously six changes per hour are required to supply the same quantity of fresh air. In a space of 130 cubic feet for each child the atmosphere must be changed eleven times to supply 1500 cubic feet of air. In temperate climates and under ordinary circumstances three changes per hour are all that can be borne; more 35 trequent changes than this produce cold currents of air and draughts. Upon very good authority it is stated that "The headaches and other symptoms ascribed to over-pressure in Board Schools may often really be attributable to the breathing of a foul atmosphere for many hours in succession." If school-rooms are not properly ventilated and children inhale vitiated air it is obvious that should any germs of disease be in such an atmosphere the scholars would be liable to fall ill. Sir Richard Thome, Medical Officer to the Local Government Board, in a lecture delivered at the Sanitary Institute, January 10th, 1894, on "The Etiology, spread and prevention of diphtheria" stated, The Education Department requires so much floor space per child, but if you have ever been into an infants' school, for example, you will have observed that of the available floor space some two-thirds are often monopolised by the teacher, it being necessary to aggregate the children at one end of the room. The greater the want of ventilation, also, the greater the risk." Sir Richard Thorne goes on to say:—"Aggregation under these circumstances recalls the reference to the hot-house plant. The children are brought together; they are aggregated in a sort of hothouse; there is often a want of due ventilation; there is overcrowding where they are aggregated, and in fact many of the circumstances that theoretically would tend to aggravate the virulence of the diphtheritic poison are present." With the ready means now at hand of testing approximately the impurity in the atmosphere of rooms, it is hopeful that, in the near future, some of the school-rooms in the district will be able to be practically tested. This is really necessary, as it is well known that the inhalation of pure air is one of the safeguards against disease. A suggestion occurs to one's mind that during the intervals of school 36 hours and more especially when an infectious disease is prevalent, it would be useful to spray the atmosphere, desks, etc. of school rooms with a solution of disinfecting fluid. As to the cause of the disease, it is very difficult to give any definite opinion. It might have been due in the first instance to a mild case which had been overlooked, for even during the prevalence of the disease children were known to have suffered from bad throats, and yet have not been notified as suffering from diphtheria. Subsequently the common symptoms which occur after diphtheria set in, thus clearly proving the patient had had the complaint. It was pointed out to the Committee that a naked eye examination of a throat could not determine whether a patient was suffering from diphtheria, and a like examination could not possible enable a medical practitioner to state whether a patient's throat was free from the germs, and that with a patient convalescent or even recovered from diphtheria the germs of this disease may be found in the throat for many weeks, and if such patient return to school there is grave danger of the complaint spreading among the scholars. Diphtheria notifications are most difficult matters to deal with, and at the present time there is under consideration a scheme for bacteriologically examining the throats of children before they are allowed to return to school. The medical practitioners of the district and its immediate neighbourhood are being communicated with. There is no doubt that a large number of cases of diphtheria notified are not the complaint, and a bacteriological examination can only determine this matter, for, as stated above, mild cases of diphtheria may be considered as simple sore throats and passed over as ordinary colds. There is no doubt that the medical practioners would be glad to avail themselves of any means in order to correctly diagnose such a dire complaint. The Committee directed that the ditches on the island should be cleansed, and during the prevalence of the disease they visited the 37 island and inspected these ditches, which receive the water from the River Thames by a penstock in the Deptford Ferry Road. As the Committee was informed that dampness was a factor which helped to cause diphtheria, and the Isle of Dogs being already an exceedingly damp section of the district, as it lies about 41/2 feet below the River Thames, the Committee directed that the penstock De kept shut down. The Millwall Dock Company and the London County Council also cleansed their respective ditches. The Committee also inspected the mud bank formed of the dredging from the Millwall Docks. This mud field is in the vicinity of the houses where the diphtheria prevailed, and as there is a feeling that such an accumulation might be injurious and dangerous to the health of the inhabitants of Cubitttown, the Committee later on recommended to the Board that Dr. Houston, M.B., D.Sc., F.R.S.E., an expert in the chemical and bacteriological examination of water and soils, at the Public Health Laboratory, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, should make a bacteriological and chemical examination of samples of the soil. The Board agreed to such recommendation, and at the time of this report going into print Dr. Houston's report had just been received. The piggeries on the Island also received special attention. The styes under the Great Eastern Railway Company's arches (Millwall extension) were shut up, and the Company refused to let these places any more for the purpose of keeping pigs. The Secretary of the Millwall Allotments was communicated with, his attention being called to the London County Council bye-laws respecting manure receptacles, &c., and also to the Board's bye-laws as to the keeping of animals so as to prevent any nuisance. The Secretary was informed that if the people wished to keep pigs they must do so in a sanitary manner and not cause any pollution of the earth. Other 38 piggeries were visited and, where necessary for the abatement of a nuisance, "documents" were served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The system of allowing pigs to live and sleep on wood which becomes impregnated with filth was strongly condemned. Straw or sawdust, which must he removed daily, was recommended. Notices were left on the tenants of the houses on the north side of Stebondale Street warning them against throwing their refuse over their garden walls on the waste ground at the rear. INFLUENZA. Twelve deaths occurred in Poplar from influenza and 8 deaths from the same complaint happened in Bromley, but 3 of these last deaths were of non-residents. Of the 8 deaths in Bromley, one occurred in the Sick Asylum and three in the City of London Union Infirmary. WHOOPING COUGH. Twenty-five deaths were registered in Poplar from whooping cough and 2 deaths vere notified from outside the parish, making a total of 27, and all these deaths were of children under 5 years of age. In Bromley were registered 28 deaths under 5 years of age and 2 over that period of life, 6 of the deaths over and 1 of the deaths under 5 years of age did not belong to the parish. One death under 5 years of age was notified from outside the parish, so that the deaths from whooping cough belonging to Bromley were 24 in number, 23 under and 1 over 5 years of age. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897.

In Bromley 41 deaths were registered, 7 of these deaths occurring in the Sick Asylum, but as 7 of the 41 deaths did not belong to the parish and there was notified 1 death from an outlying institution, the total deaths from measles belonging to Bromley will be 35, and of this number 33 were under and 2 over 5 years of age. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897.

Measles is not a notifiable disease in this district and the first information was received from the Vicar of Bromley. A certificate was given, advising that all scholars from an infected house should be excluded from the school. It was recommended, that, during the Christmas vacation, the school-rooms should be thoroughly disinfected and cleansed. DIARRHCEA. Forty-five deaths from diarrhoea with 1 from an outlying institution belonging to the Poplar parish, give a total of 46 deaths, 45 of which occurred in children under 5 years. In Bromley 70 deaths happened, 2 of which were of non-residents, so that 68 deaths belong to Bromley, and of these 64 deaths were of children under 5 years of age. For death rates see Table IV., page 12. 40 Deaths from diarihœa for the past five years were as follows:— 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897.

One death from choleraic diarrhoea accompanied by apoplexy occurred in Poplar. The patient was a labourer aged 25 years; he became ill on the 8th August and died on the nth August. An inquest was held upon deceased. A case of simple cholera was notified from Bromley in a man aged 26 years. The patient had been working among sewers. Enteritis and gastro-enteritis are maladies which ought to be considered with diarrahœa as they are generally concomitant diseases. INQUESTS AND DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE. Inquests and Deaths from violence during the year 1897 were as follows:— Number of Inquests held in the parishes. Deduct Inquests held on nonparishioners.

No parish medical orders were issued for the Council Buildings. From the Medical Registers at the Guardians' offices, I find that 11 orders were issued for Hanbury Buildings against 30 orders in 1896 and 22 orders for 1895, and for Grosvenor Buildings the orders stand:— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 77 103 65 48 BAKEHOUSES. The bakehouses were inspected twice during the year by Mr. Raymond and the notices as to limewhiteing, &c., were served in those cases considered necessary. See Inspector's report page 72. SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND COWHOUSES. Fifteen slaughterhouses (9 in Poplar and 6 in Bromley) and 12 cowhouses (5 in Poplar and 7 in Bromley) were inspected upon receiving notices from the owners of their intention to apply for the renewal of their licenses to the London County Council. In no instance was the Board advised to oppose the license. RIVER LEA. At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee held on the 1st July attention was called to the insanitary condition of the River Lea. 44 On or about the 14th June, the West Ham Corporation having begun to dig out the foundation of their pumping station at the Abbey Mills, which is to deliver the West Ham sewage into the metropolitan northern outfall, the Committee directed that the West Ham Council be strongly urged to proceed with the works as rapidly as possible. The works by the West Ham Corporation ought to have been commenced before June nth, 1894. With the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, Mr. A. G. Malins, I attended a conference at the Hackncy Town Hall, on 21st July, on the subject of the pollution of the River Lea. The conference was adjourned until the 13th October. On the 6th October, the Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, the chief officers of the Board, and representatives from the Hackney Vestry inspected the River Lea and its backwaters. On the 13th October, together with Mr. Malins, I attended the adjourned conference and gave evidence at the Town Hall, Hackney re the pollution of the River Lea. The following resolution was the outcome of the meeting : "That this conference is of opinion that a full enquiry into the condition of the whole of the River Lea, as to its sources of impurities, should be undertaken by the Government, in continuance of the report of the Select Committee of 1886." It is a very easy matter for a source of pollution to exist in connection with a river and the nuisance to be unknown. During an enquiry into the removal of "fish offal" at the Bromley Railway Station, St. Leonard's Street, it was found that the offensive water which came from the vehicles conveying such offal was poured down a gully in the railway yard, and this gully drained into an old drain or culvert which eventually emptied itself into the navigation portion of the River Lea above the Bromley Lock; a most horrible pollution and one which the Lea Conservancy were glad to be informed of. 45 SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS.

The Sanitary Committee, which met on the 1st July, referred the various claimants for compensation to the London County Council, and at the same committee meeting it was recommended that the Council be urged to take immediate steps to cleanse their sewer in High Street, Poplar. Certificates were given under section 4(3) (c) of the Public Health (Lond.) Act, 1891, respecting two cases of overcrowding in Poplar and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served. Thirty-four cases of overcrowding, 13 in Poplar, 21 in Bromley, were abated upon service of Intimations. Under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, certificates were authorised to be signed that there were proper and sufficient water supplies at the third block of dwellings, Nos. 17 to 24, Prestage Buildings, No. 2, Vesey Street, and the fourth block of dwellings, Nos. 25 to 32, Prestage Buildings. Strict attention was paid to the following bye law of the London County Council, made under Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— "14. Every person who shall intend to construct any watercloset, earth-closet or privy, or to fit or fix in or in connection with any water-closet, earth-closet or privy, any apparatus or any trap or soil pipe, shall, before executing any such works, give notice in writing to the Clerk of the Sanitary Authority." 47 The penalty is 5 for infringement of the above bye-law, which is a most important one, and one that cannot be too forcibly impressed upon builders, as it is most essential that the servants of a sanitary authority should see that any apparatus in connection with a watercloset is properly fixed. The Sanitary Committee in every case brought under their notice, directed that the builder be written to, asking him to open the ground; otherwise he would be prosecuted for infringing the bye-law. During the year 18 cases of fixing pans and traps without giving notice to the Clerk were brought under the notice of the Committee. In five of the above instances pans and traps not in accordance with the I.ondon County Council byelaw had been fixed. The builders were written to and the ground opened; in 11 out of the 18 cases reported, when the ground was opened, the drains were found defective. In every case where drainage work had been covered in without being inspected, and also in those instances where drains were becoming constantly stopped, and no result yielded when tested with smoke, the Committee authorised the ground to be opened under Section 40 of the Public Health (London) Act and the 82nd Section of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee, held 29th July, the Committee recommended to the Board that the names and addresses of persons convicted under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act and the Margarine Act be printed in the monthly reports of the Sanitary Committee. The Board adopted the recommendation of the Committee. The Police Court proceedings were as follows:— 48 49 No. of Street and Premises. Nature of Complaint.

Mr. Foad 51 The result in the case of the summons, 23, Byron Street, (date of hearing, 6th May) was a most important one, and a decision which has helped and upheld the officers of the Public Health Department in carrying out with confidence the bye-laws of the Board. In the seven summonses relating to Nos. 16 to 28, Bright Street "sewer or drain" was raised by the defendant's Counsel, not only upon the wording of the "application" but also upon the framing of the "Minute" of the Board in the year 1856. The Magistrate adjourned the case for fourteen days to consider the various points in question. Decision was given in favour of the Board. If the Magistrate had not decided in favour of the Board the large number of applications made to the Board and "allowed" between the years 1856 and 1860 for "combined systems" would have been considered by the now owners as not being applied for, so that "orders" under the Metropolis Local Management Act could have been made, and hence such combined systems would be sewers. Among the acts of parliament passed during the year 1897, there are three of special interest to those engaged in the practice of State Medicine— "Cleansing of Persons Act 1897," which is an act to permit Local Authorities to provide cleansing and disinfection for persons infested with vermin. "Metropolis Water Act," an act to amend the law respecting the Metropolitan Water Companies. "Infant Life Protection Act," which is an act to amend the law for the better protection of infant life.

It was necessary in pursuance of the Board's orders of authorization, to apply for 23 summonses against owners for non-compliance with notices served with the following results:— 60 No. 45 Tetley Street, work done, notice complied with, and costs of summons paid at date of adjourned hearing of summons. Summons withdrawn. No. 61 Burcham Street, as above. No. 23 Byron Street, work done, notice complied with after application was made for summons and hearing adjourned in order that the owner might complete work in compliance with Board's bye laws. The infringement was that the open space (enclosed forecourt) adjacent to front of premises was not "paved upon a sufficient bed of good concrete." The evidence proved that it was not "paved with a hard, durable, and impervious pavement, so sloped as to effectually carry off all rain or waste water therefrom," and that the forecourt had been patched (28 square feet being relaid) to evade legal proceedings being taken. The forecourt had been so badly paved that a portion of its surface was covered with water. Fined 20s. and 2s. costs, and 2 guineas costs to the Board. Nos. 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 Bright Street, sewer or drain question having been raised, hearing of summonses adjourned, eventually decided in favour of the Board. 21-days abatement orders made, 3 guineas costs. Nos. 44, 46 Follett Street, premises unfit for human habitation closing orders made, and 4s. costs in each case. Still closed. No. 3 St. Leonard's Cottages, premises unfit for human habitation, closing order made, 4s. costs Still closed; altered, made into an addition with No. 44 Follett Street. No. 48 Portree Street, work done, notice complied with at date of hearing of summons. Summons withdrawn, 2s. costs paid. No. 9 Albert Street, premises unfit for human habitation, closing order made, 10s. costs. Still occupied. Tenant and lodger served with notices informing them of the order made. Nos. 16, 18 Follett Street, premises unfit for human habitation, closing orders made, 4s. costs in each case. 61 Nos. 14, 18, 20, 22 Broomfield Street, 14 days abatement orders made. Nos. 16, 24 Broomfield Street, premises unfit for human habitation, closing orders made, 5s, costs in each case, 158 paid. The markets and stalls have been regularly inspected throughout the year, and in several instances I have had destroyed, meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, &c., which were unwholesome, unsound, and intended or deposited for sale. The respective vendors were warned. I have also, upon the vendor's application, examined meat, fruit, &c., purchased by them, and when found to be unfit for food of man, and had been brought direct from market the same day, I had the said meat, fruit, &c., destroyed, and I furnished the applicants with a certificate to that effect. It was found necessary in one case to make a seizure of a quantity of mussels exposed for sale on a stall outside 159 Chrisp Street; they were nearly all bad, and were, with your advice, taken to Court, examined by the Magistrate, condemned, and a summons granted, and upon the evidence, supported by yourself, it was proved that the mussels were unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for food of man. The Defendant was fined 40s. and 2s. costs. Upon the application for renewal of the annual licenses in October, the cow and slaughter houses were forthwith reinspected, and works of sanitary repairs, where necessary, executed. Bromley—South Division. Licensed Slaughterhouses 2 Licensed Cowhouses 3 Forty five samples of food have been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. One was so adulterated that legal proceedings were ordered to be taken, and the vendor was fined for 62 selling milk deficient in cream to the extent of 33 per cent.; 20s. and 2s. costs.

In compliance with your committee's instructions, a summons was taken out against the owner of No. 49, Arcadia Street for not complying with a statutory notice under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The summons was heard on the 24th March, an abatement order was made to do the work within 14 days with 12s. 6d. costs. On the 12th July, a summons was applied for against the owner of No 130, High Street, for not complying with a statutory notice, requiring the open drain to be trapped, and to repair the broken rain pipes, but when the summons was delivered, the defendant (who had already received the statutory notice and stated he would do the work) was ill in bed, and he sent his wife to the Board's offices to say they were yearly tenants, so upon the day of hearing, the 19th July, the Magistrate was asked to allow the summons to be withdrawn, so that proceedings could be instituted against the agent. The necessary work was executed. On the same date summonses were applied for against the owners of No 6 Lion Street, and 9, Oriental Terrace, for not complying with statutory notices to do certain drain work. The Magistrate made a 7 days' and 3 days' order with 7s. and 7s. 6d. costs respectively. In several cases where new pans and traps had been found to have been fixed without giving notice in writing to the Clerk of the Board, letters were written to the respective owners to open up the ground under the pan and trap. This, in each case, was done, and any defects found to exist were remedied and made good satisfactorily. Cases of overcrowding at the under-mentioned premises were abated without having to institute legal proceedings:—16, Grove Villas, 48, Sussex Street, 3, Hind Street, 89, Pekin Street, 6, Ellesmere Street, 14, Rook Street, 9, Ivy Cottages, and 21, High Street. E 66 On the 27th March, when inspecting the shops and stalls in Chrisp Street Market, my attention was drawn to a barrow full of bananas, which were being offered lor sale at four-a-penny. On examining them I found they were rotten and unfit for consumption, I therefore seized them and had them condemned by a Magistrate, who granted a summons returnable for the 30th March, when the vendor was fined 40s. and 2s. costs, or in default distress in 14 days. The shops, stalls and food stores have been regularly inspected with a view to detecting diseased, and unwholesome food, and in 4 cases I have caused the vendors to destroy a quantity of bad fruit, and I have warned them. In several cases, at the request of the vendors, I have examined consignments of fish which were purchased at the wholesale fish markets, and found the same to be unfit for human food, and in each case the vendors have destroyed the fish and I have given certificates to that effect. I have made periodical inspections throughout the year of the cowhouses and slaughterhouses in my district, and in each case found them in a sanitary condition, with good water supply, &c. The licensed slaughterhouses number 6 The licensed cowhouses „ 4 By directions of Mr. Young, the Public Analyst, I have purchased 58 samples of food and drugs for analysis. Legal proceedings were instituted against 4 of the respective vendors, and penalties obtained ranging from £2 to £5. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Sanitary Inspector, Poplar North Division. 67 To the Medical Officer of Health for Poplar and Bromley, 31st December, 1897. Sir, I beg to submit to you my Annual Report of the Sanitary Work executed and nuisances abated in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1897. House to house inspections were carried out as follows:— The whole of Mellish Street „ „ Lead Street „ „ Marsh Street „ ,, Strattondale Street „ „ Cold Harbour Sections of Manchester Road ,, West Ferry Road „ Launch Street „ Galbraith Street „ Stebondale Street „ Marshfield Street „ Seysell Street „ Cahir Street „ Johnson Street ,, Strafford Street numbering in all 440 premises inspected. In addition to the above, 954 complaints of nuisances, and 241 notifications of infectious diseases were received and dealt with, making a total of 1,635 primary inspections and 5513 re-inspections for the year. Of that total, 343 premises were found to be in fair condition, and 81 per cent. required various works of Sanitary Improvement. Apart from the testing at the completion of new drain work (which had been done in all possible cases with water), 335 drains were proved defective by the smoke or chemical tests, and in 536 instances their application revealed no defects. During the year, the drains of the undermentioned premises had been reconstructed as follows:— 68 Drains reconstructed, intercepted, ventilated and means of access provided:— Manchester Road, 2a, 4. ,, ,, 153 to 159. ,, ,, 247, 249. ,, ,, "Queen's'' P.

In 11 instances, plans were submitted in accordance with the Board's drain regulations. Notices had been served requiring the abatement of a great nuisance arising from the foul condition of the piggeries situate at the G. E. R. arches, East Ferry Road, caused by the improper feeding and keeping of swine. As the notices had not been complied with together with yourself, I visited the premises prior to applying for a a summons at the Police Court. This resulted in your communicating with the Railway Company, who in response gave the proprietor of the piggeries three months notice to give up the premises. In the meantime, swine fever had broken out necessitating the slaughtering of over 100 pigs. The styes had since been demolished, the woodwork, tarred or burnt and the premises limewashed, and pig keeping permanently discontinued. By your direction and in response to complaint, special inspection had been made of all the piggeries on the Cubitt Town Allotment Gardens, a large number of notices had been served, requiring a properly drained concreted bottom to stye, etc. These in every case had received attention either by executing the works specified on the notices or by discontinuing pig keeping altogether. Under the Public Health, London Act, 1891, Police Court proceedings had been taken in pursuance of the Board's orders of authorization against the owners of the under-mentioned premises, for disregarding the Board's notices, with the following results.— 70 Manchester Road, 477, Summons withdrawn at adjourned hearing. Costs paid. Notice complied with. Marshfield Street, 32. Summons withdrawn Notice complied with. Costs paid. Stebondale Street, 79. Magistrate's order to execute works on notice in 14 days and to pay 27s. costs. Costs afterwards reduced on the application of owner to 6s.

In adjourning this summons for 7 days, the owner was informed by the Magistrate that if the notice was not complied with at the date of the adjourned hearing, and the cost of summons paid, he would impose a further penalty of £5. Notice complied with. Costs paid. Stebondale Street, 33. Premises closed as unfit for human habitation and 8s. 6d. costs. On the 24th of December, last, I was summoned to attend at the Thames Police Court to shew cause why the order made on the 22nd of October, closing the premises 33 Stebondale Street as unfit for human habitation, should not be rescinded. On your visiting the premises, you found that the works necessary to render the premises fit for human habitation had been executed to your satisfaction. I therefore by your direction attended at the Court, and in response to the owner's application, informed the presiding Magistrate (Mr. Dickinson) there was no opposition, as the premises had been put into a sanitary and habitable condition. The order was consequently rescinded. 45 samples of food had been procured and submitted to the public analyst for analysis. 3 were so adulterated, that legal proceedings were ordered by the Clerk to the Board. 71 The nature of article, extent of adulteration, and result of prosecution being as follows:— Cocoa—Adulterated with 87 per cent. of arrowroot and sugar; vendor fined 30s. Milk — Adulterated with 14 per cent. of water; vendor fined 20s. Milk—Deficient in cream to the extent of 33 per cent. In this case on the application of the Defendant the third portion of sample was forwarded to Somerset House for analysis, which authority certified the milk to be deficient in cream; vendor fined at adjourned hearing £4. On the 24th November a street milk vendor was fined 30s. and 23s. costs at the Thames Police Court for attempting to recover and forcibly upsetting a sample of milk which I had purchased for analysis from a hand barrow in the Manchester Road, Cubitt Town. The Magistrate (Mr. Mead), remarked at the hearing of summons, that it was clear that the assault was intended to defeat the objects of the Adulteration Acts. Five notices of intention to apply for renewal of slaughter house and cowhouse licenses, were received from my district. The premises were forthwith inspected, and various works executed on the service of the Board's notices. The shops, food stores, and stalls, have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting diseased and unwholesome food. In two instances, a large quantity of fish, and a quantity of fruit were destroyed with the owners consent as unfit for food. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Assoc. San. Inst.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Sir and Gentlemen, In. accordance with. " The Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my eleventh Annual Report, which Report deals with the year 1903, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Assistant Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. VITAL STATISTICS. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1903, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 169,302 :— Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,613,812 .. 59,108 .. 67,891 .. 42,303 a 2 being 61.6 (see footnote) inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 72 75 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 50 6 per acre in Poplar Parish, 112.2 in Bromley, and 76.2 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1903. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 aro the rates as stated in previous Reports; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Parish of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three parishes might be compared, but the rates in Tables IV., V., VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. The births during the 52 weeks were:— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 992 1014 2006 Bromley 1246 1193 2439 Bow 688 710 1398 Totals 2926 2917 5843 Of these births, 76 were illegitimate in Poplar, 36 males and 40 females. In Bromley there were 42 illegitimate births, 24 males and 18 females. In Bow there were 7 illegitimate births, 4 males and 3 females, making a total of 125 in the Borough. Of the 2006 births registered in Poplar, 82 occurred in the Poplar Union Workhouse, and of the 2439 registered in Bromley, * These figures are calculated upon the acreage of the district including the water area, but exclusive of area covered by water they are:—93.58 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 100.78 for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley combined, and 78'33 for Bow. County of London 61.6 (no account being taken of tidal water and foreshore.) 3 13 occurred in the Sick Asylum and 23 in the Stepney Union Workhouse, 2 in the City of London Union Infirmary, and 0 in the Poplar Hospital. The annual birth rate per 1000 living being: — Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

The annual marriage rate per 1000 living being:— Poplar and Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

Treating the 1873 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 775 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 174 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1272. From the 473 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 20 non-residents and added 242 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 695 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III. that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, that certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 3199 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 507 deaths of actual non-residents and 385 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 3077, upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1110 deaths in Poplar included 19 illegitimate children, 9 male and 10 female; the 1272 deaths in Bromley included 19 illegitimate children, 13 male and 6 female; the 695 Bow deaths included 7 illegitimate children, 2 male and 5 female, making a total for the Borough of 45 deaths of illegitimate children.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the years 1901 and 1902 females also exceeded the males.

HOSPITALS DEPARTMENT—CASES OF MISTAKEN DIAGNOSIS. In connection with the subject of hospital provision for infectious diseases, I am directed by the Hospitals Committee of this Board to advert to the statistical reports issued annually (a copy of which is sent to each Medical Officer of Health of the metropolis), and in particular to the figures set out in the tables concerning cases of miscellaneous disease admitted into the Board's hospitals. The Committee have caused this information to be collated for three years, and I have been requested by them to transmit to you the accompanying summary of these cases, with a view to the assistance of the Medical Officers of Health being secured to prevent, so far as circumstances may make it practicable, the introduction into this Board's hospitals of cases of other diseases than those which such hospitals are designed to treat. Yours faithfully, (Sgd.) T. DUNCOME MANN. Clerk to the Board. The Medical Officer of Health, Poplar. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., Sir, 9th February, 1903. HOSPITALS DEPARTMENT—CASES OF MISTAKEN DIAGNOSIS. Your printed summary of cases of mistaken diagnosis treated in the Board's hospitals during the years 1899, 1900 and 1901, duly received, for which I thank you. With a view of preventing, as far as circumstances make it practicable, the introduction into the M.A.B. hospitals of cases of other diseases than those which the hospitals are designed to treat, the Local Authority of this district, for some years past, has supplied medical practitioners with outfits for taking swabbings and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Diphtheria and Typhoid Fever. c 2 36 Whenever a notice stating that a case is or was not suffering from a notifiable disease is received from one of your Medical Officers or Superintendents, the Medical Practitioner has one of the enclosed letters sent to him by me. If he should not answer such communication, my Public Health Committee direct the Town Clerk to write him. My Committee feel very strongly that, as the Poplar Borough Council afford facilities to practitioners to verify their diagnosis, they should avail themselves of such opportunities. I may add that if charged outfits can be forwarded so as to reach the Jenner Institute of Preventive Medicine before 6 p.m., I receive the result of examination by telegram about noon the next day. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, (Sgd.) FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Medical Officer of Health. T. Duncombe Mann, Esq., Metropolitan Asylums Board, Embankment, E.C. METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. Dear Sir, re I beg to inform you that aged of the above address, notified by you on and admitted into the Hospital on as suffering from , has been certified to me as not having that complaint or any other notifiable disease. I would respectfully remind you that this Council supplies outfits you have an outfit ) for taking from doubtful cases of * for bacteriological examination. This Council is anxious that such outfits should be used, so that doubtful cases should not occupy the beds of true cases, and, moreover, should not run the risk of removal to an infectious diseases hospital. I shall be glad l,o know if a bacteriological examination was made in this case. Yours faithfully, Medical Officer of Health. 37 The corrected number of notifications would be— Poplar 493 — 17 = 476 or 8.05 per 1000 living, Bromley 412 — 18 = 394 or 5.80 „ „ „ Bow 246 — 10 = 236 or 5.57 „ „ „ Borough of Poplar 1151 — 45 = 1106 or 6.53 „ „ „ A return from the Metropolitan Asylums Board shews the number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar and London for the years 1899, 1900 and 1901, and removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals have been as follows:— Percentage of mistakes in total cases. Poplar. London. 1899 49 cases 8.4 6.3 1900 60 „ 7.3 7.9 1901 131 „ 13.1 9.2 1902 93 „ 3.08 1903 45 „ 3.90 In every case of wrongful notification the Public Health Committee requires an explanation from the Practitioner concerned, and where this is not satisfactory the facts are reported to the Council. The Committee fully concurred with the Metropolitan Asylums Board that "the introduction into the Board's Hospitals of cases of other diseases than those which such hospitals are designed to treat" should be prevented as far as practicable. Arrangements were made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations shall be communicated to the officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned. Such knowledge, no doubt, will greatly assist the Medical Superintendents of the various hospitals. The Ambulance Committee of the Metropolitan Asylums Board had under consideration a proposal that the operations of the 38 Board's ambulance service should be extended so as to permit of the ambulance carriages being placed at the disposal of the public for the conveyance in London of medical cases and surgical cases, and of persons of unsound mind. It was believed that a very moderate fee per journey for hire of horse single-bedded ambulance and coachman would cover expenses. Before taking action in the matter the Ambulance Committee desired to know whether the Borough Councils would be disposed to support an application by the Managers to the Local Government Board for the necessary legal authority for giving effect to the proposal. The Public Health Committee recommended the Council to support the Ambulance Committee in their application of the Managers to the Local Government Board for the powers proposed. A letter was received from the School Board for Loudon with reference to the representation made by the Council that in all cases of infectious diseases, whether notifiable or not, occurring in the Schools, the Council's Officers should be allowed to disinfect the premises:— SCHOOL BOARD FOR LONDON. Victoria Embankment, W.C., llth February, 1903. Sir, BYRON AND BRIGHT STREET; FAIRFIELD ROAD AND CULLODEN STREET SCHOOLS. Adverting to your letter of the 23rd December respecting the prevalence of Mumps in the above-named Schools of the Board, and the disinfection of the premises, I have to inform you that the School Management Committee of the Board have adopted the following report of their Medical Officer:— "Considerable inconvenience has been caused by the Sanitary Authorities disinfecting a single class-room, as it often happens that 39 the room which has been closed is separated from the adjoining room by a sliding partition. "In cases of non-notifiable diseases the Schoolkeeper is instructed to brush down the walls and ceilings, wash the woodwork and furniture, scrub the floors and keep the windows open. I think this quite sufficient. "In the case of notifiable diseases the Medical Officer of Health is always asked to disinfect. "In the special cases referred to by the Poplar Borough Council, it was thought unnecessary to ask the Sanitary Authorities to disinfect." I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, C. W. ISITT, Acting Clerk of the Board. The Town Clerk, Poplar Borough Council, High Street, Poplar, E. The Committee were still of opinion the precautions taken by the School Authorities were not sufficient to prevent the spread of infection, and considered that the Council's Officers should be allowed to disinfect the Schools in all cases where infectious diseases, whether notifiable or not, have occurred, and the Committee recommended the Council—"That a further representation to this effect be made to the School Board for London." Three cases of diphtheria and one of scarlet fever were connected with milkshops in Poplar. Three cases of diphtheria, two of typhoid fever, two of scarlet fever, one of measles and one of erysipelas were connected with milkshops in Bromley. One case of scarlet fever was connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected. Two cases of diphtheria were connected with premises where ice cream was manufactured. 40 For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 50. Six outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified, 3 in Poplar, 1 in Bromley, and 2 in Bow. The usual notices were given. The St. Pancras Borough Council addressed a communication to the President of the Board of Agriculture asking that a Departmental Committee might be appointed to further investigate the subject of Glanders with a view of ascertaining the manner in which the disease is communicated to people and animals, and also as to the best method of stamping it out. 41 ALPHABETICAL STREET LIST OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

During the year 92 persons passed through the Council's Shelter in Yeo Street. SMALL-POX. Of the 28 cases of Small-pox notified within the Borough, 25 patients had the disease, and 3 cases were returned home as not having the complaint. Two cases not notified, but removed, were also returned. From the following report it will be seen that there were really more than 25 cases in the Borough, but they were not notified. d 2 52 1.—Female, aged 27 years, of Morant Street, Poplar (where a case had been removed previously on the 20th December). The patient had faint vaccination marks, and upon the removal of the patient on the 20th December, and several times afterwards, she was advised to be re-vaccinated, but she refused. The patient was prematurely confined of an eight months' living child on the 4th January, and attended by a midwife. At the request of a Medical Practitioner I examined her on the 5th January, and found her to be suffering with Small-pox and too ill to be removed, and in order to prevent the spread of the disease, the whole of the inmates were isolated within the house, food, etc., being supplied, the rent, and medical attendance paid at the expense of the Council. The inmates of the house who had not been re-vaccinated in the first instance, agreed now to be done The patient died on the 6 th January. The body was immediately coffined and removed to the Council's Infectious Mortuary, Wellington Road, and all the inmates taken to the Shelter, Glaucus Street The Undertaker's men also went to the Shelter, had baths, and their clothes disinfected. Several articles of clothing, etc., had to be destroyed, and the premises were thoroughly disinfected, washed, stripped, and lime-whited. 2.—The prematurely-born male infant of the above patient developed on the 10th January Small-pox at the Councils Shelter, and was removed on the same day, and afterwards died. The child was vaccinated as soon as bcrn, but the germs of the disease were in his system. 3.—Male, aged 32 years, was notified from the Seamen s Hospital, Greenwich. The patient had been living at a Seamen's Lodging House in Pennyfields; he had been home from sea five weeks. The first two weeks he was stated to 53 have been an in-patient of Gravesend Infirmary, the last three weeks he had been stopping at Pennyfields. He was removed from the Seamen's Hospital on the 3rd April; he stated he travelled by tram to the Tunnel, and again by tram to the Hospital, where he was detained. 4.—A male, aged 32 years, Ford Road, was detained at a Surgery in the Roman Road and removed suffering from Small-pox on the 20th April. Patient had been to the London Hospital, was placed in an isolation ward pending making enquiries, as he was seen to have Small-pox, and arrangements were about to be made for his removal, but he made his escape. The patient apparently in good health had returned home from a Hospital in Bath on the 9th April, where he had been an inmate for five weeks. On the 15th April he became ill, rash appeared on the 17th April, and as stated above, was removed on the 20th April, so that he had been lying at home for six days suffering from Small-pox. In the same house living with him were his wife, a daughter aged 16 years, and six unvaccinated children. These children had been playing in the streets with other children, and neighbours had been going in and out of the house. Information was also given that a child aged 18 months, was sent on the 18th April from Ford Road to Ellesmere Road, Bethnal Green; notice was at once given to the Bethnal Green Authorities. The mother requested that the six unvaccinated children should be vaccinated. Another child aged 8 years, unvaccinated (making seven in all) was brought into the Council's Shelter on the 21st April from Chisenhale Road; he had been taken there on 54 the 20th April. The Medical Officer of Bethnal Green was communicated with. It was evident that the disease must have been contracted out of the district, and thinking that in the Institution at Bath from which the patient was discharged there might be other inmates with the premonitory symptoms of Smallpox, the officials of the Institution at Bath were telephoned to ; the answer was that two cases of Small-pox had been removed on the 16th April, and others since. Two cases which occurred outside the Borough on the 20th April were stepsons of the case from Ford Road. One stepson aged 19 years was removed from Rotherhithe, and the other aged 18 years was removed from Bethnal Green. 5.—29th April.—Male, aged 8 years. Council's Shelter, from Ford Road. Vaccinated for the first time 22nd April. 6.—29th April.—Female, aged 10 years. Council's Shelter, from Ford Road. Vaccinated for the first time 21st April. 7.—30th April.—Female, aged 2 years. Council's Shelter, from Ford Road. Vaccinated for the first time 21st April. 8.—1st May.—Male, aged 6 years. Council's Shelter, from Ford Road. Vaccinated for the first time 21st April. 9.—1st May.—Female, aged 10 months. Council's Shelter, from Ford Road. Vaccinated for the first time 21st April. 10.—8th May.—Male, aged 28 years, Roman Road, Bow, vaccinated in infancy. Was a friend of the patient from Ford Road, and had visited him before he was removed to 55 the hospital on 20th April. He was first taken ill on 4th May. 11.— 8th May.—Male, aged 2 years, Roman Road, unvaccinated son of above. 12.—18th May.—Female, aged 27 years, Roman Road, vaccinated in infancy, mother of above. 13.—8th May.—Female, aged 14 years, Roman Road. Vaccinated in infancy. In the employ of above. 14.—19th May.—Female, aged 9 years. Hewlett Road. Unvaccinated; severe case. 15.— 19th May—Female, aged 17 years. Hewlett Road. Well vaccinated in infancy; very mild case. 16.—19th May.—Female, aged 25 years. Hewlett Road. Vaccinated in infancy; very mild case. 17.—20th May.—Female, aged 22 years. Hewlett Road. Vaccinated in infancy; very mild case. It was ascertained that in the family a girl, aged 24 years, had been ill on the 29th April, and spots appeared on the face on 3rd May; she was at home ill for some days, and returned to work on or about 12th May. The firm noticed spots on her face. It appeared the girl had visited a Club in the Old Ford Road, but as to dates she was not quite certain, possibly on or about 18th or 19th April. It transpired the man who was removed mid-day on the 20th April from the Medical Practitioner's Surgery in the Roman Road (having escaped in the morning from the London Hospital), had visited that Club on one of these nights. 56 On the 19th May, when the cases were notified, the mother in giving details as to the number of inmates in the house made no mention of two girls, aged respectively 19 and 22 years. She stated a child, aged 11 years (vaccinated in infancy), had gone for a walk in Victoria Park. Upon visiting the premises next day, 20th May, the two girls in question were found, and the one aged 22 was suffering from Small-pox; very mild case. She had been well vaccinated in infancy, and up to the 16th May had been at work at a Laundry in Hackney on the borders of Bow. The girl aged 19 years had been at home for a month out of work. A child, aged 5 years, from the same house in Hewlett Road, was removed on the 19th May, but was returned home on the 20th May from the South Wharf, Rotherhithe, suffering from Chicken-pox. 18.—25th May.—Male, aged 49 years, the father of the Hewlett Road cases; exceedingly mild attack; vaccinated in infancy, and re-vaccinated on the 20th May after having been exposed to infection for some days. It was probable that the daughter, aged 19 years, previously mentioned as being out of work, also had an exceedingly mild attack of Small-pox. She was slightly ill, and one or two spots appeared on the face. She was well vaccinated in infancy, and again on the 20th May after being exposed to infection for some days. It was also probable the child who was returned home as suffering from Chicken Pox had afterwards a slight attack of Small-pox; a few spots like Small-pox appeared after her return home. She was well vaccinated at the South Wharf before being sent back, having been in close contact with her sisters, who were removed to the ships. It is interesting to note in respect of the Hewlett Road cases (7 in number, already reported) that the first patient 67 attacked, who was not notified and worked at a factory out of the Borough, four cases afterwards occurred in the factory. The first case in Hewlett Road was supposed to be due to the patient from Bath, so that these four more cases will bring the number due to the Bath case to 24 patients (outside and inside Borough). 19.—30th May.—Male, aged 1 year. Osborn Place, Union Street, Poplar. Unvaccinated. A lad, aged 17 years, was stated to have had spots on his face. It is very probable that the lad had had an exceedingly mild attack of Small-pox (he was well vaccinated in infancy). The remains of the spots on the face gave the appearance of his having had such a disease. He stated that three weeks previously, just before the spots appeared, he was ill and sick. The mother corroborated his statement. There were two children, 3 and 5 years, who had never been vaccinated, and had been exposed to infection. The father was willing to have them vaccinated. 20.—On 6th June, female, aged 42 years. Osborn Place. Mother of the patient removed on 30th May. Patient had been well vaccinated in infancy, and, so far as the Small-pox was concerned, it was an exceedingly mild attack. 21.—Female child, aged 5 years, who was vaccinated for the first time on 4th June after being many days exposed to infection, was taken ill and removed from the Shelter on the 10th June, suffering from Small-pox. 22.—On the 15th June, a female, aged 26 years, of St. Stephen's Road, Bow, stated to have been vaccinated in infancy. 58 As to the origin of the disease, the mother said the husband of the patient frequented premises in the Roman Road, where four cases of Small-pox had been removed. The last two cases were removed on the 18th May, and the present patient became ill on the 10th June, so the disease was not likely to have been contracted from the Roman Road premises. It was also stated that two or three weeks previously the patient took two of her children to the London Hospital, and whilst waiting there she saw two boys with spots upon them. In the house in St. Stephen's Road there were five unvaccinated children, but the parents were only too anxious to have them vaccinated. It was questionable whether it would be of any use, as three of the children had been in close contact with the patient for some days. All the other inmates were re-vaccinated with the exception of two who had been done during the last outbreak. 23.—19th June.—Male, aged 7 years. St. Stephen's Road. Unvaccinated until after infection. Second case in house. Mother was removed on the 15th June. 24.—27th June.—Female, aged 18 months. St. Stephen's Road. Unvaccinated until after infection. Sister of above. Third case in house. 25.—2nd July.—Female, aged 25 years. Cardigan Road. Vaccinated in infancy. Visited her sister before being removed at St. Stephen's Road on 15th June. Immediately upon cases coming to the knowledge of the Public Health Department, the premises were visited, the names and ages obtained of all the inmates, if adults the addresses where they worked, and in the case of children the Schools and Sunday Schools were noted. 59 The inmates were induced to go to the Council's Shelter in order to be bathed, and have their clothes disinfected whilst the rooms and in some cases the whole of the premises, were being disinfected, stripped of their paper, and lime-whitened. In some instances contacts were maintained in the Councils Shelter for many days, until the period of incubation had passed. The various Medical Officers of Health were notified respecting contacts if they resided or worked outside the Borough. The Medical Officer of Health for Richmond, Surrey, notified that a male, aged 28 years, had arrived at the Union House, Richmond, on the 29th January, and was found to be suffering from Small-pox. The patient stated he was in the Casual Ward of the Poplar Union on the previous evening. Mr. Lough, Clerk to the Guardians, was communicated with, and a list of the men who slept in the Casual Ward and in the cubicle occupied by the patient was furnished to the Public Health Department, and communications were sent to the various Clerks to the Guardians of the Casual Wards to which the contacts stated they were journeying, but several said they were going to the Docks. Although communications were forwarded to the various Clerks to the Guardians, there was very little use in doing so, as it is a well-known fact that casuals do not always go to the destination which they state. As a matter of fact, the patient stated he was going to Reading, but went to Richmond, gave his age as 40 years at Poplar, and 28 years at Richmond. From Gough Street, male, aged 20 years, was removed on the 31st January, kept under observation at the South Wharf, Rotherhithe until the 5th February, and then returned home as not being a case, 60 A female child, aged 4 years of St. Leonard's Avenue, was removed to the Isolation Wharf on the 13th April as suffering from Small-pox, but was returned home the same day as not having that complaint or any other notifiable disease. A female, aged 3½ years was removed to the South Wharf as suffering from Small-pox, but was returned home not having the disease. A male child, aged 5½ years was admitted from Bromley to South Wharf on the 21st November, as suffering from Small-pox; the patient was detained until 23 November, and then returned home. The " Order " of the London County Council making Chickenpox a notifiable disease expired on the 7th January. Mr. Hitchens, the Vaccination Officer, has kindly furnished me with the following statistics, which are copied from those forwarded to the Local Government Board :— 1901.—January to June.

The President of the Local Government Board had definitely stated it was impossible for the Government to undertake to supply lymph generally throughout the United Kingdom, arid the Council of the Institute were of opinion the best solution of this part- of the question would be found in the transfer of the National Vaccine .Establishment from the 62 control of the Government to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and the establishment in the Provinces of Laboratories by the various County' and County Borough Councils. The Committee agreed in the importance of the provision of an adequate supply of pure calf lymph for all Medical Practitioners, and that the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be the authority controlling such supply for London. SCARLET FEVER. The number of Scarlet Fever cases notified for the three parishes, and the deaths which occured for the past eleven years were as follows: — Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar. 1893 Cases notified 627 854 313 1794 Deaths 39 48 13 100 1894 Cases notified 239 331 225 795 Deaths 12 22 8 42 1895 Cases notified 343 330 329 1002 Deaths 20 19 8 47 1896 Cases notified 274 429 243 946 Deaths 8 19 7 34 1897 Cases notified 251 476 373 1100 Deaths 6 12 10 28 1898 Cases notified 207 325 106 638 Deaths 3 13 6 22 1899 Cases notified 142 179 102 423 Deaths 2 4 3 1900 Cases notified 246 168 85 499 Deaths 3 3 1 7 63 Poplar.

As it was near the end of the term, the Vicar decided to close the Schools at once, and have the class-rooms disinfected by the Council during the summer holidays. The prompt closing of this School no doubt stopped a serious epidemic. CONTINUED AND TYPHUS FEVERS. No cases of Continued and Typhus Fevers were notified during the year. TYPHOID FEVER. The Typhoid Fever cases notified were: — Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

So that the 93 cases in the Borough were notified from 78 houses, and the drains were defective in 12 instances. Twenty-two cases in Poplar, 33 in Bromley, and 18 in Bow were removed to various hospitals, as follows: — POPLAR (Parish).

Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals 14 Sick Asylum 1 London Hospital 2 North-Eastern Hospital, Hackney Road 1 18 Four cases of Typhoid Fever were stated to be due to the eating of shell-fish :— 27/8/03 Male 14 years Manilla Street .. Had eaten mussels two weeks ago. 14/10,03 Male 18 years White Post Lane .. Had eaten cockles and whelks from off stall. 9/11/03 Male 12 years St. Leonard's Road.. Had eaten half an oyster two weeks ago. 19/11/03 Male 32 years Usher Road Had eaten oysters three weeks ago in a public house. The Council of the Borough of Brighton pointed out that, on investigation, not less than 36 per cent, of the cases of Enteric Fever occurring in that town during the past nine years had been traced to sewage-contaminated shell-fish. They addressed a letter to the Local Government Board urging legislation giving Sanitary Authorities control over oyster layings situated in their districts, and empowering them to prevent the sale within their districts of oysters or other molluscs derived from sewage-contaminated sources. The Corporation of London had also approached the Local Government Board in the matter, urging that the Corporation, as the Port Sanitary Authority, should have the inspection of oyster beds and layings within the Estuary of the Thames. At a Conference of Representatives of the Corporation of London and Conservators of the Thames and Medway, the follow'ng resolution was adopted, viz. : — " That in the opinion of this Conference the present system of discharging sewage into the Thames Estuary is £ 66 dangerous to health and detrimental to an important food supply, and that representations should be made to the Local Government Board with the view to legislation being initiated to effectively deal with the matter." The Council concurred in this opinion. The Hackney Borough Council called attention to cases of Enteric Fever traced to the consumption of sewage polluted watercress, and asked the Local Government Board to make an enquiry as to the sources of the watercress supplied to the Metropolis in relation to the possibility of this article causing disease. The Committee recommended the Council to support the application. Respecting the supposed causes and predisposing influences of other cases, they are given below as received from the patients or their friends. 12/1/03 3/3/03 9/3/03 12/5/03 26/6/03 4/7/03 7/7/03 22/7/03 12/7/03 21/8/03 Male Female Male Female Female Male Male Female Male Male 10 years 38 years 17 years 29 years 5 years 17 years 15 years 20 years 13 years 21 years Milton Road Seyssell Street Leven Road Cottage Street Park Street Malmesbury Road, Tapley Street Vernon Road "VVyke Road Merchant Street Ate some ice cream, 26/12/02.

On account of the prevalence of Measles at the Bromley National Schools, St. Leonard's Street, acting upon my advice, a " Notice " signed by Mr. Councillor John Bussey, the then Mayor, and Mr. Councillor Mitchell, was served on the 26th January upon the Managers of the Schools to forthwith close the Infants' Department, and to exclude from the Girls' Department, St. Leonard's Street, and the Boys' Department, Priory Street, any Scholars coming from houses where Measles existed. Sixty cases of Measles had occurred in connection with the Infants' Department. During the month of January 25 cases had happened, and many children had been excluded on account of sore throats. On the 26th January, in the school room of the Infants' Department, the scholars in attendance were 47, the number on the roll 73 being 117. In the Infants' Class Room there were 7 scholars, and the number on the roll 35. In the Girls' Department, 29 cases of Measles had occurred; number in attendance, 109; number on the roll, 158. In the Boys' Department, Priory Street, 15 cases had happened; number in attendance, 96; number on the roll, 129. The Notice was served upon the Vicar of Bromley, as representing the Managers, and at the same time a letter was sent stating that the latrines should be cleansed, and the class and cloak rooms of the Department should be disinfected, and, so far as the disinfection was concerned, this could be carried out by the Poplar Borough Council if the Managers were agreeable. On the 23rd January, on account of the number of cases of Measles and Mumps which were reported in the Infants' Department of the British Street Board School, West Ferry Road, the Medical Officer of the School Board for London was communicated with, and, in reply, the Medical Officer stated he had advised the closure of Class Room G for a period of three weeks. Owing to the prevalence of Measles in the Infants' Department of the Woolmore Street Board School, the Medical Officer of the London School Board arranged for the closure of Class Room G for a period of three weeks from the 3rd March. On account of the number of scholars absent with Measles in the Infants' Department of the Cubitt Town Board School, the Medical Officer of the School Board was communicated with, and the Department was closed until after the Easter holidays. The class rooms, etc., were disinfected. Acting upon my recommendation, Mr. Councillor Colin Gordon, the then Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and Mr. 74 Alderman Main, signed a "Notice" requiring the Managers of the All Saints' School, Poplar, to forthwith close the Infants' Department, Newby Place, for a period of 28 days with a view of preventing the spread of Measles and Mumps. The "Notice" was sent on the 24th March to the Rector of Poplar. On the 24th March there were 64 scholars absent on account of sickness, chiefly Measles and Mumps, and 18 children away through illness at their homes, making a total of 82 away upon a roll of 174. The class rooms, cloak rooms, and sanitary offices were disinfected Thirty-two deaths from Measles were registered in the Borough during the month of March. The Infants' Department of the Marner Street Board School was closed on the 27th March until after the Easter holidays. This Department, as well as the Infants' Department of the Knapp Road Board School, were disinfected by the Public Health Department. Acting upon my recommendation, Mr. Councillor Colin Gordon, the then Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and Mr. Alderman Main, signed a "Notice" requiring the Managers of the St. John's National School, Roserton Street, to forthwith close for a period of one month the Infants' Class Room No. 8 with a view of preventing the spread of Measles. The Notice was signed on the 1st April and forwarded to the Vicar of St. John's Church. On the 1st April there were 28 scholars absent suffering from Measles, the number on the roll being 71. The class room, cloak rooms, and sanitary offices were disinfected. Sixty-four deaths from Measles were registered during the month ended the 18th April, making a total of 111 deaths from Measles within the Borough from the beginning of the year 1903. An "Order" was made by the London County Council applying to Measles in the Administrative County of London, the provisions 75 of sections 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, and 74, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to dangerous infectious diseases. The "Order" was duly approved by the Local Government Board, and came into force from and including 1st April, 1903. Practically the Infectious Diseases Prevention Sections, and not the Notification Sections, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, apply to Measles; or, in other words, the effect to the "Order" is that the precautions taken in the case of notifiable diseases with regard to disinfection and the exposure of infected persons are now applied to Measles, but the provisions of the Act with regard to notification and removal do not apply. Arrangements were made upon the receipt of a notice from the Head Teachers of a Board School, or any other person, of the existence of Measles in a house, for the Sanitary Inspector to call, and leave the same papers as would be left when a notification is received at the Public Health Offices. The Secretary of the East London Hospital for Children wrote to the London County Council asking what course should be adopted in the case of out-patients infected by the disease and attending at the Hospital. The cases could not be admitted as in-patients, and the patients were seldom able to pay for the hire of an ambulance. The Public Health Committee were informed the Metropolitan Asylums Board had agreed to allow the use of their ambulances for the free conveyance of persons suffering from Measles who are not in a position to pay the ordinary charge for the hire of the same. Upon the Measles Order coming into force on the 1st April, 1903, a Measles Register was instituted, in which entries are made of premises where cases are stated to exist. 76 The bulk of the cases thus dealt with has been upon information received at the hands of School Board Teachers; by notification, as provided for by the regulations of the School Board for London, and the remainder from various sources, i.e., through medical practitioners, parents, landlords, lodgers, neighbours, police, and in fatal cases by the Registrar's Returns, these latter in some instances being the first intimation received of the existence of the disease upon the premises. The details in the Register cover a variety of information, viz., date, name, address, source of notification, number of rooms disinfected, details as to articles disinfected, etc., and remarks. As soon as the "Order" came into operation the premises named in the notices, which had been received two weeks previously from the School Board teachers, where Measles was supposed to exist, were visited and enquiries made. In 218 instances the cases were stated to have recovered. At the end of the year there were 888 entries in the Register, representing the number of premises where Measles had been stated to have occurred. These entries date from 16th March. Upon enquiry 218 cases were found to have recovered, 72 were found not to be cases, 28 were stated to be suffering from a different disease other than the one notified, 58 wrong addresses and unknown were given, 19 belonged to other Boroughs, 3 died in March, 10 moved away before enquiries could be made, 1 developed the disease in an institution, 3 were duplicate notices, 1 case was Scarlet Fever, and 1 was Enteric Fever. One case of Measles occurred in connection with a milk shop. Two hundred and fifty-one premises were disinfected by the Public Health Department, and 186 were disinfected by the Tenants, and in the bulk of these 186 cases, Medical Practitioners gave certificates that disinfection had been carried out satisfactory. Respecting the articles disinfected by the Council, see page 49. 77 DIARRHŒA.* Deaths from Diarrhœa for the past eleven years were as follows: — Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

Under the heading of "Enteritis'' are included those certified as from Gastro-enteritis, Muco-enteritis and Gastric catarrh. 78 MUMPS. On account of a large number of cases of Mumps occurring in connection with the Infant's Department of the Smeed Road Board, School, the Medical Officer of the School Board for London was communicated with, and the department was closed. This fortunately happened a few days before the Christmas holidays. Cases afterwards occurred in connection with the Girls' and Boys' Departments. The whole school was disinfected by the Public Health Department. INQUESTS AND DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE.

The provision of a Coroner's Court is the duty of the London County Council, and that body agreed to pay a rental of £150 per annum for the Court. The site cost £2,413, and the Architect's estimate for the buildings was £6,443. The consent of the Local Government Board was obtained to a Loan for the carrying out of the scheme. In view, however, of the fact that, consequent on the passing of the London Government Act, 1899, buildings would come into the possession of the Borough Council in which the Coroner might conveniently hold his Court, the proposed erection of a Coroner's Court was abandoned, and the question of the provision of Mortuary accommodation referred to the Public Health Committee. The Mortuary at Bickmore Street, taken over from Poplar Parish, was viewed, and plans prepared for its adaptation as a Mortuary for the Borough. The position and size of the site were, however, against the adoption of that site, and the Borough Surveyor was instructed to examine sites in the possession of the Council and report as to the desirability of any of them being utilized for mortuary purposes, in connection with existing buildings in which Coroner's Courts could be held." " The Borough Surveyor submitted to us the site in Cottage Street, Poplar, and that, acquired for depot purposes, in High Street, Bromley. He also presented plans suitable for either site, providing for separate mortuaries for infectious and non-infectious bodies, with lobby between to enable bodies to be viewed by juries or witnesses without entering the mortuaries, and provide ! with cases for exhibiting clothes removed from bodies. A postmortem room with dissecting table, and a separate laboratory or microscopic room for more minute examinations are included. A waiting room, with w.c. acommodation, and the usual Caretaker's rooms are provided." " The approximate estimate of the cost of the buildings proposed is £1,500." 81 The Committee inspected the plans presented by the Borough Surveyor and viewed the sites submitted by him. The Committee had a decided opinion in favour of the adoption of the site in Cottage Street, but out of deference to the fact that the Council as then constituted would shortly cease to be, the Committee was reluctant to make any binding recommendation on the subject. REMOVAL OF DEAD BODIES. At a meeting of the Public Health Committee, on the 23rd September, I reported that during the last audit by the Auditor of the Local Government Board, I was informed a surcharge would be made if any dead bodies were removed to a Mortuary without an " Order " of a Justice. The Section of the Public Health Act relating to the removal of dead bodies is as follows : — 89.—1. Where either— (а) The body of a person who has died of any tious disease is retained in a room in which persons live or sleep; or (б) The body of a person who has died of any dangerous infectious disease is retained without the sanction of the Medical Officer of Health, or any legally qualified medical practitioner, for more than 48 hours elsewhere than in a room not used at the time as a dwelling-place, sleepingplace, or work-room; or (c) Any dead body is retained in any house or room, so as to danger the health of the inmates thereof, or of any adjoining or neighbouring house or building, a Justice may, on a certificate signed by a Medical Officer of Health or other legally qualified medical practitioner, F 82 direct that the body be removed, at the cost of the sanitary authority, to any available mortuary, and be buried within the time limited by the Justice; and may, if it is the body of a person who has died of an infectious disease, or if he considers immediate burial necessary, direct that the body be buried immediately, without removal to the mortuary. 2. Unless the friends or relations of the deceased undertake to bury and do bury the body within the time so limited, it shall be the duty of the Relieving Officer to bury such body, and any expense so incurred shall be paid (in the first instance) by the Board of Guardians of the Poor Law Union, but may be recovered by them in a summary manner from any person legally liable to pay the expense of such burial. 3. If any person obstructs the execution of any direction given by a Justice under this Section he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding five pounds. I pointed out to the Committee that, as the Auditor of the Local Government Board requires the law to be strictly adhered to, there is great danger to the Public Health. During the past outbreak of Small-pox, when it was known a patient was dying from the complaint, arrangements were made, that immediately the death had occurred the Undertaker should be notified, and the body forthwith removed to the Infectious Mortuary. It is clear that no Justice will make an "Order" until death has occurred, but if the death occurs say at 5 p.m. in the afternoon, the body would have to remain on the premises until an "Order" from a Police Court Magistrate could be obtained, and should Sunday be the next day, the Courts are not open. 83 The local Justice, of course, would be the Mayor, but then it is quite possible his services could not be immediately obtained. On the 7th September, a child died from Diphtheria in Poplar, and on the 8th September the parents desired the body to be removed to the Infectious Diseases Mortuary, as they did not wish to sleep in the same room with the cofpse. The services of a Magistrate could not then be obtained, as it was late in the afternoon, and the Committee were informed the body was removed to the Infectious Mortuary. It certainly would appear where friends are desirous of having corpses removed, as in this instance, no Justice's "Order" should be required, and it should be only necessary to obtain a Justice's "Order" where there is danger to the public health through the friends objecting to removal. It is a very serious danger to the public health that the body of a person who has died from an infectious disease cannot be immediately removed to a Mortuary without an "Order" of a Justice, and a very strange state of the law that such a procedure is necessary when the friends are only too anxious to have a corpse removed in order to conserve the public health. It was suggested to the Committee that the Local Government Board be asked to take into their consideration the question of surcharge which should not be made when friends are desirous of having bodies immediately removed to the Mortuary, and when no ''Order" of a Justice has been obtained, for in the Poplar Borough application has to be made either at the Police Courts, which close at or about 5 p.m. (and are not open on Sundays), or to the Mayor, who cannot always be expected to be at hand. The Committee concurred that it is important in such cases bodies should be promptly moved, and authorised such removal without a Justice's "Order" in any case of emergency. In the F 2 84 event of surcharge by the Auditor, application could be made to the Local Government Board for sanction under the Local Authorities Expenses Act, 1887. The Council approved of the action of the Committee. MODEL DWELLINGS. Grosvenor, County Council, and Hanlury Buildings.

CANAL BOATS. For the year ended 31st December, 1903, the inspections and reports of the Inspectors respecting registered canal boats and nonregistered canal boats were as follows : — Registered. NonRegistered. Mr. Johnson—West Combined Division 18 12* Mr. Anthony—Bromley North Division 0 61† Mr. Miners—Bromley Central Division 0 46‡ Mr. Field—Bow East Division 30** 64 Mr. Boyce—Bow West Division 3 31 51 214 Note.—*See below Mr. Johnson's report. † „ Mr. Anthony's „ ‡ „ Mr. Miner's „ ** „ Mr. Field's Mr. Johnson reported : — "Weaver," Reg. No. 790, of Birmingham. Certificate much torn. Owner written to re same and new certificate supplied forthwith. "Louisa," Reg. No. 157, of Boxmoor. Certificate much torn. Owner written to re same and new certificate supplied forthwith. "Irwell," Reg. No. 780, of Birmingham. Forecabin in a leaky, wet and foul state and uninhabitable, thereby causing father and daughter (aged 26 years) to sleep in after cabin in contravention of the Regulations made by the Local Government Board, 1878. A summons was applied for, the hearing took place on 11th 88 January, 1904. The summons was withdrawn upon the owner undertaking to execute repairs forthwith, and paying £4 4s. costs. In one case Mr. Johnson found the slide ventilator in fore end of after-cabin had been blocked up; this was at once put in order. Mr. Johnson had been on board at least twelve non-registered boats. Mr. Anthony's 61 non-registered boats included two visits on two boats. Mr. Miner's 46 non-registered boats included three visits to ons boat, and two visits to another. Mr. Field reported two cases of illegible marking and painting, one damp and leaky cabin, and two cases of refuse in hold not covered and ventilating into cabin. The 30 registered boats inspected by Mr. Field, included one boat visited three times, and one four times. Mr. Boyce reported one case of non-removal of bilge water. The owner was written to respecting this infringement. BAKEHOUSES. The bakehouses throughout the Borough were inspected twice during the year, and those which are underground were inspected many times whilst the work to render them suitable was being carried out. There are 115 bakehouses in the Borough of Poplar, 35 Poplar, 50 Bromley, 30 Bow. There were 118 bakehouses, but three have been discontinued being used as such. These were underground bakehouses, and the owners did not apply for certificates of suitability under Section 89 101 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891. These premises are 253, Abbott Road, 26, Devons Road, and 17, Wellington Road. The following is a list of underground bakehouses for which certificates of suitability were applied for. The certificates were granted by the Council after the necessary alterations had been carried out. Abbott Road, 94, 156. Archibald Street, 27. Bow Road, 70, 198. Brunswick Road, 269. Cadogan Terrace, 71. Campbell Road, 46. Chrisp Street, 46, 70, 78. Devons Road, 13a. Dewberry Street, la. East India Dock Road, 287a. High Street, 167. Kerbey Street, 74. Manchester Road, 364. Morville Street, 133. Old Ford Road, 391, 564. Roman Road, 129, 153a, 249. 328. Sabbarton Street, 28. St. Leonard's Road, 66. 181. St Leonard's Street, 1. Tapley Street, 12. Teviot Street, 66. Tredegar Road, 110, 153. West Ferry Road, 39, 49. Wright's Road, 14. With respect to 163 East India Dock Road, whilst this report is being written legal proceedings were taken against the occupier 90 as he had refused to carry out the alterations required by the Council, and after notice from the Council that the certificate would be refused, he had occupied the premises as an underground bakehouse and within 21 days from the date of the notice which had been given by the Council, he had not made application to the Court as provided by subsection 7 of Section 101, but the necessary alterations are now being carried out, so there will be in the Borough 36 underground bakehouses. The alterations executed at the underground bakehouses were, speaking generally, abolition of all gullies, the floors covered with an impermeable material (in some instances the floors were lowered), dampness of walls remedied, water drawn from the main, increase of light, ventilation, and protection against dust. Where sufficient light could not be obtained from the back or the front, borrowed light was procured by means of prismatic pavement lights inserted in the floor above. Areas were also either covered by a prismatic pavement light, or a skylight, and the walls of the areas lined with white tiles. The windows of the skylights at the rear, and the window sashes under the stallboards were made to hang in such a manner as to minimise the entrance of dust. Extraction shafts in some instances were also inserted, the (roughs were made movable, and the underground bakehouses were in other ways dealt with, so as to render them suitable before certificates were granted. The Islington Borough Council addressed the Home Secretary urging that legislation should be introduced to enaole Bye-laws to be made under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in relation to bakehouses, the provisions of the Act being not in themselves sufficiently explicit, and. requiring to be supplemented by Bye-laws 91 regulating the conditions as to light, ventilation, repair, the removal of refuse, the maintenance of cleanliness, the storage of materials, and other matters. The Committee were of opinion such Bye-laws are necessary. SLAUGHTER-HOUSES AND COW-HOUSES. The slaughter-houses and cow-houses in the Borough were inspected by the Inspectors. Slaughter-houses must be limewashed four times a year and cow-houses at least twice a year. There are 20 slaughter-houses : 8 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 7 Bow; and 17 cow-houses: 4 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 8 Bow. POPLAR. Reg.

At the end of the year there were in the Borough 365 registered premises where milk is sold, 120 Poplar, 148 Bromley, and 97 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspector's reports, pages 136, 143, 161, 169, 178, and 186). 14 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 10 Poplar, 3 Bromley, and 1 Bow. 54 Premises were on account of change of owner, re-registered as milkshops, 15 Poplar, 26 Bromley, and 13 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 39. ICE CREAMS. About the middle of the year 1903, all the known premises, within the Borough, where ice creams are manufactured were inspected. See Inspectors' reports, pages 136, 145, 172, 180, and 186 SMOKE NUISANCES. 345 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year—104 Bow East, 17 Bow West, 121 North Bromley, 10 Bromley Central, 13 East combined, 18 West combined, and 62 Poplar South. 123 intimations and 73 statutory notices were served. During the year seven summonses were taken out in respect of smoke nuisances. Penalties were inflicted in every instance with the exception of one, when the summons was dismissed on a technical point. See pages 124, 125, and 126 table of Police Ciurt Proceedings. 94 WORKSHOPS, WORKPLACES, LAUNDRIES AND OUTWORKERS. 1. The number of workshops on register was 406. 2. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 801, but this number varies with each six monthly return. 3. Number of outworkers shown on the lists supplied by occupiers and factories and workshops is— a. Within the district, 527. b. Outside the district, 280. 4. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. 5. The places where the outworkers are employed were inspected all of them twice during the year, some more frequently. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. During the time this report is being written, a large number of workshops has been added to the male legister. A register of bakehouses is also kept. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 189 and 190, and Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 144, 168, 179, and 184.

The number of premises where food is sold or prepared for sale is 163. 2. 349 visits were paid to these premises during the year. 3. 87 premises were found satisfactory. 4.Sanitary defects were found in 76 premises. 5. 73 intimations were served which, in some cases, were followed UP by Statutory notices, no legal proceedings were taken. A register of these premises is kept. See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 146, 137, 155, 159, 166 179, and 186. 96 FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The results of the analyses of 373 samples were reported to the Committee during the year 1903, the samples being as follows:— 1st Quarter. 2nd Quaiter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total.

The percentages of adulterated samples found in the previous five years are as follows : — 1902 15.4 1901 9.1 1900 7.6 1899 9.2 1898 14.6 The results of legal proceedings were as follows:— Milk.

With respect to this sample of cod liver oil, the Magistrate held, under Section 16 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1879, that though the charge was proved, the offence in this case was of so trifling a nature that it was inexpedient to inflict any punishment, and he therefore, without convicting, dismissed the summons, G 2 100 but ordered the defendant to pay £3 3s. costs. The Magistrate was satisfied with the bona fides of the defendant. The defendant called two analysts, one of whom would not, however, swear that it was pure cod liver oil, but the other stated that in his opinion it was pure cod liver oil. Mr. Young, the Analyst, was called at the request of the defendant, and he gave evidence bearing out his certificate. The sample had been analysed at Somerset House, and the analysts there certified that it was not pure cod liver oil, but were unable to say to what extent it was fish liver oil or cod liver oil. The Magistrate was anxious to obtain further particulars, and he suggested that the Somerset House analysts should be subpcened. The Solicitor, acting for the Council, thought that the defendants should subpoena them, and that the Council ought not to be saddled with the costs of doing so, as on the certificate of the Somerset House analysts, the Council were entitled to succeed on the summons. The defendants, however, did not want to go to this expense, and the Magistrate therefore decided the case with the materials before him as above stated. So that the total penalties obtained and costs given were: — Penalties. Costs. £ s. d. £ s. d. Milk 31 4 6 14 8 6 Butter 38 13 6 5 0 6 General 1 5 0 5 9 0 Total 71 3 0 24 18 0 Late in the year, an Inspector of the Board of Agriculture called at the Public Health Department with respect of the number of samples taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. It was reported to the Public Health Committee that the Inspector stated 101 the Board of Agriculture would like to point out the minimum number of samples which should be taken ought to be in the proportion of at least 3 per 1,000 of the population. In Poplar seven samples are procured each week during the year, but occasionally extra samples are taken, the total samples per 1,000 of the population taken in the year 1902 was 2.2 per 1,000 of the population. The matter of taking increased number of samples is now receiving the attention of the Committee. A letter was received from the Royal Borough of Kensington, referring to the failure of prosecutions by the Customs Authorities in respect of the importation of inferior butter, which, if not physically adulterated, is not distinguishable from butter which has had an appreciable percentage of foreign fat mixed with it. The Borough of Kensington had also taken proceedings in respect of similar butter for false warranty, against the warrantors, who, however, contended the butter was of Russian manufacture, that no adulteration had taken place, and that the substance called foreign fat, if it existed, was the natural product of the cow, and that pure Russian and Siberian butter would not bear the rigid analytical test applied to other butters. In the absence of any definite standard for butter, the proceedings referred to were abandoned, and a communication addressed by the Council to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture, urging that regulations should be framed by the last-named Board, under Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, for determining what deficiency of the normal constituents of butter, or what addition of extraneous matter should raise a presumption that the article is not genuine. The Committee recommended the Council to support the action °f the Royal Borough of Kensington. I lie Board of Agriculture stated, later on, that the characteristics of Russian and Siberian butter were receiving the consideration 102 of the Departmental Committee on Butter Regulations, and a copy of the communication from the Council on the subject had been sent to the Secretary of the Committee. The Committee had under consideration the question of the discrepancy which had occurred in the analysis of a sample of butter by the Borough Analyst and the Analysts at Somerset House respectively. The Committee directed that in future, portions of samples analysed be preserved in order that an independent analysis may be made in the event of dispute. The Committee adopted a new sample bottle in order that no question of escape of moisture could arise. The Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth had under consideration the penalties imposed in certain cases under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and resolved to call the attention of the Home Secretary to the inadequacy of the fines inflicted in comparison with the offence and the cost to the Council of procuring the sample, and the analysis. The Committee concurred with the Wandsworth Borough Council that the tines are often quite inadequate, and recommended to the Council to support the Wandsworth Borough Council in the representation, citing cases in point. The Battersea Borough Council wrote respecting the conflicting decisions sometimes given by Stipendiary Magistrates, under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, quite against the weight of evidence, and suggested that a special tribunal should be appointed to try disputed cases under the Acts, so qualified as to be able to understand and examine the evidence brought before it. The Battersea Council also drew attention to the system of analysis of milk adopted at Somerset House, viz., the "Maceration process, which they stated is almost universally condemned as antiquated ami incorrect. 103 The Poplar Borough Council was asked to make a representation on the subject to the Board of Agriculture. The Public Health Committee recommended the Council to support the Battersea Borough Council. The Camberwell Borough Council wrote that their Bacteriologist had made a series of examinations of milk for Tuberculosis, and the Council had had under consideration the possibility of turning the examinations to a useful purpose with the object of reducing the amount of Tuberculosis, especially Infantile Tuberculosis, existing in the Borough. It was suggested that the "Sale of Adulterated Butter" Bill, then before Parliament, should be amended by the inclusion therein of Clauses providing— (1) "In bacteriological matters, the certificate of a duly qualified and properly appointed bacteriologist shall be accepted in the same way in bacteriological matters as that of the Public Analyst is in chemical matters." (2) "That the presence of the pathogenic bacteria in milk or butter shall be deemed to be an adulteration to the prejudice of the purchaser within the meaning of the sale of Food and Drugs Acts." The Committee were of opinion that effect should be given to these proposals, and recommended the Council accordingly. The Westminster City Council addressed a communication to the Government urging them to consider the desirability of inserting in the "Sale of Adulterated Butter" Bill a clause which would give authority to a Sanitary Inspector to take samples of milk, for analysis, at any railway station situated in another Borough and being the place of delivery of milk consigned to his district. The Committee recommended the Council to support the action of the Westminster City Council. 104 RIVER-SIDE WHARVES, UNSOUND FOOD. LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD ENQUIRY. On the 15th of April, at the Town Hall of the Borough of Bermondsey, together with the Mayor of Poplar, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and Town Clerk, 1 attended a conference of Riverside Authorities with respect to the enquiry which was to be held by the Inspector of the Local Government Board on the 24th of April at the Guildhall, City of London, with regard to the proposal that the Local Government Board should issue an "Order" extending the area over which the Port Sanitary Authority should exercise jurisdiction in the matter of unsound food, so that such area should include other wharves forming part of or abutting on the Port of London. The Port of London were to have assigned to them, under section 112 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, powers, rights, duties, capacities, liabilities or obligations of a Sanitary Authority under that Act relating to unsound food. The following resolutions were adopted by the Conference, viz.: — "That this Conference is of opinion there is no justification for the proposal that the Local Government Board should issue an 'Order' transferring from the Riverside Sanitary Authorities the powers and duties they now possess in regard to the inspection of unsound food stored in and upon the Wharves abutting upon the Port of London, and pledges itself to strenuously oppose the suggested 'Order.' "That Counsel be briefed to attend the Inquiry to be held at the Guildhall, in the City of London, to oppose, on behalf of the Authorities represented at this Conference, any such transfer of powers and duties." 105 Upon receipt of the notice that Inquiry was to be held, application was made to the Local Government Board to postpone the Inquiry in order that the Local Authorities concerned might have an opportunity of considering the matter, but this application was refused. The Inquiry was commenced on the 24th April, at the Guildhall, when Mr. Horace Avory appeared for the Local Authorities, and the London and India Dock Company complained that tinned goods (fruit, sardines, etc.) landed at Wharves on the River Thames are not subjected to examination by the Sanitary Authorities, whereas the like description of goods landed at the Docks are closely examined by Officers of the Port Sanitary Authority, and that goods have been diverted from the Docks to Wharves in order to escape such examination. On Mr. Avory's representation that there had not been sufficient notice given, the Inquiry was adjourned until the 18th May, to enable the Local Authorities to submit evidence. On the 18th May, together with the Mayor, Chairman of the l'ublic Health Committee and Town Clerk, I attended at the Guildhall, City of London, and gave evidence at the adjourned Inquiry held by the Local Government Board as to whether an " Order " should be issued by the Local Government Board, extending the area over which the Port Sanitary Authority should exercise jurisdiction in the matter of unsound food so that such area shall include other Wharves forming part of or abutting upon the Port of London. Some time after the Inquiry the Local Government Board forwarded copy of a letter they had addressed to the London and India Docks Company with regard to the application of the Company for an extention of the area over which the London Port Sanitary Authority should exercise jurisdiction in the matter of unsound food. 1 he letter stated that the Board had carefully considered the inspector's Report and the evidence placed before him at the 106 Inquiry held at the Guildhall. They had also taken into consideration the proceedings in Parliament during the past session with reference to the proposals in the Port of London Bill; and they had decided, having regard to all the circumstances, not to accede to the request of the Company at the present time. The Local Government Board further considered it desirable that increased attention should he paid to the examination of food stuffs in the Borough, and a statement of the number of samples of food stuffs taken at wharves and landing places on the Thames should be included in the Annual Report. See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 137, 145, 155, 161, 167, 168. 180, 186. and 187. INFECTED ARMY BLANKETS. About Christmas, 1902, a firm of drapers in the Bow Road bought twelve blankets from a business house in Aldermanbury, four of them had been sold, and about the middle of the year 1903, whea the draper was informed the blankets were possibly infected, the remaining eight were disinfected at the Council's Depot by steam under pressure for half an hour, and by dry heat for an hour. These eight blankets appeared to be stained with blood and excrement. Other blankets which had been in contact with the soiled ones were also disinfected in a like manner. The drapers stated they would return the blankets to the people they bought them from. A pawnbroker in Chrisp Street, Poplar, on 23rd March, bought twelve blankets from a firm in Aldersgate Street. One had been sold about the middle of the year 1903, the remaining eleven, with other blankets with which they had been in contact, were disinfected by steam under pressure for half an hour, and by dry heat for one hour. With the exception of one (which had eyelets in it and had possibly been used as a sort of awning) the blankets appeared to be stained with excrement and blood. The pawnbroker said when 107 he bought them he was informed they were too late for the Government contract. The pawnbroker stated he would return the blankets to the lirm who sold them to him. As to the dates on which the blankets were sold, and to whom they were sold, no information could be obtained from either tradesman. The Medical Officer of the City of London was informed the blankets had been disinfected and were about to be returned to his district. Upon the reception of the Public Health Committee's report, referring to infected Army blankets, the Council resolved: "That a strong representation be made to the War Office with regard to the infected Army blankets referred to in the Report." WATER SUPPLIES TO SCHOOLS. The water supplies of the Hoard and private Schools were inspected. Enquiries were made as to the number and cleansing of the utensils used for drinking purposes. The reports of the Sanitary Inspectors showed in some schools a most unsatisfactory state of affairs in respect of the drinking utensils, inasmuch as there are two or three cups for a large number of scholars, and these cups are not properly cleansed. Children drinking out of the same cups without the cups being properly cleansed must be the means of causing diseases to spread, especially if a child be suffering from an unrecognised infectious disease. How is this state of affairs to lie remedied ? If there are cups, children will drink out of them and not bother about rinsing them, as they do not recognise the necessity for so doing; if there are no cups the children will put their mouths to the nozzles of the taps. In some schools it was noticed that the teachers had the water in the classrooms and served it out; this seems a very wise proceeding. It 108 would be hardly possible to station attendants at the drinking fountains to rinse the utensils every time after being used, and to prevent the abusive use of the utensils; neither could it be expected that each child should bring its own cup. The case seems to be met by having the drinking fountains near or in the class-rooms under the immediate supervision of the teachers, and having the children educated up to the necessity of rinsing the cup before using it. The Committee directed that copies of the Sanitary Inspector's reports with regard to water supplies at the schools be sent to the School Board for London and the local managers respectively. There are 29 Board Schools in the Borough, and 18 Church Schools. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. Early in March an intimation in the form of a letter was served upon all the Landlords of premises registered under the Bye-laws of Houses-let-in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family. The letter called attention that the Landlord of a lodging house shall, in the first week of the month of April, cause every part of the premises to be cleansed. It was reported to the Committee there were some premises which had been recently cleansed by the Landlords and in these instances it would not be right to enforce this clause of the Byelaw if the premises remain clean. This report, I think, was fully borne out by the remarks of the Judges in the appeal cases of Stiles v Galinski; and Nokes v. Mayor, etc., of Islington, heard in the High Court of Justice, King s Bench Division, Divisional Court, whilst writing this report, on 5th February, 1904. 109 Mr. H. J. Langley, Temporary Assistant Sanitary Inspector, was re-appointed for a further period of twelve months. Mr. Langley has been engaged in connection with the inspection and registration of houses let in lodgings for a period of over two years. See Mr. Langley's report, pages 191-194. The Local Government Board replied to the application of the Council for their consent to an amendment of the Bye-laws relating to Houses-let-in-lodgings, to the effect that such premises should be required to be cleansed in April and November in each year, instead of in April only. The Local Government Board stated that in their opinion a requirement under which every lodging house would have to be cleansed and lime-washed twice a year might be unreasonably stringent. The Board were prepared, however, to assent to the Bye-laws being amended so as to require the Landlord of a lodging house to cause every part of the premises to be cleansed in the first week of April, and at such other time as the condition thereof may render it necessary. BYE-LAWS. Made by the Council of the Metropolitun Borough of Poplar with respect to Houses Let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Interpretation of Terms. 1.—In the construction of these Bye-laws the expression "Council" means the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar; the expression "Bye-laws of 1895" means the Bye-laws with respect to Houses-let-in-lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family which were made by the Board of Works for the Poplar District on the 17th day of September, 1895, and were confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 29th day of November, 1895, 110 and words and expressions which are defined in the Byelaws of 1895, have in these Bye-laws, the same meanings respectively as in the Bye-laws of 1895. Exempted Houses. 2.—Any lodging house which is exempt from the o]>eration of the Bye-laws of 1895 shall be exempt also from the operation of these Bye-laws. For the Cleansing and Lime-washing at stated times of the premises. 3.—The Landlord of a lodging house shall, in the first week of the month of April in every year, and at such other time as the condition thereof may render it necessary, cause every part of the premises to be cleansed. He shall, at the same time, except in such cases as are hereinafter specified, cause every area, the interior surface of every ceiling and wall of every water-closet belonging to the premises, and the interior surface of every ceiling and wall of every room, staircase, and passage, in the house to be thoroughly lime-washed. Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to the lime^washing of the internal surface of the walls of rooms, staircases and passages shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such wall is painted, or where the material of or with which such surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where such surface is thoroughlv cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed if the renewal thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. Penalties. 4.—Every person who shall offend against the foregoing Bye-law shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty 111 of five pounds, and in ihe case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Council: Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this Bye-law. Repeal of Bye-Law. 5.—From and after the date of the confirmation of these Bye-laws, the Bye law numbered 15 (fifteen) of the Byelaws of 1895 shall be repealed. The Bye-laws were confirmed by the Local Government Board. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. KING STREET AREA. ARNOLD BUILDINGS. I made representations, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, Section 30, that the following dwelling houses were in a state so dangerous or injurious to health as to be unfit lor human habitation, viz.:— Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4, Prospect Place, King Street. „ 1, 2, and 3, Eagle Place, King Street. The Housing of the Working Classes Committee viewed the dwelling houses referred to, and were of opinion they were in such state as represented, and that proceedings for closing the houses should be forthwith taken, and recommended the Council accordingly. Notices were served upon the owners of the property. The notices not being complied with, summonses were obtained and closing orders made. 112 Notices were served, under Section 32 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act. 1890, upon the occupying tenants, requiring their removal within 28 days from the date of the Notices. It was necessary to take out a summons in respect of one of the tenants of Prospect Place, but, as on the date of hearing the tenant had left, the summons was withdrawn. The courts have been boarded up. There are premises the condition of which is such that to serve Notices upon the owners is fruitless, and it is evident that this has been recognised, for the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903, which was passed on the 14th August, has the following section: — 8. (1) If in the opinion of the Local Authority any dwelling house is not reasonably capable of being made fit for human habitation, or is in such a state that the occupation thereof should be immediately discontinued, it shall not be necessary for them before obtaining a closing order to serve a Notice on the owner or occupier of the premises to abate the nuisance, and a Justice may issue a summons for a closing order and a closing order may be granted, although such a Notice has not been served. (2) The Local Government Board may by order prescribe forms in substitution for those in the Fourth Schedule to the principal Act, and Section 32 of the principal Act shall have effect as if the forms so prescribed were referred to therein in lieu of the forms in that Schedule. On 29th May, on behalf of the London County Council, I attended the Thames Police Court and gave evidence respecting Arnold's Buildings. Proceedings were taken under the Buildings Act, 1894, dealing with the premises as dilapidated and neglected buildings. A technical point arose, the summons was withdrawn, 113 and the Magistrate stated the London County Council had better take out a fresh summons. It will be remembered a " Closing Order" was made on 17th April, 1894, in respect of a portion of these buildings and they were represented to the London County Council, under Part 1 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, in 1901 as forming part of an " unhealthy area." On the 19th June, a fresh summons was taken in respect of Arnold's Buildings on the instance of the London County Council to show cause why an " Order " should not be made to take them down or repair them as they were so dilapidated as to be unfit for use or habitation. The description of the buildings on the fresh summons had been taken from the rate book, and did not include the premises specially rated. Mr. Skeggs attended the Court and gave evidence, and I repeated the evidence which had been given on the 29th May. After hearing the evidence for the defence, Mr. Dickinson, the Magistrate, stated he did not wish a large sum of money wasted, so he would adjourn the summons until the 25th March, 1904, and then if the work were not done or in hand he would make an '' Order " for the demolition of the premises. Under the Housing Act, the London County Council provide the following dwellings within the Borough:— Council Buildings, Blackwall 50 tenements Montreal ,, Cotton Street 50 Toronto „ 20 Adelaide „ Ann St. and Brunswick Rd. 40 Melbourne „ 40 Sydney ,, 55 255 Prestons Road, Poplar (in course of erection) 266 Total 52 The London County Council have also further schemes in course of development, dealing with other areas in the Borough. H 114 SEWERAGE, DRAINAGE, COMBINED SYSTEMS AND CONFERENCES. In the memorandum issued by the Local Government Board to the Medical Officers of Health respecting their Annual Reports, it is stated that the Local Government Board desire to obtain, through the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, information of particular changes of condition that occur by the action of the Local Authority, and one of the subject matters which is required to be reported upon is the condition of sewer and house drains; therefore, one cannot do better than report upon the good work which has been carried out by the Public Health Committee at the instigation of the Borough Surveyor. The Borough Surveyor reported that the Sewer in Brunswick Road was defective and at a level unsuitable for efficient drainage, more especially the portion between Abbott Road and Andrew Street The Committee considered alternative plans and estimates for the reconstructing the sewer and for connecting the drainage direct to the1 deep level sewer of the London County Council. The Committee were of opinion the requirements of the case would be met by connecting the drainage of the portion of Brunswick Road referred to direct to the London County Council Sewer, the remaining portion being also connected when necessity arises. The Borough Surveyor submitted a plan providing for the drainage of Cold Harbour to be diverted into the London County Council's sewer in New Road, necessitating the construction of about 1,000 feet of 9-inch and 12-inch pipe sewer with manholes, ventilating shafts, etc., including the re-drainage of Nos. 2 to 34 Cold Harbour. On the 10th September, 1898, notice was served on the Board of Works for the Poplar District by the Thames Conservancy requiring the discontinuance of the drainage of Cold Harbour into the Thames, the drainage discharging direct into the river at the 115 side of North Wharf. Extensions of time had been granted from time to time pending the completion of the London County Council Relief Sewer under the Dock entrances, to which the drainage could be connected. This work being completed, the Conservancy pressed the matter. The new sewer for the drainage of Cold Harbour being completed, the Thames Conservancy were communicated with in order that they might take steps to compel owners to cease discharging sewage into the River Thames, but drain into the new sewer. A list of premises discharging sewage into the River was forwarded to the Conservancy. The Surveyor reported that Campbell Road Sewer was in a defective condition. It being an old pipe sewer of an obsolete kind, the Surveyor proposed that a length of about 1,400 feet be reconstructed with 12-inch pipes, the several premises connected thereto, and the necessary manholes constructed. The Borough Surveyor reported that the old brick-barrel sewer draining a large area by Augusta Street, Poplar, and running in an irregular line at the rear of houses abutting on the neighbouring streets, from Lion Street to the High Street sewer, was in a very defective state, and choked in places. The Surveyor proposed to deal first with the more urgent work by reconstructing the sewer in Southill Street (West of Kerbey Street), constructing a new sewer in Giraud Street (South of Market Street), and part of Ricardo Street, substituting a 9-inch pipe sewer for the brick barrel at the fear of Nos. 1 to 37, Giraud Street, and connecting this portion of the system with the Market Street sewer. The work comprised the construction of about 670 feet of 12-inch and 450 of 9-inch pipe sewer, with necessary manholes, and picking up of connections. The Surveyor also put in about 500 feet of 9-inch pipe sewer to replace the brick barrel at the rear of the houses drained. H 2 116 The sewer in Hewlett Road having become blocked the Borough Surveyor reported that when the ground was opened up in places he found the sewer collapsed, owing to when it was originally constructed in 1865, it had apparently been put in by tunnelling between shafts without the tunnels having been properly filled in and consolidated. The Surveyor reconstructed the sewer. The Borough Surveyor reported the sewer in British Street, Poplar, to be defective in places, without proper fall, and not laid upon concrete. This sewer was reconstructed. The Council adopted the report of the Borough Surveyor that it was desirable a new sewer should be constructed in Parnell Road from Locton Street, to Ruston Street before the paving works authorised by the Council were proceeded with. The Surveyor's proposal is to construct about 300 feet of 9-inch pipe sewer. The Surveyor pointed out there was no sewer in this portion of the road. The Borough Surveyor submitted a plan for the reconstruction of a defective sewer draining Wellington Road. The sewer having become blocked was, as a matter of emergency, partially reconstructed. The Surveyor reported that the sewer at present discharges into Fairfoot Road sewer, but has an insufficient fall, and to obtain this he proposed to divert it by constructing a new length of sewer connecting it with Knapp Road sewer. The work proposed comprises the construction on modern lines of about 815 feet of 15-inch and 630 feet of 12-inch pipe sewer. Upon the report of the Borough Surveyor, the Committee recommended that Bridge Road sewer should be extended by about 90 feet to take the drainage of Messrs. Lamb, Beal and Co. s premises. The extension to commence at the junction of the new sewer in Bridge Road with the Dock Company's drain, with a fail in the reverse direction to the remainder of the Bridge Road sewer. 117 The Borough Surveyor very wisely pointed out to the Committee the need for the construction of manholes to existing sewers to enable the sewers to be properly examined and cleansed. A number of the Council's sewers are without manholes and can only be examined by breaking open the sewers, and, consequently, it is only when a blockage occurs that defects can be discovered. This suggestion of the Surveyor as to manholes, is now being largely carried out throughout the Borough. The owners of the premises in Paris Terrace were called upon to drain the forecourts of their houses by a combined operation, there being a sewer low enough in Gough Street into which they can drain. The Engineer of the London County Council, in response to complaints of nuisance arising from ventilating gratings over their sewer at Wick Lane, stated that if the Borough Council would allow ventilating columns to be placed upon the footpath, or, better still, along the centre of the carriageway, the Main Drainage Committee would be recommended to advise the Council to sanction the expense of providing and erecting such columns. The Public Health Committee recommended the Council to give permsision for the erection, by the London County Council, of ventilating columns on the footway in Wick Lane, and the permission to embody provisions respecting pattern and positions of the columns. Ventilating columns have been erected by the London County Council. Complaints had been made from time to time of serious nuisance arising from the gratings ventilating the sewer of the London County Council in St. Leonard's Street, and a deputation waited at the Public Health Offices on the subject. The Engineer of the London County Council informed the Public Health Committee 118 that a scheme for the ventilation of the sewers in the Borough would be laid before the Main Drainage Committee immediately after the recess, but the Public Health Committee directed a communication to be sent urging the necessity for proceeding immediately with the ventilation of the sewers. A ventilating column has been erected in High Street, Bromley, opposite Bromley Church, and another column in St. Leonard's Street, corner of Priory Street. The Local Government Board approved the Bye-laws made by the London County Council requiring persons about to construct, reconstruct, or alter the pipes, drains, or other means of communicating with sewers, or the traps and apparatus connected therewith, to deposit with the Sanitary Authority of the district such plans, sections, and particulars of the proposed construction, reconstruction, or alteration as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining whether such construction, reconstruction, or alteration is in accordance with the statutory provisions relative thereto, and with the Bye-laws made under Section 202 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1855. The Bye-laws require inter alia that drainage plans be submitted in duplicate, and that block plans of the premises be also deposited. The London County Council decided not to contribute half of the salaries of the Inspectors who are engaged in the work of supervising the original construction of drainage work carried out under the Metropolis Local Management Acts. A Conference of representatives of Metropolitan Borough Councils was held at the Town Hall, Camberwell, to consider the question of the duties of Sanitary Inspectors, and to take such action as may be deemed advisable with regard to asking the Local Government Board to amend its " Order " as to the duties to be performed by the Sanitary Inspectors or to adopt some other means of providing for a uniform 119 system throughout London, in connection with the important work of supervising the original construction of drainage work. Together with the then Mayor, Mr. Councillor Bussey, the Town Clerk and Borough Surveyor, I attended a deputation which waited upon the President of the Local Government Board on the subject of combined drainage with a view to legislation. A Conference, to which the Council appointed delegates, was held at Battersea as far back as October, 1901. Together with the Chairman of the Public Health Committee (Mr. Councillor Bacon) I attended a Conference at Fulham Town Hall, on the 11th December. The Conference was convened to consider the desirability of proceeding to an Appeal in the House of Lords against the decision of the Court of Appeal in Silles v. Fulham Borough Council. In this case it was decided that a pipe from the point where it receives rain-water from two houses, becomes a sewer within the meaning of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and one of the Justices expressed the further opinion that the downstack pipe was, in such a case, also a " sewer." The Conference adjourned for one month in order to again communicate with the Metropolitan Local Authorities who were one and all in full sympathy with the Fulham Borough Council, asking them to contribute towards the expenses of an appeal. It was decided to send particulars respecting the decision to the President of the Local Government Board. It must be obvious to everybody that if a stack pipe is to be a sewer, as one of the Justices expressed the further opinion, then an eaves gutter taking the rain-water from more than one house must also be a sewer, and it can be readily seen if such is to be considered the case in future, how easy it is for anybody to 120 vert underground conduits, stack pipes and eaves gutters into sewers and cause the entire maintenance of such structures to be thrown upon the Local Authorities. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises, either on account of there being no plans, or the plans not being in order:— 22 to 28, Samuda Street. 117, 118, Cadogan Terrace. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, Athel- stan Road. 170, Bow Road. 92, 93, and 94, Suffolk Street. 30, Upper North Street. 2 to 16, Lingen Street. 78 to 86, St. Leonard's Street. 10 and 11, King Street. 22, Woolmore Street. 1 to 4, Carter's Terrace, Rigden Street. 1, Davis Street. 14 to 24, Findhom Street. 60 to 66, Barchester Street. 30 and 32, West Ferry Road. 18 to 28, Lindale Street. 533 to 539, Manchester Road. RIVER LEA. The pollution of the River Lea from the London County Council storm outfalls at Old Ford was under the consideration of the Committee. The outfalls discharging between the Bromley and Old Ford Locks, showed quantities of crude sewage. The Committee directed that the samples taken should be submitted to the London County Council with a strong protest against the discharge of crude sewage into the river, and a recommendation that the storm outfalls should be removed from the part of the river shut in by locks, and taken into the tidal portion of the river; also that efficient screens should be provided at the outfall?. In a letter received from the Local Government Board by Mr. Sidney Buxton, M.P., who had been approached by the Council with reference to the proposed Hertford sewage scheme, it was stated that the scheme submitted is to treat the effluent 'n 121 contact beds, followed by filtration through sand, and further treatment on land is not proposed. A local enquiry had been held, and the Inspectors had been instructed to report very fully on the questions w net her land treatment should be dispensed with, and whether the scheme is otherwise the best practicable. The sewage effluent of Hertford enters the River Lea by the Manifold ditch below the Ware Lock, about 13 miles above the intake of the East London Water Works Company, and some months ago, when I inspected the Manifold ditch wi.h Mr. Councillor Bellsham, the Representative of the Boroughs of Poplar, Stepney, and Hackney, on the Lee Conservancy, the filth in this ditch was disgusting. SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Where w.c. pans and traps had been fixed without notice to the Clerk, under clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Committee, in every case brought under their notice, directed that the builder be written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise he would be prosecuted for infringing the Bye-law. During the year 16 cases were brought under the notice of the Committee. In seven instances, after the ground had been opened, the drains were found defective.

Summons dismissed Mr. Anthony The above summons came on for hearing on the 7th August, but on account of nobody appearing against defendant, summons was dismissed. Mr. Young, Solicitor, acting on behalf of the Council, informed Mr. Dickinson, the Magistrate, that the Court had altered the date of the summons from the 7th August to 10th August, and had so informed him (Mr. Young), but owing to the Clerk in the Police Office not altering the date of the summons with which defendant was served from the 7th to the 10th, the defendant attended on the 7tb. It was admitted that the Clerk in the Magistrate's office had omitted to alter the date, but inasmuch as the defendant had answered the summons as ordered by the Court, and had therefore been put in peril the Magistrate did not see his way clear to grant a fresh summons against defendant upon the application of Mr. Young, although the mistake had arisen through the negligence of the Court Officials. | Unsound food .. .. .. .. . ,1 19 th Aug... | £10 10a. penalty, £10 10s. coats ..iMedical Officer On the 22nd July, 1899, a summons was issued in respect of 982 tins of unsound food intended for the food of man, and deposited in a stable in Wilson Street. 1,086 tins had been seized, but the contents of 20 tins were stated to be good, and the contents of 84 tins were so bad that there was no doubt they could not have been used for the food of man. The defendant did not appear on the date fixed for the hearing, 1st August, 1899, and a warrant was issued. Defendant was arrested after four years, and was fined on the 19th August, 1903, £10 10s., and the Magistrate gave £10 10s. costs, a total of £21. 541 Old Ford Road Mr. Field summoned, so that "Closing Order" of 1st March, 1900, might he cancelled 19th Aug.

On page 111 Section 8 of the Housing of the Work'ng Classes Act, 1903, has been referred to. By Section 9 when houses are demolished under the Act, and the sale of the materials fails to cover the cost of the demolition, the balance can be recovered from the owner as a civil debt. Section 1 raises the maximum period for repayment of loans from 60 to 80 years, thus considerably reducing the annual charge on the rates of a re-housing scheme; and at the same time excludes loans raised for the purpose of re-housing from the general limitations imposed, with regard to the total rateable value and total loans outstanding. Section 3 imposes the obligation on any authority, or person acquiring land under the Housing Acts on which there are workmen's dwellings occupied by 30 or more persons belonging to the working classes, not to enter on such dwellings until the Local Government Board have either approved of a Housing Scheme, or decided that the scheme is not necessary. There is a schedule at the end of the Act which sets out in considerable detail various provisions in relation of the making, enforcement, and modification of such schemes. Section 4 enables the Local Government Board to order a scheme to be made, and in case of failure to make such scheme, the order may be enforced by a mandamus. Section 10 gives a speedy way of recovering possession of houses from occupying tenants in pursuance of " Closing Orders." 128 By Section 11 the power to provide dwelling accommodation is made to include the power to provide shops and recreation grounds. Section 12 prevents Landlords and Tenants agreeing to contract themselves out of the provisions of Section 75 of the principal Act which relates to the condition implied in letting houses for the working classes, viz., that the house is at the commencement of the holding in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation. Employment of Children Act. The employment of Children Act was passed in August. There are general restrictions on the employment of children under 14, and power to Local Authorities of making Bye-laws imposing special restrictions on the employment of children, and also on street trading by persons under 16. By Section 3 a child is restricted from being employed between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., but a Local Authority may, by Bye-law, vary these hours. A child under the age of 11 years shali not be employed in street trading. No child who is employed half-time under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, shall be employed in any other occupation. A child shall not lift, carry or move anything so heavy as to be likely to cause injury. A child shall not be employed in any occupation likely to be injurious to life, limb, health, or education. By Section 1 the Act gives power to ma.Ke Bye-laws for regulating the employment of children as follows: — The age below which employment is illegal, and the hours 129 between which employment is illegal, and the number of daily and weekly hours beyond which employment is illegal, and the Bye-laws may prohibit or permit, subject to conditions, the employment of children in any specified occupation. There is also power by Section 2 to make Bye-laws for the regulation of street trading by persons under 16, which includes conditions as to sex and age, requirement of a license, determining the days and hours during which, and the places at which, such street trading may be carried on. The Bye-laws may require such street traders to wear badges, and to regulate generally the conduct of such street traders. The Bye-laws shall have special regard to the desirability of preventing the employment of girls under 16 in streets or public places. By Section 8 a Justice of the Peace may empower an Officer of a Local Authority to enter a place where it is believed a child is illegally employed. Section 11 provides that a license under Section 3 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1894, shall not be granted by a Petty Sessional Court to a child under 10 years of age. By Section 3 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1894, a Petty Sessional Court is empowered to grant a license to any child above 7 years of age to take part in any entertainment, or any circus, or any other place of Public Amusement, or to be trained as an acrobat, or for a dangerous performance, but now, no child under 10 can henceforth be employed in a Theatre at all, nor can any child under 14 be employed in a Theatre at night, except when specially permitted by a Bye-law of a Local Authority. Section 13 gives the definition of street trading, wnich includes hawking of newspapers, matches, flowers, and other articles, play- I 130 itig, singing, or performing for profit, shoe-blacking, and any other like occupation carried on in streets or public places. The Sanitary Accommodation Order of 1+th February, 1903. The Secretary of State issued an " Order " under Section 9 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, determining what is sufficient and suitable accommodation for persons of each sex within the meaning of this Section. The " Order " prescribes one sanitary convenience for every 25 males, and the same proportion for females. Where the number of males employed exceeds 100, and sufficient urinal accommodation is also provided, it shall be sufficient if there is one sanitary convenience for every 25 males up to the first 100, and one for every 40 afterwards. Where the number of males exceeds 500, upon a certificate from the District Inspector of Factories under certain conditions stated, it shall be sufficient if one sanitary convenience is provided for every 60 males, in addition to sufficient urinal accommodation. This " Order " does not apply to the Administrative County of London, but obviously it may be taken as a guide. The London County Council propose to make application in this session of Parliament for powers: — 1.—Enabling Sanitary Authorities to require the cleansing or destruction of articles of clothing which are in a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition. 2.—Enabling Sanitary Authorities to require the owners of premises to strip the walls and cleanse any room or rooms infested with vermin, and enabling owners to recover the cost of the work from tenants in certain cases. 3.—Enabling Sanitary Authorities to require the reconstruction or removal of urinals or other conveniences 131 opening on to streets and constructed before the passing of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and so placed as to be a nuisance or offensive to public decency. 4.—Enabling the Council to make Bye-laws to be enforced by Sanitary Authorities requiring the paving of stables with impervious material. 5.—Enabling Sanitary Authorities to require the removal of fixed dust receptacles after movable receptacles have been provided. 6.—Enabling Sanitary Authorities to examine premises on which food is prepared for sale, and to require the removal of conditions likely to give rise to contamination. 7.—Amending Part VIII. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, so as to make penalties against ice cream manufactures and vendors payable to the Metropolitan Borough Councils. 8.—Prohibiting the sorting and sifting of house refuse by hand in London. The Committee considered the report of the Public Health Committee of the London County Council on the subject and were of opinion the proposals should be supported.

Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., Corner of Fairfield Road, May, 1904. I 2 132 Public Health Department, December Hist, 190S. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my fourteenth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending 31st December, 1903, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 675 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 133 Do. on house-to-house visitation 467 Do. Canal Boats 55 Re-Inspections 2,547 Making a total of 3,877 visits Details and results of such inspections from time to lime have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,275 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that 51.5 per cent, of the premises thus inspected various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out—requiring the service of 658 written intimations, 32.1 statutory, and 86 final notices. In many of these cases on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 2 cases it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating attendances at the police-court to ensure enforcement. 133 The details and nature of Sanitary Works executed in the Bow West Division during the year are as follows:— Walls and ceilings of houses cleaned throughout 37 partially 126 Drains opened and cleansed 88 Defective drains repaired 66 Inlets to drains properly trapped 7 Sink waste-pipes properly disconnected from drains 1 Rain-water pipes do. do. 2 Water-closets re-constructed 7 Water laid on to soil pans of W.C.'s 60 Ventilation of W.C.'s improved 2 New soil pans provided where broken or unsuitable 21 Foul soil pans cleansed 15 Yards, areas, and forecourts paved 65 Yards and areas drained 4 Nuisances from dampness remedied 56 Roofs made watertight 189 Eaves guttering of roofs and rainwater pipes repaired 132 Water supplies to houses reinstated 31 Water services for domestic purposes altered or improved 0 Water service fittings repaired 13 Public house urinals repaired and cleansed 3 Animals improperly kept (removed) 0 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 32 Rye-laws enforced 5 Other nuisances remedied, chiefly dilapidations 140 Overcrowding abated 2 Drains tested* by the application of the smoke drain test, of which 16.6 per cent, were proved defective 396 * Primary tests only. 134 House-to-House Visitation.

The market places have been regularly inspected throughout the year, but in no instance was any article of food exposed for sale at the time of my visits in such a condition as to justify seizure. The following have also received constant attention throughout the year:— Bakehouses 21 Registered Milksellers 65 Public House Urinals 23 Marine Store Dealers 3 Butchers' Shops 19 Fishmongers' „ 12 Fruiterers' „ 9 Ice Cream 6 137 By your direction I have submitted 53 varied samples of food to the Public Analyst for analyses, of which three were certified to have been adulterated. The vendors of the three adulterated articles were summoned, and convictions obtained, with costs. A special inspection of the 9 underground Bakehouses has been made with the view of ascertaining if any alterations were necessary to warrant the granting of certificates under the new enactment relating to Bakehouses which will come into operation on 1st January, 1904. The 28 Coffee and Eating Houses and other premises where food is prepared have also been specially inspected, and the food stuffs on the premises examined with satisfactory results. Through the year 1 bag of mussels, 1 trunk each of mackerel, plaice, and haddocks, and 6 casks of salted beef have been examined by request of their respective owners, and found unfit for human consumption. On the 28th February the basement of the premises of a wholesale provision merchant in Cardigan Road was flooded with sewage matter caused by an obstruction in the Council's sewer. A large quantity of butter, margarine, eggs, bacon, and cheese were contaminated. All the above-mentioned articles of foodstuffs examined were destroyed and the usual certificate given. 138 PAKISH OF BOW (West Division).

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you the Annual Summary of the Sanitary work and improvements carried out irk the Bow East Division during the year ending Slst December, 1903. Inspections have been made as follows:— On notifications of infectious diseases 85 On complaints of nuisances 885 On house-to-house visitation 333 Re-inspections 2437 Total 3740 In 576 instances varied Sanitary improvements were necessary, requiring the services of 544 intimations, 182 authorised statutory, 45 final notices, and the issuing of 8 Police Court summonses supplemented by 2437 re-inspections to secure proper compliance, resulting in the following detailed works being executed:— throughout 36 Walls and ceilings of houses cleaned partially 73 Yards and areas paved 7 Yards and areas drained 35 Inlets to drains properly trapped 6 Defective drains repaired 74 Drains opened and cleansed 88 Sink waste pipes properly disconnected from drains 4 Rain-water do. do. do. 4 Water laid on to soil pans of W.C.'s 39 140 New soil pans provided where broken or unsuitable 3 Foul soil pans cleansed 13 Roof guttering and rain-water pipes repaired 82 Roofs made watertight 142 Water supplies to houses reinstated 29 Water service fittings repaired 1 Water services for domestic purposes altered or repaired 1 Ventilation of W.C.'s improved 0 Nuisances from dampness abated 42 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 34 Public house urinals cleansed and repaired 8 Bye-laws enforced 110 Overcrowding abated 3 Other nuisances remedied, chiefly dilapidations 214 Drains tested by the application of the smoke drain test, of which 22.4 per cent, were proved defective 329 Cisterns cleaned and covered 1 Inundations 11 Nuisances from the improper keeping of animals 2 Dung receptacles provided or repaired 2 Water closets newly constructed 33 DRAINAGE CONSTRUCTIONS AND RECONSTRUCTIONS.

W.C., part reconstructed of main. 73, Bow Road, part reconstruction of main. HOUSE-TO-HOUSE INSPECTION. The house-to-house inspection comprised the whole of the houses in the under-mentioned streets, viz.:— Brewery Yard. Kinnear's Dwellings. Bream Street. Leonard's Buildings. Craven Buildings. Mitford Terrace. Davey Road. Remus Road. Gandy Court. Rothbury Buildings. And sections of:— Baker's Alley. Trego Road. Kelday Road. Wyke Road. Maverton Road. Blondin Street. Monier Road. Bream Street. Rippoth Road. SMALL-POX. No cases of Small-pox have occurred within the district, but one contact has been kept under observation during the incubatory period. 143 BAKEHOUSES. The bakehouses throughout the district have been periodically visited, and the conditions in some instances necessitating service of intimation for dirty walls and flooring, accumulations of sweepings or ashes beneath the troughs, and the bi-annual cleansing not carried out at the stated periods. With two exceptions the bakehouses of the district are conducted on the ground level. These have been measured, and specially examined and reported upon, and necessary alterations made in conformity with the new regulations governing underground bakehouses. whi':h came into operation on 1st January, 1904, for abolishing or regulating bakehouses situated 3 feet Beneath surrounding ground levels. In each case of underground bakenouse certificates of fitness have been granted. DAIRIES, MILKSHOPS AND OFFENSIVE BUSINESSES. 1 he milkshops, numbering 32 on the register, and offensive businesses in the district have been periodically visited; an intimation in the case of offensive business being sufficient to secure amendment. In one or two instances, milkshops have changed hands without the incoming tenant registering, through ignorance of existence of regulations. On their attention being directed to infringement, they immediately registered. In three instances, attention has been drawn to rusty or broken condition of measures, resulting in the condition being forthwith remedied. The conditions of storage vessels, and utensils generally have been very satisfactory. One vendor has removed to premises on opposite side of street. CANAL BOATS. X inety-three boats have been examined; of the registered boats, three were found in an unsatisfactory condition, in two cases the boats required re painting, and the names were not sufficiently 144 legible. The holds, which were used for carrying house and other refuse, were not covered with cloths or hatches, and cabin ventilated immediately over hold. In one other instance the distinctive marking was insufficient. In each case letters were sent to owners and Registration Authority, pointing out the defects. Of the unregistered barges, the cabins are totally unfitted for use as habitations, for which it is feared many of them are at times improperly used. The registered boats generally were found to be maintained in a cleanly and satisfactory condition, and usually carrying less persons than registered for. Only one of the boats visited carried either women or children. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP INSPECTIONS. Nuisances arising within the several factories and workshops have been satisfactorily dealt with. SMOKE NUISANCES. The smoke nuisances arising within and without the district have received much attention. In the matter of smoke nuisances arising without the district little improvement is perceptible. In two instances summonses have been taken out and heard at West Ham Police Court. On 24th June, at West Ham Police Court, an abatement order with .£2 2s. costs, and a prohibitive order were obtained against The Saw Mills Company, Ltd., of Cook's Road, Stratford, for causing nuisance from smoke within the Borough of Poplar. On 8th July, a summons was heard at West Ham Police Court against Messrs. Walter Jones and Sons, Ltd., of Magnet Wharf, 145 Stratford, and dismissed by the Magistrate upon the raising of a technical point, relating to the description of the premises. The nuisances from smoke arising within the district have been very slight, but in two instances summonses have been taken out as follows: — On 18th July, at the North London Police Court, summonses were heard against Messrs. W. C. Barnes and Co., Ltd., of Wallis Road, Hackney Wick, and Messrs. Carless, Capel, and Leonard, of White Post Lane, for smoke nuisances. The defendants in each case were fined 10s. and 23s. costs. FLOODING. During August very heavy rains were again the cause of flooding in the low-lying portion of Hackney Wick, by which several houses and other premises in the district were rendered temporarily unfit for habitation. COW AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The cow and slaughter houses in the district have received attention throughout the year, and found generally satisfactory. MEAT AIMD FOOD INSPECTION. The food supplies within the district have been vigilantly watched. On 29th September, one large hamper of shrimps unfit for food was destroyed by owner, and a certificate of unfitness given. On 23rd July, a half hamper of shrimps unfit for food were destroyed by owner, and certificate given. ICE CREAM. The shops wherein ice cream is made or sold have been visited periodically. In only one instance (an alien) was it necessary to k 146 serve intimation requiring cleansing of walls, etc. A great improvement has taken place in the conditions under which the cream is made and stored in this instance. The itinerant vendors throughout the district have been visited from time to time, and found to comply with the new regulations. EATING HOUSES AND COFFEE SHOPS. In accordance with instructions of the Medical Officer of Health, the whole of the eating houses and coffee shops within the district have been specially inspected and generally were found in a fairly good condition. In one or two instances the kitchen required some lime-whiting, which was immediately done upon the service of intimation. COUNTY COUNCIL SEWERS. The ground level ventilators of the County Council sewers running through the district have been from time to time an intolerable nuisance, from the very powerful emanations of sewer- gas in Old Ford Road, Cadogan Terrace, Wansbeck Road, and Smeed Road particularly. Representations were made to the L.C.C., and petitions forwarded from aggrieved persons. During the month of August, six cases of Diphtheria occurred in the immediate neighbourhood of one of the openings. This occurrence was immediately followed by considerable activity on the part of the London County Council in erecting several uptake Ventilating shafts along the line of route of the sewers in question. These are not yet completed, but considerable relief from.the offensive emanations is apparent, and presumably the nuisances existing at the ground level will be reduced to a minimum so long as atmospheric conditions are favourable. Some nuisance has arisen from the tops of the shafts along Cadogan Terrace, as the height of the 147 houses is considerably above the top of the shafts, and when the wind is in a westerly direction the fumes are carried directly into the houses in the vicinity. FOOD AND DRUGS. Fifty-seven varied samples of food or drugs have been obtained and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, of which four were certified to have been adulterated, in three instances convictions were obtained with costs, and in one instance the vendor was ordered by the Magistrate to pay costs on the dismissal of summons. On 25th February, at the Thames Police Court, defendant was fined £5, including costs, for selling butter adulterated with 80.5 per cent of foreign fat. On 4th December, at the Thames Police Court, defendant objected to the Public Analyst's certificate that sample of cod liver oil was "fish oil, and not cod liver oil," and the third portion of sample was, at his request, submitted to Somerset House for analysis, and the summons accordingly adjourned. On 8th January, 1904, the adjourned summons was heard, when the Magistrate imposed 3 guineas costs on the defendant, and dismissed the summons. On 23rd December, a sample of milk was purchased for analysis which was certified by the Public Analyst to be "deficient in fat, and solids not fat, to the extent of 18.3 and 8.3 per cent, respectively." At hearing of summons, on 26th January, 1904, at Thames Police Court, defendant was fined 40s. to include costs. On 31st December, a sample of milk was purchased, and on analysis was .certified by the Public Analyst to be "deficient in fat to the extent of 20 per cent." k 2 118 At hearing of summons, at the North London Police Court, on 2nd February, 1904, defendant was fined 2s. 6d. and 12s. 6d. costs. RIVER LEA. On 11th June, the portion of the River Lea, between Bow Bridge and the London County Council relief outlet at Old Ford, was inspected, and samples of the water taken, at the request of the Medical Officer of Health. The water appeared unusually clean, with very little fcecal matter floating upon the surface. REFUSE DEPOSIT On 30th March, a very large deposit of street and market refuse and slop, emitting a very foul odour, and which was being added to daily, was discovered upon a wharf in the district. It was alleged that this refuse was removed by contract from the streets of a neighbouring borough. The matter was immediately reported to the Medical Officer of Health, and the premises watched daily. The refuse was said to have been accumulating about ten days, and was daily increased in volume. It was evidently intended to remove the refuse by barges, but none were provided. The owner was communicated with by telephone, letter, and inti mation without effect, and a summons was authorised to be issued against the wharfinger. At the hearing of summons, on 5th May, at Worship Street Police Court, the full penalty of £5 and 23s. costs was imposed. This had the almost immediate effect of a speedy clearance, and the wharf has not been used for the same purpose since. 149 CLOSING ORDER. On 19th August appeared at Thames Police Court in answer to summons issued by the owner of No. 541, Old Ford Road, asking that a Closing Order, dated 1st March, 1900, should be cancelled or rescinded. The Order was cancelled by consent of the Medical Officer of Health, provided the basement rooms were not used for living or sleeping purposes. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS.

A special inspection of the 23 tea rooms and eating houses in my Division of the District has been made, but in only two cases sanitary defects were discovered. The usual notices were served, and the nuisances complained abated. The markets and stalls have been regularly inspected throughout the year with a view of detecting diseased and unwholesome food, but in no instance was anything exposed for sale at the time of my visits to justify seizure. I have also inspected the whole of the bakehouses in my district, and the notices as to defective drains and lime-whiting were served and the nuisances complained of abated. In addition to the usual periodical inspection of the 10 bakehouses in my district, a special inspection was made of the seven underground bakehouses, with the view of ascertaining what alterations were necessary to warrant the granting of a certificate under the new Bakehouse Regulations I have made periodical inspections throughout the year of the above houses.

Bromley North Division. 157 Public Health Department, Slut December, 1903. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to submit to you my fourteenth Annual Report of the Sanitary works, executed for the abatement of nuisances which had existed in the Central Division of the Parish of Bromley, under the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, for the year ended 31st December, 1903. I have inspected 1371 premises, 950 in response to complaints of nuisances, 107 on account of infectious diseases notified, an! 314 house-to-house inspections were made. Of the 1371 premises so dealt with, 372 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the remainder, 999 nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated list, page 122) and 4200 re-inspections were made in the supervision of same. House-to-house visitations were carried out as follows : — Street Section of Streets. Bromley Street. Abbott Road. Bromley Cottages. Aberfeldy Street. Burcham Cottages. Brunswick Road. Clutton Street. Devas Street. Colin Street. Ettrick Street. David Street. James Street. Dewberry Street. Leven Road. Donald Street. Lingen Street. Dunbar Cottages. Lochnagar Street. Empson Street.

Willis Street. Yatten Street The drains of 280 premises were tested—by means of the smoke lest (either with rockets or the machine)—120 drains wgre found to be defective (not gas-tight), and in the remaining 160 instances with "negative-results. The water test had been applied to all new work, and where practicable to work reconstructed on old lines. The drains of the undermentioned new and old premises had been constructed and reconstructed, and (where practicable) intercepted, ventilated, and furnished "with. the means of access for cleansing purposes, in accordance, with the London County Council's Drainage Bye-laws. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, Abbott Road (front area drainage), 131, 133, 135 (previously reconstructed), 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, throughout to sewer, at 139, 237, 237a. 81, 83, 85, 87, 88, 90, 92, Aberfeldy Street. 70, 102, 104, 114, 116, 118, 120 (throughout, connected up wit^i Council's new sewer in road), 122, 124, front basement areas, 103, 127, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 147, 149, 153, 155, 245, 247, Brunswick Road.

In carrying out the above-mentioned drainage works, it was found necessary to .submit nine plans to the Councillor approval. The institution of legal proceedings for disregarding .statutory notices served under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, for the abatement of nuisances, etc., has not been necessary in any instance, as the notices served were complied with. Eating Houses. I have, by your direction, inspected the eating .houses (coffee shops) in my district, and the following, with one exception, were found to be in fair sanitary condition: — 118, 165, St. Leonard's Street. 25, Dewberry Street. 127, Brunswick Road. 125, St. Leonard's Road. L'pon the service of intimation, etc., the one in question (No. 165, St. Leonard's Road) had since been put in order, and in no case was there cause for complaint so far as food was concerned. Fifty-one samples of food had been, procured and submitted to the Public Analyst (Mr. W. C. Young) for analysis. Six were-fouml to be so much adulterated that legal proceedings were taken. -The 160 nature of articles, extent of adulteration, result of prosecution in each case being as follows: — Butter.—" Adulterated with 62.7 per cent of foreign fat, and containing 6 per cent, of excessive water." Vendor fined £5 and £1 lis. 6d., under the Margarine Act, for not having the statutory label displayed. Second summons for having served same in unstamped wrapper, at the suggestion of the Magistrate, was withdrawn. Milk.—"Deficient in fat, and solids not fat, to the extent of 16.7 and 3.5. per cent., respectively." Two summonses were issued against proprietor and employee. Both were dismissed, upon the " written warranty " produced. Milk.—" Deficient in fat to the extent of 25 per cent." Vendor fined 2s. and £1 3s. costs. Milk.—" Deficient in cream to the extent of 90 per cent." Vendor fined (third conviction) £8 and £1 3s. costs. In default of payment and distraint, one month's imprisonment. The previous convictions were: — 1898.—Fined £3 and £1 3s. costs. In default, 14 days' imprisonment. 1901.—Fined £5 and £1 3s. costs. In default, one month's imprisonment. Milk.—" Deficient in sclids not fat to the extent of 3 per cent.'' Vendor fined £6 and £1 3s. costs. Milk.—"Deficient 21.6 per cent, in fat, and 7 per cent, solids not fat." Vendor fined £2 and £1 3s. costs. Seizure of Unsound, Unwholesome Tinned Goods. I attended, at your request, with you, on the 19th August last, the Thames Police Court to give evidence upon the apprehension of the owner of the 982 tins of unsound food intended for the food of man, which were deposited in a stable in Wilson Street, and seized by you, with my assistance, on the 22nd July, 1899, for which offence the defendant was fined £10 10s. and £10 10s. costs. 161 Bakehouses. I have, as directed by you, made the periodical inspections of the 14 bakehouses in the Bromley Central Division (seven of which are underground) and where required served intimations and statutory notices for the necessary work of cleansing, and in some cases sanitary repairs to be carried out. Regarding the underground bakehouses (one since disused), specifications were prepared and submitted by the tradesmen's Surveyors, and the work of alterations carried out in accordance with same, to your satisfaction, and in compliance with the new Act, 1904, the necessary certificates have since been granted. I have on several occasions, upon different tradesmen's applications, examined articles of food purchased by them, at the markets, and when found to be "unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for food of man" witnessed the same destroyed, and have given certificates to that effect. In no instance was any article of food exposed for sale, or deposited for the purpose of or preparation for sale, at the time of my visit, in such a condition as to justify seizure. I have made 46 inspections of non-registered and registered sailing barges. The cabins were fairly clean, and regulations complied with. The cowshed at the rear of 27, Abbott Road, dairies, milkshops, and milk purveyors' shops, have been frequently inspected, and the register corrected. In the case of those found to be non-registered through change of proprietorship the new occupiers had signed forms of application in compliance with your instructions, and had their names inserted in the register. Constant attention has been given to the enforcement of the regulations relating to cleanliness of premises and utensils, etc., but in no case has an infringement been discovered. Where a nuisance had occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney belonging to a factory, bakehouse, etc., either on com- L 162 plaint or from my own personal observation, intimations, notices, etc., have been served, and the nuisances for the time being had been abated in compliance with same. By your direction frequent inspections have been made of the schools in the district, all of which had been found to be kept in fair sanitary condition. Cowshed. One notice had been received for renewal of licence. The premises, No. 27, Abbott Road, were again duly inspected, found to be in fair sanitary condition, no objection raised. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Canal Boats Act, Bromley Central Division. 163 Public Health Department, Decembtr Slat, 1903. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my third Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith, in the West Combined district during the past 12 months, rendering as detailed an account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc, as possible. In investigating complaints, and making inspections of all kinds, 1401 houses or other premises have been visited, 246 of this number being on account of infectious diseases, and 78 being houseto-house visits. The number of re-inspections necessary to follow up the Notices totalled 3998. I am very pleased to state that on the year's total of infectious diseases, there has been a falling off of 397 cases (the total for 1902 was 643.) This is no doubt due in a large measure, to the absence of any epidemic to speak of, and the abnormal rainfall that has taken place. The drains of 224 premises have been tested with smoke or scent tests, and in 155 cases were found to be defective, and allowing escape of foul gas from same. Some drains were in such a state as not to require any test to prove defects. House-to-house inspections were conducted in the undermentioned places, viz.: — Arcadia Street. Market Street. Birchfield Street. Ricardo Street. Barchester Street. Southill Street. Broomfield Street. Sussex Street. King Street. Sabbarton Street. Limehouse Causeway. Upper North Street. Morris Road. West India Road. L 2 164 During the year the drains of the following premises were taken out (where necessary right through to sewer) and reconstructed, and, where practicable, in order to comply with the Bye-laws of London County Council and the Borough Council, were intercepted, ventilated and provided with proper means of access for clearing in times of stoppages in same, the whole being subjected to the " hydraulic " or water test, before being passed as sound. In a number of instances there are " combined systems " among those dealt with. 1, 13, 15 (17, part), 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, Arcadia Street. 1. 6, 14, 16, Alton Street. 9, Augusta Street. 45, 47, 49, Bygrove Street. 71, 60, 62, 64, 66, Barchester Street. 1, 3, Bath Street. 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, Birchfield Street. 62, 64, 66, 98, Canton Street. 27, Chilcot Street. 7, 8, Cottall Street. 49, Limehouse Causeway.

Upper North Street, Guardian's Offices. Coffee Shops and Eating Houses. Acting on instructions from the Committee, special inspections were made of the whole of the coffee shops and eating houses in the district, numbering 26. Some of these had previously been inspected by me and various improvements carried out, in the shape of improved skylights and better ventilation of cooking places. Of the others some were found to be in a more or less unsatisfactory state, and where sanitary defects as to drainage were 167 detected, and where cleansing was required, the necessary Notices were served, and the work put in hand without delay. In two instances the premises were quite unsuitable for the proper carrying on of the business, without some structural alterations, and the places shut up. One place has since had the alterations carried out, and is now open again for business. These shops are now periodically inspected. Food Inspection. There is one riverside wharf in the district where food is shipped and landed for transit, and this is regularly visited. The food consists principally of preserved and tinned goods, all tinned goods being subjected to a 10 per cent, examination on arrival before being taken over. When any "blown" tins, or tins that have beei "nailed" in the boxing up are found, they are put on one side and destroyed by contract as often as necessary. The butchers' shops and market stalls from which foodstuffs are purchased in the district have received attention, especially where sausage making is carried on. At times I have in one day entered every butcher's shop in the market without exception, examining the ice safes and refrigerators where these exist for any unsound food. On one occasion I discovered two pigs' livers which were in a state of decomposition, also some 14 to 20-lbs. of sour beef unfit for food. I destroyed the lot and severely commented on it to the proprietor, who has since left the district. On another occasion I discovered and seized some 11 rabbits, marked up at 4|d. per lb., they were decomposing about the body and quite unfit for food. After pouring disinfectant upon them. I had the lot taken to the Borough Council's destructor and burnt. By your directions a letter was sent to the vendors, cautioning them that if a second offence occurred, legal proceedings would be instituted. 168 At different periods I have condemned and destroyed (sometimes by request)— 3 barrels of fresh haddock. Half the stock of a grocer's shop (unfit for food). 4 cases of blown salmon (on landing wharf). 1 kit of herrings. 27 boxes of tomatoes. Sundry lots of fruit. Several consignments of damaged rice, wheat, and other cereals, and 140 cases of mouldy currants, released from the docks by the Port Sanitary Authority, have been received into the district, and the proper disposal of same carried through. Factory and Workshops. A revised register of workshops and workplaces in the district has been prepared, and this is added to or altered as occasion requires. These places are receiving particular attention as to water closet accommodation, and proper provision for females where the latter are employed, and also as to general cleanliness and ventilation and light. In some instances new W.C.'s have been built, and in others, where space and the general structure of the worKplace make the provision of a W.C. on the premises most difficult and undesirable, special arrangements have been made and the workpeople are provided with a convenience close by under lock and key. In one instance I found a workshop where six men were employed making boots and shoes The place was not registered, was dilapidated and dirty, and there was no convenience of any kind. All "outworkers'" premises have been visited when necessary, and mostly found in a satisfactory condition. All observations of "Black Smoke" from shafts and chimneys in the district, notified from the L.C.C., and also my own 169 tions have been investigated. The Notices under the Section of the Public Health Act which deals with "Black Smoke" have been attended to as carefully as is possible, and in two cases where the stokers could not see the top of their shafts, large mirrors in frames have been provided for reflecting the same in order that a smoke nuisance can be at once seeni and dealt wicn. No legal proceedings with respect to above have been necessary during the year. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops. These places have been regularly visited throughout the year, and in accordance with the "Regulations" governing the same, the periodical lime-washing and cleansing have been carried out without much trouble. Special visits have been paid just prior to the granting of fresh licenses in respect of the cowsheds and slaughterhouses. In one case of a slaughterhouse, the L.C.C. Inspector opposed the renewal of license, but the objection was over-ruled by the licensing Committee. Now and then some milksellers have had to be severely cautioned as to the condition of the "dippers," the caution had the desired effect, for there was no reason to complain upon the next inspection. I have sometimes thought that it would be much better if the Council had the power to refuse granting "milk " registration papers to small chandlers' shop keepers, on account of their premises being unsuitable for storing milk The milk, perhaps a quart up to half-agallon, being the amount for the day, is put in close proximity to paraffin oil, soap, open jars of pickles, tarry wood, etc., and despite my insisting on the receptacles being covered with dust proof material, the milk must surely become somewhat contaminated. The number of premises as above is now: — Milkshops 89 Cowsheds 2 Slaughter-houses (one for swine only) 3 170 Bakehouses and New Regulations. The whole of the 25 bakehouses in the district have been visited at intervals during the year, and the cleansing of walls and ceilings and staircases, etc., carried out according to the requirements. While inspecting one bakehouse I discovered a baker asleep on his bed on top of the troughs, and in searching under the troughs I found six or seven old boots, green with mould and smelling badly, and quantities of other rubbish. I had the master in and after showing the above, cautioned him as to further proceedings should the bakehouse not be kept clean. There are seven underground bakehouses in the district, and to six of these the necessary alterations as to light and ventilation, etc., have been carried out according to plans submitted to the Public Health Committee for approval. The remaining one is partly done, and the owner who is also the occupier refuses, up to the present, to proceed any further with the work. The occupiers one and all, I am glad to say, are agreed now the improvements have been effected, that they were much needed, and the workers are benefited thereby. Canai. Boats Acts. "Canal boats" have been watched for and inspections carried out as often as possible. These "boats" trade between different inland waters and the firms along the cutside. 20 registered "boats" have been boarded and examined as well as numerous unregistered barges. Any small infringements of the "Regulations" have soon been put right. In one case, however, a serious infringement was found to be existing—the forecabin was in such a dilapidated condition that the master's daughter (age 21) was compelled to sleep aft in the same small cabin as the father occupied, and when complained about it appeared that neither had had their clothes off for three weeks. Legal proceedings were instituted against the owner, who was at fault in a technical sense, but on his arrival from 171 mingham, and giving a satisfactory explanation of the state of affairs, and paying all costs £4 4s., the summons was allowed to be withdrawn. On the next appearance of the "boat" she was in thorough good order. Three renewal certificates of registration have been supplied in accordance with the letters sent to owners. No cases of illness on any " boat " have been found to exist. The pumps, bulkheads, water vessels, etc., are invariably in good order and condition, and the cabins very clean. The occupants of the "boats" have never opposed an inspection in any way. Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-eight samples of different kinds have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, nine of which were returned as adulterated. By order of the Committee Legal proceedings were instituted in each case. Many others contained carious preservatives, and in some cases a large percentage was found in the article analysed. This being a difficult matter to deal with, no proceedings have been directed to be taken in such cases. The nature of sample and extent of adulteration, with results of proceedings are set out below:— Butter.—Adulterated with 81 per cent, of foreign fat. Defendant fined £10 inclusive. Milk.—Deficient in fat 13.3 per cent. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in fat and solids not fat 1G.7 and 4.1 per cent. Defendant fined £3 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat 3.3 per cent. Defendant fined £1 inclusive. 172 Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat 27 per cent. Defendant fined £3 and 23s. costs. Butter.—Containing an excess of water 3.1 per cent. Defendant fined £4 and 23s. costs. (Warranty produced and disallowed by the Magistrate). Milk.—Deficient in cream 5 per cent. Defendant fined £1 and 23s. costs. Butter.—Adulterated with 68.3 per cent of foreign fat. Defendant fined 33s. 6d. inclusive. Milk.—Deficient in solids not fat 10 per cent. Defendant lined £2 and 23s. costs. Ice Cream Regulations. Tn the month of August, I found an Italian itinerant vendor of ice cream selling the article to some school children in my district in contravention of the London County Council General Powers Act (part 8), in so far as there was no name and address on his barrow. On questioning the man, I found he came from the Limehouse district. I communicated with the Sanitary Inspector for that part, in order that the premises where the ice cream was made might be visited. Legal proceedings were instituted, and a fine of £1 with 23s costs was imposed, oi in default 11 days' imprisonment. Housing of the Working Classes Act.—Part II. Closing Orders. The premises known as Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, Prospect Place, King Street, and 1, 2, 3, Eagle Place, King Street, were in such a condition, and the surroundings so unsuitable with regard to light and ventilation that "Closing Orders" were obtained at the Thames Police Court, and in the case of the former 25s. costs on each summons, and in the latter 4s. costs on each summons, were allowed by the Magistrate. 173 One tenant in Prospect Place had not vacated the premises on the expiration of 28 days' Notice served in accordance with the Magistrate's " Order," and after repeated excuses, a summons was applied for, but at the last moment the house was emptied, and the summons withdrawn. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Upon authorization from the Committee, the owner of 43, Southill Street was summoned for disobeying a "Statutory Notice to abate a nuisance. After hearing the evidence of both sides, the Magistrate inflicted a fine of £3 and 23s. costs, together with a seven days' abatement order. The work was then finished in the time allowed. The two blocks of tenement dwellings in the district have four times been inspected during the year, and in the case of "Hanbury "Buildings some improvements in the lighting and ventilation of the W.C.'s ha,ve been effected. There has been very little illness indeed in connection with these dwellings. Several minor infringements of the Bye-laws of the Council and L.C.C. have occurred, but mostly through builders being unacquainted with the same. An explanation has invaribly put thing; right.

Board (Lon.); Sanit iry Inspector and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs and Canal Boats Acts. 174 Public Health Department, December 31st, 1903. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my eighth Annual Report of the sanitary work carried out in my district (East Combined Division) during the year ended 31st December, 1903. 1370 premises have been inspected, 1104 in answer to complaints of nuisances, 114 on account of notification of infectious diseases, the remainder being 152 house-to-house inspection. Out of the above total number of inspections the drains of 260 premises have been tested with either smoke or chemical drain testers, and 123 were found to be defective (not gas-tight), and in 137 instances the tests revealed no defects. 631 premises were found to be in good condition. See tabulated list for defects, page 122. House-to-house inspections have been carried out in the whole of the following streets, viz.:— Melbourne Buildings. Tetlev Street. Sydney Buildings.

The shops and stalls in my district have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting unsound and unwholesome food, and in several instances quantities of fish, meat, and fruit have been destroyed, and the retailers cautioned. Frequently throughout the year, cases of fish, fruit, and vegetables have been brought to the office by tiadespeople and costermongers, who have found, on arriving home from market, that the articles were not of the same quality as the samples shown to them, and on examination have been proved to be totally unfit for the food of man. In each case the goods were taken to Glaucus Street Depot and destroyed, certificates being given, so that the purchasers were in a position to demand the return of their money. Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, 34 applications have been made for authority to make complaint and take legal proceedings against owners in default, but in each case the nuisances were satisfactorily abated before applying to the Magistrate. Under the Bye-laws of the London County Council, Section 16 (2), there has been no occasion to take legal proceedings, particularly in reference to removal of fish offal and other offensive matter during prohibited hours. Food and Drugs Acts. Sixty-eight samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Four were found to be adulterated, and legal proceedings instituted in three cases only; nature of article, extent of adulteration, and result of legal proceedings being as follows:— Miik.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 40 per cent. Vendor fined 35s. including costs. M 178 Butter.—Adulterated with 77.7 per cent, of foreign fat delivered to purchaser in paper wrapper stamped “Margarine,” no action taken. Butter.—Adulterated with 81.4 per cent, of foreign fat. Vendor fined £10 and 23s. costs. Milk.—Deficient in fat to the extent of 33.3 per cent. Vendor fined 20s. and 23s. costs. Bakehouses. I have, by your direction, made periodical inspection of the bakehouses throughout my district, 16 in number, three of which are underground, the conditions in some cases have necessitated service of Intimations respecting dirty walls, flooring, and utensils, also accumulation of sweepings under the troughs, and the biannual lime-washing not being carried out at the time specified in the Act The underground bakehouses have been thoroughly overhauled with respect to cubic capacity, light and ventilation, drainage, means of dust prevention from outside (as far as practical), water supply, etc. Certificates of suitability were granted by the Council after the necessary alterations had been carried out. Cowsheds and Slaughter-houses. Five Notices were received for the renewal of licenses. The premises were duly inspected, and where any infringements of the regulations were found, Notices were served, and the nuisances satisfactorily abated before the licenses were granted. Cowsheds 2 Slaughter-houses 3 Milkshofs and Milk Sellers. I have, by your instructions, made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is sold throughout the district with the object 179 of detecting any infringement of the regulations in respect of means of storage, prevention of contamination, and registration In two instances there was cause to make complaint of dirty utensils, and in two cases the measures were found to be old and worn out, Intimations were served and new ones supplied. No. of milk vendors, 34. Do. do. discontinued selling milk. 11. Do. do. changeS ownership, 9. Workshops and Workplaces. 1 have, by your instructions, called at the workshops and workplaces in the district where male labour only is employed, and obtained the number of workmen employed, and, where nuisances were found to exist, Notices! were served and the nuisances abated. Smoke Nuisances. During the past year considerably less complaints were received in the district, particularly from Orchard Place, where most of the shafts are situated, which have been under careful observation, and when dense black smoke has been emitted from shafts and chimneys, Intimations and Notices have been served and the nuisances abated. More often than not the fault has been through bad stoking. Coffee Houses. Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, and Fried Fish Shops. During the past year, special supervision has been given to these premises, all of which have been inspected with regard to their sanitary condition, water supply, and cleanliness of cooking utensils. The food has also been inspected. The premises generally were found to be in a very unsatisfactory condition, particularly the coffee houses, particulars of which were duly reported to the Public Health Committee, in each case Notices were served and the nuisances abated. M 2 180 Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. In accordance with your instructions, the whole of the premises where ice cream is prepared were inspected, with the view to detecting any infringement of Part VIII. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. Each Itinerant vendor's barrow was inspected to see that the manufacturer's name was legibly fixed thereto, and an examination was also made of the ice cream and the utensils. In no case was an offence detected. Wharves, etc, where Food is Stored. Concordia Wharf.—Coldharbour is the only wharf in my district where tinned food (principally) is received either for export or for sale to wholesale firms. These premises have been almost daily inspected, and during the past year 151 tins (various sizes) of preserved meat and fish were found to be blown, and the contents on examination proved to be unfit for the food of man. These were condemned by the consent of the Manager, who stated they were not intended for sale, as they were kept separate from the sound tins. Male Outworkers. Rooms where male outworkers are employed have been inspected in connection with premises where cases of infectious diseases have been notified, the sanitary arrangements have been examined, drains tested, and any defects found duly remedied. Overcrowding. On the 25th February, a case of overcrowding, at No. 1, Burford's Court, was reported. The usual Notices were served upon the tenant landlord, who applied to Mr. Mead, at Thames Police Court, for an ejectment order. The tenant landlord stated that the rooms had been measured up by the Sanitary Inspector and found to be badly overcrowded, and he had given the usual Notices to the occupier; thereupon the Magistrate requested me to attend the 181 Court to give evidence. The Magistrate made an “Order” for the abatement of the nuisance within seven days, which was accordingly carried out. On the 24th October, at the request of Mr. Mead, I attended at the Thames Police Court to give evidence respecting a very bad case of overcrowding in the back room, first floor, at No. 12, Woolmore Street. An “Order” was made to abate the nuisance forthwith, and the overcrowding was abated the same evening. The occupier being fined 4s. Ten other cases of overcrowding were dealt with, without having occasion to resort to legal proceedings. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Assoc. San. Inst., Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Fast Combined Division. 182 Public Health Department, March 31st, 1903. To the Medical Officer of Health.

At the Thames Police Court, on the 20th of February, the owner of 79, Stebondale Street, Cubitt Town, appeared in answer to a summons issued for wilfully acting contrary to a Magistrate's Order, made on the 18th January, 1901, closing the said premises as unfit for human habitation. On the 9th February, I noticed a bill in the window advertising the house to let. I at once wrote to the owner informing him of the Magistrate's Closing Order, and warned him against letting the premises until they had been put into habitable repair, and the Order had been rescinded by the Court Notwithstanding this intimation, the house was occupied, and from the 14th to the 23rd February was without a water supply, and various other insanitary conditions existed on the premises. At the Police Court, Mr. Dickinson, the presiding Magistrate, after hearing evidence on both sides, ordered the defendant to pay £24 and 23s. costs. The premises having been put into habitable condition to your satisfaction, on the 27th March, in response to a summons, I attended at the Court, and the Magistrate being satisfied the premises had been made habitable, rescinded the Order. Bakehouses, etc. Detailed statements of the condition of the three underground bakehouses in this division, together with sketches in plan and section, had been submitted to you. In response to your notices and specifications of works required, and improvements necessary, to comply with the new Act relating to bakehouses, extensive alterations and improvements have been made in the lighting, ventilation, and sanitary conditions generally of the underground bakehouses. 186 Periodical inspections were made of the following premises, and Notices served as under: — Number of Intimations or Notices served. Bakehouses 10 18 Cowhouses 1 1 Slaughterhouses 3 2 Sausage makers 4 1 Dairies and Milkshops 25 5 Ice cream vendors 6 3 Coffee shops, restaurants, and dining rooms 35 27 Frequent visits were made to the undermentioned river side wharves:— Victoria Wharf (Crosse and Blackwell) is chiefly used for landing and storing pickles. Hutching's Wharf, landing of food stuff discontinued. Timothy's Wharf, nothing but grain and jute landed. Maconochie's Wharf, and food preserving and manufacturing premises. No unsound food stuffs landed at time of any of my visits. Sufferance Wharf, and food preserving and manufacturing premises. At the above wharf the following food stuffs were notified to the Public Health Department, and surrendered for examination with the results indicated:- 15th March.—112 doz. jars meat extract (in cases) returned from abroad; 26 doz. were in sound condition; 86 doz. were damaged, and were destroyed in the Incinerator on the premises. 10th September.—Three cases each containing 50 doz. tins of Anchovy paste. 1 he whole destroyed in the Incinerator on the premises. 187 12th October.—64 casos tinned Salmon each containing 48 tins. Destroyed at the request and cost of the owner at the Borough Council's Dust Destructor. 28th November.—97 doz. cases tinned Salmon, 4 doz. per case. Destroyed at request and cost of owner at Borough Council's Dust Destructor. Information was received on the 21st January of 12 casks of pigs' heads and feet in bad condition at premises in the West Ferry Road. On examination the whole was found to be unfit for human food. The owner stated he was treating for the sale of the stuff for manufacturing purposes. The following day the whole was purchased by a firm of fat melters, and was removed to their premises, at Stratford. Notice was given by you at the time of the removal to the Medical Officer for Stratford. Information was received on the 23rd December from the Port Sanitary Authority of a large quantity of food stuffs at a bonded warehouse in Cubitt Town. The premises were forthwith visited, and the following food stuffs were examined:— 713 sacks of coffee, and four loads loose. 360 boxes of rasins. 1 load cocoa nuts. 95 bags of pepper. 10 bags of dog biscuits. 257 chests of tea It was ascertained that the whole had been salvaged from the s.s. Batavia, sunk in the Thames, and had been a week under water. It was in an advanced state of fermentation, and quite unfit for human food. By arrangement with the Salvage Company, the whole 188 of the goods, with the exception of the tea, was destroyed in the Borough Council's Dust Destructor. The tea was removed by water to a firm of chemical manufacturers for the purpose of extracting the caffeine. An Officer of H.M. Customs and myself had kept observation of the goods until their ultimate destruction. Sale op Food and Drugs Acts. Forty-five samples had been purchased under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and submitted to Mr. Young, the Public Analyst, for analysis. A summons was granted in February last against the vendor of a sample of milk marked 58F, for selling milk deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 13 per cent. The business had changed hands, and the defendant had left the neighbourhood before the Warrant Officer could serve the summons. Every enquiry was made to ascertain his new address, hut with no success. This summons has, therefore, not been served. There had been no other prosecution under this Act during the year. The particulars of samples purchased, the result of analysis, etc., had been reported month by month to the Public Health Committee. I am, Sir, Your Obedient Servant, CEPHAS FOAD, Assoc. San. Institute, Sanitary Inspector, Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and Inspector of Canal Boats. 189 Public Health Department, December 3ht, 1903. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present to you my fourth Annual Report of the work done in factories, workshops, and among outworkers, during the year 1903. During the year, five workrooms have been overcrowded; two in Bromley, and three in Bow. 1 have reported four factories and seven workshops as having insufficient or no separate closet accommodation. One employer closed his workshop, and one discharged the females. In one case alterations were made and two employers made satisfactory arrangements, and in one case temporary provision was made pending the removal of the factory next March. Legal proceedings were taken against one employer for failing to comply with the Notice of the Council, resulting in the defendant being lined £5 and 23s. costs. At the present time the necessary work at these premises and the four remaining cases is nearly completed. The women's conveniences at Bow Road, and Blackwall, have been inspected frequently, and have usually been found in a satisfactory condition. The outworkers lists have been inspected at the premises from which work is given out, and lists have been received from 72 employers in the Borough. 137 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs, containing the names of persons who live in Poplar. 69 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. From these lists 1636 visits have been made to the homes of the outworkers, and a large number of the 88 new workshops registered during the year have been discovered in this way. 190 The following is a tabulated statement of further details— REPORT OF LADY INSPECTOR (Miss Tatters all .

December 31st, 1905. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sib,— I beg to submit to you my second Annual Report of the work carried out by me, in the Borough of Poplar, respecting houses let in lodgings. The total number of houses on the register is 580. The number registered during the year being 207. The number of houses that have been registered and re-registered during the year is 329. The registered houses are situated in the Borough as per statement below— Bow 89 Bromley 206 Poplar 203 Millwall and Cubitt Town 82 Total 580 This gives an increase of 299 houses added to the register during the year. The total number of rooms that have had their cubical capacity ascertained being 200. These rooms are used either as day, or day and night rooms. Fifty-one cases of over-crowding have been found to exist. These have all been abated, either by the occupants of the house leaving the premises, or by distributing themselves throughout the rooms insuch a manner as to avoid and abate the over-crowding. Comparing 192 the number of cases of over-crowding with those of last year, it will be noticed there is a decrease. These figures refer to the same area, more night inspections having been made. In many other cases the cubical capacity of the rooms was very little short of the required standard, and no action was taken. 153 night inspections were made during the year. These visits were confined practically to the same area visited during the previous year, and much less over-crowding was found to exist. These visits were paid at all hours of the night. Constant care is required to prevent over-crowding in the houses occupied by Italians, and many visits have to be paid. 259 circular letters were' sent to the landlords of registered houses, drawing their attention to the requirements of the Bye-laws, in respect of cleansing, during the latter end of March and the first week in April. Many final Notices were sent before the work of cleansing was finished, and in nearly all instances the work was completed before the month of April expired. The number of rooms cleansed during the year being 774, and the number of yard walls and W.C.'s cleansed was 235. The rooms are stripped and either re-papered or coloured-washed ; while the yard walls and W.C.'s are lime-washed. 207 intimations were served upon the responsible landlords, informing them that their houses had lieen placed upon the register. Owing to the constant change of tenant-landlords, many houses have had to be re-registered during the year. During the year, 2050 re-inspections had been made with a view to seeing that the interior of the houses were kept clean, and that the over-crowding had not recurred. 193 Where nuisances had been found to exist upon premises, relating to foul smells, leaky roofs, broken W.C., or defective drains, the same were reported to the Inspectors of the respective districts. Houses in the under-mentioned streets have been registered, Poplar. Arcadia Street. Park Place. Brunswick Street. Park Street, Broomfield Street. Rook Street. Cordelia Street. Simpson Road. High Street. Silver Lion Court. Lion Street. Sophia Street. Norfolk Street. Wades Place. Bromley. Bartlett Street. Gale Street. Box Street. Hawgood Street. Devons Road. Lingen Street.

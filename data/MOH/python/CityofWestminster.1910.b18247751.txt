To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councillors of the City of Westminster. My Lords and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Annual Report for the year 1910. Returns required by the Local Government Board, and particulars relating to Factories and Workshops required by the Home Office, are incorporated therein. I have again to point out that it is somewhat difficult as the years get further away from the last census period to estimate the correct population of Westminster thereon, or make the usual calculations. Under such circumstances birth and death rates cannot be regarded as reliable, and any conclusions drawn from a consideration of them must be guarded. Apparently the year as a whole has been a healthy one. The death rate of London is estimated at 12.7 per thousand persons living, as compared with 16.4 the average of the previous ten years, and 14.5 for the last five years. For Westminster the rate was 11.0 per thousand, the average being 14.1 for the ten years, 12.8 for the last five years. Deaths from the principal infectious diseases were equal to a rate of 1.14 per 1,000 for London, which is lower than preceding years, the average of the ten preceding years being 1.8. 2 Measles became prevalent in London during the last three months and proved extremely fatal, the number of deaths recorded being 526 in excess of the corrected averages number in the corresponding period of the five preceding years. The disease was also prevalent in Westminster, but the mortality was not great, which may be ascribed to the attention given to each case. The method adopted is described in the Report. More could be done were information as to children suffering to reach the Council sooner from the schools. There is at present no means of learning of the existence of measles unless some member of the family attends school. It has been suggested that compulsory notification should be instituted, but as only a small proportion of the children are attended by medical men before the visit of the Council's Inspectors it would not be of much value. Parents cannot be relied upon to notify. The Local Government Board has issued an order enabling the Metropolitan Asylums Board to utilise spare accommodation in the hospitals of the Asylums Board for the reception and treatment of additional classes of poor persons. Under the authority thus conferred upon them, the Asylums Board will be enabled to receive from any of the Poor Law Authorities of the Metropolis children suffering from measles or whooping cough into any of their hospitals where there is vacant accommodation. It is understood that some 1,000 beds will be available for these cases. Special attention has continued to be given to the subject of tuberculosis, and the schemes mentioned in my last Report has been brought into active working. The medical staff and the almoners of the various hospitals has been freely co-operated, a special (paid) Phthisis Visitor has been appointed by the Health Society, and at the end of the year 406 persons suffering from pulmonary or other form of tuberculosis, together with persons who were regarded as doubtful or suspicious cases, were on the Visitor's list. These do not include persons having no settled abode, who move from one casual ward or shelter to another. The beds taken by the City Council at a sanatorium have proved to be a valuable adjunct. On the whole the "Westminster Scheme" has shown itself to be a distinct success. The death rate of children under one year of age in London varied but little for fifty years (1841 to 1890), except in the decade 1881-90 when meteorological conditions were favourable. The rate in the first ten years of the half century was 157 per 1,000 births, and in the last was 159. Since 1900 (which coincides with the period when the Borough Councils came into existence) the London rate has regularly decreased year by year, until it now stands at 103. For the first five years of the decade, beginning with 1901, the rate was 138; for the last five years, 118. 3 It must, however, be kept in mind that during the last four years the climatic conditions have again been favourable to infant life, and resemble those existing in 1881-90, but in that decade the infant death rate only fell to 152 per 1,000. The marked improvement which has taken place is due to the methods which have been introduced in recent years, whereby instruction is given to mothers in the way to bring up children, by ladies specially qualified for the work. The system was begun in Westminster in 1903. The average death rate for the districts which eventually formed the City was 158 for the ten years 1891-1900, varying in the component districts from 132 in St. George's to 176 in St. Margaret and St. John, and in the Strand. The average of the last nine years (1901-9) for the City is 110, and the rate has fallen in the year 1910 to 82 per 1,000 births. In the beginning of 1909 the Notification of Births Act came into force, the Local Government Board having sanctioned the suggested arrangement that the Hon. Secretary of the Health Society, Miss M. Horn, should be appointed the Council's Honorary Health Visitor. The Council provided an office at the St. George's Baths, Buckingham Palace Road, and the Society has thus become a special centre for health in the district. Detailed records are kept of individual cases, and systematically indexed for future reference. The discovery of sickness and ill-health in other members of the family arises frequently from the infant visiting, and in this way very complete family histories in disease have been collected, together with much knowledge of sanitary and economic conditions. This collected information is particularly valuable in dealing with school children, with phthisis, and in many other directions. The Hon. Health Visitor has been assisted in visiting by 25 ladies, and is in close touch with the various agencies, philanthropic and otherwise, working in the City, most of which send representatives to the committees of the Society. It is with regret that I have to add that owing to ill-health Miss Horn is unable to continue the double duty, but her valuable experience, together with the assistance of the other Visitors, will still be available. The Council has continued the special attention it has given for some years to the purity of the food sold in the City and the sanitary condition of the places in which it is prepared. The inspection of workshops and workplaces occupies a large part of the time of the Inspectors, and especially of the two Lady Inspectors. Details of the defects found are set out in special tables, and particulars are also given relative to houses in which work is carried out by out-workers. 4 The Council has taken action under the new Housing and Town Planning Act in regard to a number of houses in St. John's Ward, and underground dwellings in various parts, and has also had special reports on several streets in Westminster. I desire to express my appreciation of the able assistance I have received from all the staff in the work of the Department. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, my Lords and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, FRANCIS J. ALLAN, Medical Officer of Health. March, 1911. 5 PART I. A. Population. At the census in 1901 the resident population of the City of Westminster was 183,011; for the year 1910 it is taken by the RegistrarGeneral at 167,233. This is arrived at by a calculation based on the assumption that the rate of decrease ascertained at the census taken in 1901 as having taken place since the census taken in 1891 is still continuing; it is obvious that the risk of error may be considerable. The Registrar-General has to estimate the population under the Equalisation of Rates Act, and for this purpose adopts a different method, which, so far as Westminster is concerned, yields a different result. According to one method the population of Westminster has declined, as stated above, by 15,778 in the ten years ; according to the other method a decline is also shown up to 1907, though at different rates each year, but in April, 1908, instead of a decline there was an increase. This year the equalisation population is 174,491, which is 7,258 above the estimate of the Registrar-General on which he calculates his birth and death rates. Consequently if the equalisation of rates method be the more correct, rates calculated on the other estimate will be too high. The figure 171,790, as estimated by me, lies between the Registrar-General's two estimates, and it is on this that the various rates in this report are calculated. The Census will be taken in 1911, and when the figures are available the rates for the years which have elapsed since the previous Census can be recalculated. A point to be noticed is the increase (shown in column two) in houses comprising two or more tenements; these have increased from 231 in 1902 to 421 in 1910, and the number of separate occupiers in them from 8,926 to 11,818. 6  l 2 3 4 5 6 Number of Houses as defined in Local Government Board Schedule.

Births. 2,365 births were registered in the City in the 52 weeks ending 1st January, 1911. On examination, 49 births were found to he referable to other districts. Through the courtesy of the Committees of Management of Endell Street, York Road, Queen Charlotte, and the Clapham Maternity Lying-in Institutions, of the Master of the Strand Workhouse at Edmonton, the Secretary of the French Hospital, the Steward of St. George's Workhouse, Fulham Road, and of other Medical Officers, I have ascertained that 276 children were born in outlying institutions, the home address of whose mothers was in Westminster. The net number of births was, therefore, 2,592 as compared with 2,751 in 1909; the birth-rate, uncorrected, was 13.1, corrected 15 0 per 1,000 persons. The birth-rate for the County of London for 1910 was 23.6, the rate during the preceding ten years averaged 25.8 per 1,000. The birth-rate in England and Wales was 24.8, the average of the preceding ten years being 27.5. The birth-rate was again lower than any rate recorded since registration was established. 9 Table I.‚ÄîShowing the number of Births in the City of Westminster and its Wards (corrected by distributing Institution Births).

It will be noted that, the total number of births is again less than in previous years. The birth-rate calculated on the number of married women in Westminster, distinguishing the legitimate and illegitimate, shows more exact rates. The number of married women between the ages of 15 and 45 in Westminster is estimated to be 17,865, and the unmarried and widows at the same age-period 38,119. 10 Westminster. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910.

In a certain proportion these mothers were sent into the lying-in hospitals from rescue homes in Westminster whither they had been brought from other districts. Probably these might number about 50, which would reduce the illegitimate births to 143, and the total births to 2,544. I have, however, included them in order that comparison may be made with the figures in previous years, and because when the infant has died the death is put down to Westminster. The Notification of Births Act was adopted in 1908, and came into operation on January 18th, 1909. The number of names of infants notified and registered is in excess of the actual number of infants born, as it is not at all infrequent to find, especially among foreigners, that different surnames are given, the proper surname being given on registration, but the first name or some name more easily pronounced than the proper surname is given to the doctor or midwife. Foreign names in Westminster undergo a gradual change in this way. This leads to much extra work on the part of the Health Visitors. During the year notification was received of 1,674 births which took place in Westminster; of these, 53 were stillborn children. By comparing all the births which were registered as having occurred after the 1st January with those notified, it is found that the proportion of births notified was 68.0 per cent. for the City. The percentages in the several registration areas were as follows:‚Äî 11 Registration District. Births Registered. Births Notified. Percentage. 1909. 1910. 1909. 1910. 1909. 1910.

Still births, which are not registrable, are also excluded from this calculation. The notifications were made by parents in 296 instances, 632 by doctors, 561 by midwives, 185 by other persons. In addition, information is received through the County Council of births coming to their knowledge in their work of supervising midwives, and from Medical Officers of Health of boroughs in which there is a maternity hospital; births occurring in such an institution would be registered in the borough in which it is situate. Notice of 276 births were so received. Further, the Health Society received 700 names of women expecting to become mothers from six hospitals and three maternity societies. Visiting of the families was carried out by Miss Horn, the Council's Health Visitor, assisted by a staff of voluntary workers. Suitable leaflets* were widely distributed, both by the visitors and the registrars. Miss Horn reports that these, and the advice given, appear to be much appreciated, and that the mothers display more intelligent interest in the care of their own health as well as that of their children. The method followed is to begin visiting in suitable cases about twelve days after the birth has occurred (if the mother has been visited beforehand, visiting is suspended during these twelve days). This course is advisable for several reasons; the patient is under the supervision of a medical man or midwife, and it is not desirable to disturb the mother with visits; when the nurse has left and the patient * The leaflets deal with (1) The care and management of infants and children; (2) Infant management (in English, Italian, and Yiddish); (3) Management of children over one year; (4) Hints to mothers; (5) Measles and whooping cough; (6) Summer diarrh≈ìa; (7) Care of the teeth; (8) Simple cookery. 12 is left to tend her child by herself she is more ready to accept the advice and instruction which the visitor may offer. Visiting is continued, if deemed necessary, throughout the year, once a month, or more frequently in the first three months, and afterwards quarterly. During the year 2,263 families in which births occurred in 1910 have been visited; 1,576 of these were notified; the balance of the notified births (98) were considered "above the standard" and were not visited; 678 of those eventually notified or registered were being visited before the confinement took place. In addition, visiting also took place of 1,032 children born in 1909 until they were a year old; thus 3,295 infants were being regularly visited during 1910. At the end of the year 1,567 names were carried forward for future visiting, and 536 families had moved away from Westminster. An analysis on the same lines as that printed in last year's report, but restricted to children born in 1909, who have been visited throughout 1909 and 1910 has been made. Infants who hare moved from the district, or who have not attained the age of twelve months, have been excluded from the analysis. Subjoined are tables relating to the City, which for this purpose is divided into a north and south portion. They deal with 1,262 children and are taken from the Report of the City of Westminster Health Society. Tables A and C show the influence of housing, poverty, the mother's work, health, and the mode of feeding, and the rate of infant mortality and ill-health. Tables B and D show the influence of the mother's work on her health, confinement, mode of feeding of the child, and care of home. 13 Table A.‚ÄîSouth (Westminster, Pimlico, Knightsbridge).

They show some variation in the proportions but they show the same effects produced by the various factors. 15 From the above tables it is seen that 74.7 per cent. of the 923 children in South Westminster were alive and in a healthy condition when twelve months old, 4.5 per cent. were in delicate health, and 20.8 per cent. failed to reach their first birthday, 4'5 per cent. of these were still-born. The superior health and low mortality of the breast-fed infants is very marked. The percentage of children entirely breast-fed for at least six months was 62.6 of the births, which is practically the same as last year, though lower than the figures for 1908 when 75 per cent. ware so fed. There is also a markedly lower mortality amongst the bottle-fed, due, no doubt, largely to the teaching in the homes which has been carried out systematically for some years past. The percentage of deaths again shows a definite relation to the poverty of the family. The proportion of infants who fail to reach their first birthday is much greater in the Southern part where the income of the families is considerably lower than in the Northern area.

Deaths. 2,164 deaths were registered in the City in the 52 weeks ending the 1st January, 1911. After deducting 1,023 deaths of non-citizens in public institutions in the City, and adding those of 750 citizens who died in other districts, the corrected total is 1,891, and is equivalent to an annual rate of 11.0 per 1,000 persons. The average death-rate for the years 1901-9 was 13.6. The London death-rate for 1910 was 12.75, the average for the previous five years being 145, and for England and Wales 13.4, the lowest rate on record (see Table VI), being 1.1 below the 1909 rate and 2.4 below the average rate of the previous ten years. Tables VI to XIII show the vital statistics of the City and five groups of districts from 1891 to 1910. The death-rates, according to the old districts of the City, are:‚Äî District. Average of Previous 10 Years. 1910.

Cause of death at all Ages.‚ÄîThese are set forth in Table VIII, and also their distribution in the various Wards of the City. Deaths were fewer from nearly all causes than in 1909, the exceptions being diseases of the digestive system, including diarrhoea, diseases of the heart and blood vessels ; suicides were also more numerous. Ages at Death.‚ÄîDeaths were fewer at every age period and in each ward except the Strand, which was increased by 6 by deaths of homeless per3ons admitted to Infirmaries through the casual wards. 18 Of the total deaths, 214 were those of children under 1 year of age, and 654 of persons over 65 years of age; these are referable to the various wards as follows:‚Äî 1910.

Infantile Mortality.‚ÄîThe uncorrected rate for the City was 102 deaths per 1,000 births registered in the City, as compared with 133, the average of the previous ten years. The corrected rate was 82, the average of the years 1901-9 being 112. On deducting the births and deaths of illegitimate children, it will be seen below that the infant death-rate has fallen regularly from 125 to 78 per 1,000. The London rate for 1910 was 103, the average for the five years 1905-09 being 120. The infantile death-rate in England and Wales was 106, being 3 below the rate in 1910 and 26 below the ten yearly averages. Table VII, required by the Local Government Board, shows in detail the ages and causes of death of children under 1 year of age. I have also set out in Table VII, A and 13, the figures in Victoria Ward and St. Margaret and St. John. The births and deaths apportioned to these divisions are shown below:‚Äî 19  Legitimate.

It also shows the age periods at which they died. The causes of death in each year are given, together with the relative proportion each group bears to the whole of the infant deaths. The ages at which reductions have taken place, and the causes of death in previous years, may be compared. The remarkable decrease in infantile mortality is due to a certain extent to the meteorological conditions which have obtained, but that this is only part of the explanation is shown by the fact that until recent years, when greater attention has been given to infant life, the mortality for 50 years previously maintained an average of 160 per 1,000 births.

In the adjoining County Council Buildings at Millbank the rate is 33.2. The death-rate compares favourably with that of the Ward, which was 16.5. The rate in the Millbank Buildings is 11.8 per 1,000. Measles.‚ÄîThere is, I think, no doubt that there is a greater incidence in block dwellings. Certain of the differences in the death-rates given below are due to the varying proportion of children under 5 years of age. I have therefore ascertained the relative proportions at this age-period in the various sets of dwellings, and compare them with London and Westminster. The proportions for the County and City, Peabody Buildings and the Improved Industrial Buildings are those given as the result of the last Census, and are probably higher than will be found at the Census this year, as the birth-rate has markedly decreased in the decade. Those for the City's dwellings in Regency Street and the London County Council buildings at Millbank and Drury Lane are the exact figures at the present moment (these buildings were erected subsequent to 1901). The figures for the former may therefore require some amendment. Measles, 1904‚Äî1910. Population. Death-rate. Total. Under 5 years. On total population. On number under 5 years. Per cent. Per 1,000.

Communicable Diseases. (1) Compulsorily Notifiable Diseases. The details respecting the 517 notifications of infectious disease received by me are set out in the Local Government Board's Return (Table XV), which also shows the number treated in hospital as well as the number of deaths. The number of cases of each disease notified in London since 1890 are shown in Table XIV, together with cases notified during the same period in the different divisions which, with some modifications, now form the City. These figures are exclusive of duplicate notifications. The charts indicate the number of notifications of scarlet fever, diphtheria, enteric fever, and erysipelas in each week. In London as a whole the number of cases of typhoid and puerperal fevers was above the number notified in the previous year, while scarlet fever, diphtheria and erysipelas were below. In Westminster typhoid fever cases were more numerous, but the cases of scarlet fever, diphtheria and erysipelas were much below the average. Doubtful cases, contacts, and certain patients returning from fever hospitals, &c., were visited. Smallpox.‚ÄîDuring the year seven cases of smallpox were notified in London, one of these being in Westminster. On Sunday evening, 19th June, a lady and her child, aged 6 months, arrived at Charing Cross Station, having travelled from Tientsin, in China (which they left on the 7th), by overland route vid Siberia to Ostend. The child became ill at Moscow, but was not seen by a medical man until arrival in London, when she was taken to Charing Cross Hospital, where the nature of the illness was at once recognised. Information was given to the authorities at Dover and Hastings, a friend from the latter place, having travelled from Dover to London with them. The Railway Company and the Steamship Company were communicated with, and steps were taken to have the saloon carriage on the train and the cabin on the steamer disinfected. The child's father was suffering from smallpox when she left China. The mother was removed to hospital along with the child, who was able to be discharged on the 2nd July. Intimation was received of 87 persons who had been in contact, or came from places where smallpox existed, and these were kept under observation. Vaccination‚Äî The Vaccination Officers have supplied me with the following particulars relating to vaccination of infants born in 1910:‚Äî 37 Vaccination Statistics. 1909. Union. Births.

Scarlet Fever.‚ÄîThe striking reduction in the number of cases in 1910 is shown in the subjoined statement of each quarter of the last three years:‚Äî Scarlet Fever. London. Westminster. 1908. 1909. 1910. 1908. 1909. 1910. 1st quarter 5,943 4,227 2,701 168 113 88 2nd ‚Äû 4,462 4,404 2,548 129 218 57 3rd ,, 5,616 4,680 2,580 87 144 54 4th ‚Äû 6,038 3,940 2,683 243 115 49 22.059 17,251 10,512 627 590 248 38 The rise and fall of the disease is shown week by week on the accompanying charts. The schools attended by affected children are shown later, but no school has been much affected. In the early part of the year several families, the children of whom have been attending St. Gabriel's Day or Sunday School, wore affected. Probably this arose from a mild undetected case. In one family a child was notified on the 10th' February, and it was then reported that two other children had sore throats, but the medical attendant did not feel justified in notifying them as scarlet fever until they began to peel. One case notified followed somewhat closely the return from the fever hospital of an elder sister. There were four deaths, giving a low mortality rate, as shown below. In the whole year, 84 of the 248 cases were in Victoria Ward, 57 in St. John's; 4 were fatal, 1 being in the former and 3 in the latter Ward. The death rate for London was 0'04 per 1,000, the fiveyearly average being 0.11. In 18 instances, 2 cases occurred during the year in the same house, and in 4 instances 3 cases. There were 4 cases in one police section house and 7 in a large business establishment. In 8 instances the disease was eventually found not to be scarlet fever.

In 5 instances 2 cases occurred in one house. Supply of Anti-toxin.‚ÄîThe Local Government Board, in a letter dated the 15th August, 1910, stated that they have had under consideration the question of facilitating the prompt use of diphtheria anti-toxin in the case of persons who may be attacked by diphtheria or exposed to the infection of the disease, and with that object they have made an Order under Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sanctioning the provision by Councils of metropolitan boroughs of a temporary supply of diphtheria anti-toxin and of medical attendance in connection therewith. The Board pointed out that the arrangements with respect to the keeping, distribution and use of the diphtheria anti-toxin are to be made in accordance with the advice of the Medical Officer of Health, 40 and, having regard to the importance of the matter, the Board suggested that at an early date the Council should consider with the Medical Officer of Health what arrangements should be made for the provision of anti-toxin and for its use both as a prophylactic and a curative agency. They stated that in cases in which a patient is under the care of a medical practitioner the latter should, in ordinary circumstances, be the person to administer the anti-toxin. The Board suggested that the Council in considering the matter should take into special account the possible requirements of the Poor Law Medical Officers, as it appeared to the Board to be desirable where the Council avail themselves of the powers now given them, that the Poor Law Medical Officers should be able to obtain from the store of the Council the anti-toxin which they may require from time to time for use in connection with patients under their care. It was also suggested that to prevent misapprehension it should be observed that the free provision of diphtheria anti-toxin which is authorised by the Order must not be regarded as a substitute for removal to hospital of a patient suffering from diphtheria, nor as implying that the patient to whom the anti-toxin has been administered may properly be retained for treatment at home, unless means are available for his efficient isolation to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. The Board added that the prompt administration of anti-toxin before the patient is removed to hospital may, especially if delay in removal is inevitable, go far towards preventing the attack of diphtheria from being fatal; that by Article II of the Order the duties of the Medical Officer of Health are to be deemed to extend to and include all action by the Medical Officer of Health in the execution of the Order, and Article III provides for the payment by the Council to the Medical Officer of Health of reasonable compensation for such action taken by him; that the arrangements which the Council may make for the supply of diphtheria anti-toxin should be brought to the knowledge of all medical practitioners practising within their jurisdiction; and that in any circular letter which the Council send out to medical practitioners it is desirable that emphasis should be laid on the importance of prompt treatment by anti-toxin and of the saving of life which may thereby be effected. The Council resolved to avail themselves of the powers given, and the following letter was sent to medical men practising in Westminster:‚Äî- "Provision of Diphtheria Anti-Toxin. "The Local Government Board having made an Order sanctioning the provision of a temporary supply of diphtheria anti-toxin, for use in 41 cases of the disease, the City Council have made arrangements whereby a supply of anti-toxin may be available for the use of medical practitioners, in cases in which the patients (resident in Westminster) are themselves unable to pay, and I enclose particulars of these arrangements. "In this connection I may remind you that if the best results are to be obtained, anti-toxin must be administered within the first forty-eight hours. Dr. Goodall, Medical Superintendent ol Homerton Fever Hospital, in a paper read recently before the Medical Officers of Health Society, stated that he had never seen paralysis ensue if anti-toxin had been given within that period; that the earlier anti-toxin is given, the smaller is the dose required. He advised that in suspected cases, where the probability is strong, anti-toxin should be given, especially where the patient is under ten years of age. In cases in which the patient is being removed promptly to hospital, Dr. Goodall does not consider it of much advantage to administer a dose of anti-toxin before removal, but it should be used if delay in removal to hospital is inevitable. Dr. Goodall further pointed out that the use of anti-toxin is contraindicated in patients suffering from asthma or allied disorders, or if more than a week had elapsed since the previous dose was administered, as dangerous and even fatal results had followed its use under such circumstances. "The Local Government Board wish it to be understood that the free provision of diphtheria anti-toxin must not be regarded as a substitute for the removal to hospital of a patient suffering from diphtheria, or as implying that the patient to whom anti-toxin has been administered may properly be retained for treatment at home unless means are available for his efficient isolation to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. "The Westminster City Council have made arrangements that medical practitioners practising in Westminster can obtain a supply of diphtheria anti-toxin (4,000 units) for poor patients resident in Westminster, at the following places and times :‚Äî "(1) Messrs. Parke, Davis & Co., Beak Street, Kegent Street, W. (Telephone Nos. 8636 Gerrard and 9201 Central; Telegraphic Address‚Äî "Cascara,"London). Monday to Friday inclusive‚Äî9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturdays‚Äî9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays and Bank Holidays ‚Äî11 a.m. to 12 noon and 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. "(2) Messrs. Heppell & Co. Chemists, of 35, Hayniarket and 78, Strand. At any hour of the day and night, except on Sunday night between midnight and 8 a.m. on Monday. 42 "(3) The Caretaker, Coroner's Court, Horseferry Road, S.W., at any hour. "When a supply has been obtained a receipt must be given by the medical practitioner in order that it may be forwarded to the City Council, who will otherwise not hold themselves responsible for payment." Bacteriological Examination.‚ÄîAdvantage was taken by medical men of the means provided by the City Council to have the diagnosis of their cases assisted by bacteriological examination of swabbings from the nose or throat in 184 instances. In 13 instances I had a bacteriological examination made of the throats of the members of families in which a case had occurred, or when children were excluded from school in consequence, and no medical man was in attendance; the bacillus was present in one of them. In one instance examination was made on account of other cases occurring subsequent to the first patient's return from hospital‚Äîit proved negative. Typhoid Fever.‚ÄîThe number of cases notified, both in London and Westminster, show an increase over 1909. Of the 48 persons notified in the City, 1 was eventually declared not to be so suffering. This disease was proportionately most prevalent in Holborn, Finsbury, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Stepney, Poplar, and Bermondsey. According to a report issued by Dr. Hamer to the County Council, it is possible that some of the attacks may be due to the consumption of small plaice or dabs. These small fish frequent the more shallow waters, which are those which would be more liable to pollution. The Local Government Board has also issued a report by Dr. Ledingham, dealing with the subject of the enteric fever carrier. The carrier is a person, usually a woman, who, although in good health, carries the infectious material in the body and excretes the bacillus typhosus in f√¶ces or urine. The excretion of the bacillus may continue, persistently or at intervals, during many months or years. The carrier state is not necessarily the result of a previous attack of enteric fever, or at least of any illness which can be traced or is known to the carrier. Fnteric fever patients, however, may continue after convalescence to excrete the bacillus, sometimes for a period less than three months ("temporary carrier") and sometimes for much longer periods ("chronic carriers"), and it is naturally among persons who have been attacked by enteric fever that most carriers have been detected. The average carrier does not appear to be a serious danger, but some have been proved capable of causing outbreaks wherever they go. Surveillance seems necessary in the case of carriers of proved infective ability, especially where food preparation is concerned. 43 Notifications of Infectious Diseases in each week of the year 1910. The County of London. The City of Westminster. 44 In London the increase in the number of cases occurred in the third and fourth quarters of the year; in Westminster it was in the second and third quarters:‚Äî Typhoid Fever. London. Westminster. 1909. 1910. 1909. 1910. 1 st Quarter 354 242 9 10 2nd 197 166 1 19 3rd 239 415 6 14 4th 253 460 9 5 The Year 1,043 1,283 25 43 Of the 47 eases, 17 of the patients contracted the disease out of London; of the remaining 30 no definite history was obtainable in 14 instances, 3 contracted the disease by attending persons suffering from the complaint, and 13 had a definite history of having eaten shell fish or fresh fish (from stalls or from fried fish shops). As pointed out in previous reports, a number of the cases are of persons connected with food in some way, such as hotel and restaurant employes. Seven of the cases proved fatal. Five cases occurred in one family, the patients being the mother and four daughters, the father, son and baby escaping. It has not been possible, so far, to discover how they became infected. Suspicion at first fell on winkles which had been eaten by all the family, except the baby, on the 3rd April; the officials of the Fishmongers' Company made very careful enquiries with regard to the source from which they were obtained and the processes to which they are subjected before they reach the consumer. It appears that winkles arrive at Billingsgate from several sources and on arrival are mixed. They are sold to retailers, in this instance for his Sunday trade only. The winkles are placed in brine by the retailer for 16 hours, and are then washed in fresh water to remove grit and dirt. They are then cooked, about three-quarters of a bushel at a time being plunged in a wire basket into boiling water. The water in the first instance is brought up to the boil, on the winkles being plunged in, the water is necessarily cooled, but the water is again allowed to come up to the boiling point, and the winkles are kept in it at boiling point for 2¬Ω to 3¬Ω minutes, being kept in the water therefore for about 5 minutes in all. After this operation the winkles are again placed in brine for about half an hour. If this operation be done thoroughly the winkles ought to be freed from any deleterious organism should such have been present. Advantage was taken to obtain the City Bacteriologist's opinion in 18 cases, in 5 the Widal reaction was reported. 45 Puerperal Fever.‚ÄîSix notifications were received, and three deaths occurred. Disinfection was carried out after each case, including the clothing, &c., of those in attendance. All the patients were treated in hospital or infirmary. The illness was due to want of proper attention at birth in one case; one to abortion; two to pre-existing disease; no definite history was obtainable in two cases. The Asylums Board have decided to make arrangements for the reception of certified cases of puerperal fever in their hospitals, having been advised that such cases can be safely admitted to the same hospital with other infectious diseases, and are in some hospitals treated in the same wards as cases of enteric fever. Cholera.‚ÄîThis disease continued prevalent in Russia during last year. I received notification from the Port Sanitary Authorities of 121 persons coming to Westminster from affected districts, and these were kept under observation. Plague.‚ÄîThe recent occurrence of cases of this disease in Suffolk is cause for some apprehension, but not necessarily for alarm. It is now generally admitted that rats play an important part in the dissemination of this disease, and infected rats have been found not only in Suffolk, but also in Essex, while there is always the danger of infected rats entering the docks from vessels coming from localities where the disease is prevalent. The London Port Sanitary Authority takes active steps to prevent this, and the Local Government Board have made regulations whereby local authorities may deal with the destruction of rats in their district, but the co-operation of the householder is also necessary. Steps must be taken to keep rats from gaining access to dwellings and stores. In London the usual route by which they do so is through defects in the sewers and house drains; it is therefore incumbent upon owners of property who are troubled with rats to take steps to have all drains thoroughly examined with a view to their being made sound. If rats are kept out of houses and stores, and exterminated in waste places, &c. there need not be much fear that there will be any great outbreak such as occurred 245 years ago. Once the disease attacks human beings there is danger, especially in the pneumonic form, that infection may be given off by the breath of the patient, but isolation and disinfection will doubtless act as sufficient checks, if undertaken promptly. At present it should be the aim to prevent infection spreading to human beings from lower animals, especially rats. Circulars prepared by the Board of Agriculture on the destruction of rats have been circulated in the city. D 46 Table XIV.‚ÄîInfectious Diseases Notified, 1890-1910, in London. Year. Smallpox.

Compulsory Notification of Poor Law Cases.‚ÄîPoor Law District Medical Officers and Medical Officers of Poor Law Institutions are lequired, under an Order which came into force on the 1st January, 1909, to send a notification to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which a consumptive patient is (or was before admission to an institution) resident, within 48 hours after recognition of the symptoms. The Superintending Officer of an institution is required to send a notification of the actual or intended place of destination and address at that place of any consumptive person leaving such institution, and Eelieving Officers are required to notify changes of address of patients other than to an institution. Voluntary Notification.‚ÄîIn addition to the above requirement the Council has had in force since the beginning of 1903 a system of voluntary notification. In 1908, 148 persons were notified, 69 of these being inmates of Poor Law infirmaries. In 1909, 438 persons were notified under the combined systems, 30 having been previously known; of these, 159 persons were voluntarily notified, and 281 under the Order (two of the latter having been notified voluntarily in the first instance). Of the compulsory group, 136 were persons from common lodging-houses, casual wards, &c., so that 302 was the net number of consumptive persons notified as having regular residence in the City. In 1910, 275 persons not previously notified were certified to be suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, of these 135 were voluntarily notified and 140 under the Order. Of the latter 90 were persons from common lodging-houses, casual wards, &c. 186 deaths from consumption were registered of persons who had resided in Westminster, inclusive of casuals, &c.; 71 of these had been notified during life; 45 more should have been notified under the Order, as the deaths occurred in Poor Law institutions, but the majority of these had no definite address other than the casual ward ; these are to be notified in future. There remain therefore 70 deaths of residents who had not been known to the Public Health Department during their illness. Details are shown on the next page. Visits to the families subsequently have led to the discovery of other persons suffering. 50 Notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Under Poor Law Order:‚Äî Year. Number of Certificates Received.

It is almost impossible to find them at the addresses they give as their proposed destination, as such addresses are usually false; many of them, however, decline to give any address. I think the Superintendents of Poor Law Institutions should be required to notify the discharge in all cases whether an address is given or not. Through the courtesy of the Medical Officers, I have ascertained that at the end of the year, 127 persons suffering from consumption were inmates of the Poor Law Institutions connected with the City. During 1909 there was considerable delay in sending in accounts; but this has been got over by sending a card of reminder at the end of each quarter. Arrangements have been made with the Health Society, who have appointed a special visitor for the purpose, to keep in close touch with persons notified voluntarily or compulsorily who are living at home. At the end of 1910,251 persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis were under supervision, 126 suspected or doubtful cases, and 29 persons suffering from other forms, making a total of 406 persons, of whom 143 are in the North part of the City, and 263 in the South, In previous reports I have given particulars of a scheme which was being framed to carry out the essential objects and methods of the system which has been devised and gradually built up in Edinburgh by Dr. Philip. This scheme demands:‚Äî (1) A special department of public health activity devoted to the handling of tuberculosis in all its manifestations. (2) A sanatorium for selected patients‚Äî(a) for education; (b) for prolonged treatment. (3) A hospital or asylum for advanced cases. (4) Means by which suitable employment can be found for patients in whom the disease is arrested. In Edinburgh most of these objects have been attained:‚Äî A special centre has been formed and has become the uniting point of all the other agencies, besides being the office in which all information and records are kept, and where enquiries are attended to on all matters connected with Phthisis; it includes a Dispensary where patients can be examined and treated by the staff of physicians, and instructions given how to prevent or minimise the risk of infection to others. Medicines, disinfectants, and sputum bottles are supplied, and where the patient's condition warrants it food-stuffs and the like are given. Patients are subsequently visited at their own homes, by one of the 52 Assistant Physicians and a specially trained nurse, for the double purpose of treatment and investigation into the state of the dwelling, the general conditions of life, the risk of infection to others, and opportunity is taken to see the other members of the family with the view of detecting cases in the early stages, and of suggesting measures whereby any members of the family who seem predisposed to the disease may be protected and their health strengthened, so as to be able the better to resist it. Records of all these matters are prepared by the Special Visitor under the superintendence of one of the Medical Officers. There had been some difference of opinion as to whether a Special Phthisis Dispensary, with a Eesident Medical Officer and Resident Nurses, should be provided in Westminster, such as is now established in Paddington mainly by the munificence of a private donor, or whether, in view of the number of Hospitals and Dispensaries already existing in Westminster, it would be better to endeavour to secure a more complete co-operation between the City Council, the Health Society, the various Hospitals and Dispensaries, and private medical practitioners dealing with cases of Tuberculosis. In October, 1909, at the suggestion of the Health Society, a conference of representatives of Hospitals and other Charitable Institutions in Westminster was held at the City Hall, at which the matter was fully discussed. Eventually, in view of the heavy cost of establishing and maintaining a Special Dispensary, the Society resolved to try the method of co-operation between existing agencies. This scheme has now been placed on a good working basis. A special Tuberculosis Committee of the Society has been appointed, on which the City Council and the Boards of Guardians are represented. A Visitor (Miss Sanders), who thoroughly understands the system, has been appointed. She compiles the records in a methodical manner on the card system, and has prepared useful indices whereby important facts and details are available, such as the frequency of disease in various houses and streets; its association with varying insanitary conditions of dwellings; the frequency with which one or more persons share a room, or even a bed, with a consumptive patient; the varying amount of fresh air admitted into the dwelling by day and by night; the frequency with which the consumptive patient changes his house, thus multiplying the infection again and again; the frequency with which a previous family or house infection can be traced; and the effect of the disease in producing physical and financial distress in a more or less wide family circle. The information thus filed is confidential, and is used solely for the information of the Medical Officer of Health, Hospitals, Medical Men and Health-workers who require special knowledge re environment and health of particular families who are under their charge. 53 Visiting of patients at their homes is carried out by the Phthisis Visitor, who gives instructions as to measures of personal hygiene, and precautions against infection, &c., and the Hon. Secretary arranges where required for better food, Sanatorium treatment, clothing, &c., through the various Charitable Societies. Arrangements have been made whereby the Physicians at the following Hospitals will examine suspected and contact cases, viz.: Brompton, Mount Vernon, Margaret Street Consumption Hospitals, Golden Square Throat Hospital, Charing Cross, St. George's, and Westminster General Hospitals, besides treating actual cases. The members of the local profession are taking advantage of the scheme, which has received the approval of the Local Division of the British Medical Association. In cases in which the family is not under the care of any medical man, arrangements have been made with Dr. P. W. Spaull that he should visit the houses and see the other members of the family. The Health Office at St. George's Baths has become just such a centre as Dr. Philip suggests. The clerical work entailed is considerable, as reports on the homes, &c., visited are supplied to the physicians in charge of cases, and there is much correspondence between the various agencies whose help may be desired. An advantage which the Westminster Scheme possesses is that it is in close touch with the other schemes of the Society‚Äîby this means the Phthisis Visitor can at once have access to a great deal of information already acquired. Her attention can also be called to persons who may appear to require special attention from a phthisis point of view, by those visiting families in connection with the rearing of children, school work, &c. Educational training by a short stay in a sanatorium is provided by the City Council. Prolonged sanatorium treatment for patients resident or employed in the parishes of St. Anne and St. Mary, Soho, through the St. Henry Trust; for Jewish cases, through the Jewish Board of Guardians; for children, through the Invalid Children's Aid Association and the Metropolitan Asylums Board; for some others, through the Charity Organisation Society; and the various general and special hospitals through their Almoners; and by the Poor Law Guardians of two Unions at their special infirmary at Hendon. Disinfection of rooms, bedding, clothing, &c., after death, on change of address or while patients are temporarily away, is provided by the City Council. Provision is also made for the use of poor persons certified under the Tuberculosis Regulations, on loan or otherwise, of any appliance, apparatus, or utensil (such as special flasks for spitting into) which will be of assistance for the purpose of any precaution against the spread of nfection, by the City Council, and for others through the Health Society 54 Provision is also made by the Council whereby bacteriological examination of sputum, &c., may be obtained by medical practitioners. During the eighteen months ending 31st December, 1910, 767 cases of tuberculosis, or of persons suspected to be suffering, have been visited by the Society, 148 of these having been brought forward from the previous period. These have been analysed as follows:‚Äî Definite pulmonary tuberculosis (Thirty-three of these cases had been " suspects.") 564 Removals 107 Deaths of cases already known to Society 74 Families visited where deaths occurred of cases not previously notified 132 Current cases still under eupervision 251 Suspected pulmonary tuberculosis 143 Removals 14 Deaths of cases already known to Society 3 Current cases still under supervision 126 Other forms of tuberculosis 60 Removals 2 Deaths of cases already known to Society 4 Families visited where death occurred of cases not previously notified 25 Current cases still under supervision 29 Sanatorium or Convalescent Home Treatment (including Boarding out of suitable cases) were arranged for by the following agencies:‚Äî Charity Organisation Society 11 Jewish Board of Guardians 20 Invalid Children's Aid Association 30 Clergy, private individuals, &c. 99 St. Henry Trust 39 Through the Guardians; in Poor Law Infirmaries 113 City Council 26 Seventy-six patients had had institutional or convalescent treatment previous to the period now under review. Twenty-six patients have been sent away by the City Council for educational training, 25 to Maitland Sanatorium and one to the Eoyal National Sanatorium, Bournemouth. 16 of these were men, 10 women, J 3 were married. Their occupations were :‚Äî Ages.

It was clearlyexplained to the patients before they were sent that an opportunity was being afforded them to learn how to live at home with safety to themselves, their relations, and those with whom they worked. Most of them derived marked benefit from their stay at the Sanatorium‚Äî 13 returned to work, and have been able to continue at it. 2 are at home looking for light work. 2 are in the country, not able to work, trying to continue the line of treatment they have been taught. 1 obtained a situation on board ship. 4 are at home, unable to work. 2 have since died; and 2 were still at the Sanatorium at the end of the year. Bacteriological Examination of Sputum.‚ÄîSixty-five examinations were made of sputum, from 63 patients, to ascertain if the tubercle bacillus was present. It was found in 15 instances, and was doubtful in one. Disinfection.‚ÄîTwo hundred and fifty-three rooms in 200 houses and 2,450 articles were disinfected by the Council's staff, articles were destroyed, and general cleansing of the premises was carried out after each death, or on removal from one house to another, entailing 385 visits, Deaths.‚ÄîThe deaths for the last ten years are set fortli in the following table The City op Westsiinsteb.

For purposes of comparison with the whole of London, differences in the number of males and females, and their relative ages, have to be 56 taken into account. This may be effected by multiplying the rates by a factor (0.89205). The figures are then:‚Äî Year. Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Total Tubercular Bates. County. City. County. City. 1901 165 167 229 202 1902 161 159 223 199 1903 155 154 213 178 1904 163 136 217 171 1905 140 131 191 168 1906 144 121 196 158 1907 140 119 187 148 1908 .. 132 105 179 137 1909 .. 131 116 174 141 1910 .. 114 96 ‚Äî 120 I have worked out a table showing the number of deaths from tuberculosis which have taken place in the City within the last ten years, and I have divided this period into two groups of five years each. In the first five years, deaths from Pulmonary Consumption numbered 1,509, in the second period 1,088, thus showing a striking reduction. When deaths in common lodging houses are deducted, the reduction is from 1,355 to 932, or 31 per cent. It will be noted that common lodging-house deaths among men have increased in the second group. Deducting these deaths, the reduction in the number of deaths is 26.6 per cent. for males, 39.9 per cent. for females. The total number of deaths of males is just double that of females in the last 5 years; in the previous 5 years the proportion was about 5 to 3. In deaths from other forms of tuberculosis there is a reduction of 15.2 per cent. among males, and of 20.0 among females. It is encouraging to note that the number of young children who have died from pulmonary or other form of tuberculosis has considerably decreased. There has been some reduction in the deaths from other tubercular disease in London during the same period, and it will be interesting to see if the reduction is at the same age periods as in Westminster, and if so to what extent. It is to be expected that the greater freedom of milk from the tubercle bacillus during the last few years (since 1907), would have such a result, but the increased care which many patients are taking to prevent infection must also play an important part. 57 Table XVII.‚ÄîTuberculosis.

Diarrh≈ìal Diseases.‚ÄîIn London, deaths from the epidemic or acute form of this disease were half the corrected average, giving a rate of 0.28 per 1,000. In Westminster the number of deaths was less than any previous year. Meteorological conditions again played an important part in keeping down the rate during the autumn months. The figures for several years are shown below. Deaths from other forms of enteritis numbered 32, which is above the average; 21 were of infants. Probably this form was due to cold, improper feeding, defective powers of digestion, and in some instances this condition may have resulted from a previous attack of the epidemic form. The following table exhibits the particulars:‚Äî Westminster. 1903. 1901. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910.

Measles.‚ÄîTwenty-two deaths were attributed to this cause in 1910 in the City. During the year 567 cases came to my knowledge, 555 having been notified by school teachers (particulars as to schools affected are given later). The deaths per 1,000 calculated on the total population were:‚Äî 1903. 3904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910.

As 22 of the deaths in Westminster, and the bulk of those in London, occurred in children under five years of age, it affords a better 59 comparison to calculate the deaths on the number of children estimated to be living under five years of age:‚Äî 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910.

Disinfection of 84 rooms in 36 houses, and of 1991 articles, was carried out by the Council's staff. Visits were paid by the women inspectors in cases notified from schools : advise is given verbally and printed instructions are left at the house. Wherever necessary, the Inspectors visit throughout the illness, see that medical attendance is obtained, and that proper attention is given to the cleanliness of the rooms, bedding, &c. It may, I think, be claimed that the low mortality in Westminster is the result of this attention. Whooping-cough.‚ÄîThis complaint was responsible for 19 deaths, all of them of children under five years of age; 163 cases were notified to me (for particulars as to schools affected see list below). Disinfection of 8 rooms was carried out. In London, the fatal cases were slightly less than the corrected average number. Particulars relative to this disease for the years 1903-10 are:‚Äî 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910.

The matter under consideration was whether the large margin of unoccupied beds which frequently exists in the fever and small-pox hospitals could be beneficially used for providing for additional classes of patients, and for meeting the growing demands on other departments, such as those for children and imbeciles. It was decided to arrange for the reception, tentatively, of measles and other approved diseases in their fever hospitals, provided the Local Government Board can empower them to admit selected cases from the poorer classes for which no accommodation is now available. This last part of the recommendation was due to the report of Dr. Cuff, the Medical Officer for General Purposes, who states that there is adequate accommodation in the Metropolitan Workhouse Infirmaries for pau-per cases of measles; what is wanted is accommodation for cases from the poorer classes, not necessarily paupers. As to the feasibility of treating measles and whooping-cough in the same hospital with other infectious fevers, Dr. Cuff states that in his opinion this can be done without any risk of interchange of infection between the different wards. He reports : " The danger to diphtheria patients is at least as great now from scarlet fever as it would be from measles or whooping-cough. Such, at any rate, is the experience of those fever hospitals in the provinces and in Scotland which admit all these diseases. Dr. Ker, of the City Hospital, Edinburgh, where over 1,000 cases of Measles were treated last year, writes : ' Measles is never carried by the staff' Dr. Bundle, of the City Hospital, Liverpool, says: 'We have had under treatment here probably a thousand cases of measles, and I have never known the disease to be carried to other wards. I am convinced that measles is almost entirely a personal infection, and that the third factor does not exist.' With whooping-cough there is no risk at all." The balance of evidence is that the hospital treatment of measles and whooping-cough resulted in a saving of life among the poor. The arrangement which has been come to is that suitable cases are sent to the Board's Hospitals through the Believing Officer. Schools and Infectious Disease. School teachers are required to notify the Medical Officer of Health when they exclude children on account of infectious disease. The following list shows how far this was carried out and the nature of the cases notified:‚Äî 61 Actual Cases. Infection in House. School. Chickenpox. Measles. Mumps. Whoopingcough. Chickenpox.

Between 500 and 600 children, varying from one and five years of age, suffering from rickets, marasmus, chorea, eye affections and debility, etc., were referred by the Health Visitors for special treatment to Hospitals and Dispensaries. The fact that so many were found to require special treatment shows the real need of continuing to watch over them. By means of continuation sheets attached to the infant cards a complete record of the life-history of each child will be available. As the significance of this step becomes more widely appreciated a more intimate and mutually advantageous association between the Health Society and the Education Authority may be established. 370 school children (over 5 years of age) were visited for the Care Committees and Hospital Almoners, the same Visitor being the Health Visitor and the Care Committee Visitor in most cases. Reports were 63 sent to the Care Committee Secretaries. The system of comparing the School Medical lists with the Health index before further action was taken by the Care Committee Visitor has been proved to be a good one. Overlapping of Visitors is prevented and the visit for the baby and the school child has been successfully combined. Bacteriological Laboratory. During the year 270 examinations have been made by Dr. J. M. Bernstein, at the Westminster Hospital Medical School, at a cost of ¬£36 4s. 9d., with the subjoined results. The number of examinations in previous years were: 1902, 251; 1903, 181; 1904, 75; 1905, 132; 1906, 180; 1907, 155; 1908, 175; 1909, 245. Disease. Persons. Examinations. Results. Positive. Negative.

In addition to those mentioned above, many medical men and hospitals obtain reports on their cases from private or hospital laboratories. Disinfection. New Disinfecting Station and Staff Dwellings.‚ÄîWhen the City was incorporated, four of the constituent authorities possessed disinfecting stations, while one did the work through a contractor. Considerable inconvenience was experienced in carrying on the work of disinfecting under such circumstances, and the Council in their first year of office had under consideration the erection of a central station. As the bulk of the work was found to come from the southern part of the City, it was evident that a site should be selected there. Several schemes have been considered in connection with the various properties belonging to the City, but none of them were deemed satisfactory. In 1904 the County Council acquired the Deuzell Street e 2 64 VERMINOUS PEPSONS' ENTRANCE. CITY OF WESTMINSTER DISINFECTING STATION ground . FLOOR. PLAN 65 CITY OF WESTMINSTER.. DWELLINGS FOR STAEF 66 Disinfecting Station, Mortuary, and Dep√¥t belonging to the late Strand Board of Works, in connection with the Holboru to Strand Improvement, paying a sum of ¬£5,000 and handing over a piece of land in Kean Street in exchange for that taken by them. It was, however, decided that it would be more advantageous, both from an administrative and a financial point of view, not to erect the disinfecting station here, and, consequently, this site has been let. In this way the cost of the new building is met without any additional charge upon the rates. Eventually, on the acquisition of the Grosvenor Canal property, the land on the west side of the lock was selected. The site is in an open position, well away from dwellings, and is approached both from the Chelsea Embankment and Gatliff Eoad. Mr. John Murray, F.R.I.B.A., was instructed to prepare drawings and specifications for the erection of two blocks of buildings, one containing the Disinfecting Station, the other residences for the lockmaster, some of the disinfecting staff, and other employees, and an office for the Highways Department. Tenders for the erection of the buildings were invited from fifteen firms of builders, and the lowest, that of Mr. C. F. Ivearley, of 4, Great Marlborough Street, amounting to ¬£9,921, was accepted. The offer of Messrs. Goddard, Massey and Warner, was accepted for the erection of the necessary fittings in the disinfecting chamber, boilers and other apparatus in the possession of the Council being utilised as far as possible. The amount of the tender, the lowest of four, was ¬£506 14s. 8d. The Disinfecting Station.-Externally the plinth of the building is faced with red pressed bricks, the upper part with Crowborough and red brick facings, red gauged arches and Portland stone dressings. The interior is faced to a height of four feet with white glazed bricks, the walls above of all the rooms, and the ceilings of the Infected and Disinfected Chambers, being lined with white tiles. The following accommodation is provided in the building:‚Äî An "Infected" Van Shed, for unloading infected articles. An "Infected Chamber," 36 ft. by 20 ft., for the reception of infected articles which will be placed directly into the disinfecting apparatus. A "Disinfected Chamber, 36 ft. by 20 ft., into which the goods which have been disinfected are discharged from the disinfecting apparatus, A Loading Store and "Disinfected" Van Shed, from which the disinfected articles are despatched. A Formalin Chamber, accessible from the "Infected" and "Disinfected " Chambers, 12 ft. by 6 ft. 3 ins., for the disinfecting of furniture 67 and such articles as cannot be submitted to the action of steam; it is provided with a Ligner's apparatus for the generation of formaldehyde gas. A Drying Boom, 23 ft. 6 ins. by 16 ft. 6 ins., containing drying horses and a mangle. A Bottle Washing Boom, fitted with sinks, washing machine and special shelving. Separate Bath Boom, Lavatory and Mess Boom accommodation is provided for the Staff. Store Rooms in Basement. A special and separate department is provided for the reception and cleansing of verminous persons. The verminous clothing is placed in air-tight receptacles between the two Bath Booms and the "Infected" Chamber, and from thence placed in the Disinfectors and returned from the "Disinfected" side to the Bath Booms, the departments being connected by a basement passage. Apparatus and Machinery.‚ÄîThe Steam Disinfecting Apparatus is that know as the "Alliot and Baton," made by Manlove, Alliot and Co. Two are provided, both having been removed from the Council's other stations. The apparatus has an oval chamber, 7 ft. long, 6 ft. high, and 3 ft. 7 ins. wide internally, with double walls forming a jacket round, and steel framed doors at each end. The object of the jacket is to heat the contents of the disinfecting cylinder before the steam is turned in to prevent condensation and to assist in drying the contents after the steam has been withdrawn. Articles to be disinfected pre placed inside the apparatus, and the air is extracted. This is to facilitate the penetration of the steam which is subsequently admitted under a pressure of 20 lbs. and at a temperature of 259¬∞ Fahr. After the articles have been subjected to this for a sufficient period, the steam is allowed to escape and a second vacuum obtained, this being broken in its turn by hot pure air. Articles which are partially or wholly made with leather or furs, silks, letters, &c., cannot be subjected to steam without damage. These may be treated in the same machine either with dry heat alone or with formaldehyde gas. A special appliance is provided for the introduction of this gas, which may also be used in conjunction with steam. To each apparatus is attached a Recording Fressure Gauge, fitted with a chart on which a diagram of every operation is automatically registered. These charts are preserved, and afford a means of ascertaining the treatment to which the articles have been subjected. Articles of clothing, bed liuen, or which have been soiled with discharges, require to be soaked in cold water and washed before exposure to steam, which would fix any stain. A washing machine has 68 therefore been added. In many cases treatment therein will he sufficient disinfection, and on removal the washed articles will he placed in a hydro-extractor and afterwards in a drying closet. For furniture and large articles a special room has been provided in which formaldehyde, sulphurous acid gas or other disinfectant may be applied. The Incinerator Furnace is new, and was provided by Messrs. Goddard, Massey and Co. It is for the destruction of mattresses, clothing, &c., which are worn out or too filthy to clean. It is constructed of steel plates covering side and top, the interior being built up of fire brick lining. It consists of a fire-grate, ash pit, baffle wall and flue. The smoke and fumes from articles burnt are destroyed by being passed through the fire-grate. Power for driving the various machinery and plant is obtained by means of a Horizontal Steam Engine, driving by belt on to a main shaft extending the length of the building. Any machine may be started or stopped independently. Dwellings for Staff and Highways Office.‚ÄîThe materials used externally are similar to those in the Disinfecting Station. The Mansard roof is covered with green slates, and the elevations are of a Georgian character. The block contains an office for the Highways Department, and seven dwellings with a central area, four of the dwellings being for Disinfectors, two for Highways employees, and one for the Lockmaster. There are four separate entrances: the West one for the Disinfectors gives access to four flats, two being on the ground floor and two on the first floor over, connected by an artificial stone staircase, from the landings of which the four flats are entered. Each flat contains Living Koom, 13 ft. by 12 ft., fitted with range and gas stove ; Scullery, 9 ft. 6 ins. by 7 ft. 9 ins., with sink and coal box, and the Larder adjoins; three Bed Rooms, the sizes of which are 16 ft. by 11 ft., 12 ft. by 10 ft. 6 ins., 12 ft. by 9 ft.; Bath Room and W.C. On the flat asphalted roof over there are two common Washhouses, each fitted with a copper. The entrance at the opposite or East side, facing the Lock, gives access to the Lockmaster's dwelling, containing on the ground floor, Sitting Room, 20 ft. by 11 ft. 6 ins.; Kitchen, 12 ft. 6 ins. by 10 ft. 6 ins. fitted with range and gas stove; Scullery, 7 ft. 3 ins. by 6 ft. 9 ins., with copper and sink; Coal Cellar and Larder. An artificial stone staircase leads to the first floor, which contains four Bed Rooms, two being 20 ft. 3 ins. by 12 ft., one 16 ft. 3 ins. by 11 ft. 6 ins., and one 12 ft. 6 ins. by 11 ft. 6 ins.; Bath Room and W.C. 69 The entrance on the North side gives access to another artificial stone staircase, which leads up to two flats situated on the second floor over the Lockmaster's rooms, each containing Living Room, 16 ft. by 11 ft. 3 ins., fitted with range and gas stove; Scullery, 6 ft. 9 ins. by 10 ft. 9 ins., with sink and coal box; three Bed Rooms, 14 ft. 9 ins. by 12 ft., 13 ft. by 12 ft., and 12 ft. by 6 ft. 9 ins.; Bath Room and W.C. The entrance on the Soutli side give access to the Highways Office, 12 ft. by 10 ft. 6 ins., and Committee Room, 20 ft. by 11 ft. 6 ins., with Lavatory and Coal Cellar adjoining. The central area is divided into four parts with a coal box in each. The floors throughout are steel and concrete, the Sculleries, Bath Rooms, W.C.'s and Corridors being finished with cement, and the floors of all other rooms are covered with deal boarding, bedded solidly in pitch and tar on the concrete. The walls internally are plastered; there are cement dadoes in the Passages and Living Rooms, and all the walls are finished in duresco. Hot water is laid on from the range to the bath and sink in each dwelling; gas is laid on throughout, and slot meters are provided. The dwellings are in telephonic connection with the City Hall, and there is an extension from the Foreman Disinfector's Room to the Disinfecting Station. A better approach from the Chelsea Embankment has been constructed under the supervision of the City Engineer. The new buildings were opened by the Mayoress on the 6th July, 1910, and the disinfecting work carried on at Horseferry Road and Commercial Road stations was shortly afterwards transferred to the new station. From the experience already gained, I am satisfied that it is in every way a success. The disinfecting staff has been re-arranged, and consists of one foreman disinfector, one man in charge of the station, boilers, &c., two drivers, and four disinfectors. Formerly the disinfectors assisted in drain testing, but now two men have been taken from the disinfecting staff and have been allocated to this work. Below is shown the number of rooms and articles disinfected by the Staff of the Department. The premises included 29 rooms in 5 schools, 6 workrooms, and 2 sets of offices; 19 vehicles were also disinfected. In 23 cases of infectious disease treated at home the laundry linen was collected weekly and disinfected (190 articles from scarlet fever cases, 240 from diphtheria, and 563 from enteric fever). Disinfection was carried out after all cases of the notifiable diseases, except as regards erysipelas (in which disinfection was performed in 70 27 instances, when the circumstances of the case required it), and also after 36 cases of measles, 2 chicken-pox, 27 cancer, 2 influenza, 3 mumps, 2 whooping cough, and 200 phthisis. In 56 instances the premises, &c., were disinfected privately (28 of these being cases of phthisis). Consequent upon the fewer cases of infectious disease in 1910 the number of rooms and articles disinfected is much lower than in previous years. The owner of a house was reprimanded for sending away linen after an infectious case without disclosing the fact; fortunately, it was discovered before it had reached its destination. Shelters.‚ÄîOne person was admitted to the temporary shelters at Horseferry Itoad while disinfection was being carried out. The following table gives a comparative statement of the above work during the past seven years:‚Äî 1903. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908. 1909. 1910.

Cleansing of Persons.‚ÄîThe Guardians have dealt with the frequenters of their casual wards, who are the persons most troubled with vermin, at their own establishments, and the Education Committee has in use an apparatus at Pulteney School. The names of children treated at this school are forwarded to me, so that the homes, bedding, &c. may be examined and, if necessary, cleansed. Names of 22 children, inmates of 19 houses, were received; the home conditions were found to be unsatisfactory in 6 instances, and steps were taken to rectify them Two children were reported to be in a verminous condition, and were visited at their homes until the parents had cleansed them. Eight rooms and 595 articles were fumigated on this account. Six adult persons were given a bath and their clothing fumigated (76 articles). Verminous Houses.‚Äî249 notices with reference to vermin in rooms were issued on the reports of the Sanitary Inspectors; 18 of these were fumigated with sulphur by the Council's staff, the remainder by the 71 owners. In all 1,991 articles were passed through the disinfecting apparatus on account of their verminous condition, and a number were destroyed; these articles were removed from 36 houses. Mortuaries. The number of bodies removed to the Council's mortuaries under order of the Coroner, or to await burial, was 333; in 5 instances death was the result of infectious disease. Two hundred and eighty-one inquests were held at Horseferry Eoad where the Coroner's Court is situated; G adjourned inquests were held. Post-mortem examinations were made in 141 instances at Horseferry Eoad. The number of fatal accidents due to vehicular traffic continues to increase; in 1910, 45 inquests resulted therefrom. The number of dead bodies taken to the mortuaries for purposes of inquest and to await burial during the last nine years are:‚Äî Total. For Inquest. To await Burial. Total. For Inquest.

Summons against occupier withdrawn. 5, Diadem Court (restaurant and dwelling) Failure to maintain w.c. in proper condition Two landlords, each fined 10s. 6d. Refusal to admit Inspector.‚ÄîA magistrate's warrant had to be obtained before the occupier of rooms in Dufour's Place would admit the Inspector. The conditions found justified the application. Drainage, &c. Plans.‚Äî570 sets of plans were examined during 1910. 430 of these resulted from notices served by the Public Health Department, and 74 140 were plans of new buildings or re.constructions, the drainage of which is under the supervision of the City Engineer, with the exception of such matters as come under the Public Health Act and by.laws made thereunder in respect of water closets, water supply, ventilation, &c. Failure to send in plans occurred in 30 instances. Infringement of the by.laws in connection with the erection of buildings occurred in 37 instances. Proceedings against one person offending were taken with the following result:‚Äî Premises. Offence. Eesult. W. E. Sharpe, 44, How. land Street, W. Carrying out certain drainage works in an improper manner at No. 7, Archer Street Fined 10.9. and 23s. costs. Twenty.one persons were cautioned by the Public Health Committee. Drain.testing.‚ÄîIn the list given above is shown the number of drains and soilpipes which have been tested under the superintendence of the sanitary inspectors. The chemical test is applied by them, but the other forms of test require assistance, this is frequently given by the builders employed in the work, but in 301 instances the services of the two drain.testers attached to the Department were requisitioned. Public Conveniences for Women‚ÄîFree Water.Closets.‚ÄîThe Public Health Committee, on consideration of a letter from the Women's National Health Association of Great Britain, on the subject of the provision of free public lavatory accommodation for women, represented to the Works Committee that it is desirable that some free accommodation should be provided in connection with each of the women's conveniences belonging to the Council. The Works Committee objected to this on the ground that when such free accommodation was provided by the Yestries and the Council in the past it was misused and abused to such an extent as to render its continuance impossible; but the Public Health Committee suggested that this difficulty was due to the use of a special form of urinette and might be surmounted by using an ordinary water.closet with a wooden rim, and with proper supervision. Eventually it was agreed to give the scheme a trial for three months at each of the women's conveniences at Broad Street and Parliament Street for free use; that notices be exhibited outside the conveniences that free w.c. accommodation is available on application to the Attendant. 75 Removal of Offensive Refuse.‚ÄîComplaints were made of offensive smells in a number of instances occurring during the removal of kitchen refuse from hotels, &c. Three persons were cautioned for removing refuse during prohibited hours and one prosecution was taken as follows :‚Äî ]Name and Address of Defendant. Offence. Result. John Cornwell, Westfield Farm, Weston Road, Mitcham Removing offensive matter during prohibited hours Fined 20s. and 2s. costs. A summons is not taken out unless the person offending has been previously cautioned. A contractor engaged in dust removal was cautioned against removal of bones and other offensive matter from one of the Council's wharves in improper receptacles. Daily Removal of House Refuse.‚ÄîIn my last report I mentioned that daily removal of house refuse was in force in the City with the exception of one locality. I am glad to be able to say that during 1910 that part has been brought into line. Inquiry having been made as to the existence of any statistics bearing upon health conditions before and after the institution of a daily collection, I have compared the mortality returns for two periods of nine years each of a block of Peabodv Buildings, dailv collections having been instituted in 1901. The average annual population is 1,391, of which 242 are under five years of age, and is fairly constant in each period. 1891.99. Before. 1901.09. After. Total deaths 220 184 Rate per 1,000 15.8 13.2 Deaths under 5 105 73 Rate per 1,000 43.0 301 Deaths over 5 115 111 Rate per 1,000 100 9.7 Deaths from the principal zymotic diseases:‚Äî Small.pox 3 Scarlet fever 3 1 Diphtheria 10 3 Typhoid fever ‚Äî ‚Äî Measles 19 2 Whooping.cough 4 5 Diarrhoea 10 4 Total 46 18 = 3.3 per 1,000 = 1.3 per 1,000 76 The diarrhoea death-rate was equal to 0 71 per 1,000 in the first, and 028 in the second period; for all London during the same periods it was 0 79 and 0'67 respectively. Housing and Town Planning Act.‚ÄîThe Council on February 17th, 1910, determined that as certain of the provisions of this Act are so closely related to those contained in the Public Health (London) Act, it is desirable that the execution of the Act, together with such sections of the principal and amending Acts, in so far as they relate to the remedying, closing, or demolition of insanitary houses, should be made a reference to the Public Health Committee of the Council instead of to the Housing Committee. The Local Government Board on September 2nd, 1910, issued a series of regulations with reference to the systematic inspection of dwelling.houses and the keeping of records in respect thereof. It is required that there shall be submitted to the local authority special lists of dwelling.houses, early inspection of which is desirable, and that information and particulars in tabular form shall be included in the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health in regard to the number of dwelling.houses inspected under and for the purposes of Section 17, the number of which on inspection were considered unfit for habitation, the number of representations made to the local authority, and the subsequent action taken thereon. I have therefore to report as follows:‚Äî Houses inspected under Section 17 21 Representations made as to unfitness 9 Closing Orders made 9 Orders complied with 9 Number of houses since put into habitable state 0 Undergroimd rooms represented under Section 17 12 Closing Orders made 11 Still under consideration 1 The dwelling.houses with regard to which representations were made by the Medical Officer of Health were Nos. 48, 50, 58, 62, 64, 68 and 70, Tufton Street, and Nos. 41 and 43, Wood Street. The houses in Tufton Street had been unoccupied for some time, and had become dilapidated and a danger to the neighbourhood, being receptacles for refuse. Internal connections with the drains were not cut off, so that rats and effluvia could escape. Two of the houses were very old, the date of their erection being stated to be 1679.* * Tufton Street is named after Sir Richard Tufton, who is said to have built the first houses in this street. He died in 1631. 71 The houses in Wood Street *.each consisted of a basement and two floors above; the lighting and ventilation of one room were bad; the w.c. accommodation for both houses was situated in a yard a considerable distance away from the premises and approached by descending a dark staircase into a dark cellar in which, until recently, was the only source of water supply; from the cellar a long winding tunnel led to a yard at the back of some other houses. The result of such construction being that the cellars and passages became a receptacle for filth and refuse. The houses were occupied. The Public Health Committee inspected the nine premises, meeting the owners or their representatives, and subsequently made closing orders which have been complied with. The properties in Tufton and Wood Streets were part of those scheduled under the St. John (Westminster) Improvement Act, 3 906. The period within which compulsory power of acquirement could be exercised would have expired in September, 1911, but on December 7th, 1910, the Council received information from the Local Government Board that the Company found it impossible to exercise the powers conferred by the Act and had therefore passed a resolution for voluntary winding up. Systematic Inspection.‚ÄîThe Act requires this to be done and the Board has laid down the Order that a record shall be prepared and kept of the result of such inspection. House to house inspection has always been carried out in the City and special inspections of certain localities and streets have from time to time been ordered by the Public Health Committee. The Board recommend that records be kept in one of three ways, in a book, on separate sheets or on cards. The advantage of the card system is that the space occupied by the records is not great, but it necessitates reference to notice books, files of letters, plans, &c., which have to be kept separately. It was therefore resolved that it would be best to have the records on sheets rather than cards, so that all the information relating to a house (not only the facts found on present inspection, but plans correspondence, sanitary notices, &c.) should be kept together so that in future anyone may at once obtain the sanitary history of the house without having to hunt through minute books, notice books, plan registers, &c. The method suggested is that a large envelope be prepared for each house, into which will be placed all documents relating thereto. The various envelopes will be grouped in streets, so that reference will be easy. * Wood Street was described in 1720 as "very narrow, with old boarded hovels ready to fall." 78 This system has been in use to a certain extent for some years, so far as clerical assistance would permit. It is on the model of that in use in Paris which was begun in 1894 and recommended for adoption by me in reports made in 1898 and 1900. Underground Rooms.‚ÄîUnder the Public Health (London) Act, Section 96, an underground room may not be used as a dwelling unless it complies with certain requirements, but if used in conjunction with another room in the same house which is not underground, it escapes from the control of the section. It may, however, be dealt with under the general nuisance sections of that Act. Section 17 of the Housing and Town Planning Act prohibits any underground room being used habitually as a sleeping place, unless it is seven feet high or complies with regulations to be made by each local authority. This apparently includes basement rooms used by servants in good class houses as well as the kitchens of tenement dwellings. This particular part of the Act did not come into force until the 1st July, 1910. Orders were made by the Council requiring the closure of 11 underground rooms which were not seven feet high in eleven houses. The Council has not made regulations under this section, as it does not seem clear from the wording of the section that it would be possible to enforce such regulations with regard to rooms seven feet or over in height. Back.to.baclc Houses.‚ÄîSection 43 prohibits for the future the erection of any back.to.back dwellings intended to be used as working class dwellings. This also applies to a house containing several tenements, in which the tenements are placed back to back, unless the Medical Officer of Health certifies that they are so constructed and arranged as to secure effective ventilation of all habitable rooms in every tenement I have objected to one plan submitted for proposed dwellings under this section. Inhabited House Duty.‚ÄîSection 35 exempts any house occupied for the sole purpose of letting lodgings to persons of the working class, at a charge of not exceeding sixpence a night for each person, if certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be solely constructed and used to afford suitable accommodation for the lodgers and due provision made for their sanitary requirements. I have certified one house under this section and have not certified two others (see below "Inhabited House Duty.") Alteration of By.laws.‚ÄîIn view of the terms of the By.laws for houses let in lodgings in force in the City, it was not deemed necessary to make any alteration under the power given in this Act. Displacement of Persons of the Working Class.‚ÄîEight premises in 73 Houghton Street and Stanhope Street, in connection with the Kingsway scheme, have been closed, displacing 71 persons. About 100 persons have been displaced by the demolition of houses in Eccleston Place, and 34 by the closure of a house in St. Anne's Court. The imminent closure of certain houses in St. John's Ward will displace about 80 persons. It is proposed by the County Council to build a new school in place of that in Horseferry Road on a site not yet settled in Victoria Ward. A plot of ground with some 50 houses on it has been acquired by the Peabody Trustees between Vauxhall Bridge Road and Willow Street, and building operations are expected to be proceeded with during 1911, when seven blocks of buildings will be erected. Houses Let in Lodgings. The number of houses in 1910 was reduced by 34 through closure, and as none were added in that year, the number on the register at the end of the year was 1,447; to this class of house 7,507 visits were recorded as having been paid, but more were actually paid. Overcrowding was found in 63 instances, and 1,292 other defects were found and remedied. Particulars are included in the general list given at the beginning of this part of the Report. Regulation of Cheap Furnished Rooms.‚ÄîIn 1909 the London County Council addressed a letter to the City Council on the above subject, and asked their opinion as to the manner they considered best for dealing with the difficulties which had been found to exist. The City Council were of opinion that the local Sanitary Authority should be invested with power to inspect and enforce a certain standard of requirements in such cases. (A statement embodying the County Council's letter and this Council's action is given on pp. 80.81 of my Annual Report for 1909.) The Council of the Borough of Kensington have incorporated a clause in their By.laws for houses let in lodgings, which has been sanctioned by the Local Government Board, requiring that:‚Äî " Subject to the provisions of these By.laws, a keeper of a lodging house in which rooms are let in furnished lodgings shall cause the bedding and other articles in such rooms to be at all times maintained in a clean and wholesome condition." I suggested that if a similar provision were added to the City of Westminster By.laws it would provide, to a certain extent, the increased control which the Council thought it desirable to have. The Council adopted the suggestion, and have submitted to the Local Government Board a similar By.law, altering the word " keeper" to " landlord," to F2 80 be in conformity with the By.laws already in force in the City, and limiting the application of the proposed By.law to furnished lodgings let at not more than seven shillings a week. Water Supply. Applications were received for certificates that the water supply of six new buildings was sufficient, and were granted in each instance. 164 notices of withdrawal of water supply were received from the Metropolitan Water Board, and in 38 instances it was reinstated, on notice. Additional sources of water supply on the upper floors of tenement houses were provided in 1,049 instances. Legal proceedings in connection with water supply were taken in six instances. Owners are recommended in all cases to fit a proper sink in connection with the new supply on upper floors and so prevent risk of walls and ceilings being spoiled. As a rule, the Council has not asked for more than one tap and sink between the first and second floors, but in some instances owners have laid on water to each floor. Complaints were made in the early part of the year that the water supplied by the Water Board to the Council's swimming baths was objectionable from the large amount of colour, due to the presence of vegetable matter; representations were made to the Board on the subject. The cause appears to be due to imperfect filtration during times when the river is in flood, and to the want of sufficient storage. Dr. Houston, the Director of Water Examination to the Water Board, has shown that if water is stored for a sufficient period in reservoirs it can be rendered quite "safe," provided that no accident happens in course of delivery. In recent years considerable provision has been made for such storage, but the reservoirs have been chiefly used merely to cover periods of emergency. In order to obviate this, the Board is constructing more reservoirs, so that no water shall be supplied to London until it has been purified by storage. As a result of the alteration in the method of charging for water, several owners of property have been sinking wells, in order to tap the supply of water contained in the chalk below the London clay. Analyses of the water obtained have been made, and are appended. Curious variations in the contents may be noted in the water raised from the different localities. Water which is extremely soft has a tendency at first to act upon lead pipes, but after a time they become coated with a protective " skin." Analyses taken some time after the wells had been in use showed that the waters contained no lead. 81 Analyses of Water from Beep Wells. Parts per 100,000. Regent Street. Ashley Gardens.

These salts, which form the "solid residue," are found to consist of sodium chloride, 33.7 per cent.; sodium sulphate, 35 per cent.; sodium carbonate, 23'3 per cent.; calcium carbonate, 5 per cent.; and magnesium carbonate, 3 per cent. In the water supplied by the Water Board the total hardness varies from 22 to 26, of which from 6 to 9 parts are permanent. The great increase of these deep wells in recent years must have a marked effect upon the underground water in the chalk under London, and as the level sinks such wells will have to be sunk deeper. The rate at which the level is falling has been estimated at from 2 to 3 feet a year, and eventually it may not pay to sink wells to the depth necessary to obtain a supply, possibly, moreover, the quantity of water in this underground reservoir is not inexhaustible. The excavations in connection with the new St. Anne's Parish Hall, in Dean Street, led to the discovery under the pavement of a well 73 feet deep containing 57 feet of water. This was the source of supply of the old Parish Pump, which stood in front of the Vestry Hall. Its use was discontinued in 1866 at the time of the cholera visitation, as it was found that many of these shallow wells were contaminated by soakage from cesspools, and thus became a means of spreading the disease. Common Lodging.houses. The use of the premises 6, 6a, 6b, and 6c, Great Smith Street, and the Salvation Army Shelter at 23 and 25, Millbank Street, as common lodging.houses, was given up during the year, and a new Salvation Army Shelter has been opened in Great Peter Street. 82 The premises at 16, Strutton Ground have been reconstructed. The total common lodging-house accommodation available is now 2,162 beds for men, 75 for women. Deaths.‚Äî91 deaths occurred in 1910 among inmates of the common lodging-houses and shelters in the City (87 males and 4 females). 28 of the deaths were due to phthisis, 19 to respiratory diseases, 19 to diseases of the heart and bloodvessels, 8 to cancer, and 6 to kidney disease. There were 36 deaths in St. John's Ward, 1 in Regent, 8 in Covent Garden, and 46 in Strand. The following is a list of the common lodging-houses in Westminster, the number for which they were licensed, and the number of deaths which occurred during the last three years among persons alleged to have been inmates:‚Äî Common Lodging Houses.

Revenue Act. Certificates under this Act relieve the recipient from the payment of Inhabited House Duty. Applications were received by me in 12 instances comprising 46 tenements. Certiiicates were granted in respect of all of the tenements. The premises in which are situated the tenements for which certificates were granted are:‚Äî Bessborougli Mansions, Regency Street. Ashley Mansions,Vauxhall Bridge Road. St. Augustine Mansions, Bloomburg Street. Park Mansions, Knightsbridge. Maidstone House and Tonbridge House, Mercer Street. 152, Vauxhall Bridge Road. 68, Buckingham Gate G-ardens. Whitcombe House, Orange Street. Hyde Park Chambers, Knightsbridge. Adelplii Terrace House. 37, St. James Place. 83 Such certificates were originally intended as a stimulus to property owners to improve the condition of tenement houses, but in some of the above the accommodation for which application was made was intended for servants and caretakers in blocks of high.class mansions. By the Housing and Town Planning Act a further extension has been made by exempting from Inhabited House Duty any house occupied for the sole purpose of letting lodgings to persons of the working class at a charge of not exceeding 6d. a night for each person, if certified by the Medical Officer of Health to be solely constructed and used to afford suitable accommodation for the lodgers and due provision made for their sanitary requirements. Three applications were made for certificates under this Act. In one case, 16, Strutton Ground, it was granted, in one refused, and in the case of the third, which was for three houses separately licensed by the County Council as common lodging.houses but assessed as one house, a certificate was offered for one of the three but was declined. Smoke Prevention. The City is divided into two parts for purposes of smoke inspection, under Inspectors McNair and Williams. The following is a summary of the work done in connection therewith:‚Äî 1910. North District. South District. Total. Complaints received 14 13 27 Observations taken 952 2,057 3,009 Notices issued‚Äî. Preliminary 43 43 86 Statutory 5 1 6 Summonses 3 - 3 Police court proceedings were taken on three occasions against two offenders:‚Äî St. Petersburg Hotel Fined 5s. and 2s. costs. The Empress Club Fined 20s. and 2s. costs. Ditto Fined 40s. and 2s. costs. A comparison with previous years is given below 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 1907 1908 1909 Complaints 81 52 55 52 37 48 35 44 Observations 2,728 2,731 3,191 2,715 2,722 2,417 2,362 2,605 Notices issued:‚Äî Preliminary 58 68 142 121 93 106 116 93 Statutory 18 18 26 26 25 15 12 6 Summonses 6 3 5 11 8 2 ‚Äî ‚Äî 84 As in previous years much of the smoke nuisauce complained of is the result of careless stoking of the furnaces. Several notices were also served with respect to chimneys outside Westminster from which black smoke was blowing into the City. The County Council introduced a Bill into Parliament to amend the law dealing with smoke nuisance in several respects. One of the objects of the Bill was to omit the defining word "black" before the word "smoke" in the Public Health Act. A special report from the Select Committee on Local Legislation states that as the County Council were unwilling to accept any limitation on their suggested clause, the Committee, having in view the serious effect it might have on the industries of London, did not allow it. Other clauses of the Bill were passed, and the Act received the Royal Assent on August 3rd, 1910. It provides that in any special case in which a sanitary authority request them so to do, the County Council may, in lieu of such sanitary authority, enforce the provisions of Section 23 (Furnaces and Steam Vessels to consume their own smoke) and Section 24 (Summary proceedings for abatement of nuisance caused by smoke) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The County Council are also empowered to enforce the provisions of those sections in their application to any building or premises belonging to or used by a sanitary authority, but in the exercise of this power the County Council are subject to the provisions of Sub.section (3) of Section 117 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which provides that no proceedings shall be taken by the County Council against a sanitary authority save with the sanction of the Local Government Board, unless such proceeding is for the recovery of expenses or of money due from the sanitary authority to the County Council. Difficulty is sometimes experienced in dealing with smoke from chimneys ending at a lower level than the houses adjoining. The smoke is often unable to get away, being beaten down or blown about by the currents of air induced by the varying heights of the surrounding buildings. In the accompanying photographs some of these results may be noted. The remedy consists sometimes in raising the offending chimney, or in carrying the smoke to the top of the nearest house by means of a flue, or by discontinuing the use of coal. 85 D. WORKSHOPS, &c. Section 132 of the Factory and Workshops Act directs that "The Medical Officer of Health of every District Council shall in his annual report to them report specifically on the administration of this Act in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State," and forms have been supplied giving a summary of what is required. It is, however, a matter of difficulty in Westminster to apportion work done, as workshops and dwellings are so intermingled. The following shows the state of the register of workshops at the end of 1910:‚Äî Workshop. Total N umber. Number in which Women are Employed. Tailors, outfitters, shirt makers, liat, cap, and helmet makers Dressmakers, milliners, embroiderers, lace makers, blouse makers, costumiers, lingerie makers, children's outfit makers, feather 1,612 1,195 dyeing, corset makers, furriers, &c. 789 782 Leather workers, boot and shoe makers, harness makers, &c. 64 10 Carpentry, upholstery, carvers, gilders, &c. 25 ‚Äî Surgical and dental instrument makers 12 ‚Äî Tobacco manufacturers 14 6 Wig makers and hair workers 42 42 Printing, bookbinding, lithographers, envelope making, stationers, publishers, &c. 64 52 Jewellers, silversmiths and burnishers, diamond cutters and polishers, engravers, &c. 74 31 Metal workers 45 6 Miscellaneous‚ÄîBasket making, fancy work, shoe ornaments, hat pins, stamp sorters, postcard tinters, fan makers, artificial flower makers, &c. 116 70 Florists 32 32 Laundries 48 48 Bakehouses 85 ‚Äî New workshops are always being discovered, at the same time the occupation of premises on the register is constantly changing. The use of 283 registered workshops was discontinued, and 48l additions were made to the register during the year; 107 visits of enquiry were made at places where women were likely to be employed. The number of inspections of workshops and workplaces is shown in the accompanying tables. One hundred and sixty.seven complaints were received, including 112 from the Home Office and were duly investigated ; 12 matters were referred to the Home Office relating to insufficient warming of rooms, working overtime, &c. In addition, notice was sent of 105 workshops in which Abstracts were not affixed. Statutory notices were issued in 23 instances; two prosecutions 86 took place in connection with premises in which work was carried on, as shown above, under the heading of " House Inspection." Obstructing an Inspector.‚ÄîThe owner (a woman) of a dressmaking business was extremely abusive to one of the women inspectors, and pushed her aside. The Public Health Committee placed the matter in the hands of the City Solicitors, and as a result of their communication an apology was tendered which the Inspector and the Committee accepted.

In two or three cases oil was in use to heat the stoves, and caused the air of the rooms in which they were to be distinctly offensive. The Home Office Inspectors co.operated with the Council's staff in many instances, and had chemical examination of the air made. In one case, in a long narrow underground workshop of 2,637 cubic feet capacity, the ventilation was found to be defective, especially at the back of the room. There were large windows the whole breadth of the room part of which were kept open, the door was near the windows, and there was a small electric fan in the rear wall. This, however, was badly fixed, and failed to extract the air as it was intended to do, instead of which it threw a draught down on the workers and drew in air from an area which was not kept in as cleanly a condition as it might. In addition there was a flueless gas stove, and a gas ring heater which was connected with a flue. Nine persons were employed in the room, which was fairly light, so that artificial lighting was not usually required. On analysis it was found that the amount of carbonic acid gas was 22.5 parts per 1,000 in the centre of the room and 27.3 parts at the far end. Various improvements were effected, the fan was properly fixed and more openings provided in the window, and the result of further analysis showed the carbonic to be 12.6 and 16 parts respectively. On both occasions the gas stove was not in use. The Home Office standard is not a high one, being 12 parts per 10,000, so that the above results could not be regarded as satisfactory, and led to the conclusion that regular use was not being made of the fan, which proved to be the case, the reasons given being that the tenants in the room above complained of the vibration, and the workers in the basement that there was too great a current of cold air through the room 88 there being no means of warming the air as it entered. Eventually the use of the workroom was given up. Outworkers.‚ÄîFirms giving out work in certain trades are required to send in a list twice a year of those they employ. Outworkers are constantly changing their addresses and their employers, so that it is difficult to maintain a correct register. Less trouble has been experienced in getting in the lists since the Council adopted the plan of sending a printed form to all known or likely employers to be filled up by them; in addition 36 visits of enquiry to ascertain if outworkers were employed were made by the women inspectors. The accompanying table gives the details of the returns made in Westminster in 1910. 671 lists were sent in by employers, as compared with 678 in 1909, 665 in 1908, 654 in 1907 and 318 in 1906; 4,269 addresses were sent to other local authorities in whose jurisdiction lived persons to whom work, chiefly tailoring, is sent from Westminster to be done in other boroughs; 510 addresses were received of persons in Westminster taking in work from other boroughs. They were distributed thus:‚Äî Council. Sen l from YVeslminster. Received by Westminster. Council. Sent from Westminster. Received by Westminster. Feb. Auk. Feb. Aug. Feb. Aug. Feb. Aug.

There is practically no change in the number of persons living in Westminster working for firms in other districts. Workers are frequently in the employ of several firms, so that the number of names returned does not necessarily coincide with the actual number of workers, the actual number of persons resident in the City is found to be 1,778, being 11 less than in the previous year. All those living in Westminster were visited, and the sanitary condition, not only of the rooms occupied, but of the whole house, was inquired into. The actual number of houses in which outwork was being done was 974. 306 notices were served in resuect of 651 defects discovered in 263 houses. They may be summarised thus :‚Äî 1909 1910 1909 1910 Sanitary Walls and ceilings dirty 340 250 tion‚Äî Booms verminous 48 17 Insufficient ‚Äî 4 Booms overcrowded 13 4 Not kept separate 25 10 Rooms badly ventilated 23 15 Improper position 1 ‚Äî Gas stoves and heaters unventilated Apparatus defective 130 87 31 9 Requiring cleansing 56 42 Other defects (dampness, defective Ventilation defective 6 8 roofs, floors, water supply, dust Drains, &c., defective 73 33 bins, &c.) 167 112 In 21 instances statutory notices had to be served before the work required was done. In several instances where the rooms were dirty or verminous the outworker was seriously warned, and in two instances work was stopped until the conditions were improved. Infectious Disease‚ÄîA list of the cases of notifiable infectious diseases which occurred in families engaged in the making, &c., of wearing apparel, are given below. It was unnecessary to stop their work except temporarily during the time disinfection was being carried out, except in one case of typhoid fever. As the patient was too ill to be moved rooms were taken elsewhere for the family and for use as a workshop:‚Äî 91 Smallpox. Scarlet lever. Diphtheria Typhoid Fever. Erysipelas. Total.

There are 48 Laundries in which washing is done, besides which there are a number of private houses in which mangling only is done. 92 E. FOOD SUPPLY. During 1910 visits have been paid to the various classes of business as follows:‚Äî Dairies and Milkshops 608 Bakehouses 210 Hotels, Restaurants and Eating houses 1,361 Ice cream makers 188 Food preserving works 20 Fishmongers 630 Greengrocers and Fruiterers 630 Meat shops (various) 715 Confectioners 14 Provision shops 368 Aerated water makers 2 Eleven statutory notices were served and police.court proceedings were taken in one instance (see above). Ice.cream Premises.‚ÄîThis commodity is made at 150 premises, each of which was kept under supervision. In 3 instances defects affecting this particular part of the business were remedied. The owner of certain premises which were unfit, for the purpose was called upon to discontinue making or dealing in ice.creams at the premises until they were made to comply with Section 42 General Powers Act, 1902. Bakehouses.‚ÄîAt the end of 1909 there were 13 above.ground and 71 underground in use. During 1910 a new above.ground bakehouse has been added. All the bakehouses were inspected, and cleansing carried out twice a year. In several instances there was some delay in having the work done, and proceedings were threatened. One baker was also warned that he was not keeping the floors, &c., as clean as he ought to do. Certification of Premises, &e.‚ÄîAs Certifying Officer for the City of Westminster for all meat foods prepared or packed for export to several foreign States, I have granted 152 certificates during 1910, 32 for the United States, 48 for the Philippine Islands, 63 for the Argentine, and 9 for Venezuela.

In 1910, 19 names were removed and 42 added, leaving 372 on the register at the end of the year; 29 of these were registered in respect of new premises; 10 are street vendors having no address in the City. Eight persons selling milk were given notice to register, and complied. The Council refused to register in 2 instances Six hundred and thirty.three visits were paid during the year, besides those by the two Inspectors taking samples under the Food and Drugs Act. Notices requiring improvement of existing conditions were served in a number of instances; no proceedings had to be taken against any milk seller on this account, but two were cautioned. Infectious Disease.‚ÄîTwo cases of diphtheria occurred on premises in which milkshops were situated, and one person from an infected house was employed elsewhere in the milk trade. Satisfactory arrangements were made in each instance, and no infection of the milk resulted. Coivsheds.‚ÄîThere is now only one cow.keeper, namely, at 13, Marsbam Street (licensed for 19 cows). These premises were visited 25 times during the year. Considerable improvements have been effected during the year. There are no slaughter.houses or "offensive trades" carried on in Westminster. Fried Fish Vendors, &c.‚ÄîSeveral complaints have been dealt with relating to the smell from these shops, and improved ventilation has been brought about, in one case by the adoption of a stove whereby the fumes from the frying are drawn into the stove and burned. Inspection of Food. The food exposed for sale in shops and on stalls in the street markets has been regularly inspected every day (including Sundays). The following list shows the quantity of food condemned and destroyed during the year.

Butchers' Meat on Stalls.‚ÄîThe street markets are regularly inspected during the week, but especially on Saturday evenings and Sunday mornings. The attention of vendors of butchers' meat has been called to the desirability of providing forks for the use of customers, to prevent the pieces of meat being handled, and in a number of instances the suggestion has been complied with. Bread.‚ÄîThe Council have had under consideration the question as to the need for fresh regulations dealing with places where bread is sold. This arose over certain allegations which were made in the Press and by the Association of Master Bakers, who pointed out the unreasonableness of strict regulations being made as to the places where bread is made and no regulations as to where it is sold, and that it is in many cases sold in the same shop as such articles as soap, candles, coke, coal and paraffin oil, and occasionally exposed in egg.boxes on the pavement. It was suggested that bread might be contaminated in this way, and by being handled and breathed upon by customers. Attention was also drawn to the practice which exists amongst bakers of taking back from customers loaves which they think too stale; instances were given in which bread had been sent back to the baker by customers suffering from consumption and other diseases. In a previous report I drew attention to the risk of contamination which occurred through baskets of bread being deposited on the roadway during delivery. A letter was also received from the Local Government Board, requesting information on the subject. In reply, the Council stated that " they are of opinion that the powers conferred by Section 8 of the 95 London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, are sufficient to ensure the cleanliness of places where bread is sold in London. No instance in Westminster has been brought to the knowledge of the Council where infection has been communicated by means of bread; but in any case in which bread from dwellings, where there were cases of infectious disease or of pulmonary consumption, was being taken back by a baker the Council think that such bread should be seized and destroyed as being unlit for human food under the provisions of Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and that the baker would be liable to prosecution if he knowingly sold such bread." ."Further, the Council considered that the practice of taking back bread from customers should be discontinued, unless such bread has been sold and kept in sealed dustproof paper coverings, which would bo a means of protecting the bread in course of transit between baker and customer as well as in retail shops." The practice of taking back stale bread appears to be one which might very well be regulated by the trade associations. Samples of flour, bread and biscuits were taken for analysis, but no adulteration was proved by the Analysts. The Public Health Committee has more than once considered the question of the quality of the Hour and bread which has been sold in recent years. The demand has been for a white bread, and in order to produce this a flour was produced which is said to have been artificially bleached, but which certainly did not contain important parts of the wheat as did the flour which used to be supplied in former times. Recently attempts have been made, apparently with success, to obtain a flour which shall contain the germ of the wheat together with a certain amount of the husk. In view of the inferior nourishing qualities of the white bread commonly sold it is being urged that the Local Government Board should lay down a standard for bread, making it compulsory that all bread sold as such should, unless distinctly labelled otherwise, be made from unadulterated wheat flour containing at least 80 per cent. of the whole wheat, including the germ and semolina. Such a standard has already been enforced by law for milk. The standardisation of bread is equally important, bread and flour forming about two.fifths of the weight of the food consumed by the working classes and constituting almost the whole diet of many poor children. An enquiry is being conducted by the Local Government Board as to the bleaching of flour and the addition to it of so.called "improvers"; also as to the presence of calcium sulphate in baking.powder and self. raising flour.

Milk.‚Äî947 samples of ordinary milk were taken during the year. Of these 108 (1140 per cent.) were reported by the Analysts to be below the standard of the Board of Agriculture, and 63 samples were just on the border line, making a total of 18.05 per cent. of the samples. The percentage of adulterated (11.40 per cent.) is rather higher, the increase being specially noticeable in the north district. The Analysts have graded the samples submitted to them into four groups:‚ÄîGood quality, in which the fat was over 3.8 per cent.; fair quality, in which the fat was between 3.3 and 3.8 per cent.; and poor or inferior quality, in which the fat was between 3 per cent. (the official standard) and 33 percent., or in which the non.fatty solids were between 8.5 and 8.6 (if the fat was also below 3.8). Adulterated are those below the official standard of 3 per cent. for fat and 8.5 for solids not fat. 98 Good Quality. Fair Quality. Poor Quality. Adulterated. District. Total. No. Percent.

The explanation of this apparent increase is that special attention has been given to restaurants, coffee houses, &c., the majority of which are situate in the north part of the City. The south district gives a more fair idea of the quality of the milk sold for home consumption, as the majority of the vendors are dairymen. The amount of "good" quality milk shows an increase, while the "fair" has dropped slightly and the "poor" rather more so. Separated milk is added to bring down milk of good quality to the minimum legal standard, or even lower when it is known that proceedings will not be taken unless the adulteration is in excess of a margin allowed by the local authority. This Council has prosecuted when the deficiency was under 5 per cent., and successful proceedings have been taken in several cases where there had been persistent adulteration within that limit. Sixty-one prosecutions were taken with regard to adulteration ‚Äî 41 for fat abstracted, 14 for added water, and 6 for both fat abstracted and added water. Fourteen cautions were given to sellers whose milk contained less than 5 per cent. of added water, or had less than 5 percent. of fat abstracted. Warranties were set up as a defence in 27 instances, 1 case was adjourned sine die, as the defendant was reported to be in Italy, and 1 case was withdrawn, as at the hearing it transpired that the business had been transferred. Details of the proceedings taken are appended. Sunday Samples.‚Äî150 of the samples of milk were taken on 15 Sundays during the year; 13 (8.6 per cent.) were found to be adulterated. In the four previous years the figures were 9.1, 10.6, 1T0 and 10.5 per cent. respectively. Samples taken in course of Delivery‚Äî (a) At Railway Stations.‚Äî68 samples of milk were taken on arrival at Victoria and Charing Cross Railway Stations. Thirty were reported of good quality, 23 fair, 13 poor, and 2 adulterated. 99 (b) On Delivery at Shops, &c.‚Äî47 samples of milk were taken as it was being delivered by wholesale firms to retail customers. Of these samples, 22 were good, 15 fair, 6 poor, and 4 adulterated (9 per cent. fat abstracted, 1 per cent. added water, 2 per gent, added water, 2 per added water and 4 per cent. abstracted fat). These samples were taken in consequence of the milk sold by the retailer having been previously sampled and found below the limit. The number of samples of milk taken in each of the last nine years are as follows:‚Äî 1902. 1903 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907. 1908 1909. 1910. New 401 658 741 831 806 792 860 951 947 Separated, condensed, sterilised or dried 55 55 31 36 11 31 18 16 13 Total 546 663 772 867 817 823 878 967 960 Infringement of Section 9, Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899.‚Äî Several persons were cautioned for failure to have name and address on milk can or barrow. Refused to Sell.‚ÄîA vendor refused to sell milk in a shop to the Inspector from a can which contained about one quart and was standing in front of the counter. A customer had been served from the can in question previous to the Inspector.s Assistant demanding some of the milk. The explanation given was that the milk was wanted for the proprietor.s wife. A fine of ¬£3 was inflicted and 12s. 6d. costs. A sample of milk purchased on a former occasion had been found deficient and the vendor had been lined. Cream.‚ÄîThe trade has now adopted the distinction in selling cream of the terms "fresh" or "preserved." Forty.one samples of the former were taken, 21 of them contained no preservative, and 20 had boric acid in the following proportions per pound:‚Äî5.95, 7.7, 9, 10, 10.25, 11, 11.2, 12.39, 13.8, 13.8, 148, 16.1, 16.1, 17.3, 20.5, 21.7, 23.5, 23.5, 24.29 and 30.98 grains respectively. In most of these instances notices were displayed in the shops that the cream contained preservative, although it was sold as fresh. Proceedings were taken in respect of five with the largest amounts, and notwithstanding the notices in the shops, convictions were obtained. The preserved creams sold in pots and marked as containing not more than 35 grains were found to have the following amounts per pound:‚Äî7.7, 7.8, 10.6, 14, 16.8, 19, 20.2 and 29.4 grains respectively. Cheese.‚ÄîIt having come to the notice of the Public Health Com 100 mittee that Gorgonzola cheese was being sold coated with a mixture of barytes and tallow they ordered some samples to be bought, and the Analysts reported that the rind contained 70 to 80 per cent. of barytes. The attention of dealers was called to this and the sale of such coated cheese was discontinued. Sausages, Meat Pies, &c‚ÄîIn my Annual Eeport for 1908 the judgment of Mr. Mead was stated in the case of McNair v. Hayward, in which a pork sausage was sold containing 224 grains of boric acid per pound. Mr. Mead in convicting under section 6 of the Food and Drugs Act held that the article was not of the nature, substance and quality demanded. An appeal was entered against this conviction and was heard before Mr. Robert Wallace, K.C., at the Sessions. The result was that the appeal was dismissed with costs. A case was stated for the. consideration of the High Court, but the six months within which it should have been entered for hearing by the Divisional Court was allowed to expire. Application was made on 26th January, 1910, for leave to enter the case, although it was out of time, but the Court dismissed the motion, with costs. Five other cases in which the amounts of boric acid varied from 245 grains to 46 grains had been waiting the result of the final appeal. The summonses were restored to the list and lines inflicted. Samples were taken during 1910 of sausages, meat pies, &c., with the following results:‚Äî 64 Pork Sausages 53 genuine; 11 contained boric acid:‚Äî0.6, 1.3, 6.5, 7.4, 9.9, 10.78, 10.8, 161, 347 grains per lb.; and 2 contained traces. 8 Beef Sausages 3 genuine; 5 contained boric acid:‚Äî7.2, 7.5, 9.12 and 9.12 grains per lb.; 1 contained a trace. 6 Liver Sausages Genuine. 6 German Sausages 3 genuine; 3 contained boric acid:‚Äî3.5, 19.83 grains per lb.; and 1 a trace. I Saveloy Genuine. 11 Pork Pies 6 genuine; 5 contained boric acid:‚Äî 2.5, 4.4, 13.0, 14.8, 24.7 grains per lb. (crust included). 29 Meat Pies 27 genuine; 2 contained boric acid:‚Äî20 and 2.6 grains per lb. (crust included). 1 Sausage Roll Contained 1.5 grains boric acid (16 grains in meat portion). 3 Brawn 2 genuine; 1 contained 1.5 grains boric acid. 1 Veal and Ham Pie Contained 1.0 grain boric acid. In reporting upon the pies the Analysts stated the amount of boric acid found in the pie as a whole but in certain instances particulars were given showing the amount found in the pie apart from the crust, in some of these it was above 16 grains per pound of meat. 101 In these various meat preparations there has been a great reduction in the amount of boric acid used as compared with previous years. In one sample of bacon examined 9 grains boric acid per pound was found. Tinned Meat,‚ÄîIn 15 samples of potted meats 5 were found to contain preservatives to the amount of 1¬Ω, 9, 12.39, 1.8 and 19.8 grains per pound. Fish.‚ÄîFourteen samples of fish, fresh, filletted and cured, were examined. One "fresh" haddock (taken unofficially) was found to contain 21.07 grains of boric acid per pound. A sample of filletted cod was found to have the skin dyed with an organic dye; the analyst reported: " The proportion of the dye found is extremely small, too minute in fact for determination, and there is no reason for supposing that it is in any way injurious or that its use would serve any fraudulent purpose, so that in the absence of any further information I only regard the offence as a technical one." Tinned Vegetables.‚ÄîThe use of copper sulphate as a colouring agent has been reduced by the action of the Council to small amounts‚Äîunder 2 grains per pound. One retailer was cautioned for selling spinach with over this amount. Drugs.‚ÄîBoric ointment was purchased 9 times and found to be satisfactory except in one instance; this sample contained 11 per cent. of the drug instead of 10 per cent. The ointment in question was procured by the retailer from a wholesale firm, who had another sample examined which was found to be of correct strength but a little lumpy. 102 Legal Proceedings Under the Food and Drugs Acts during 1910.

Two summonses were issued, and the usual evidence was given for the prosecution. The inspector having stated that the chums arrived unsealed and with one label loose on the top of one of the churns, the defendant gave evidence and called two of his employees to prove that the churns were sealed on the morning they left him, that labels were attached to each, and that such labels could not get loose without being cut, the suggestion apparently being that the water was added by the railway officials. The City Solicitor pointed out to the Magistrate (Mr. Horace Smith) that this was no defence, but he dismissed both the summonses, stating that he did not consider the evidence for the prosecution sufficient. The Magistrate did not say in what respect the evidence was insufficient. 729 N. 27th October Bow Street (Mr. Curtis Bennett) John Hughes, 13, Bedfordbury 6 per cent. of added water Fined 40s. and 23s. costs. 739 N. 28th October Marlborough.

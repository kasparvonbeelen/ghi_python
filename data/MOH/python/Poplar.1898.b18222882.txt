PoP8 Board of Books for the poplar District. ANNUAL REPORT, YEAR 1898, on The Sanitary Condition with Vital Statistics of the Parishes of POPLAR and BROMLEY within the Poplar District, by FREDK. WM. ALEXANDER, Diplomate in Public Health (England,) medical officer of health. ANNUAL REPORT of the MEDICAl 0FFICER OF HEALTH for the SOUTH DISTRICT. Comprising the Parishes of All Saints, Poplar, and Bromley St. Leonard. To the Chairman and Members of the Board of Works for the Poplar District. Gentlemen, In accordance with " The Sanitary Officer's (London) order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my sixth Annual Report, which report deals with the year 1898, and includes the annual reports of the Sanitary Inspectors for the parishes of Poplar and Bromley, and the report of the Inspector of Nuisances in manufactories and workshops. VITAL STATISTICS. The populations of the two parishes, estimated to the middle of the year 1898, on the theory of the basis of the rate of change between the censuses of 1891 and 1896 being maintained are:— Registration London 4,504,766. South Poplar or Isle of Dogs 20,905 South Bromley 37,334 North Poplar 37,512 North Bromley 32,355 Total 58,417 69,689 A 2 being 60.3 inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 50.0 per acre in Poplar and 114.6 in Bromley, and these estimated populations are. the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present report. In calculating the birth and marriage rates, also the general death and zymotic rates in addition to using the above-mentioned estimated populations, these rates have also been obtained by dealing with populations estimated by deducting the deaths from the enumerated populations and adding the births from the time that the census of 1896 (the end of the first quarter of the year) was taken to the middle of the year 1898. The unknown figures relating to emigration and imigration concerning the parishes have received no consideration. Poplar. Bromley. Census 1896 5 7,7 59 69,821 Deaths from first quarter of year 1896 to middle of year 1898 2,824- 3,176- 54,935 66,645 Births for the corresponding period 4,47I + 5.758 + Estimated population (b) to the middle of year 1898 59,406 72,403 For convenience the rates as mentioned above will be styled (a) or (b) according to the respective estimated population used. Poplar. Bromley. (a) 58,417 69,689 (B) 59,4O6 72,403 Certain houses have been pulled down in Culloden and Dee Streets in order to build a Board School, and new dwelling houses have been erected in Ailsa and Lochnagar Streets, but no insanitary areas have been cleared in the parish of Bromley, therefore it is more than probable that the estimated population of this parish has not 3 diminished since the last census, but would be possibly represented by the larger figure. In calculating with two estimated populations, it is obvious, that when rates are obtained with the lower population, the result will always be greater than if the higher figures had been used, and vice versa. In dealing generally with the rates in this report, the lower population, (a)—except where mentioned.—will be used, in order to compare the rates obtained with those of other metropolitan sanitary districts, as the populations of these areas which form the whole metropolis are estimated upon the same theory. The births during the 52 weeks were :— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 1019 986 2005 Bromley 1310 1246 2556 T otals 2329 2232 4561 Of these births 73 were illegitimate in Poplar, 38 males and 35 females. In Bromley there were 43 illegitimate births, 24 males and 19 females. The annual birth rate per iooo living being;— 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898.

Treating the 1962 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 643 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 157 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1476. The 1254 deaths in Poplar included 9 illegitimate children, 3 male and 6 female, and the 1476 deaths in Bromley included 15 illegitimate children, 7 male and 8 female. Males. Females. Totals.

Poplar 380 371 751 Bromley 557 523 1080 Totals 937 894 1831 The male births in the two parishes exceeded those of the female by 97, but the male deaths exceeded those of the female by 54, which makes a gain of 43 males this year in the two parishes, whereas in the year 1897 there was a gain of 82 females, so that there would still be an excess of females for the two parishes, 5 The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 14 years :— Poplar.

The Hammersmith Vestry urged that the information being of a public character and acquired in the public interest from public records ought to be supplied free of such charge, and suggested that representations to that effect should be made by the Board to the Registrar General; This course was adopted by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee. The Registrar General replied that the information is already furnished to the several Local Authorities by the registrars of births and deaths ; it would therefore be possible for the Vestries and Local Boards to obtain from each other the particulars of deaths which occur in districts other than those to which they belong. Such a process would doubtless involve difficulty and delay, so for the convenience of the Local Authorities, the Registrar General has consented to their employing a Clerk in the General Register Office to prepare returns for them during non-official hours. 8 9 TABLE I.

Notifications and Hospital Accommodation, Outworkers, and Port Sanitary Authorities' Notifications. There were 558 notifications of infectious diseases in Poplar and 670 in Bromley ; these do not include 38 second notifications. The notification rate per iooo living being : — 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. Poplar 10.6 13-6 11.3 (A) 11.49 (B) 11.37 (A) 9.57 (B) 9.36 Bromley 12.9 11.9 13.8 (A) 14.50 (b) 14.19 (a) 9.61 (b) 9.25 Of the 558 patients notified in Poplar 195 were removed to hospitals, and of the 670 in Bromley, 291 were isolated. Twenty-three patients removed to the Metropolitan Asylums Boards' Hospitals, were returned home, after being detained in the hospitals some days certified as not suffering from the complaint notified or any other notifiable disease. These 23 notifications have not been deducted from the totals. During the year no difficulty was experienced in the removal of patients, for there was no want of accommodation at the Metropolitan Asylums Boards' Hospitals. One case of scarlet fever and one of erysipelas were connected with milk shops in Bromley. The London County Council was communicated with and the sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected. Eight outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified, 2 in Poplar and 6 in Bromley. The usual notices were served. At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee on the 28th October, 2 3 the Committee considered the suggestion of the Battersea Vestry that the Sanitary Authorities of Districts in which the factories of firms employing " outworkers" are situated should advise the authorities of districts in which such " outworkers " reside of their addresses, so that proper sanitary inspection of all places where clothing is made may take place. The Committee recommended the Board to approve the proposed interchange of information with regard to "outworkers." At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee, held on the 28th April, the Committee considered a circular letter of the Marylebone Vestry which communication proposed an elaboration of the definition of puerperal fever, for notification under the Public Health (London) Act. The Committee were advised that the words "puerperal fever" covered the diseases referred to in the letter and they recommended that the Board discharge the reference. On account of a decision given by a magistrate against the Bethna Green Vestry, proceedings were taken against a medical practitioner who failed to notify a case of puerperal peritonitis. This authority supported by eleven other sanitary authorities, wrote to the London County Council to add certain diseases under the head of puerperal fever to the list of notifiable complaints named in Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Public Health Committee of the London County Council addressed a letter to Sir Samuel Wilks, Bart., M.D., F.R.S., President of the Royal College of Physicians, and asked him whether in his opinion the various diseases in question are included in the " puerperal fever " and notifiable as such. Sir Samuel Wilks was good enough to lay the letter before a Committee of the Royal College who devoted very careful attention to the matter, and unanimously passed the following resolution ;— 24 "That this Committee is of opinion, that, with a view to the limitation of dangerous infectious diseases the London County Council would be acting rightly in adopting the view that the expression 'puerperal fever' as contained in Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, should betaken to include septicaemia, pyaemia, septic peritonitis, septic metritis, and other acute septic inflammations in the pelvis occuring as the direct result of childbirth." In forwarding this resolution for the information of the Council Sir Samuel Wilks added that he entirely approved of it. The Public Health Committee of the London County Council expressed their opinion that it was unfortunate the Vestry did not appeal against the magistrate's decision. Dr. W. J. R. Simpson was appointed by the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to conduct investigations on their behalf into " Return " cases of scarlet fever and diphtheria that may be reported during the six months which commenced on the 1st October. Dr. Simpson was instructed to conduct his investigations with the full knowledge and concurrence of, and as far as might be practicable in conjunction with the respective District Medical Officers of HealthThe Asylums Boards' Medical Superintendents received instructions to place themselves in communication with the respective Medical Officers of Health, as well as with Dr. Simpson, immediately upon any alleged " Return " cases being brought to their notice. During the year best endeavours were made with the medical practitioners after receiving a notification of an infectious disease, to keep the patient (if a scholar) and the children in the house from returning to school until at least a month had elapsed ; premises not being considered free from infection and ready for disinfection until after such a period. The Sanitary Committee on the 8th September considered the 25 reference of the proposal before the London County Council to establish a laboratory, or make such other arrangements as would enable medical officers of health and medical practitioners in London, to obtain the examination of pathological matter by a competent bacteriologist at the expense of the County. The Committee recommended that the suggestion be approved by the Board. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT. The following figures give the number of premises disinfected, and the number of times the Board's apparatus was used for the two parishes, some thousands of articles being disinfected:— Private premises. Board's apparatus. Poplar 401 342 Bromley 499 444 900 786 The bath in connection with the disinfecting house as mentioned in my last annual report has been erected. This bath has not only been used by the disinfectors but also by the men engaged at the Dust Destructor. Another bath is now being built for the last named men. The Equifex Drying apparatus has been fitted to the steam disinfector at the Board's depot, Glaucus Street; with this arrangement bedding, clothes, &c., are dried more quickly and the steam prevented from escaping into the disinfecting house thus protecting health of the men. The cradle has been adapted to allow of moveable wooden shelves being used in order to prevent articles being packed upon one another. The steam in the disinfecting process and the hot air in the drying can now freely circulate around beds, &c., thereby disinfection is more speedily effected. 26 One side of the cradle has been made to drop down by working upon a hinge, so that the risk of tearing heavy beds whilst lifting them in and out of the cradle is lessened. The seats of the disinfecting vans are now being altered in order to give some protection to the men from wind and weather. The inside of the van for infected articles is being lined with zinc. The 40 per cent, solution of formic aldehyde gas (six ounces in one gallon of water) is now used throughout the Poplar and Bromley parishes for disinfecting rooms by spraying over the floors, walls and ceilings. The burning of sulphur for disinfecting purposes has ceased. SMALL POX. Two cases of small pox were notified in the Isle of Dogs and two cases were reported in Bromley. At the request of the medical practitioner I examined the children, and, with great deference to the opinions of two medical practitioners, I considered that the two children were not suffering from small pox, but from a bad attack of chicken pox. With respect to the Bromley patients, the children were very ill, and from the appearance of a rash then out upon their bodies they were removed as suspicious cases to the South Wharf tor isolation purposes and detained for five days, the cases eventually developing to scarlet fever. The clerk of the Metropolitan Asylum's Board was communicated with in order to know if, with suspicious cases of small pox, the South Wharf is available for isolation purposes without notifying cases as small pox. The answer received was " that suspected cases of small pox cannot be isolated at South Wharf unless they are notified as small pox." Mr. Hitchins, the vaccination officer, has kindly furnished me with the following statistics, which are copied from those forwarded to the Local Government Board:— 27 1896.—January to December.

As already stated in this report, best endeavours are always made to keep children away from school for at least one month after notification of diphtheria. Whilst writing this report the Board has, after considering a report upon the subject, authorised a supply of diagnosis boxes containing sterilised outfits to medical practitioners, for use in doubtful cases of diphtheria and typhoid fever For number of deaths and death-rates from diphtheria, see Tables I., II., III., IV. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898.

In Bromley were registered 71 deaths under five years of age and two over that period of life; nine of the deaths under and one death over five years of age did not belong to the parish, so that the deaths from whooping cough belonging to Bromley were 63 in number, 62 under and one over five years of age. 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898.

Two deaths over five years of age were registered in outlying institutions, making a total of 15 deaths for the Poplar parish. Thirteen deaths also happened from the same disease in Bromley, three under and 10 over five years of age. MEASLES. Thirty-three deaths from measles happened in Poplar and one death in an outlying institution, making a total of 34 deaths, 32 of which were of children under five years. In Bromley 58 deaths were registered, six of these deaths occurring in the Sick Asylum and one in the Stepney Union Workhouse; but as six of the 58 deaths did not belong to the parish and there was notified one death from an outlying institution, the total deaths from measles belonging to Bromley will be 53, and of this number 52 were under and one over five years of age. 33 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898.

At the end of the year on account of the number of absences in the Infants' department of the Upper North Street Board School, either through the scholars suffering from measles or from the complaint being in their homes, I communicated with the London School Board, and their Medical Officer advised the School Management Committee to close the Infants' department, which was accordingly done and the schoolrooms disinfected. In the letter sent to the School Board, attention was called to the want of adequate ventilation to the class-rooms, and to the bad position of the infants' cloak rooms, which are too near the class-rooms, and may cause infection to spread (if there should be an unknown infectious disease) from the clothing hanging up. When reporting to the Sanitary Committee upon measles it was pointed out that children who were excluded from a Board School either suffering from or on account of any infectious disease were deprived of their marks and the chance of winning medals, which is manifestly a gross injustice. The Committee recommended that a communication be sent to the School Board for London suggesting that where children are excluded from school through illness or in connection therewith, they should not be deprived of attendance marks. DIARRHA. Fifty-seven deaths from diarrhoea with nine from outlying institutions belonging to the Poplar parish, give a total of 66 deaths, 62 C 34 of which occurred in children under five years. In BromRey 12r deaths happened, two of which were of non-residents, and five deaths were reported from outlying institutions, so that 124 deaths belong to Bromley, and of these 117 were of children under five years of age. For death rates see Tables III. and IV., page 12.* Deaths from diarrœa for the past six years were as follows:— 1893. 1894. 1895. 1896. 1897. 1898. Poplar 54 20 52 61 46 66 Bromley 83 29 56 72 68 124 Totals 137 49 108 133 114 190 London 3446 1780 3600 3223 4104 4376 The extraordinary and persistent high temperature no doubt caused diarrhoea to prevail. It has been shown that when the earth four feet from the surface reaches a temperature of 56 degs. Fahr , and so long as this temperature is maintained the epidemic prevalence of diarrhoea continues and commonly reaches its highest point about the same time as the four feet earth temperature. It therefore behoves every person to prevent pollution of the surface of the soil with organic refuse matter and sewage. It is as well to state that according to Klein the probable cause of diarrhoea is largely to be found in horse dung which is pulverised and blown about generally; hence the necessity of keeping the streets well scavenged and watered. Two cases of cholera (simple) were notified in the Poplar parish. One patient, aged 12 years, had been eating "hokey-pokey" and fruit, this case recovered; the other patient was a woman aged 45 * Deaths from simple cholera are included in these tables. 35 years, she was a weakly person and died in 48 hours, she had lately come from the country and her child had had diarrhoea Three deaths in all from simple cholera occured in Poplar, and two in Bromley; one death was notified from an outlying institution belonging to Bromley, so that six parishioners died from the malady.

In consequence of this short supply, the district was placarded by the Board with bills as to the hours the water was on in each particular street. Stand pipes were fixed during the day at all available points. For watering the roads and flushing gullies in Poplar, water was obtained from the East India Docks ; permanganate of potash being mixed with it. The schools were inspected to see that the latrines were kept in sanitary condition. 39 Disinfectants were freely distributed, and two depots were opened, one in Bromley another at Millwall, so that with the Board's offices (the usual place of supply), three depots for the distribution of disinfectants were kept going. The Water Company supplied the Board with water jars to deliver among the poor so that water might be stored. In order to draw water from the sub-soil, the experiment was tried at the Bromley depot and the Recreation Ground, by driving iron tubes through the ground until the water bearing stratum was reached and fixing a pump to the upper end of the tube, and making what is popularly known as " Abyssinian tube wells." The water at the Bromley depot could not be used as it had a most offensive smell, and the tubes were withdrawn. The water from the Recreation Ground was clear and bright. There is no doubt that by sinking a number of these tube wells in this riparian district which contains underground springs, a large supply of water could be obtained in an emergency. Dr. Thresh, in his book on " Water Supplies," states, " In suitable localities these tube wells answer admirably, and not only are cheaper to sink, but yield a safer supply of water than a sunk well." He goes on to state, " Whatever the depth of the tube well* an ordinary pump will raise the water, provided the water level in the tube is within 25 feet of the surface." Whilst this report is being written, on Tuesday, 21st February, Mr. Chaplin, in introducing a Government Bill to give facilities for the inter-communication of the metroplitan water companies' mains, * Abyssinian tube wells are most suitable for gravel,—such as the subsoil of the major portions of Bromley and North Poplar,—coarse sand, chalk, and similar porous water-bearing strata, and for depths not exceeding 40 to 50 feet, though under exceptional circumstances tubes have been driven successfully to a depth of 150 feet. Of course these tube wells cannot be driven through rock, and they are not suitable for obtaining water from marl, fine sand, or clay formations,—such as the subsoil of the Isle of Dogs,—since the apertures in the perforated terminal tube are liable to become blocked by the fine particles of which such strata are composed. 40 gave an outline of its provisions. The metropolitan water companies under the direction of the Local Government Board are within a certain time to submit schemes for the construction of the works necessary to carry out inter-communication between their mains, and it is provided that in the case of an emergency the companies are to supply "at a reasonable cost, and to such extent and during such periods as the Board may direct, such water as may be required for the need of any other metropolitan water company and as may be available after satisfying the requirements of their own districts." HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACT, 1890. On a complaint received from the Poplar Vestry, an exhaustive inspection was made and a full report presented to the Sanitary Committee respecting the houses in Burford's Court, Tucker's Court, Dingle Court, Dingle Lane, and Silver Lion Court. I considered the areas formed by the above houses and certain adjacent premises, with the exception of Silver Lion Court, formed " unhealthy areas." The Sanitary Committee inspected the houses in these areas and agreed with the report The report in due course was presented to the Board, and later on a representation under part I. of the Act was made to the London County Council. The houses in Silver Lion Court were put into repair by the owner. Extract from Minutes of Proceedings at a meeting of the London County Council, Field 29th day of November, 1898. Report of the Housing of the Working Classes Committee, 23rd November, 1898. " We are therefore strongly of opinion that all clearances involving " re-housing should be done at the sole cost of the Council. " The recommendations which we have to make upon the above " considerations are :— 41 " (A) That housing accommodation should be provided for a number of persons " equal to that of the working classes displaced by any scheme under the Housing " of the Working Classes Act, 1890, or under the provisions of any improvement " Act, but not necessarily in the immediate neighbourhood of the displacement, " due consideration being given to the needs of those living on any particular " area. Amended and adopted. " (b) That all clearances under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, " which involve re-housing, be done at the sole cost of the Council." Adopted. HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. A letter dated 1 st July having been received from the London County Council asking what steps had been taken for the enforcement of by-laws relating to houses let in lodgings, the communication was referred to the Sanitary Committee, The letter, moreover, expressed the Council's view that the rent of tenements which exempts the houses in the district from being subject to the by-laws is so low as to militate against their usefulness, and suggested that the Board should consider the desirability of amending the exempting clauses. In the Poplar district, as the bye-law now stands, exempted unfurnished houses are at a rate of 3s. per week or upwards, and furnished houses at a rate of 4s. per week and upwards. On the 8th September I presented a report upon the whole subject to the Sanitary Committee, and the Committee deferred consideration of the matter for three months. At the time of writing this annual report my report of the 8th September is again before the Committee. BAKEHOUSES. During the year the bakehouses were twice inspected by Mr. Raymond, the Inspector of Nuisances in factories and workshops, and the notices as to limewhiting, &c., were served in those cases considered necessary. See Inspector's Report, page 87. 42 SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND COWHOUSES.* Fifteen slaughter-houses (nine in Poplar and six in Bromley), and 12 cow-houscs (five in Poplar and seven in Bromley), were inspected upon receiving notices from the owners of their intention to apply for the renewal of their licenses to the Landon County Council. In no instance was the Board advised to oppose the license. The Sanitary Committee, at their meeting held 24th November, considered the communications from the London Chamber of merce (meat and cattle trade section) and the London Butchers Trade Society in opposition to the scheme of the Public Health Committee of the London County Council, proposing the abolition of private slaughter-houses in London and the establishment of public abattoirs, and the Committee recommended the Board not to approve the proposal, but to express the opinion that a proper system of inspection, and the marking of meat, would be sufficient. Extract from Minutes of Proceedings at a meeting of the Londot\ County Council, held 31st day of January, 1899. " Adjourned Report of the Public Health Committee. The Council considered the following recommendations in the report brought up on 4th October:— Meat inspection and public slaughter-houses. (a) That in the opinion of the Council it is desirable that as a first step towards ensuring the proper inspection of meat private slaughter-houses should cease to exist in London, and that butchers should in substitution be afforded such facilities as are necessary for the killing of animals in public slaughter-houses to be erected by the Council. Motton carried to procedd to next business. (b) That a copy of this report, and of the Council's resolutions thereon, be sent to the Local Government Board, with an inlimation that the Council is prepared * See page 6, under heading of Tubercular Diseases. 43 to accept such responsibilities as may be necessary to give effect in London to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on tuberculosis, and that the Board be asked whether they will include in any legislation introduced by them in connection with the Royal Commission's report the provisions which would be necessary for this purpose. Further consideration of the motion—That recommendation (a) be adopted. The Vice-Chairman of the Committee requested leave to withdraw the motion. Leave refused. Amendment moved by Mr. Porter, seconded by Mr. C. H. Campbell—That the erection of public slaughter-houses ought not to be undertaken by the Council before an efficient inspection and examination of milk has been provided for, since, in the opinion of the Royal Commission on tuberculosis, no doubt the largest part of the tuberculosis which man obtains through his food is by means of milk containing tuberculous matter. After debate— Moved by Mr. Torrance, seconded by Mr. Crooks—That the Council do proceed to the next business. Motion to proceed to the next business put and declared to be carried. Resolved accordingly. (b) The Chairman ruled that having regard to the decision of the Council on recommendation (a) no motion could be made for the adoption of recommendation (b)." From the report of the Royal Commission appointed to inquire into the administrative procedures for controlling danger to man through the use as food of the meat and milk of tuberculous animals. Presented to Parliament in the year 1898. On page 2 it is stated :— 44 " 11. We have had before us the unanimous finding of the Royal Commission on tuberculosis, which reported in 1895 to the effect that tuberculous disease in bovine and other animals is identical with that in the human subject, and that it is communicable from one to the other, though the manifestation of the disease differs in some respects in the human subject from that in the lower animals. We have also considered their finding that " Any person who takes tuberculous matter into the body as food incurs risk of acquiring tuberculous disease." Nothing that has come before us in the course of our inquiry has raised any doubt in our minds as to the accuracy of this opinion. At the same time we think that there has been a tendency in some minds to exaggerate the extent of the risk arising from meat." On page 12 the Commission reports :— Milk Supply. " 36. Whatever degree of danger may be incurred by the consump tion of the flesh of tuberculous animals (and we have already stated our belief that the tendency in this country has been rather to exaggerate this than to underrate it), there can be little doubt that the corresponding danger in respect of milk supply is a far greater one." " On this point the opinion of the previous Royal Commission on tuberculosis was emphatic. " No doubt the largest part of the tuberculosis which man obtains through his food is by means of milk containing tuberculous matter." " In Great Britain and Ireland meat, as a rule, is cooked before it is eaten, to an extent which goes largely to destroy infective matter. Milk, on the other hand, is largely consumed in a raw state, especially by children, and there exists a general distaste for cooked milk as a beverage. Among most continental nations the practice is to some extent the opposite of this, and large quantities of meat, especially in the various forms of sausages are consumed absolutely 45 raw, while the greater proportion of the milk is cooked before consumption. It has been proved over and over again that milk from tuberculous udders, and even milk which has been purposely contaminated with tuberculous matter, can be rendered perjectly harmless by being boiled for one minute,* a method of sterilization which we agree with the former Commission in preferring for general application to any of the other plans which have been employed." On page 17 the commission reports:— "The views of Professor Bang on bovine tuberculosis are, briefly, that it is due to the ease with which the infection imy spread by air, water, and food, owing to the common life of healthy and unhealthy animals when in confined badly ventilated sheds." It is most important to bear in mind that like conditions apply to human beings. Whilst this report is being written, Mr. Chaplin in the House of Commons stated in answer to Mr. Channing, that he had now come to a decision as to the portions of the recommendations of the Commission on Tuberculosis which ought to be carried out without delay, and especially as to the recommendations referring to the purity of milk. He was aware that a considerable number of town councils and other local authorities were bringing in bills to extend their powers for dealing with the purity of milk. He had considered the resolutions passed by the British Dairy Farmers' Association, and by the Central and Associated Chambers of Agriculture to the effect that there should be a general Act passed dealing uniformly with this question, but he doubted if a general bill was required to secure better protection from infection. He proposed to issue an order extending the definition of Diseases in the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885 so as to include in the case of a cow such disease of the udder * The text does not appear in italics in the report of the Royal Commission. 46 as should be certified by a veterinary surgeon to be tubercular. This would have the effect of prohibiting the milk from such cows from being mixed with other milk and sold for consumption. FOOD AND DRUGS. On the 24th March the Committee considered the several communications referred to them on the subject of the Sale of Food and Drugs Bill of last Session, and recommended, as suggested by the St. Giles District Board, that a communication be addressed to the Local Government Board urging that the Bill should be so amended as to bring it into line with the recommendations contained in the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons, presented on the 9th April, 1896. On the 26th June the Committee considered the reference to them of the resolution of Stoke Newington Vestry, as to delay arising in analysing samples of milk, &c., at Somerset House, and recommended that the reference be discharged. On the 28th July the Committee recommended that the Board support the proposal of Stoke Newington Vestry in favour of an amendment of the Food and Drugs Act, providing that the vendor of a sample of milk, within 48 hours after receipt of notice that it is adulterated, may require that an analysis be made by the chemical officers at Somerset House. On the 8th September the Committee considered the reference to them of the proposal for bacteriological analysis of ice cream samples, and they recommended that six samples of ice creams be obtained and submitted to ordinary analysis by the Public Analyst as to the wholesomeness of the article, and that the Local Government Board be urged to take steps to secure the proper registration of itinerant ice cream vendors. 47 The samples analysed were found to consist of milk, sugar, starch, and water. On the 8th September the Committee considered the reference of the circular letter from the Clerkenwell Vestry giving result of proceedings against a milk vendor for adulteration, showing that a retailer who gets a warranty is protected, whilst the farmer giving the warranty cannot be reached; and they recommended that the application of the Vestry to the Local Government Board urging legislation on the matter be supported. On the 22nd September the Committee considered the resolutions of the Camberwell Vestry on the subject of condensed separated milk:— (a) "That the Government be asked to at once introduce a short Bill into Parliament, requiring that persons manufacturing or importing condensed milk should state in plain language on the outside of each tin what quantity of the milk contained in the tin it would be necessary to use to obtain the full benefits desirable from a pint of new Engiish milk." (b) "And that posters and bills be printed and circulated throughout the District, and that the Registrar of Births be asked to hand to each person on registering a birth a handbill intimating the above information." The Committee recommended that the Board support paragraph (a) of the above proposals. On the 28th October the Committee considered the letter from St. Olave's District Board of Works, that they had communicated with the Local Government Board, urging that in any future Act that may be passed, dealing with the adulteration of food, a provision should be inserted requiring that all receptacles out of which milk other than 48 genuine unaltered milk is sold, should be specially distinguished by means of shape, colouring, or otherwise.

After the conclusions in Dr. Houston's report, I again inspected the mudfield, together with Mr. Duckham the Engineer to the Dock Company and Dr. Talbot Medical Officer of Health for Bow. It was suggested that trees and a hedge be planted along the bank of the mudfield at the rear of the houses in Stebondale Street, and the mud in future be deposited as far away as possible from these dwellings, and that vegetation of some kind be cultivated. Later on steps were taken by the Dock Company to afford means of drainage and two sumps were sunk. During the drought it was found that the water in certain portions of the ditches on the Island had dried up, the penstock in the Deptford Ferry Road having been closed for a considerable period. The ditches (which are practically sewers) required cleansing, more especially the London County Council's portion. The Committee directed me to take such steps as I considered necessary to abate the nuisance. Mr. Bussey, the Chairman of the Board, at my request kindly in. spected the ditches with me whilst they were being cleansed by the men employed by the London County Council. It was seen that the cause of the water which drained from the allotments and the mudfield remaining stagnant in the ditches at the rear of the houses in Stebondale Street was due to the fact that the ditch has no proper fall to the sewer in Stebondale Street, so that under these circumstances with the object of keeping the water running and constantly flushing out the stagnant water; it was deemed most advisable to re open the penstock in the Deptford Ferry Road. In order to abolish these ditches and to obviate the necessity of the water from the River 49 Thames continually flowing over the land, now the penstock had to remain always open, the Committee's attention was called to the advisability of draining by a sewer the East Ferry Road from the Deptford Ferry Road to the East Ferry Road. There really is no known necessity for the existence of the ditch, but of course the site would belong to the Board. It was suggested that the London County Council be asked to endeavour to remedy the ill effects from the want of a proper fall to their ditch at the rear of Stebondale Street. REMOVAL OF STABLE REFUSE AND PEAT LITTER. At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee, held on 27th January, the Committee considered the proposal of the London County Council to seek an amendment of section 36 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, such section empowering a Sanitary Authority to employ or contract with scavengers for collecting and removing the manure and other refuse matter from any stables and cow-houses the occupiers of which signified their consent in writing to such removal. The proposed amendment was to give to each Sanitary Authority power to charge for the removal of manure; and the Committee recommended that the Board agree to the suggested amendment. On the 28th July, the Committee considered the reference of the enquiry of the London County Council as to nuisance from peat litter, and recommended the Board to approve of the suggestion that the Council should include peat litter within the provisions of its bylaws under section 16 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prescribing the hours of removal of offensive matter throughout London, and the construction of the carriage conveying such matter. FISH OFFAL. The Committee during the past year have had their attention largely engaged in the consideration of several reports as to the D 50 collection and removal of offal from fishmongers' shops, and its deposit, after removal, not only from such premises in the district but from others in the metropolis, at a private depot in Bromley previous to its being taken away in barges. The Committee also enquired into the circumstances as to the complaint from residents at Millwall relative to the nuisance due to the removal of fish offal. In this last instance the offensive odour emanating from such offal was no doubt increased by the want of daily removal. The nuisance at the depot arose from the shooting into a shed of the offal from the vans (when they were used) in order that this offensive matter might be put into the tanks, which when filled, were slung on to the barges. It was reported that when tanks with air-tight lids were used for the collection of the offal and returned to the depot full they were slung, without disturbing their contents or removing the lids, on to the barges and no nuisance arose. But when partly filled tanks were returned to the depot difficulty arose, as the tanks had to be made up from other tanks or from the vans, before being put on to the barges. In the course of enquiry it was stated that the fishmongers did not always deliver the offal to the collector when he called, but kept it two or three days, hence the tanks returned to the dep6t partly filled. The Committee fully realised that fish offal is "an unknown quantity," and for the sake of public health the sooner it was removed from shops the better, and if fishmongers were to get rid of it themselves it was obvious serious nuisances might be caused, and in order that the offal might be delivered up when comparatively fresh 51 the Committee directed that notices for daily removal should be served throughout the district under section 36 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. This section ought to be enforced throughout the metropolis by the local authorities, so that the inhabitants of a parish in which a depot is situated may not be liable to be inconvenienced. In order to diminish the quantity of condemned fish from the Shadwell Market coming into the district and being shot in the Blomfield Street depot, where it is loaded into tanks and a nuisance created, the Committee directed that the Shadwell Market authorities be written to, suggesting that the same practice be adopted at Shadwell as at Billingsgate, viz., that all condemned fish be put into a barge, which is kept alongside for the purpose and sent away direct. The Clerk communicated with the Fishmongers' Company, and it was arranged that the "offal" should in future be taken to Billingsgate and barged away. On account of the continued nuisance to the neighbourhood surrounding the Belvedere Fish Guano Depot in Bloomfield Street, through the shooting of the fish offal and allowing the same to remain at this dep6t for days instead of being instantly removed, a summons was applied for, and the Company agreed to a forthwith "prohibitory order" being made. Latter on summonses had to be applied for against the Company for infringing the magistrate's order. The plea of the Company was disorganisation of the river traffic on account of fog. Nominal penalties were inflicted. A nuisance in the warm weather must happen when the receptacles used for storing on the premises are emptied at collection times in the streets into the vans or tanks. The Committee thought that all nuisance would be abated if, instead of emptying the receptacles at the street doors they were removed direct to the factory or depot with their lids properly fixed, 52 It was felt that the following words in bye-law 5 of the bye-laws made by the London County Council, under Section 16 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, prohibit the emptying in the streets into the vans or tanks the offensive matter from the receptacles the lids of which ought not to be removed. "(5) Every person who shall convey any . . . trade . . . refuse across or along any footway, pavement, or carriage way shall use a suitable receptacle . . . and in the case of offensive refuse so covered as to prevent any nuisance therefrom . . ." Whilst this report is being written the Committee has under consideration estimates of the cost of removal and disposal of fish offal and other offensive trade refuse by the Board. Fishmongers, butchers and others are being written to, and they are having pointed out the requirements of the London County Council bye-laws as to any nuisance arising during removal of refuse, and an enquiry is being made as to whether they will be prepared to pay the expenses involved in the provision of properly closed air-tight receptacles and their daily removal by the Board. SEWER EMANATIONS. At the meeting of the Sanitary Committee, held the 27th day of January, the Committee considered the suggestion of the Vestry of St. Mary Abbott, Kensington, that the London County Council should instruct their Engineer to convene a conference of the Surveyors and Medical Officers of Health in the metropolis to discuss the subject of sewer emanations and the general question of metropolitan sewer ventilation, and the Committee recommended the Board to approve the suggestion and that the Council be so informed. The following is a copy of the report from the Chief Engineer of the London County Council:— 53 LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. ventilation of sewers. Report by Engineer as to the result of a conference of Engineers and Surveyors of the several Vestries and District Boards of the Metropolis. To the Main Drainage Committee. In accordance with the instructions of the Committee I issued two circular letters to the engineers and surveyors of the various vestries and district boards in the county, inviting them to a conference on the subject of the ventilation of sewers, with a view to some uniform system being adopted, if possible, for dealing with complaints of offensive emanations from gratings connected with both local and main sewers. In response to the invitation a meeting was held at the County Hall on Friday, 25th February, at which upwards of 40 of the gentlemen invited were present. A list of those who signed the attendance book, together with the names of the districts represented by them, is appended hereto. The discussion on the subject of the ventilation of sewers occupied a period of over two hours, and resulted in the following resolutions being passed, namely:— 1. That the closing of sewer ventilators in response to complaints increases the general evil, the diminution of which is to be attained by the multiplication of the ventilators at regular frequent intervals. 2. That in connection with any interceptor hereafter fixed on a main house drain it is advisable to carry up a ventilating pipe from the sewer side of the interceptor, up the front, side, or back of the house, to the satisfaction of the local sanitary 54 authority, and that the outlet drain from the interceptor shall not be flap-trapped in sewer, unless required by the local sanitary authority. 3. That pipe ventilators up buildings, or otherwise where possible, should always be adopted, in addition to surface ventilation. It will be observed that the general result of the conference has confirmed the action of the committee and the Council in recent years, and that the remedy for sewer emanations is to be looked for from the maintenance of more frequent ventilating openings, both at the street level and by means of pipes carried up houses and other buildings. I would suggest that, as the meeting was a very representative one, this report be printed, and that copies be sent to each member of the Council and to the engineers and surveyors of the district boards and vestries in the metropolis. Spring Gardens, S.W., 24th March, 1898. Alex. R. Binnie, Chief Engineer. SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. Owing to the coal strike in Wales, numerous firms were unable to obtain smokeless coal, and consequently there was more smoke than usual emitted, but as the 23rd section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, does not mention kind of fuel, but enacts, that "Every furnace . . . shall be constructed so as to consume or burn the smoke arising from such furnace," the Committee directed that proceedings be taken in the worst cases. See page 57 Result of legal proceedings. During the coal strike, the Westminster Vestry wrote to the Board 55 that the Vestry had addressed a communication to the Court of Common Council urging them, as the port sanitary authority, to cause effective proceedings to be taken without delay to suppress the smoke nuisance arising from Thames steamboats; the Committee recommended that a similar communication be made by the Board. At a meeting of the Sanitary Committee, held 27th January, the Committee recommended the Board to agree to the suggestion of the Vestry of the parish of St. Margaret and St. John, Westminster, that access should be afforded to the officers of the Local Sanitary Authorities to barracks, post offices, military hospitals, factories, and other Government institutions, as well in reference to cases of dangerous infectious disease as to water supply, drainage, w.c. accommodation and sanitary conditions generally, with the object of obtaining a systematic co-operation between the Departments having control of the Government buildings and the Sanitary Authorities. In the reply received from the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Works it was stated, "They cannot, however, abandon the right of exemption claimed by the Government to control absolutely the buildings in charge of the Government." The letter went on to state that Her Majesty's Office of Works would be glad to be informed of any specific cases where insanitary conditions are said to prevail. There was a nuisance complained of in the neighbourhood of the Bromley Gas Works with respect to the mechanical coal grabber. The premises were visited and the apparatus inspected, and the manager gave his assurance that the "grabber" should be so worked as to prevent a recurrence of the nuisance—viz., coal dust being scattered in all directions. 56 Where w.c. pans and traps had been fixed without notice to the Clerk, under clause 14 of the London County Council bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the Sanitary Committee in every case brought under their notice directed that the builder be written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise he would be prosecuted for infringing the bye-law. During the year 14 cases were brought under the notice of the Committee. In five of the above instances pans and traps not in accordance with the London County Council bye-law had been fixed. The builders were written to and the ground opened; in four out of the 14 cases reported, when the ground was opened, the drains were found defective. The importance of the bye-law is paramount. Under Section 48 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, certificates were authorised to be signed that there were proper and sufficient water supplies at the following newly erected premises:—64 and 66, Pennyfields; 26, Bow Road; 27, 29, and 31, Chrisp Street; 25, Brunswick Street; 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35, Lochnagar Street; 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28, Ailsa Street. Two houses in Chapelhouse Street; "East India Arms," High Street; 167, St. Leonard's Road; 34, Bright Street; "The Royal Oak" (b.-h.), St. Leonard's Street; 110, High Street, Poplar; 54, 56, 58, and 60, Bow Common Lane, 3, to 24, west side of Cottage Street. Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting 18 cases of overcrowding:—1 in Bromley and 17 in Poplar, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served. 40 cases of overcrowding, 22 in Poplar, and 18 in Bromley were abated upon service of intimations. 57 List of Sanitary Works carried out in the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley, from the 1st January, 1898, to 31st December, 1898.

Whilst writing this report, the Staff Committee has under consideration the following recommendation of the Committee as amended by the Board and referred back, viz.:— "That an additional permanent Sanitary Inspector be appointed on the same terms as the last appointed Inspectors and that the sanction of the Local Government Board be asked to the appointment, also that the areas over which the various Inspectors have control be considered by the Sanitary Committee and reapportioned accordingly."* I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, FREDERICK WILLIAM ALEXANDER, Diplomate Public Health (England), Medical Officer of Health, Poplar and Bromley, Public Health Department, Offices of the Board, 117, High Street, Poplar, 31st March, 1899. * The Board at its meeting on the 28th March, 1899, upon the recommendation of the Staff Committee resolved:—That a lady Sanitary Inspector be appointed, to aid in the duties performed by the Sanitary Inspectors already in the service of the Board, particularly in the inspection of factories where female labour is employed, and in the purchase of samples of foods and drugs for analysis (the actual duties to be settled by the Sanitary Committee) . . .; and that the consent of the Local Government Board be asked to the appointment. There is no doubt that the appointment of such an officer will be an acquisition 63 to the district, so far as female labour is concerned, but a lady Inspector will not benefit the parishes of Poplar and Bromley in regard to house-to-house inspection. I have stated twice to the Board during my period of office the number of houses (approximately) each Inspector has in his district, and I have pointed out that an Inspector ought to have no more than 2500 premises to look after. The following figures show the number of houses (approximately) each Sanitary Inspector has in his district:— Poplar, North 5036 Bromley, North 4322 ,, South (very large area) 2808 ,, South 5000 Total 7844 Total 9322 North Poplar, the poorest sub-division, with its 5036 premises undoubtedly requires another inspector. There is always a large amount of sanitary work constantly on hand, and builders must be kept waiting as the one inspector cannot possibly be at every job immediately he is required, because he must necessarily be delayed on account of unforeseen exigencies occurring when work is about to be passed. North Poplar in its present condition in my opinion is much too large an area for one inspector. 64 December 31st, 1898. To the Medical Officer of Health. Poplar and Bromley.

At your special request a summons was taken out by me against the owner of No. 16 Whitethorn Street, for having failed to comply with written "Intimation" served by my colleague Mr. F. J. Anthony, Sanitary Inspector, North Bromley Division, he being away on his annual holiday at the time; the nuisance being urgent, caused by the drains being choked. Owner's son, who had charge of the repairs, considered there was no need to execute the work until served with a notice. Proceedings were taken under the 12th section Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and I appeared in the case as a private individual. Magistrate made a four days abatement order, granted £2 10s. costs. These proceedings were taken in consequence of the indifference shown by not remedying the nuisance complained of, and to save delay of waiting for the meeting of the Sanitary Committee. On the 19th September last I was summoned to attend at the 76 Thames Police Court to show cause why the orders made on 9th December, 1897 and 29th April, 1898, respectively, closing the premises Nos. 14, 16 and 24 Broomfield Street as unfit for human habitation, should not be rescinded. On your visiting the premises, you found that the works necessary to render the premises fit for human habitation had been executed to your satisfaction. I therefore, by your direction, attended at the Court, and in response to the owner's application, informed the Magistrate there was no opposition, as the premises had been put into a sanitary and habitable condition. The orders were consequently rescinded. Forty-five samples of food had been procured and submitted to the public analyst for analysis; four were so adulterated that legal proceedings were ordered. The nature of articles, extent of adulteration, and result of prosecution being as follows:— Gin .. ... 46.5 degrees under proof or adulterated to the extent of 11.5 below the standard minimum strength allowed. Vendor fined £2, with £1 3s. costs. Butter ... Adulterated with 99 per cent, of foreign fat (same vendor previously cautioned when last sample was obtained, which was found to be adulterated with 97 per cent, of foreign fat), both samples were served in labelled wrappers, no labels displayed over parcels in conformity with Margarine Act. Vendor fined £1, with £1 3s. costs. Butter ... Margarine containing 1 percent. of butter(same vendor as above) proceedings taken under Margarine Act. Sample served in labelled wrapper, taken from parcel on which there was no statute label displayed. Vendor again fined £1, with £1 3s. costs 77 Milk... ... Deficient in cream to the extent of 70 per cent, and adulterated with 10 per cent, of water. Itinerant vendor summoned for the abstraction of cream. Fined £3, with £1 3s. costs. In lieu of distress, defendant appeared at Court and elected to receive sentence, 14 days' imprisonment. The market places and stalls were regularly inspected throughout the year, and I have on several occasions, on the vendors' application, examined the articles of food purchased by them at the markets, and when found unsound, had the same destroyed as trade refuse, and gave the necessary certificates to that effect, but in no instance was anything exposed for sale at the time of my visit in such a condition as to justify a seizure. Five notices of intention to apply for renewal of slaughter-house and cow-house licenses were received from my district. The premises were again forthwith inspected, and various works executed on the service of " Intimations." I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Assoc. San.

The shops, stalls, and food stores have been regularly inspected with a view to detecting diseased and unwholesome food, and in several instances parcels of fish, meat, and fruit have been destroyed, and the vendors warned. On the 28th January, a summons was heard against a Butcher in Chrisp Street (which was fully reported at the time) for exposing for sale three bullock's cheeks, the summons was dismissed on a E 82 technical point, viz.: "proof of ownership," the owner in this case living in the country. In any similar cases it will be necessary to subpoena the rate collector and shop assistant. On the 23rd December, whilst inspecting the shops and stalls in Chrisp Street, my attention was drawn to a barrow full of figs which were exposed for sale; on examining same found them very rotten and full of maggots; they were seized, and whilst they were being put into a vehicle, the vendor (who had given me a false name and address) disappeared in the crowd. The figs were taken before Mr. Dickinson, at the Thames Police Court, the following day, who said he had no hesitation in condemning them and had never seen such a bad lot before. I am pleased to mention that the seizure has had a desired effect upon that class of traders in Chrisp Street. In several cases, at the request of the vendors, I have examined consignments of fish which were purchased at the wholesale fish markets, and found the same unfit for the food of man; in each case the vendors have destroyed the fish in my presence, and I have given certificates to that effect. I have made periodical inspections throughout the year of the cow-houses and slaughter-houses in my district, and in each case found them in a sanitary condition, with good water supply, &c. The licensed slaughter-houses number 6. The „ cow-houses „ 4. It was necessary to apply for three summonses against owners for non-compliance with notices served on the under-mentioned premises with the following results:— 56, Cottage Street, forthwith Closing Order and 12s. 6d. costs. 9, Chilcot Street, 10-days Abatement Order and 27s. costs. 27, Ashton Street, 7-days Abatement Order and 25s. costs. 83 In ever8 case where new pans and traps had been found to be fixed without giving notice in writing to the Clerk of the Board (Infringement of London County Council's Bye-laws) letters were sent to the respective owners to open up the ground under the pan and trap This in each case was done and any defects found to exist, were remedied and the work passed after applying the smoke test. Cases of overcrowding at the undermentioned premises were abated without having to institute legal proceedings:— 63, East India Dock Road; 35, Woolmore Street; 48, Sussex Street; 16, Grove Villas; 89, Pekin Street; 12, South East Row; 37, Sophia Street; 204, East India Dock Road: 11, Bygrove Street; 84, Northumberland Street; 13, Castdr Street; 2, Gaselee Street; 11,Castor Street; 18, Hanbury's Buildings; 21, 1, 4, Silver Lion Court; 3, 5,Tuckers Court; 5, Dingle Court; 37, Kerbey Street; 3, 4, Dingle Lane; 18, James Place ; and Burford's Court.

During the year the marriages of 2,654 persons were registered in the Borough, giving an annual rate of 1617 per 1,000 of the estimated population, the rate for England and Wales being 16.9, and for London 19.4. The annual marriage rate per 1,000 living being Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

During the year 2,107 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 392 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1,469 in Bromley, and 246 in Bow; from the 392 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 19 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 354 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 727 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1,469 registered deaths in Bromley in a similar manner, viz., deducting 750 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 153 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 872. From the 246 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 6 nonresidents and added 251 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 491 deaths. * The rate in England and Wales in 1921 was 22.4 per 1,000 of the estimated population. 6 In dealing separately with the sub-districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II., and III., that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub-districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2,107 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 431 deaths of actual non-residents, and 414 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2,090 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 727 deaths in Poplar included 8 illegitimate children, 2 male and 6 female; the 872 deaths in Bromley included 7 illegitimate children, 7 female; the 491 Bow deaths included 3 illegitimate children, 1 male and 2 female, making a total for the Borough of 18 deaths of illegitimate children, 3 male and 15 female.

Mortality rate among infants visited was 48.1 per 1,000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough, and the rate refers to those born in 1920. In 1910 and 1911 the rates were 105.69 and 115.62, because diarrhoea was prevalent in 1911. The infantile mortality rate is based on deaths occurring in any one year and births occurring in that and the preceding year The rate of mortality amongst infants visited by Health Visitors is calculated upon births occurring in one particular year and deaths in that and the following year. The children born in 1910 and dying during 1910-11 are shown in the rate for 1910, so that the diarrhœa months June, July, August and September of 1911 affected not only the children born in 1911, but also those born in 1910 who had not yet reached one year of age, hence the higher rates amongst infants visited during the two years 1910 and 1911. 1908 Mortality rates amongst infants visited 104.19 1909 „ „ „ 98.75 1910 „ „ 105.69 1911 „ „ „ 115.62 1912 „ „ .. 90.10 1913 „ „ „ 83.0 1914 „ „ „ 117.00 1915 " 78.07 1916 „ „ 78.07 1917 „ „ „ 79.2 1918 „ „ „ 67.9 1919 „ „ ,, 69.0 1920 „ .. 48.1 9 Notification of Births Act, 1907.

The rates are calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population. * In Column 6 are included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the borough, but excluding the deaths of soldiers and sailors that have occurred in hospitals and institutions in the district. In Column 12 are entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. † "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence—e.g., casuals—are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (b) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known: and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

All "Transferable Deaths" of residents, i.e., of persons resident in the district who have died outside it, are included with the other deaths in columns 2-10, Tables VIII., IX., X. and XI., and Infantile Mortality Tables XIII., XIV., XV., and XVI. Transferable deaths of nonresidents, i.e., of persons resident elsewhere in England and Wales, who have died in the district, are in like manner excluded from these columns. For the precise meaning of the term "transferable deaths" see footnote to Table IV.

Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the " Intimations " which are followed, if necessary, by " Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are " in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. t For the Cleansing of Verminous Persons, see pages 56 and 57. 88 During the year 714 Intimation Notices were served in respect of verminous rooms, and the verminous rooms cleansed were :— East Combined Division 62 West Combined Division 76 Popiar South Division 71 Bromley North Division 50 Bromley Central Division 114 Bow East Division 66 Bow West Division 99 Housing Inspectors— Poplar 53 Bromley 76 Bow 47 714 No summonses were applied tor. A fluid insecticide is given and sprayers loaned to tenants in order to rid rooms and contents of bugs. Thirty gallons were distributed during year. RATS AND MICE DESTRUCTION. During the organised" Rat Weeks'' a large quantity of barium carbonate paste was distributed to applicants, the results being highly satisfactory. Lithographic varnish traps were also used with success. The number of complaints of the presence of rats and mice has greatly diminished. It must be added that every week is a "rat week" in Poplar, and the work of destruction proceeds, principally by the use of barium carbonate paste which is still being distributed to tenants of houses, where necessary, and is recommended for use in factories; etc. Where rats are still persistent after the use of poison the ground is opened and the drain examined as a matter of routine. Accumulations of refuse are also directed to be removed. SCHOOLS. Inspection of Schools. A special report re inspection of schools was issued to all members of the Council early in 1921.

A number of cases of overcrow ding were reported but on account of lack of housing accommodation remained unabated. No cases of overcrowding were found in workshops. General. 2,305 complaints (including 38 smoke) as to nuisances were made. 5,076 communications on general matters were despatched, and 6,518 in connection with the supply of milk. I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. May, 1922. 98 Free Milk Scheme. Mr. Dyer, Chief Clerk, reported : During the 12 months ended 31st December, 1921, 23,799 applications for free milk were received, of which 18,270 were granted. Orders for 782,012 pints of fresh and 1,236 lbs. of dried milk were issued, the total commitments amounting to approximately £14,500. An Investigation and Enquiry Officer commenced duty in March, and during the year investigated 1,611 cases. All cases where statements on the application forms were found to be incorrect were reported to the Maternity and Child Welfare Committee, who authorised Police Court proceedings against 4 applicants for obtaining, or attempting to obtain, milk under false pretences. In one case the defendant was fined and ordered to refund the value of the milk supplied, but the others were each sentenced to one month's hard labour. Proceedings were also taken against a milkman for attempting to obtain money by false pretences, and he was given six weeks' imprisonment. In 95 cases where milk was obtained upon false information repayment of value of milk supplied was ordered by the Committee. At the end of the year £176 had been so refu nded. In addition 8 cases were referred to the County Court for Court Orders for repayment to be made. 99 Report of Dr. W. C. P. Smith, Tuberculosis Officer and Assistant Medical Officer of Health for Tuberculosis Purposes, Information required by the Ministry of Health (Memo (i.) A list of dispensaries, specifying also branch dispensaries and visiting stations ; a list of the Tuberculosis Officers employed ; a statement of the numbers of other officers employed in dispensary work ; a list of residential institutions, specifying for each the number of beds normally available for patients from the area of the Local Authority, and the type of case for which these beds are used. In the case of residential institutions belonging to the Local Authority, the names of the Medical Officers and the number of other officers should be given. (1) (a) Tuberculosis Dispensary.—Alexandra House, 135, Bow Road, E. As explained in last year's report, these premises are unsuited for the purpose of physical examination of patients, owing to noisy surroundings. In other respects also the arrangement of rooms is inconvenient. The Council have purchased more suitable premises in Wellington Road, but possession cannot yet be obtained. When these premises are available and some necessary alterations can be carried out, it is understood that the work will be transferred there. (b) Proposed Branch Dispensary.—Unfortunately the proposal for a branch dispensary at 134, High Street, Poplar, has not received the sanction of the Ministry of Health. At a conference held at the Ministry of Health between representatives of the Borough Council, the L.C.C. and the Ministry, the need for such a branch was explained and was freely admitted by both the Ministry and the L.C.C., and it was made clear that it was only on grounds of economy that the necessary sanction was withheld. Tuberculosis Officer : W. C. P. Smith. Assistant Tuberculosis Officer : F. N. Moos. Other Officers :— 3 Health Visitors. 1 Dispenser. 1 Clerk. 1 Assistant Clerk. 1 Part-time Helper (female). 1 Caretaker. Residential Institutions :— (a) Sanatoria—hospitals and homes available under the L.C.C. scheme (which now includes all classes of patients, whether insured, uninsured, or ex-Service men). 100 (b) The Poor-Law Infirmary. (c) A few In-patient letters for Victoria Park or other hospitals when obtainable. (ii.) In the case of administrative counties, precise particulars of arrangements for co-operation with Sanitary Authorities and their officers. Nil. (iii.) The nature and extent of co-operation with general and special hospitals, school clinics, and other institutions. General Hospitals:—Under an agreement between the Council and the London Hospital, cases of surgical tuberculosis and certain other cases are referred to the hospital for opinion or treatment. Cases of lupus are also sent to this hospital for treatment by means of the Finsen light, on the recommendation of the Tuberculosis Officer : a fee of 5s. is charged for each treatment, and if more than twelve applications are required in any case a fresh recommendation from the Tuberculosis Officer is necessary. Owing to the difficulty of forecasting the number of applications which may be required in any given case and to the varying intervals between applications in different cases, it has proved difficult in practice to avoid breaking the continuity of the treatment in some cases pending a fresh recommendation from the Tuberculosis Officer. Special Hospitals.—No special arrangements exist except that cases in which an artificial pneumothorax has been produced may be referred to Brompton Hospital for the necessary refills at a charge of 10s. for each refill. Non-tuberculous pulmonary cases are referred generally to Victoria Park Hospital either by cards or out-patient letters. Similar cases in children are sent to one or other of the Children's Hospitals—at Shadwell and Hackney Road. School Clinics.—Cases of children of school age requiring treatment for defects of various kinds—e.g., tonsils and adenoids, aural, dental, eye trouble, etc.—are referred to the Divisional School Medical Officer, who arranges through the School Care Committees for their attendance at the appropriate school clinic. The scheme of co-operation with the School Medical Officers outlined in last year's report has been working satisfactorily. A large number of doubtful or indefinite cases have been referred to the Divisional School Medical Officer with a request that they be kept under observation for a definite period. A period of six months has been found the most convenient one to fit the arrangements of the Divisional School Medical Officer, and in the majority of cases two examinations of the child have been made at three-monthly intervals and recorded on the card which is returned to the Tuberculosis Officer when the child is due to attend the dispensary again. 101 (iv.) Any special arrangements made to secure the co-operation of medical practitioners and the working of the arrangements for periodical reports on insured patients under domiciliary treatment. Patients are constantly being referred to the dispensary by local practitioners for opinion. In many cases it is found desirable to see the patient more than once before giving a definite pronouncement on the case. A full report is sent to the practitioner concerned, giving the results of examination or observation. The arrangements for the collection of periodical reports have secured a number of these latter. (v.) The arrangements for following up patients in cases where the diagnosis is doubtful. The method of dealing with doubtful cases is that outlined in last year's report—viz., observation and re-examination—avoiding as far as possible the establishment of routine attendances for medicine. Owing to some slight lessening of pressure in this latter respect, it has been found possible to devote more time to cases of doubtful diagnosis, and especially to cases sent in by private practitioners for opinion. (vi.) The arrangements for securing the examination and systematic supervision of " home contacts." Home contacts are examined at the dispensary generally by special appointment. The arrangements are in the hands of the Health Visitors whose duty it is to secure their attendance at a convenient time. (vii.) Information as to special methods of diagnosis and treatment in use and the number of persons to whom these special methods have been applied. The X-ray apparatus is in constant use as an aid to diagnosis. It is used almost exclusively for screen work. No record of the number of cases so examined has been kept. (viii.) The results of local experience as to the relative value of each form of treatment. No special treatment has been in use. (ix.) The nature and extent of any dental treatment provided by the council for tuberculous patients. No dental treatment is provided at present by the Council. A proposal for a dental clinic similar to that provided for maternity and child welfare patients has not been approved by the Ministry of Health, presumably on the score of economy. (x.) Any arrangements for the provision of nursing or of extra nourishment for patients living at home. No special arrangements for the provision of nursing for adults and children over 10 years of age exist, but it is frequently possible to obtain such assistance in the person of a district nurse or from local nursing associations. 102 The Borough Council undertake the nursing of children up to 10 years of age. There is no provision for extra nourishment except such as can be obtained from the War Pensions Committee, for ex-service men, by application to the Poor-Law Guardians. (xi.) The arrangements for treating non-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially tuberculosis of bones and joints in adults and in children, and for the provision of surgical apparatus, etc. Non-pulmonary cases requiring residential treatment are referred to the L.C.C. for sanatorium or hospital treatment. Cases that can suitably be dealt with as out-patients are referred to the London Hospital according to the terms of the agreement referred to, as are also cases of lupus for Finsen light treatment. Surgical apparatus is obtained through hospital almoners, Invalid Children's Aid Association, Charity Organisation Society, or other charitable bodies. (xii.) The arrangements for "care" and "after care" and their working. Care and after care are in the hands of the Care Committee, which meets fortnightly. Most of the organisations engaged in social work in the Borough are represented on the Committee, and many of the cases which come up for consideration are already known to one or other of the members. (xiii.) Particulars as to any local arrangements for finding employment for patients. No arrangements exist for finding employment for patients, except the Labour Bureaux, which are of little or no value to the tuberculous patient, who usually requires a light occupation. (xiv.) Statement as to the supply and supervision of shelters at the homes of patients. Three shelters are at present out on loan. (xv.) Any special points noted locally as to the incidence of tuberculosis (i.e., occupation). No fresh points worth recording have been noted with regard to occupational incidence. A very large proportion of cases occurs among those who are out of work or have not recently followed any regular occupation. (xvi.) Any special methods adopted or proposed for the prevention of tuberculosis. No special methods outside the general scheme, which includes: the examination and re-examination of contacts, the dissemination of information with a view to minimising the danger of massive infection, and the removal where possible of the infectious patient, or of the contacts from close association with it. 103 (xvii.) Special difficulties encountered. The difficulty which in normal times is encountered in finding suitable employment for tuberculous patients becomes almost an impossibility in these days of widespread unemployment. The reluctance of many cases of advanced disease to enter the PoorLaw Infirmary continues to be one of the chief difficulties in dealing with this type of case. The practical impossibility of improving unsatisfactory home conditions or of securing better accommodation elsewhere for the affected family results from the existing shortage of houses. 104 Report to Medical Officer of Health of Miss A. E. Hall, Chief Health Visitor. Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. 3. January, 1922. Sir, I beg to present the fourteenth Annual Report of the work of the Maternity and Child Welfare Department. Various alterations have been made during the year. The special "Eye," ''Ante-natal" and "Treatment" Clinics, and the "Sewing Class" have been discontinued, the attendances not warranting the expense entailed. Curiously enough, the numbers of expectant mothers attending have been greater since the special Clinic was closed than before, and there is no doubt but that a successful Ante-natal Clinic could be worked up at Shirbutt Street, given the staff and time. A second session for Infant Consultation has been found necessary at the latter Clinic, and the Friday morning Treatment Clinic at Old Ford has been converted into a third session for Infant Consultation. At the Dental Clinic the services of the outside nurse have been dispensed with, and the work undertaken by the Health Visitor, a much more satisfactory arrangement from the Health Visitor's point of view. There are now ten sessions held weekly, all in a flourishing condition: with the exception of Allanmouth Road and the Dental Clinic, neither of these showing any signs of the normal expansion that a successful Clinic should do. The separate Office for the Island Health Visitors has been closed, and all the Health Visitors are now housed together at the Bromley Public Hall. Case papers are forwarded monthly to the Education Department of the London County Council as the children under supervision attain the age of 5 years. The attention of the Minister of Health and the Registrar-General was called to an advertising scheme (promoted by the proprietors of a brand of milk) likely to have a very prejudicial effect on Infant Welfare Work. The Registrar-General intimated to the Public officials concerned that sanction would not be given to their participating in such a scheme. No less than nineteen of the notified cases of Zymotic Enteritis were dead when the notifications were received. Not much chance for the Health Visitor ! ! ! 105 The issue of Dried Milk shows a reduction of 2,445 lbs., chiefly on the Island. Many thanks for the plain packets. It has, as you know, always been a grief to me that the Clinics should be used as advertising agencies for proprietary articles of any description. Dare I hope that my dream of uniform advice and treatment throughout the Borough will ever materialize? Surely the difference in the results obtained by the Royal College of St. Katharine, in an exactly similar district, warrants at least a trial of their methods. Fancy the Borough of Poplar with an infantile mortality rate of 70 per 1,000 ! ! ! We have to thank Councillor S. March, J.P., L.C.C., the then Mayor of Poplar, for making a Baby Show possible.

HALL. 113 Annual Report of Clinic Dental Surgeon To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, The following is the record for the year ending April, 1922, inclusive:— Attendances 325 Sessions 53 New patients 99 Extractions 382 Fillings 122 Dentures (and repairs) 31 Though some of the figures show a falling off, the amount of actual work done has increased. This is chiefly noticeable in the case of fillings. Yours faithfully, C. HAMMOND WILLIAMS, L.D.S., R.C.S. (Eng.). 115 INDEX. Page.

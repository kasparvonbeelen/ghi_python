In a review of public health it is well at times to consider the aims of the local authority and the methods which are employed to promote the health of the public. The health of a community depends more on how people live than where they live but whilst it is possible for a local authority to use its powers to improve the premises in which people dwell and work it is almost impossible to change people's habits by legislation. The aim of the public health services is so to alter the circumstances that it is easy to live healthily and less easy to live in a manner which may be injurious to health and this method of approach has achieved a great deal in the past and is continuing to do so. For example, the requirement in London that every dwelling shall have a proper piped water supply ensures that everybody uses pure water merely because it would be much more inconvenient and probably more expensive to obtain water that was not pure, and use of a pure and safe water supply has for so many years been accepted by the public that there is no need to explain its advantages. -6- This type of action has been very effective in factories where safe and healthy working conditions can be enforced and this is particularly so because the employer has a duty to the persons he employs and the methods of working can also be regulated in many cases. The law which requires that all portable gas or electric heating appliances sold shall be provided with a proper guard is an advance in the field of home safety although its full effect is unlikely to be seen for some years. Improvements in the conditions of living in the home still depends largely on the provision of new and better houses. Legislation to encourage the improvement of existing houses by the provision of baths, hot water supply, etc., has not proved very effective in Poplar and indeed the quality of materials and workmanship used in the construction of many of the older houses in the Borough would not justify the expenditure of large sums on these houses to-day. In the meantime some standards will remain low. The Pood Hygiene Regulations which came into force immediately after 1955 depend for their effectiveness partly on good premises and partly on the hygienic behaviour of the food handlers. The standards for premises and equipment will be enforced by the local authority and these will encourage hygienic behaviour but the real improvement in the way food is handled depends on public opinion and it is unreasonable to expect purchasers to be unduly critical whilst their own facilities at home for the preparation of food are totally inadequate. -7- In some matters improvement in public health must depend on national policy rather than local action. During the war the basic foods were rationed and subsidised and there were certain supplements for children and the result of this, oddly enough, was that the children of the country were fed during a long period of national emergency better than they had ever been fed before. Being better fed does not of course mean merely having more food but having more of the correct foods and now that the choice of food is virtually unrestricted it is doubtful if the children's diets are as satisfactory as they were during the war years. Rationing and food subsidies are now political matters upon which it would be inappropriate to comment here but it would be unfortunate if the standard of nutrition of children which was achieved during the war was allowed to decline. Several other matters are outstandingly unsatisfactory. It has been proved without doubt that smoking is in part responsible for the increase in the number of cases of cancer of the lung and it is essential that young people should be prevented from acquiring the habit. From a purely medical point of view there would be every justification for increasing the tax on tobacco or of limiting imports though doubtless these measures would be objected to by the trade and others. It is also well known that the mental health and to some extent the physical health of children is likely to be less satisfactory where the mother goes out to work and yet little is done to make it more attractive for a married woman with young children to stay at home. -8- Atmospheric pollution is a matter which is receiving some attention largely as a result of the disastrous "smogs" which we have experienced but the cost of improvements will be high. In an area such as Poplar where the problem is severe the local cost is likely to be so high that it will be impossible to keep pace with more fortunate areas and there is no indication that the outside financial assistance will be sufficient to correct the balance. In the meantime if the housewife wishes to provide reasonable ventilation for her house she must suffer the smuts and dirt which pervade the air of Poplar. The health of the public is improving slowly and no doubt progress will continue to be slow because public health is not spectacular. The fact that somebody has not been ill will never make headlines but the cost of the medical services of the country and the cost of the time lost from work through illness is so enormous that it is well that the steps taken to improve the health of the public should be kept under review and that the possible benefit or detriment to the public health should be given due weight when any schemes are considered. Included in the report is information which has again been kindly supplied by Dr. G. 0. Mitchell, Divisional Medical Officer, London County Council, concerning the personal health services and I would like to express my thanks to Dr. Mitchell and his staff for their help and co-operation at all times. My thanks are due to theMembers of the Council and particularly the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and encouragement throughout the year. -9- The other Chief Officers and their staffs have as always, been most helpful in dealing with the many problems which have arisen from time to time and I am very grateful for their willing assistance. To Mr. C. A. Grabham, Senior Sanitary Inspector, Mr. A. A. Hamilton, Chief Clerk and all the other members of the staff of the Public Health Department, I owe a deep debt of gratitude for their loyal assistance and support at all times. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. DUNCAN DEWAR Medical Officer of Health June, 1956. -10- SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During the year births registered exceeded deaths registered by 397 but \ through rehousing and other reasons some 1,820 residents moved from the Borough to other areas and the home population estimated by the Registrar General to number 70,260 at the middle of the year shows a decrease of 1,430 compared with the estimate for the previous year. The birth rate was 16.6 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 17.7 for 1954. To enable a fair comparison to be made with other areas and the country as a whole, area comparability factors which take into consideration the age and sex distribution of the population are provided by the Registrar General. Factors are supplied both for births and deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 14.9 as compared with 15.0 for England and Wales. The death rate in 1955 was 10.9 per 1,000 of the population as compared with 9.98 for 1954. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted death rate would be 12.4 as compared with 11.7 for England and Wales. Comparative rates for the previous year were 11.4 and 11.3 respectively. The infant mortality rate, being the number of deaths of infants under one -11- year of age per 1,000 births, was 29. 2 as compared with 25.1 for the previous year. The figures for England Wales are 24.9 and 25.5 respectively. The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from all forms of diseases of the yeart and circulation show an increase (from 284 in 1954 to 303 in 1955), diseases of the respiratory system, excluding tuberculosis of the lungs, (from 101 in 1954 to 141 in 1955). Deaths from accidents, excluding motor vehicle accidents, rose from 8 in 1954 to 19 in 1955. Deaths from other diseases show no significant change from the numbers recorded in 1954.

The domestic water supply for every dwelling in the Borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The results were uniformly satisfactory throughout the year. Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 in 246 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The District Sanitary Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows. -16- TABLE II INSPECTIONS, INSANITARY CONDITIONS POUND FXISTTNG.

During the year 54 plans of drainage work to new and existing buildings were submitted and approved. Houses let in lodgings. No. of houses on register at end of year .. 145 Common Lodging Ho.uses. There was one licensed Common Lodging House, with accommodation for 295 males, in the Borough. 16 inspections were made during the year. Seamen's Lodging Houses. There were two licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 187 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 37. Personal Cleansing. Owing to the very small number of cases requiring personal cleansing an arrangement was made with the Stepney Borough Council to carry out cleansing where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The Poplar Cleansing Station, which is in Yeo Street adjoining the Disinfecting Station, is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. -19- The number of persons cleansed during 1955 was as follows:- Verminous Scabies Adults Children 29 1 30 18 16 34 Total 47 17 64 Disinfection and Disinfestation. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below: - (a) Disinfection:- Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 325 2,225 Tuberculosis 54 452 Verminous 2 40 Miscellaneous 269 3.560 Disinfection for manufacturing firms - 53,073 TOTALS 650 59,350 (b) Disinfestation:- Inspections:- Number of visits 1,086 Premises requiring treatment 770 Furniture requiring treatment 190 Re-inspections after disinfestation 41 Miscellaneous visits and revisits 60 Disinfestation carried out:- Rooms (in 825 premises) 1,874 Beds, bedding, etc. articles • • 2,200 Furniture articles 3.512 -20- Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949o The work of Rodent Control throughout the Borough has been carried out under the supervision of the Rodent Control Officer and a staff of six Rodent Operatives. Work of the Rodent Control Section may be divided into three categories:- (a) Sewer Maintenance treatment (b) Contributory control scheme for business premises against the festation of rats and mice. (c) Treatment in dwelling houses, following complaint. Sewer Maintenance treatments were carried out at six monthly intervals and in conjunction with the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department. The purpose of these treatments are to gain information and check the build-up of the common rat population in the sewers and thereby assist in preventing surface infestation from the sewers via defective drainage. Business Premises. The Council's Scheme of Rodent Control in business premises has continued to function well. This provides an important service owing to the extensive water frontage in the Borough and the immense volume of goods carried by river and canal. -21- Dwelling Houses. The number of complaints concerning mice is still high, but the use of the anti-blood coagulent agents has proved to be very effective in treatments and it is found possible in most cases to eliminate all mice in a reasonable period of time.

During the year 9 complaints of nuisance from smoke were received. 23 smoke observations were carried out. Shops Act, 1950. Under the provisions of this Act 14 visits were made. No exemption certificates under the Act were issued during the year. Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. A list of persons who sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List is maintained under the provisions of the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. The number of persons on the list at the end of 1955 was 91. Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act requires the registration of premises upon which a business is carried on involving the use of filling materials. The number of premises registered is 9. The Act also requires the licensing of premises for the storage of rag flock, and 2 licences have been issued. Pet Animals Act, 1951. Licences have been issued in respect of ten premises within the Borough. -26- Hairdressers and Barbers. Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. provides that, as from an appointed day, no person shall carry on the business of hairdresser or barber unless he and the premises are registered by the borough council. The Borough Council fixed 1st October, 1955, as the appointed day and, as empowered by Section 18, made bye-laws for securing the cleanliness of premises, instruments and utensils, and employees. 47 persons and 43 premises were registered. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47. A number of cases of aged people came to the notice of the Public Health Department, but with the co-operation of the Home Help Service of the London County Council and with the assistance of the District Nurses, the Voluntary Services and friends and neighbours it was possible to provide proper care at home for a large proportion. The remainder, with one exception, were persuaded voluntarily to enter a hospital or home. The exception concerned a Miss M. W., 71 years, certified as being aged, physically incapacitated, living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to herself and was not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention, in respect of whom it became necessary for action to be taken under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951. The Court granted an Order for removal to hospital. -27- Care of the Aged. Help, advice and assistance for old people through the statutory authorities and voluntary organisations associated in welfare work continued throughout the year and the old people have benefited greatly from the services provided. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50. Burials carried out under the provisions of this Act totalled 4 (adults). The total cost was £44 6s. 6d., the whole of which was recovered. Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court. It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped post-mortem room. In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the pathologists and clerks. Arrangements were made for the joint use of Poplar Mortuary by the three boroughs of Bethnal Green, Poplar and Shoreditch, whereby the Poplar Mortuary situated in Poplar High Street was to be used as the main mortuary for the three boroughs, the Bethnal Green Mortuary being maintained as a reserve in case of emergency. The cost of the service is shared between the three boroughs. The arrangements, which were approved by the London County Council, came into operation on 11th August, 1954. The total number of bodies received during 1955 was 903. (Residents 274, non-residents 629). Post-mortem examinations were made in all cases and inquests were held in 168 cases. -28- Swimming Baths and Wash-houses- The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent:- Poplar Baths Vapour, Foam and Slipper baths, Swimming Pools Bow Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry Island Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry Wick Lane Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry Watts Grove Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry Sophia Street Baths Laundry only Public Cleansing.

Stepney and Stoke Newington were invited to participate. The Exhibition was held on the 21st and 22nd November, 1955, at Shoreditch Town Hall and was officially opened by the Mayor of Shoreditch, Mr. Councillor W. Coyne, J.P. Invitations to attend were addressed to all retail food traders in the Boroughs concerned. The theme of the Exhibition was the progress being made in each of the Boroughs towards cleaner food, and was demonstrated by photographs taken in retail food premises in all seven districts. Photographs displayed were designed to illustrate standards which may be achieved by even the most modest trader. Though the end of the period covered by this report heralds the introduction of the new Pood & Drugs Act, 1955, and a new code of regulations designed to secure improvements in the hygienic conditions of all premises where food is handled or sold, measures which raise considerably existing standards and impose heavy penalties for recalcitrence, much will still remain to be done by way of education in connection with those engaged in the food industry. -35- Apathy, unacquaintance and procrastination are all factors commonly met in the experience of public health officers; human fallings which may be corrected only by the utmost perseverance with encouragement and the greatest diligence in tuition.

The bulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned by the Borough Engineer's refuse disposal service as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned, arrangements may be made under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch, or manure making. -43- Milk Supply. All domestic supplies of milk are sold in sealed bottles or cartons bearing a designation. Except for very small quantities of raw Tuberculin Tested milk from Attested herds, all milk is heat treated. Although a large number of shop keepers are registered to sell milk, the greater proportion of milk supplied to domestic consumers is delivered to the door through seventeen of the registered distributors. The London fresh milk depot of one of the leading wholesale milk concerns is situated within the Borough. Here, over 9,000,000 gallons of milk are pasteurised annually and distributed over some thirty to forty districts in the Greater London area. The Council is responsible for licensing and supervising the pasteurising process. Samples of milk have been taken from dairies, shops and deliverymen for the purpose of checking quality, purity and bacteriological cleanliness. Samples were also taken on delivery from supplies to schools. During the year 229 inspections were made of dairies and other premises from which milk is distributed. Conditions on the whole were found to be satisfactory. Registration and Licensing. For details of registration of dairies and distributors see page 38. Licenses issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949:- Sterilised Pasteurised Tuberculin tested Dealers 142 61 20 Supplementary 28 23 22 Pasteurisers - 1 - -44- Milk sampling. A total of 36 samples of milk (32 formal, 4 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination. All samples were satisfactory. For average solids in all samples, excluding Channel Islands milk, the figures were: Pat 3.5; Non-fatty solids 8.65. Of the 65 samples of designated milk (47 pasteurised; 6 tuberculin tested pasteurised; 7 tuberculin tested; and 5 sterilised) submitted to the Phosphatase, Methylene Blue and Turbidity tests as appropriate, 2 samples of tuberculin tested Paw Milk failed the Methylene Blue test. Since the milk was produced outside the Borough, the appropriate Licensing Authority was informed. All other samples were satisfactory. Milk delivered to Schools and other London County Council Establishments. Of the 34 samples of milk taken on delivery at London County Council Establishments, 17 were submitted for chemical and 17 for bacteriological examination. All samples were reported to be satisfactory. Oxidising Agents. The Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, provide for the use of certain cleansing agents for milk containers and plant. All these products are required to contain a small percentage of sodium chlorate to act as a detector of the efficiency of subsequent rinsing. Pour samples were tested for the presence of chlorates and were found to be free. Ice cream. Close supervision is exercised in connection with the manufacture, sale and storage of ice cream, Premises, plant and refrigerators were kept under constant observation. Pull and free consultation has taken place between manufacturers and the Council's Pood Inspector on problems of production. -45- Inspections are made of the vehicles used by itinerant vendors; vehicles have been stopped, stocks inspected, temperature of containers checked and samples taken. A total of 95 samples were taken during the year. Of these 53 were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination by the Methylene Blue test. The samples were graded as follows:- Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 31 8 12 2 Samples falling into the lower grades were all reported at the height of the season which, due to the very favourable summer, was the busiest the ice cream industry has had for many years. The falling in the standard of samples during the active summer months indicates that this is a period requiring the greatest attention and care from those engaged in the trade. Manufacturers faced with the deluge of orders have often to concentrate on production, sometimes with added labour which is less experienced than would be desired. This is a testing time for the efficiency of management and supervision. The remaining 42 samples were examined by the Public Analyst under the Pood Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951. Three samples were reported to be deficient in fat. The quality of the remainder was found to be far higher than the standards prescribed in the regulations. -46- Imported Food The Council is a specially appointed Authority under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations, 1937. Inspections are made of direct landings of imported foodstuffs at the Sufferance Wharves in the Borough. No prohibited meat may be imported into the country for sale for human consumption and no meat or meat products may be imported without an official certificate of inspection issued by the Country of Origin, and approved by the British Government. Detention notices were served under the Public Health (Imported Pood) Regulations on 4 occasions, all in respect of food found to be unfit for human consumption due to contamination during course of transit. Foods for Export. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 41 inspections were made of foods exported from the district; 129 certificates of purity were issued. Inspection of Meat in Slaughterhouses. Slaughtering has taken place in one only of the two slaughterhouses licensed in the Borough and this was in the nature of an experiment. Carcasses inspected: l cow, l bullock, 1 heifer. Condemnations: 1 pair lungs. Food Poisoning. Thirty-nine cases of food poisoning were notified during the year, investigations failed to establish a specific cause in any of these cases. -47- SECTION E INFECTIOUS DISEASES The total number of corrected notifications of infectious disease during 1955 was 2,114 which was considerably more than the figure for the previous year and mainly due to the increase in the number of cases of measles which were notified. Diphtheria. One case of diphtheria was notified during the year. The result of bacteriological examination was stated to be K.L.B. positive but type not given. The patient (male, 19 years) was transferred to another hospital but was discharged a few days later with a corrected diagnosis of tonsillitis. A further notification concerning this patient was received from the second hospital giving the disease as diphtheria (faucial). The patient made a satisfactory recovery. Poliomyelitis. During the year 44 cases of poliomyelitis (25 paralytic: 19 non-paralytic) were notified but diagnosis was confirmed in only 29 cases (19 paralytic: 10 nonparalytic). There were 2 deaths from this disease. Measles. The number of cases of measles notified during the year was 1,559 as compared with 40 in 1954 and 780 in 1953. Whooping Cough.

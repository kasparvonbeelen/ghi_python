(e) D.P.A. -5- TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF POPLAR Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1953. The health of the population appears to have been reasonably satisfactory during the year and there has been at least some improvement in the general standard of living. Probably the greatest improvement to be seen is in housing. The rebuilding of areas of housing takes a long time, requiring a great deal of preliminary work lasting sometimes for many months before even a brick is laid. The work of former years resulted in the completion of 423 houses and flats during 1953. Of - these 235 were built by the Borough Council and 188 by the London County Council. By reason of the demolition of old houses the increase in the number of inhabited houses was only 196 but the houses which were demolished were some of the worst in the Borough and the new houses and flats are of a standard of which the local authority can be proud. Alongside this replacement of bad old houses by good new ones, and probably influenced by it, is the improvement of existing houses and it is very striking to see the improvement both in the decoration and the furnishing of many of the -6- older houses. This is accompanied by an increase in the standard of housekeeping and although there always were many very good housewives in the Borough and on the other hand there still are some bad ones the standard has noticeably risen and this is, I think, reflected in the better health of the community and especially of the children. During 1952 the high death rate and the low birth rate compared very unfavourably with other areas; during 1953 both these rates improved very satisfactorily but it would be unwise to draw any definite conclusions until it is seen whether these trends are maintained. One disturbing feature is the continued increase in the number of cases of cancer of the lung and it has been shown by many investigations that tobacco smoking, although by no means the only cause, is at least a contributory factor. Where smoking has contributed to the disease it is probably in persons who have been smoking fairly heavily for 20 years or more and so far as we know stopping smoking at this stage will make little or no difference. What is to be deplored is that young people should fall into the same bad habit. Tobacco smoking is thoroughly bad; it does no good whatever and apart from being a factor in the causation of cancer it causes a considerable amount of indifferent health. It is hoped that everybody will join in discouraging young people from acquiring the habit. Standards of food hygiene have shown some improvement and the greater variety -7- of food available combined in some cases with increases in price has probably encouraged the housewife to be more critical. The standards in poplar however are low and this is partly the result of the sale of food from stalls in the street. Open air stalls in the street are basically unsuitable for the sale of food which, however well the stall is constructed or managed is bound to be contaminated to a greater or less extent by the dust and filth of the road. The standard of hygiene which can be insisted upon must be based upon the standard of the stalls and this standard is appallingly low for shops but it is impossible to enforce different standards on the different sides of the same pavement, A special market place where lavatories and washing facilities are available and where the stalls are away from the traffic is still not entirely satisfactory for the sale of food but it is perhaps a reasonable compromise. In the meantime food standards will remain low in Poplar whilst trading on the streets continues. I am again indebted to the Divisional Medical Officer. Dr. G.O. Mitchell for the information given concerning the personal health services which are administered by the County Council and I would like to express my thanks to him and his staff, particularly in the Home Help section, for the services given to the residents of Poplar and for the assistance given to my Department. My thanks are due to the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their help and encouragement throughout the year and to the other chief officers of the Council and their staffs for their assistance and advice. -8- I would like particularly to thank the staff of the Public Health Department for their very loyal help on all occasions and I would like especially to mention the senior clerk Mr. D.N.W. Irvine and the other clerical officers for their work during the long illness of the chief clerk. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, R. DUNCAN DEWAR Medical Officer of Health June, 1954. -9- SECTION A VITAL STATISTICS During 1953 there were 548 more births than deaths registered but on account of persons being rehoused outside the borough and other reasons the population at the middle of the year was estimated at 72,470 which was 200 less than during 1952. The birth rate in 1953 was 18.0 per 1000 of the population, an increase of 7% over the figure for the previous year. The Registrar General provides Area Comparability factors which take account of the age and sex distribution of the population so that comparisons may be made with other districts or with the county as a whole and factors are supplied both for births and for deaths. Using the comparability factor the adjusted birth rate would be 16.2 as compared with 17.5 for the Administrative County of London and 15.5 for England and Wales. The death rate was 10.5 as compared with 12.0 in 1952. Again using the comparability factor the adjusted rate would be 12 as compared with 12.5 for London and 11.4 for England and Wales. The infant mortality rate rose from 23.8 in 1952 to 34.4 in 1953. This is an adverse trend which could indicate a lower degree of child care during the year but as it is calculated on a total of only 45 deaths of infants under one -10- year it is an unreliable guide if taken alone, and the figures given later in the report of the personal health services which have been supplied by the Divisional Medical Officer indicate that the children of the Borough are indeed receiving at least as good care as in previous years. The causes of death are shown in Table I in accordance with the classification used by the Registrar General. Deaths from cancer of the lung in men continue to show an increase. During 1952 cancer of the lung accounted for 28% of all the deaths from cancer in men and 5.2% of all male deaths. During 1953 the figures increased to 39% of all deaths from cancer in men and 7.8% of all male deaths. -11- STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area (excluding water) 2,136 acres Population, estimated mid-year 72,470 Number of inhabited houses (according to Rate Books) 17,659 Rateable value £578,372 General Rate (1952-1953) 21/8d. in £ Sum represented by a penny rate (1952-1953) £2,263 -12- EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR Males Females TOTAL Live Births: Legitimate 668 582 1,250 Illegitimate 26 31 57 Birth Rate per 1,000 estimated resident population: 18.0 Stillbirths: Legitimate 11 13 24 Illegitimate 4 1 5 Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births: 21.7 Deaths 423 336 759 Death rate per 1,000 estimated resident population: 10.5 Deaths of Infants under one year of age: Legitimate 17 25 42 Illegitimate 3 - 3 Death rate of Infants under one year of age: All infants per 1,000 live births: 34.4 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births: 33.6 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births: 52.6 -13- -14- -15- TABLE I DEATHS CAUSES OF DEATHS SEX ALL AGES AGE GROUPS 0- 1- 5- 15- 25- 45- 65- 75- ALL CAUSES M 423 20 1 3 7 24 124 133 111 F 336 25 2 2 3 14 61 74 155 1.

The domestic water supply for every dwelling in the Borough is taken from the Metropolitan Water Board. Samples of the water are subjected to regular routine chemical and bacteriological examination at the Board's laboratories and the results of these examinations are made available to the local authority. The results were uniformly satisfactory throughout the year. Water supply certificates were granted in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936 in 454 cases. There are 11 private wells in the Borough some of which are used for industrial purposes. In no case is the water used for drinking purposes but by arrangement with the owners of the wells, the Metropolitan Water Board takes samples periodically for examination so as to have some record of the probable suitability of the water for drinking should this become necessary in the unlikely event of a major breakdown in the normal supply or in case of war. Sanitary Inspection of the Area. The District Sanitary Inspectors are responsible for the investigation of all complaints in connection with premises within their areas whether these be used as dwellings or for commercial or industrial purposes. The greater portion of the work concerns dwellings as can be seen from the summary of work done which follows. -16- There has been some change in the general pattern of the work during the past few years. Immediately after the war and for several years following, the defects in almost every house in the Borough were to some extent at least attributable to war damage and there were restrictions as to the amount of repair work which could be carried out. Owners were in general willing and even anxious to have the work done and they were influenced partly no doubt by the fact that in many cases the greater amount of the cost was met by the War Damage Commission. At the present time the majority of war damage claims have been settled and the full cost of repairs must now be borne by the owner of the property. As a consequence additional items, which are not or cannot be included in a sanitary notice but which add to the comfort of the occupier or the appearance of the property and were previously done together with the war damage, are now generally excluded. In particular, owners now not infrequently refuse to carry out decorations. It was held in a recent case that lack of decoration does not constitute a nuisance and cannot therefore be included in a statutory notice. This decision has been upheld on appeal and is consequently binding on magistrates in the future. In spite of this, the standard of decoration and furnishing is higher than ever before. Many tenants carry out their own decorations which are of a high quality, and the quality of the furnishings and the care which is obviously given to them is evidence of an increase in the pride which the people of the Borough have in their homes. There are of course exceptions where there are bad landlords or bad tenants or both, one not infrequently causing the other, and it is these cases to which attention is most frequently drawn, but in general the improvement is very good. A summary of the work of the sanitary inspectors is given below in Table II. The number of complaints received was approximately 4% less than in the previous year but the number of cases in which legal proceedings were necessary was increased. The general pattern is however much the same as in previous years. -17- TABLE II INSPECTIONS, INSANITARY CONDITIONS FOUND EXISTING, AND RE-INSPECTIONS DURING THE YEAR 1953 Number of Complaints received 2,818 Number of Inspections Dwelling Houses House-to-House - On complaint 2,777 After Infectious Disease 123 Factories Where power is used 463 No power used 24 Others 57 Outworkers 8 Stables 21 Smoke observations 85 Miscellaneous visits and inspections (including visits to infectious disease contacts, school inspections, etc.) 3,069 Re-inspections 11,058 Premises requiring amendment Dwelling Houses 2,348 Others 25 Service of Intimations, etc., Intimations served 2,029 Intimations complied with 1,597 Notices served 943 Notices complied with 765 Final Notices served 136 Final Notices complied with 133 Summonses applied for 79 Work done (number of instances not included above): (a) After legal proceedings 70 (b) Voluntarily 253 Defects, etc., found in Dwelling Houses: Nuisances, etc., found Works completed Drainage: Drains defective 102 99 Drains obstructed 185 194 Waste pipes defective, etc. 110 107 Rainwater pipes not disconnected 5 11 W.Cs. and flushing apparatus defective 308 322 -18- -19- TABLE II (continued) Nuisances, etc., found Works completed Dampness: (Not due to defects shown elsewhere) 798 709 Water: supply cut off 36 31 Dust receptacles: Insufficient or defective 83 122 Miscellaneous: Rooms, etc., dirty and/or verminous 598 717 Cases of overcrowding 13 - Yards, etc., not properly paved or drained 85 71 Roofs defective 930 923 Rainwater pipes and gutters defective 343 336 Public House urinals requiring cleansing - - Other nuisances or defects 3,400 3,913 Defects, etc., found in Factories: Sanitary defects 12 15 W.

During the year 53 plans of drainage work to new and existing buildings were submitted and approved. Houses let in lodgings. No. of houses on register at end of year 145 Inspections 11 18 Common Lodging Houses. There were two licensed Common Lodging Houses, with accommodation for 295 and 40 males respectively, in the Borough during the year. One of these was closed at the end of the year. 44 inspections were made. Seamen's Lodging Houses. There are three licensed Seamen's Lodging Houses, providing accommodation for 126, 45 and 26 males respectively, in the Borough. Inspections made during the year totalled 45. Personal Cleansing. Owing to the very small number of cases requiring personal cleansing an arrangement was made with the Stepney Borough Council to carry out cleansing where necessary at the Stepney Cleansing Station at Branch Road. The arrangement worked very satisfactorily throughout the year to the mutual advantage of the two Councils and without any serious disadvantage to the persons -21 requiring cleansing. Towards the end of 1953 the Councils agreed to continue the arrangement for a further year. The Poplar Cleansing Station in Yeo Street adjoins the Disinfecting Station. It is maintained in proper order and can be re-opened at any time should this be necessary. The number of persons cleansed during 1953 was as follows;- Verminous Scabies Total Adults 26 4 30 Children - 3 3 26 7 33 Disinfection and Disinfestation. The Council maintains a disinfecting station at Yeo Street and a summary of the work carried out is given below: - (a) Disinfection:- Premises Disinfected Articles Disinfected Infectious Disease 313 2,666 Tuberculosis 35 291 Verminous - 1,087 Miscellaneous 350 5,891 Disinfection for manufacturing firms - 1,787 TOTALS 698 11,722 -22- (b) Disinfestation: - Inspections: - Number of visits 1,515 Premises requiring treatment 734 Furniture requiring treatment 203 Re-inspections after disinfestation 229 Miscellaneous visits and revisits 161 Disinfestation carried out: - Rooms (in 709 premises) 1,677 Beds, bedding, etc. articles 1,381 Furniture articles 3,231 Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949. The work of Rodent Control throughout the Borough has been carried out by a staff of six Rodent Operatives under the supervision of a Sanitary Inspector. The work falls mainly into three categories viz. Sewer Maintenance Treatments; infestations of rats and mice in business premises; and complaints from occupiers of dwelling houses. Sewer Treatments: During the year under review two treatments have been carried out by the staff of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor's Department under the supervision of the Rodent Operatives, in co-operation with neighbouring authorities and in conformity with the direction of the Infestation Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The general low level of infestation has been maintained but discussions have taken place with the Technical Officer of the Ministry in relation to an area in the north of Bow where it appears that an unusual increase in the rat 23- population has occurred. Business premises The Council's Scheme of Rodent Control in business premises has continued to function well during the year and no serious complaint was received from any contributor under the scheme. A small number of contributors ceased to participate in the scheme, mainly as a result of the premises being closed or the removal of the business to another area. Again it must be emphasized that owing to the large water frontage of the Borough and the volume of goods carried by barge, etc., it is extremely difficult to entirely eliminate the menace of rats and constant supervision is required to prevent damage. Notwithstanding the increase in charges to contributors which was approved by the Council in April 1952, the financial aspect of the Council's Contributory Scheme continues to be satisfactory. Dwelling Houses Owing to the remedial measures carried out under the supervision of the District Sanitary Inspectors the number of rat complaints is extremely low but the number of complaints regarding mice still stands at a high level. However with the use of the newer poisons and effective co-operation of the tenants it is hoped to reduce these complaints to a negligible number but it should be pointed out that the tenants can largely assist in this matter by denying access to foodstuffs. -24- The work carried out was as follows: Sewer treatments Number of manholes baited in June 1953 1885 " " " " " December 1953 1930 Business Premises Premises Treatments Privately owned premises 227 1865 Borough Council premises 4 25 The work included the laying of 97,261 prebaits and 10,120 poison baits and involved 1,644 visits by the Rodent Officer and 10,277 by the operatives. In addition 170 visits were made and 45 test baitings were carried out at premises not participating in the Council's Scheme. Dwelling Houses The number of complaints of rats or mice received was 746 relating to 517 premises and 2,307 treatments were applied. The Rodent Officer made 526 visits and the operatives 2,104 visits.

During the year 18 complaints of nuisance from smoke were received. 85 smoke observations were carried out. Shops Act, 1950. Under the provisions of this Act 91 visits were made, and in one instance a notice was served in respect of the w. c. accommodation. No exemption certificates under the Act were issued during the year. Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. A list of persons who sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List is maintained under the provisions of the Pharmacy & Poisons Act, 1933. The number of persons on the list at the end of 1953 was 100. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 47- A number of cases of aged people came to the notice of the Public Health Department, but with the co-operation of the Home Help Service of the London County Council and with the assistance of the District Nurses, the Voluntary Services and friends and neighbours it was possible to provide proper care at home for a large proportion. The remainder were persuaded voluntarily to enter a hospital or home and it was possible to avoid taking action under Section 47. 29 Care of the Aged Help, advice and assistance for old people through the statutory authorities and voluntary organisations associated in welfare work continued during the year. The facilities provided (Old People s Welfare Committee, Meals, Chiropody, Home Help, Home Nursing and Women's Voluntary Services, Clubs, Homes, and others) were reported fully in my last report and have not been given in detail again although it is appreciated how much the old people have benefited from these services. National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50 Burials carried out under the provisions of this Act totalled 9 (6 adults and 3 children). The total cost was £82 13s. Od. and the amount recovered was £76 lis. 8d. Mortuary and Coroner's Court. The Poplar Mortuary is situated in Poplar High Street adjoining the Coroner's Court. It is fitted with modern refrigerating plant which will hold fifteen bodies and it has a well equipped postmortem room. In addition there is a viewing room, a waiting room and accommodation for the use of the pathologists and clerks. During the year the mortuary in use at Bethnal Green which normally received bodies from both the Boroughs of Bethnal Green and Shoreditch, was found to be unsatisfactory, and arrangements were made for bodies from these Boroughs to be sent to the poplar Mortuary. For some years bodies from the Borough of Stepney -30- have been sent to poplar and towards the end of the year discussions were taking place with a view to making a combined arrangement for the four boroughs concerned. A final arrangement had not been settled at the end of the year although the poplar mortuary was then being used to receive bodies from all four boroughs. The total number of bodies received during 1953 was 715. (Residents 302, non-residents 413). Post-mortem examinations were made in all cases and inquests were held in 162 cases. Rag Flock and other Filling Materials Act, 1951. This Act requires the registration of premises upon which a business is carried on involving the use of filling materials. The number of premises registered is 9. The Act also requires the licensing of premises for the storage of rag flock, and 3 licences have tieen issued. Pet Animals Act, 1951. Licences have been issued in respect of seven premises within the Borough. Swimming Baths and Wash-houses. The following bathing establishments are maintained by the Council under the supervision of the Chief Baths Superintendent: - -31- Poplar Baths Vapour, Foam, and Slipper Baths, Swimming Pools. Bow Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Island Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Wick Lane Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Watts Grove Baths Slipper Baths and Laundry. Sophia Street Baths laundry only. Public Cleansing. The arrangements for collection, removal and disposal of refuse are under the control of the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, who has supplied the following information: - Refuse. During the year 23,536 tons of house, trade, street, gully, market and kitchen refuse were collected and disposed of at the controlled tip. In addition 18,738 tons of refuse from a neighbouring borough were also dealt with at the Council's Refuse Disposal Depot. Street Cleansing. Two mechanical sweeper-collector machines work in conjunction with the manual sweepers, and as required 3 watering machines are used for street watering. Two of these three machines are dual purpose machines, and work as gully emptiers when not street watering. Gully cleansing. Four gully emptying machines have carried out 7,685 cleansings of the gullies during the year. -32 - SECTION C HOUSING The major part of the work of the District Sanitary Inspectors is concerned with insanitary conditions and housing defects and the action taken is summarised below, The number of new houses and flats completed is also given. New housing in Poplar has been almost entirely confined to redevelopment of areas as opposed to the infilling with single houses and the number completed during 1953 is the result of some years of work including planning, acquisition and in some cases demolition before the erection could be commenced. The number of suitable areas for redevelopment is now small and the rate of building must slow down very considerably during the next few years. Details of new housing accommodation completed in the Borough during 1953 are as follows - Poplar Borough Council 235 dwellings London County Council Coventry Cross Estate 76 dwellings Devons Estate 112 dwellings The number of families living in property owned or managed by the Borough Council at 5th July, 1953, was as follows: - 33- Type of dwelling No. of Lettlngs Pre-war Council houses and flats 1,074 Post-war Council houses and flats 494 Temporary bungalows 540 Old properties in Compulsory Purchase Areas 160 Requisitioned properties 1,335 Temporary hutments 128 Total properties 3,731 Closing Orders. During the year legal proceedings instituted by the Department to secure the abatement of nuisances resulted in Closing Orders being made by the Magistrate on 8 premises. In one case a Closing Order was revoked, the necessary works having been carried out. Overcrowding (Housing Act, 1936). Particulars of overcrowding and abatement of cases of overcrowding in the Borough during the year are as follows: Number of cases reported during the year 57 Number of cases of overcrowding relieved during the year: Rehoused by London County Council 23 Rehoused by Poplar Borough Council 12 Number of persons concerned in cases rehoused 159 -34 Housing Statistics. 1.

Miscellaneous visits and inspections (not included above) made by the Housing Inspector during the year 100 -36- SECTION D INSPECTION AND SUPERVISION OF FOOD If a survey is made in retrospect of food premises in the Borough ample evidence will be found of improvements which have taken place over the past few years. It will be observed that a far wider use is being made of wrapping materials by all sections of the trade; stainless steel is gradually replacing such materials as lead, copper and enamelled iron for the purpose of containers, pipes and instruments in the factory; glazed display cases and refrigerated counters are becoming increasingly popular in the retail shops and refrigerators are now regarded as a necessity rather than a luxury by even the most humble general shopkeeper. These are but a few of the outward signs of a will to progress. Conduct may not be so easy to observe but even though it is expected that a food handler will be on his best behaviour in the presence of an official it would be unreasonable to presume that his work was otherwise than in keeping with his surroundings or that it fell far below the standard observed at the time of an inspection. Encouraging though it is to see improvements which are taking place to meet the demand for cleaner and purer food it must be admitted that there are many who, through either negligence or indifference are not co-operating to the extent -37- that could be desired. It can be said of traders who lead in the field of food hygiene that standards voluntarily adopted are often far higher than the minima required by legislation; on the other hand there are those who are without initiative in this respect and who fail to maintain standards or effect improvements unless continuously pressed by the local authority. The Pood and Drugs Act 1938 together with the Pood and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Creajn) Act 1950, contain the principal legislation used in connec tion with the enforcement of food standards, and although the act of 1938, which deals with food generally, has many wide and useful provisions it has long been felt that it required amending to bring it into line with modern conditions. A Bill to strengthen the Act of 1938 was introduced into the House of Lords on November 10th. The Bill proposes to amend the existing legislation in certain respects: 1. The control of hygienic conditions under which food is manufactured, prepared, and sold. 2. The introduction of powers to Ministers to make general regulations covering the whole field of food hygiene. 3. The registration of food premises and the licensing of street traders. 4. The inclusion in permanent legislation of the powers contained in emergency Defence Regulations governing the labelling and advertising of food. 5. The wider control of injurious ingredients. -38- Though the main purpose of this Bill is to provide an Act of Parliament that will strengthen the arm of those who have the responsibility of enforcing improved conditions, it may be hoped that its introduction, together with the attendant publicity, will act as a stimulus to the sense of responsibility not only of those already engaged in the food industry but also of those who propose to enter it. Food Premises. The number of food premises in the area by type of business is as follows: Manufacturing premises 38. (Confectionery 5; Bakers confectionery 1; Flour millers 3; Edible oils 2; Ice cream 2; Wine blenders 2; Nut roasters 2; Grocery 3; Pickles 2; Spice grinders 1; Milk pasteurising 2; Pood dehydration 2; Meat products 7; Mineral waters 1; Sugar refiners 2; Bakers 1). This list does not include places where food is manufactured principally for retail sale on the premises. Wharves 23 Cold stores 2 Wholesale premises 19 (Grocers 12; Banana ripeners 4; Confectioners 2; Biscuits 1). Retail premises 1,028 (Grocers 207; Confectioners 106; Restaurants 128; Industrial canteens 105; Non-industrial canteens 35; School meals centres 23; Public houses 175; Off-licences 25; Continental butchers 1; Bakers 37; Fishmongers 45; Herbalists 1; Greengrocers 68s Butchers 59; Chemists 13).

(b) Sausages and preserved, etc., foods 51 Food & Drugs Act, 1938, Section 34. Wholesale Dealers in Margarine 8 Butter factories 2 (Note - no butter blending took place at either of these premises during the year). -39- Milk & Dairies Regulations 1949 Dairies 8 Milk Distributors: Inside the Borough 139 Outside the Borough 24 Inspection of Food Premises. The following is a detailed summary showing the types of premises inspected during the year: Number of Inspections Bakers 55 160 Milk Distributors 178 Restaurants 394 Industrial catering establishments 106 Other catering establishments 60 Pish shops, fryers and curers 82 Stalls and itinerant vendors 55 Market inspections 56 Ice cream premises 163 Wharves 113 Butchers 199 Registered food manufacturers 81 Other food premises 797 Total inspections 2,499 Unsatisfactory conditions, warranting formal action, were found at 54 premises. 40 Food sampling. A total of 733 samples of food were procured during the year by the Council's Pood inspector. Of these, 551 were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination, the remaining 182 being sent to the Public Health Laboratory Service for biochemical or bacteriological report. Samples examined by the Public Analyst included a comprehensive variety of food. 124 samples were acquired formally and 427 informally. A total of 25 samples (4.5 per cent) were found to be adulterated. Details of the unsatisfactory samples and the action taken are shown in Table VI, on pages 42 and 43. Attention has been drawn to the possibility of ice lollies being contaminated by lead and other metals during the course of manufacture. Only negligible amounts were found in ten samples specially examined and the lollies were reported satisfactory. Local manufacturers have been advised on this matter and are taking precautions to reduce the risk of metallic absorption to a minimum. Methods adopted include care and maintenance of moulds, the use of stainless steel where economically practicable, and calling for guarantees that pure tin only is used in replating moulds and vessels. -41- -42- -43- TABLE VI Sample No. Article Result of analysis Action 95 * Patent Barley Contained deposit caused by moth infestation together with living larvae of moth.

The Council's Pood Inspector is called upon to pass judgment of fitness on great quantities of food. Frequently large and valuable stocks are involved. Among special lots of food examined during the year were the following: 66 and 54 bags of whole coconuts (13,440 lbs.) All condemned and destroyed. 253 bags imported onions (28,336 lbs.) „ „ „ „ 24 forequarters Danish beef (3,290 lbs.) 12 quarters condemned and released for industrial use. 916 boxes chocolate novelties . (916 lbs.) All condemned and destroyed. 1139 tins greengages (2,278 lbs.) „ „ „ „ Compound cooking fat (33,096 lbs.) All condemned, released for industrial use. 1151 cartons each 24 tins Dutch marinated mussels (27,624 lbs.) All condemned and destroyed. 39 cases each 48 tins processed Peas (1,872 lbs.) „ „ „ „ 204 tins apricot pulp (2,040 lbs.) „ „ „ „ 250 cases dessicated coconut (32,500 lbs.)

Sweet fat 4,480 lbs. - Other foods 152 lbs. 9 lbs. This summary differentiates only between canned food and others; foods preserved by salt, sugar, dehydration, etc., being included under the heading "Fresh Foods". Disposal of Unsound Food. The hulk of the food condemned as being unfit for human consumption is removed from the premises concerned by the Borough Engineer's refuse disposal service. When suitable for animal feeding the food is collected and included with kitchen waste. Unsuitably packed and totally unfit foods are removed as trade refuse and the cost of removal is charged to the owners in accordance with the Council's fixed scale of charges. In special cases, where large quantities of food are condemned, arrangements are made under suitable guarantees from the owners, for the foods to be utilised for animal feeding or non-edible industrial purposes such as soap, starch, or manure making. Milk Supply. Ml domestic supplies of milk are sold in sealed bottles or cartons bearing a designation. Except for very small quantities of raw Tuberculin Tested milk from Attested herds, all milk is heat treated. -45- The quantity of milk filled into churns or bottles in dairies other than pasteurising dairies in the Borough is now estimated to be no more than fifty to sixty gallons per day. For some time now the smaller dairymen have been reducing the quantity of milk handled on their premises and concentrating more on milk received in sealed bottles. No replacement has been made of stocks of bottles or other accessories as they become defective. These dairymen have thus prepared themselves for the operation of the Second Schedule, Part I, paragraph 7, of the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations 1949, which it is anticipated will be introduced in October of next year, and the necessary changes may be made with a minimum of inconvenience and negligible expense to the dairymen concerned. Although a large number of shop keepers are registered to sell milk, the greater proportion of milk supplied to domestic consumers is delivered to the door through eighteen of the registered distributors. Two dairies in the Borough pasteurise over 189,000 gallons of milk per week: in the same period over three-quarters of a million bottles are filled. Milk produced from these dairies is distributed over some thirty to forty districts in the Greater London area. The Council is responsible for licensing and supervising the pasteurising process. Samples of milk have been taken from dairies, shops and deliverymen for the purpose of checking quality, purity and bacteriological cleanliness. Samples -46- were also taken on delivery from supplies to schools. Restrictions on the sale of cream were relaxed in the month of April. At the same time minimum fat standards were fixed for specified types of cream whether home produced or imported. At first, a number of samples were reported to be below standard although subsequent samples proved to be much more satisfactory. It is possible that this situation was partly due to cream producers suffering to a certain extent from a loss of experience in the process of cream separation resulting from the many years of emergency during which the manufacture of this article was prohibited. During the year 338 inspections were made of dairies and other premises from which milk is distributed. Conditions on the whole were found to be satisfactory. Registration and Licensing. For details of registration of dairies and distributors see page 40. Licences issued under the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949, and Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949: - Sterilised Pasteurised Tuberculin tested Dealers 136 57 20 Supplementary 25 20 19 Pasteurisers -- 2 -- -47- Milk sampling. A total of 102 samples of milk (88 formal, 14 informal) were submitted to the Public Analyst for chemical examination. All were satisfactory. Satisfactory reports were received on 127 samples of designated milk (93 pasteurised; 16 tuberculin tested pasteurised; 1 tuberculin tested; and 17 sterilised) submitted to the Phosphatase, Methylene Blue and Turbidity tests as appropriate. Milk delivered to Schools. Of the 107 samples of milk taken on delivery at London County Council Schools, 55 were submitted for chemical and 52 for bacteriological examination. All samples were reported to be satisfactory. Oxidising Agents. The Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949, provide for the use of certain cleansing agents for milk containers and plant. All these products are required to contain a small percentage of sodium chlorate to act as a detector of the efficiency of subsequent rinsing. Pour samples of milk were specially tested for the presence of chlorates and all were found to be free. Ice cream. Close supervision is exercised in connection with the manufacture, sale and storage of ice cream. Premises, plant and refrigerators were kept under constant observation. Pull and free consultation has taken place between manufacturers and the Council's Pood Inspector on problems of production. -48- Inspections are made of the vehicles used by itinerant vendors; vehicles have been stopped, stocks inspected, temperature of containers checked and samples taken. A total of 88 samples were taken during the year. Of these 47 were submitted to the Public Health Laboratory for examination by the Methylene Blue test. The samples were graded as follows: - Grade 1 Grade 2 Grade 3 Grade 4 30 10 6 1 Samples falling into the lower grades were in each case isolated. The regaining 41 samples were examined by the Public Analyst under the Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951. All samples were reported to be satisfactory and in most cases the quality was found to be far higher than the standards prescribed in the regulations. Imported Food. The Council is a specially appointed Authority under the Public Health (Imported Food) Regulations, 1937. Inspections are made of direct landings of imported foodstuffs at the Sufferance Wharves in the Borough. No prohibited meat can be imported into the country for sale for human consumption and no meat or meat products can be imported without an official certificate of inspection issued by the Country of Origin, and approved by the British Government. All foods imported were found to be satisfactory, and meat and meat products were -49- all accompanied by satisfactory official certificates. Foods for Export. In order to satisfy the Authorities of importing countries overseas it is necessary for the exporter to obtain a certificate of purity signed by the Medical Officer of Health for the district from which the food is shipped. During the period covered by this report 46 inspections were made of foods exported from the district; 132 certificates of purity were issued. Food Poisoning. Twenty-nine cases of food poisoning were notified during the year.Investigations failed to establish a specific cause in any of these cases. -50- SECTION E INFECTIOUS DISEASES The total number of corrected notifications of infectious disease during 1953 was 1461 which was slightly below the figure for the previous year. Diphtheria. There were again no confirmed cases of diphtheria in the Borough during the year. This very satisfactory condition is almost certainly due to immunisation against this disease and it is gratifying to record that the number of cases immunised for the first time or given a re-inforcing dose shows an increase of almost 30% over the figures for 1952 in spite of the fact that the 1952 figures were 20% more than those for the previous year. Nearly all the immunisations are carried out by the officers of the London County Council. Smallpox. There were no cases of Smallpox in the Borough during 1953. The number of children vaccinated during the year (mainly at the London County Council's Welfare Centres) was 600 as compared with 357 during the previous year. During the year the sanitary inspectors and the staff of the disinfecting station were vaccinated -51- or re-vaccinated as they comprise one group of persons likely to be exposed to infection if any case of smallpox should occur in the area. Poliomyelitis. Five cases of paralytic poliomyelitis were confirmed during the year. There were no deaths from this disease. Measles. During 1953 the number of cases of measles notified was 780 as compared with 808 in 1952 and 1,761 in 1951. Whooping Cough. There were 314 cases of whooping cough notified and of these 60% occurred in children below 5 years of age and 14% in children below 1 year. Of the latter group one child died. Tuberculosis The following table shows the age and sex incidence of the cases notified.

During the first part of the year all bacteriological examinations for the Public Health Department were carried out by the Public Health Laboratory Service at the Laboratories at 134, Denmark Hill, S. E. 5. This laboratory closed in September 1953 and after that date specimens for examination were sent to the Laboratory at County Hall. Ambulance Facilities. The provision of ambulance transport within the administrative County of London is the responsibility of the London County Council. Hospitals. There are three hospitals in the Borough - St. Andrew's, St. Clement's and Poplar Hospital. These hospitals, together with the Poplar Chest Clinic, Wellington Way, E.3, which continued to operate during the year, are under the control of the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. -55- Personal Health Services.

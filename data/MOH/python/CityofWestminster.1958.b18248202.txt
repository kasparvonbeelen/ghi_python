To the Right Worshipful The Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the City of Westminster. Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, Herewith I beg to present a report upon the health and sanitary conditions of the City for the year 1958. I have the honour to be Your obedient Servant, J. A. Struthers, Medical Officer of Health July, 1959. 10 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS Area (acres) 2,502.7 Population (Registrar General's Estimate, mid-year, 1958) 95,440 Number of inhabited bouses (Census, 1951) 27,349 Rateable Value (at 1st April, 1958) £20,075,000 Births Live Births (registered)— Total.

These are also the factors which tend to cause still-birth. The Perinatal Mortality, which is the number of still-births plus the number of deaths in the first week of life per 1,000 total births, is therefore an index of the total mortality due to factors arising before and during birth. Infant Mortality Cause of Death Total Legitimate Illegitimate Vascular lesions of the nervous system 1 1 — Pneumonia 1 1 — Bronchitis 2 2 — Congenital malformations 2 2 — *Other defined and ill-defined diseases 12 11 1 All other accidents 1 — 1 19 17 2 *This is the Registrar-General's classification; but such conditions as prematurity, birth injuries and other fatal conditions relating to the process of birth are included under this heading. The Infant Mortality Rate of 18.41 is the lowest ever recorded in Westminster. Although it is to be hoped that this figure will fall still further in future years, the numbers from which this rate is computed are so small that fluctuations are likely to occur. For the first time the infant mortality among illegitimate babies (17.69) is less than that for legitimate babies (18.49). The former rate is very much lower than that occurring in previous years; but it must be pointed out that it is based on the occurrence of two deaths among 113 babies. The death of one more illegitimate infant would have given an increase of approximately 9 points in the death rate, to 26-55. (5442) A 4 12 Births, Infant Deaths and Death Rates Year. All Infants.

There were as usual numerous cases of persons who had been in contact with smallpox— in most cases outside this country. The necessary preventive measures were taken. Poliomyelitis Two notifications of Acute Poliomyelitis (Paralytic) were received during the year, but the diagnosis was confirmed in one case only—a non-immunised girl of 2 years. Immunisation against poliomyelitis was begun in 1956. The number of corrected notifications of poliomyelitis, including polio-encephalitis, for each year since 1947 are given below. It will be seen that the numbers vary greatly and it is not possible to attribute the paucity of cases during 1958 to the effects of immunisation:— 1947 1948 1949 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956 1957 1958 21 16 29 13 1 10 9 4 15 7 5 1 18 Typhoid Fever Two cases of Typhoid fever were notified during the year. One, a man living alone, had been in the Eastern Mediterranean shortly before his illness, and it was presumed that he had been infected there. In the other case the causative organism was found to be similar to one known to infect the water around West Mersea. The patient, like several others in various parts of the country, had eaten oysters which came from West Mersea. Samples of oysters taken subsequently from various restaurants within the City were found to be in first class condition. International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation Arrangements continued during the year for the authentication by the Medical Officer of Health of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation completed by medical practitioners in Westminster. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad from this country and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. 4,096 certificates were authenticated during the year. The Medical Officer of Health also issues, on request and in appropriate circumstances, certificates to the effect that no cases of smallpox have occurred in the district during the preceding two weeks. These certificates are sought by persons proceeding to the United States of America who do not wish to submit to vaccination. It is understood that the United States immigration authorities reserve the right to place such persons under surveillance notwithstanding the production of such a certificate. 19 Bacteriological Examinations Face, Ear, Nasal and Throat Swabs (74) Diphtheroid bacilli 1 Haemolytic Streptococci 10 Staphylococci 15 Faeces (271) Rectal Swab (1) Shigella sonnei 62 Shigella Flexneri 2 Salmonella Newport 6 Salmonella Typhimurium 1 Trichomonas hominis 1 Tuberculosis (97) Positive 2 Negative 95 During the year new arrangements were made by the Westminster Chest Clinic for the examination of sputum from patients attending the clinic.

During 1958 Mobile Units of the South West London Mass X-Ray Service made seventeen visits in the City of Westminster to provide chest X-ray facilities for the staffs of firms and Government Departments, and the staff and students of three University and training colleges. The total numbers X-rayed were 13,414, and as a result of these visits 53 people were referred to chest clinics with a radiologically significant lesion requiring further investigation. In addition, a Mass X-ray Unit was installed at the Board of Trade, Horse Guards Avenue, S.W.I, for ten days, when 2,492 X-ray examinations were carried out, as a result of which 13 examinees were referred to the chest clinics. For four months of the year a Mass X-ray Centre was functioning at The New Gallery, Regent Street, W.l, where 16,462 people from firms and organisations in the W.l area were X-rayed, and 42 of these were referred to chest clinics. The highest incidence rate was found, as might be expected, during two visits to the London County Council Lodging House in Kemble Street and visits to the Salvation Army Hostel and Church Army Hostels in Great Peter Street. During these visits 831 people were examined, of whom 50 were referred to the Chest Clinic, a rate of 6 • 02 per cent. A mobile Unit made a weekly one-day visit to the Westminster Chest Clinic until 29th August, after which, unfortunately, this accommodation was no longer available because it was required for other purposes. During the first eight months of the year, 6,571 examinations were carried out, as a result of which 94 were referred to chest clinics. Of these figures 3,197 and 79, respectively, were patients referred by general practitioners. The closing down of this Centre, with the consequent loss of regular weekly X-ray facilities in Westminster, has caused a great deal of inconvenience to general practitioners, to the general public and to firms. It has not yet been possible to find alternative accommodation for a Unit to make a weekly visit, but enquiries are still being made. Welfare op Old Persons Westminster Old People's Welfare Association This voluntary Association, whose members include representatives of various bodies interested in the welfare of old people, continued its activities in the City during the year. These activities include the organisation in various parts of the City of 14 Darby and Joan Clubs, where light refreshments and recreation are provided; arranging holidays at seaside resorts, summer outings, Christmas parties, and other entertainments. Special outings and parties were organised during the year for handicapped old people, who by reason of their infirmities had not been outside their homes for long periods. The distribution of gift parcels 21 at Christmas time was arranged; and also the visiting by voluntary helpers of the ailing and lonely in their homes. The Association also provides a chiropody service for the elderly. Treatment can be obtained at two clinics in the City, or at home. The charge is 2s. 6d. per treatment; the balance of cost, which varies from 3s. 6d. to 6s. per treatment, is borne by the Association. The City Council, under powers conferred by the National Assistance Act, 1948, makes an annual contribution to the funds of the Association. In 1957 the Association agreed to a proposal by the City Council to recruit on their staff a welfare worker witb the appropriate qualifications, whose duties would include case-work with individual old people and the co-ordination of services provided by the various statutory authorities for the welfare of old people; duties which were formerly carried out by a Public Health Inspector on the City Council's staff. The welfare worker commenced duty in February, 1958, and the Council reimburses the Association annually the salary and expenses of the appointment, with the consent of the Minister of Housing and Local Government, under Section 136 of the Local Government Act, 1948. British Red Cross Society—Mobile Meals Service The Westminster Division of the British Red Cross Society has continued the service which it established in the City in December, 1946, for the delivery to their homes of hot mid-day meals to aged people who are unable themselves to prepare meals at home. The service is operated with two vans provided by the City Council and loaned to the Society. The Council also makes an annual grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the running costs of the vans. The meals are obtained from a firm of caterers, and are placed in individual containers and kept in heated chambers on the vans until delivered at the homes of the old people. The meals cost Is. 6d. each, and consist of meat, two vegetables and a sweet, or lighter diets for those requiring them. The old people pay 8d. for the meal and the London County Council bear the difference of lOd. The number of meals delivered by the Society has continued to increase, and in 1958 reached a record total of 14,939. This invaluable service rendered by the Society and the voluntary helpers is much appreciated by all concerned. Luncheon Clubs The Society, in March, 1957, opened a luncheon club for the elderly in accommodation on one of the Council's Housing Estates, a second luncheon club being opened in October, 1958, in City Council premises in Monck Street. Both clubs operate on two days each week, and have proved convenient centres where aged persons who are not housebound can have a hot meal at a modest price, and enjoy the company of others. (5442) A 7 22 The meals are purchased by the Society from the caterers who supply the meals for the mobile service, and are conveyed in insulated containers to the clubs, where they are served out by voluntary workers. Each club attracts between 30 to 40 people per day. The meals cost Is. 6d. each and the old people pay 8d. and the London County Council pay the balance of lOd. per meal. The City Council makes a grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the cost of running the clubs as well as bearing the cost of equipment. Aged Persons in Need of Care and Attention Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, a Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply to the Courts for an order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place, of persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from others, proper care and attention. It was not found necessary to use these powers during the year. Aged and Infirm Persons Most of the visiting of the aged and infirm is done by the Westminster Old People's Welfare Association social worker. There are occasions, however, when a visit by the Public Health Inspector is required, either because he has specialist knowledge or because of his statutory powers. Twelve such visits were made during the year. Mobile Library Service The City Council provides a library service for the elderly, and books are issued to them at Darby and Joan Clubs. For those who are unable to leave their homes, delivery is made there. Bathing Facilities The City Council has made available to old age pensioners facilities whereby they can have hot baths at the Council's public baths at reduced charges. Cleansing of Bed Linen of Elderly and Infirm Facilities have also been made available by the Council for the cleansing of bed linen of elderly and infirm people when it has become fouled and unwholesome. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933—Slaughterman's Licences The Council during the year granted Slaughterman's licences to 12 men who had been accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to act as their inspectors in different parts of the country. These licences are required to be held by the pupils while undergoing training in humane slaughtering as part of the course for appointment as inspectors of the R.S.P.C.A. 23 Sanitary Circumstances Duties performed by the Public Health Inspectors The following statistics show the work of the Public Health Inspectors during the year:— Dwelling Houses Analysis of Inspections:— Complaints 713 House to House (by Housing Inspectors) 72 Routine 610 Infectious Disease 167 Underground Rooms 239 Other parts unfit for habitation 12 Housing Applications 72 Applications for Loans and Grants 32 Drainage 843 Rodent Control 641 Miscellaneous 52 3,453 Included in the above totals are:— Requisitioned properties 29 Houses let in lodgings 263 Council properties 159 Aged and Infirm Persons 12 Common Lodging Houses 7 6,730 re-inspections were made following the above inspections.

There are two common lodging houses for men in the City, licensed by the City Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. These common lodging houses have accommodation for 716 and 565 men lodgers respectively. Seven visits were made to the lodging houses during the year. 27 Slum Clearance (a) Clearance Areas In furtherance of the City Council's slum clearance programme for the period 1955-1960, representations were made for dealing with 17 unfit houses within a site bounded by Dufour's Place, Broadwick Street, and Marshall Street, W.l. The houses were contained in two areas—(i) fourteen houses, viz.— 1-6 (consecutive and inclusive), Dufour's Place; 64-70 (even) and 74, Broadwick Street; and 7-9 (consecutive and inclusive),Marshall Street, comprising an area of -36 acre; and (ii) three houses, viz.:—11, 12 and 13, Marshall Street, comprising an area of -09 acre. Acting upon my official representations, the City Council, at their meeting on the 13th November, 1958, declared the following areas as clearance areas:— No. 1—Westminster (Dufour's Place, Broadwick Street and Marshall Street) Clearance Area, 1958. No. 2—Westminster (Marshall Street) Clearance Area, 1958. (b) Compulsory Purchase Order The Housing Act, 1957, provides that when an area has been declared a clearance area, the local authority may proceed to secure the clearance of the area either (i) by ordering the demolition of the buildings in the area (clearance order procedure); or (ii) by purchasing the land comprised in the area and itself undertaking or otherwise securing the demolition of the buildings thereon (purchase procedure). It was considered that clearance order procedure was unsuitable for dealing with the areas described above because, when the houses were demolished, one of the cleared sites would be too small for separate redevelopment, and the other site would be irregular in shape and thereby also unsuitable for separate redevelopment. Accordingly, it was decided that Nos. 60, 62 and 72, Broadwick Street and 10, Marshall Street, and the factory premises at the rear of 9 to 13 (consecutive and inclusive), Marshall Street should also be purchased to secure a cleared area of convenient shape and size and to ensure the satisfactory development and user of the sites to be cleared. At their meeting on the 13th November, 1958, therefore, the City Council resolved to make a Compulsory Purchase Order for the acquisition of the properties Nos. 1-6 (consecutive and inclusive) Dufour's Place, 60-74 (even), Broadwick Street and 7-13 (consecutive and inclusive), Marshall Street (including factory at rear). The Order has been submitted to the Minister of Housing and Local Government for confirmation. One of the houses (No. 74, Broadwick Street, birthplace of William Blake, painter, poet and mystic) has been included by the Minister of 28 Housing and Local Government in a list of buildings of special architectural or historic interest compiled by him under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 (Section 30). This section provides that a listed building may not be demolished unless two months' notice is given to the local planning authority. Consultations are taking place with the Minister and the London County Council concerning the effect on this house of the City Council's proposals. Rent Act, 1957—Certificates of Disrepair The Rent Act, 1957, which came into operation on 6th July of that year, prescribed a new procedure in regard to the issue of Certificates of Disrepair in respect of dwelling houses which are not reasonably suitable for occupation. The Act repealed the provisions of the Housing Repairs and Rents Act, 1954, relating to these certificates, and enacted a new procedure for the tenant of a controlled tenancy who desires to resist an increase in rent on the grounds of the existence of defects. These he must specify in a notice served by him on the landlord. If, after the expiration of six weeks from the date of service of such notice, any of the defects remain unremedied, and the landlord has not given an undertaking to remedy those defects, the tenant may apply to the local authority for a certificate of disrepair. The following is a summary of the action taken during 1958:— Part I—Applications for Certificates of Disrepair (1) Number of applications for certificates 7 (2) Number of decisions not to issue certificates ... ... 2 (3) Number of decisions to issue certificatesz:— (a) in respect of some but not all defects 4 (b) in respect of all defects 1 (4) Number of undertakings given by landlords —■ (5) Number of certificates issued 5 Part II-—Applications for Cancellation of Certificates on completion of work required (6) Applications by landlords for cancellation of certificates 4 (7) Objection by tenants to cancellation of certificates ... 2 (8) Decision of Local Authority to cancel certificates standing tenants' objections 2 (9) Number of certificates cancelled ... ... ... ... 4 29 Land Charges Act, 1925. The number of enquiries dealt with and reported upon was 2,389, relating to 4,117 properties. Comparing these figures with those for 1957, there was an increase of 21 in the number of enquiries dealt with. These enquiries concerned outstanding statutory or informal notices, combined drainage orders, smoke control area orders, applications for decontrol under the Rent Restrictions Acts, and certificates of disrepair. As in previous years many of the search forms requested supplementary information regarding any proposals for dealing with properties under Part III of the Housing Act, 1957, restrictions on the use of underground rooms, and the suitability of premises for specific purposes such as catering establishments and workrooms. 30 Inspection of Factories, Workplaces, Shops, Offices and Other Premises (other than Food Premises) Total Number of Visits Factories—Power 121 Factories—Non-power 78 Workplaces, etc .2,625 Offices 4,323 Shops (other than Food) 976 8,123 Analysis of Inspections:— Complaints 450 Routine 1,235 Infectious Disease 5 Drainage 1,447 Outworkers Premises 37 Outworkers Lists 27 Rodent Control 535 Sanitary Defects 19 Other Reasons 40 3,795 4,328 re-inspections were made following the above inspections.

Of this number 92 were reported upon adversely, representing a percentage of 5.97:— Baby foods 12 Baking powder 2 Beer 8 Biscuits 3 Bread 7 Butter and peanut butter7 Cakes, puddings, and cake and pudding mixtures 34 Cereals 40 Cheese and cheese spreads 20 Cocoa 12 Coffee and coffee essences 24 Condiments and spices 33 Confectionery 83 Cooking fats and oils 12 Cream Custard powders, blancmange and jellies 59 36 Drugs 51 Fish and fish products 83 Flavourings and colourings 24 Flour 13 Fruit, canned, etc 55 Herbs 6 Ice Cream 69 Jams, marmalades and preserves 28 Malt and chocolate drinks 3 Margarine 5 Meat and meat products 50 Milk 400 Milk, condensed and evaporated 12 Nuts—Cashew, peanuts 4 Pickles and sauces 38 Pie filling, pies and pastry mix 8 Poultry and poultry products 5 Saccharin 3 Sausages 10 Soft drinks, fruit juice, etc. 92 Soup and soup powders 27 Spirits 94 Spreads, various 2 Suet 5 Syrup 2 Tea 15 Vegetables, tinned, etc. 34 Vinegar 10 Wines 3 Yeast and yeast extract Yogurt 3 Miscellaneous 11 The adverse reports on samples analysed included the following:— Contraventions of labelling regulations. These were mostly of a minor character, and the co-operation of the manufacturers or importers was readily forthcoming on contraventions being brought to their notice. 37 Legal proceedings were taken against several firms in respect of fish products which contained added preservative, contrary to the Public Health (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations, 1925-1953. A prosecution was taken against a restaurant company for applying a false description to a sandwich which was stated to contain smoked salmon. On examination it was found to contain artificially dyed smoked saithe. Proceedings were also taken in respect of two glasses of hot milk. They had been heated by the injection of steam, and in consequence the milk contained added water. Samples of spirits were also found to contain added water, and legal proceedings ensued. A summary of the results of legal proceedings taken during 1958, which include the above, will be found later in this report (page 48). Several consignments of apples bearing deposits of lead and arsenic in excess of the recommended limits, arrived in Covent Garden during the year from overseas. Arrangements were made for them to be washed and repacked before being placed on the market for sale. A number of investigations were made as the result of complaints from members of the public alleging that foodstuffs purchased by them contained foreign matter, or were otherwise unfit for consumption. Where necessary, action was taken. Food Hygiene Regulations, 1955 The provisions of these Regulations continue to operate successfully in the maintenance of satisfactory conditions in food premises in the City. In some cases an explanation of the Regulations is hampered by language difficulties, for there are a large number of foreign nationals who work in the food trade in Westminster. It has been suggested to certain proprietors that Part III of the Regulations, which relates to persons engaged in the handling of food, should be printed in the languages understood by the staff. In this way the full implication of their responsibilities under this section can be understood. In order that new owners or occupiers of food premises can be aware of the requirements of the Regulations, before any alteration is undertaken at existing premises, an early recommendation is made suggesting a consultation between the Public Health Inspector and the new occupier. The opportunity is then provided for a discussion of proposals, including the type of catering or sale of food to be undertaken. The provisions of Part III of the Regulations can also be made known. This procedure has been found to be greatly appreciated by the proprietors of new businesses, and has resulted in the Council's requirements being met at the outset, and in a more satisfactory manner. 38 Shops Act, 1950—Section 38 Sanitary and other Arrangements in Shops Section 38 of the Shops Act, 1950, empowers a Metropolitan Borough Council to take action in regard to sanitary conveniences, ventilation, and temperature, in shops. Under this section the London County Council were responsible for matters relating to lighting, facilities for washing and meals for staff, in shops. The functions previously undertaken by the London County Council were transferred to Metropolitan Borough Councils as from 1st January, 1959, in accordance with the provisions of section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1958. The City Council has decided that the functions transferred from the County Council should be referred to the Public Health Committee. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 16 Registration of Premises used in connection with the Manufacture, Sale or Storage of Ice Cream Two hundred and sixty-five premises are registered for the manufacture and/or sale and/or storage of ice cream. Registration of Premises used for the Preparation or Manufacture of Preserved Foods Seventy-seven premises are registered for the preparation or manufacture of preserved foods. Ice Cream (Heat Treatment) Regulations, 1947 Methylene Blue Tests on Samples of Ice Cream Eighty-nine samples of ice cream were submitted for methylene blue test. The samples were classified in provisional grades based upon the method of examination as recommended by the Ministry of Health. These were as follows:— Grade 1 61 Grade 2 15 Grade 3 7 Grade 4 6 39 Milk (Special Designation) Regulations The following licences authorising the sale of designated milks were issued during 1958 to Distributors of Milk registered with the Council:— Dealers' Licences Dealers' Supplementary Licences Pasteurised 117 47 Sterilised 99 44 Tuberculin Tested 85 44 Milk During the year 35 samples of milk were submitted for methylene blue and phosphatase test. The results received showed that the milk had been efficiently pasteurised. Milk and Dairies Regulations, 1949 At the 31st December, 1958, the following were entered in the City Council's Register of Dairies and Distributors of Milk:— Distributors of milk with premises registered as dairies 33 Distributors of milk with premises not registered as dairies 84 Distributors of milk with premises situate outside Westminster 52 Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 Persons entitled to sell poisons included in Part II of the Poisons List numbered 150 at 31st December, 1958. Pet Animals Act, 1951 Five licences were issued by the Council during the year in relation to premises subject to the provisions of this Act. 40 Food and Drugs Act, 1955, Section 8 The following table shows the amount of food condemned as unfit for human consumption during the year:— Amount destroyed. Tons Cwts. Lbs. Canned food 13 3 12 Meat 1 12 103 Fruit and vegetables 127 0 0 Cereals — 2 13 Fats — — 28 Fish — 12 25 Confectionery — 4 16 Miscellaneous — 9 50 Total 143 4 23 Method of disposal of condemned food Food condemned or voluntarily surrendered to the Public Health Inspectors is disposed of by depositing in the Council's refuse barges at the Central Depot at Gatliff Road, S.W.1. Foodstuffs disposed of at this depot are removed by barge for land reclamation by controlled tipping at Pitsea. No recovery or diversion of any goods whatsoever takes place at the central tipping site. Food and Drugs Act, 1955—Section 26 During the year, sixteen persons were notified to be suffering from food poisoning. Of this number, two were members of the same family, and the remainder were single notifications, though one was concerned in a larger outbreak affecting children and staff at a school outside Westminster. Of those notified, the causative organism was indicated in six cases at the time of notification. Nine other outbreaks came to the notice of the Public Health Department during the year. The minimum number involved was two persons and the maximum 41. In two outbreaks it was possible to trace the causative organism, and in one other the probable cause. Bacteriological examination of faecal specimens or swabs taken from those affected, from food handlers, or from articles of kitchen ware, occasionally suggest a cause of infection, but great care is necessary in the interpretation of results. 41 By the time news of an outbreak is received, any remains of food from the suspected meal (which might have assisted in discovering the cause) have usually been destroyed. This cannot be prevented, for no obligation is placed on caterers to retain specimens of meals served, although it is a requirement for meals supplied through the School Meals Service. Immediate notification of cases increases the likelihood of obtaining significant specimens, both from the patient and the kitchen, and thus gives a greater chance of drawing a firm conclusion.

The Act came into force on 31st December, 1956, and under Section 11 local authorities are empowered to create Smoke Control Areas within their districts. In a Smoke Control Area, the occupier of any building for which no exemption has been granted, from which smoke is emitted in contravention of that section, is guilty of an offence for which the maximum penalty is £10 for each day on which the offence is committed. Under the Act local authorities have power to grant exemption for a particular building or group of buildings, or a particular fireplace or fireplaces. In general, it is the policy of the City Council not to grant such exemptions. 45 During 1958 the Public Health Committee considered a proposal put forward by the Minister of Housing and Local Government that exemption should be granted in respect of mechanical (underfeed) stokers. These are furnaces so constructed that fuel, in the form of bituminous coal, is fed to the underneath of the fire, combustion taking place on the upper surface. The air for combustion is supplied under pressure through suitably designed apertures. When properly maintained these furnaces are capable of burning bituminous coal smokelessly. The Committee decided that no steps should be taken at the present time to secure the exemption of mechanical (underfeed) stokers from the requirements of the Clean Air Act. At its meeting on 23rd May, 1957, the City Council adopted the recommendation of the Public Health Committee that "without committing itself to any financial obligations at this stage, the Council do agree in principle that its long-term policy should be to transform the whole of the City of Westminster into a Smoke Control Area." Following the recommendation of the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee that there should be some co-ordination in the pattern of Smoke Control Areas throughout the County of London, the City Council agreed that, in Westminster, Smoke Control Areas should extend westwards from the City's boundaries with the City of London and the Borough of Holborn, and progress in this respect has been made as follows:— (a) The Temple Bar Area (60 acres). This Order was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and became operative on 1st October, 1958. In order to promote interest and co-operation, a letter was sent to every owner and occupier in the Area explaining the purpose of the Order and requesting their co-operation in minimising smoke emissions and thereby making a success of the purpose of the Order. (b) The AdelphiI Whitehall Area (195 acres). The necessary survey and the required statutory notifications were completed by November, 1958. Members of the public were made aware of the proposals by advertisements in the Press, and by the display of posters which, in addition to the letterpress, contained a map delineating the boundaries of the proposed Area. No objections were lodged, and the Order was duly submitted to the Minister for confirmation; it is hoped that the Order will come into operation on 1st October, 1959. It is of interest to note that the part of the River Thames nominally within the City boundaries, i.e., from the Embankment to mid-river, is, where smoke control is concerned, under the jurisdiction of the Port of London Health Authority and is therefore not a part of these Smoke Control Areas. 46 (c) The Covent Garden Area (100 acres). Approval in principle has been given by the Minister of Housing and Local Government for the required survey to be made of this third Smoke Control Area. Work in connection with the survey is in progress, and it is hoped that the Order will come into force on 1st October, 1960. Further Operation of Clean Air Act. 1st June, 1958, was the second "appointed day" when section 1 of the Clean Air Act, 1956, came into operation. This section prohibits the emission of dark smoke from chimneys anywhere, subject to certain exemptions which are dealt with in the Dark Smoke (Permitted Period) Regulations, 1958. On the same day the Alkali, etc., Works Order, 1958, made under the Clean Air Act, came into force, whereby such works are made subject to the provisions of section 17 of the Clean Air Act, which provides that where all reasonable steps have been taken to minimise smoke emission, no action can be taken. Grants towards adaptations or alterations. In connection with the creation of Smoke Control Areas, provision is made in the Act for a grant to be paid to householders towards the cost of any necessary alterations or adaptations to their existing equipment to enable them to use an authorised fuel. During 1958 two applications for grant were received from residents in the Temple Bar Smoke Control Area, in one case for the replacement of open fire grates, and in the other for replacement of a coal-burning cooking range with one to burn smokeless fuel. The amount of grant which can be claimed by the householder is 70 per cent, of the total cost incurred. Forty per cent, of the total is subsequently recoverable by the local authority from the Central Government. Consultant Panel In June, 1958, the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee notified constituent Councils that they had asked the Advisory Body of Borough Engineers to submit to them the names of suitable persons who would be willing to act as consultants to assist metropolitan borough councils in the administration of the Clean Air Act. Notification was later received that a Consultant Panel had been set up. 47 Analysis of Legal Proceedings, 1958. Fines Costs £ s. d. £ s. d. Food and Drugs Act, 1955.

Eighty-seven deep wells were in use at 31st December, 1958. In 84 of these wells, the water is used for domestic purposes. In the remainder, one supply is used for cooling purposes, one for supplying boilers and one as a stand by in case of fire. Satisfactory reports were received of 51 bacteriological examinations and 24 chemical analyses of water from these wells. 48 Disinfection, Disinfestation and Cleansing of PersonsArrangements with the Holborn Borough Council The arrangement between the City Council and the Holborn Borough Council whereby the latter undertook to carry out, on agreed terms, the work of disinfection, disinfestation and cleansing of persons, and the provision of the necessary transport therefor, continued. The arrangement came into operation on the 3rd September, 1956, and is working satisfactorily with resulting economies to both Councils. The following is a summary of the work carried out for Westminster during the year:— Disinfection and Disinfestation Rooms Articles Articles Washed Books Disinfection 159 15,732 233 218 Disinfestation 511 2,097 - - Cleansing of Persons Scabies Head Lice Body Lice Treatments Treatments Treatments Men 150 191 Women 6 2 13 Children 12 — — Burial or Cremation of the Dead Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, it is the duty of the City Council as a Sanitary Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or is found dead in the area, where no other arrangements have been made for the disposal of the body. The Council is empowered to recover the cost of burial from the estate of the deceased, and is eligible to receive payments in respect of 49 the cost of such burial from death grants payable under the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946. Where persons without known relatives die in the City, it is frequently necessary not only to arrange for their burial, but to dispose of the contents of their homes. This is done in consultation with the Treasury Solicitor. Such action is necessary to enable the proceeds to be applied towards the cost of burial and also to avoid rent accruing and to release the accommodation for housing purposes as early as possible. During the year 43 burials were undertaken by the City Council, 42 in its Cemetery at Hanwell, and one at Kensal Green Cemetery, for which special arrangements were made. The requests for the burials were received from the following sources:— H.M. Coroner 21 Relatives of the deceased 12 Friends of the deceased 1 Hospitals in the City 8 General Practitioner 1* 43 * Private grave at Kensal Green Cemetery. Coroner's Court and Mortuary During 1958 287 bodies were received in the Mortuary on Coroner's Warrants, etc. Twenty-one bodies were admitted to await burial. Number of Cases Inquest cases 68 Non-inquest cases 219 Post-mortem examinations held 261 Causes of death in the foregoing were as under:— Accidental drowning 1 Found drowned 8 Suicide by drowning 8 „ by other means 20 Accidents— Street 6 Domestic 5 Others 4 Natural causes 220 Misadventure 3 Murder 1 Miscellaneous causes 11 50 Mortuary Accommodation—Arrangement with Holborn Borough Council The City Council and the Holborn Borough Council, with the approval of the London County Council, made arrangements whereby bodies from Holborn, which were not the concern of H.M. Coroner, were accommodated at the City Council's Mortuary in Horseferry Road whilst awaiting burial. The arrangement came into operation on the 3rd September, 1956, and two bodies were received in the mortuary during 1958.

Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1950. The undermentioned items call for particular comment. General Standard of Health. The general standard of health of the inhabitants of the Borough continued to be satisfactory. The total number of notifications of compulsorily notifiable disease showed a considerable decrease as compared with last year, mainly due to the decreased number of cases of Measles. Vital Statistics. The Population for the year is given by the Registrar-General as 74,050 as compared with 74,640 for the previous year. The Birth Rate for the year is 16.7 per 1,000 estimated population, that of the previous year being 18.3, and of the country as a whole 15.8. The Infantile Mortality Rate is 27.6, the rate for England and Wales being 29.8. The Recorded Death Rate for the Borough is 10.8 per 1,000 estimated population, that for England and Wales 11.6, a decrease in comparison with the previous year due to the decrease in deaths from diseases of the circulatory and respiratory systems. Housing. The provision of adequate housing accommodation is still a major problem in the Borough but in this connection the Council is making every effort consistent with its resources to improve the situation. During the year work has progressed on the Lansbury Neighbourhood in which the exhibition of Live Architecture will form part of the Festival of Britain Exhibition and in this connection it is possible to place on record that the efforts being made to improve the environmental conditions in this badly blitzed borough are taking shape and will provide on completion for a healthier and happier existence to those who withstood the trials of an intensive air war so bravely and who have suffered so much as a result thereof. A survey of two areas included in the preliminary survey of 1949 has been completed and indications as to procedure given. —6— Food Hygiene. The activities of the department to stimulate improved standards of hygiene in all food establishments and in those taking part in the production, handling and distribution of foodstuffs have continued throughout the year and have included an exhibition of educational films both at the local cinemas and food factories at which short addresses have in addition been given to employees. It is gratifying to note that included among the recommendations of the Catering Trade Working Party, whose report is now receiving consideration by the Central Government, is one which recommends the registration of all food premises as a prerequisite to the improvement of food hygiene standards. Rodent Control. The Rodent Control Scheme continued to operate successfully during the year. Sewer Maintenance Treatments were again carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. In conclusion, I wish to express my thanks to the Council for the interest shown in the activities of the Public Health Department, to my colleagues in other departments for their co-operation and to my own staff for unfailing loyalty and assistance. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, W. T. DONOVAN, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1951. —7— SECTION A. STATISTICS OF THE AREA.

CLOSING ORDERS. During 1950, as a result of Police Court proceedings instituted in accordance with the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, by the Department to secure the abatement of nuisances, the Magistrate made 31 Closing Orders in respect of certain premises in the Borough. In addition, in 9 instances Closing Orders in respect of part of the house were made by the Council under the Housing Act, 1936. Included in this category are underground rooms and similar dwellings which do not comply with the regulations under the Housing Act, 1936. UNDERGROUND ROOMS. Arrangements provide for the inspection of such premises and rooms that have been closed as unfit for habitation showed that no insanitary conditions existed therein. HOUSING ACT, 1949.

In the 53 weeks 2588 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 622 deaths having occurred in the Sub.District of Poplar, 1622 in Bromley, and 344 in Bow ; from the 622 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 44 deaths of non.residents, and to the remainder must be added 420 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 998 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1622 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 779 deaths of non. parishioners and adding 224 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub.district will be found to be 1067. From the 344 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 4 non.residents and added 284 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 624 deaths. 8 In dealing separately with the sub.districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II., and III., that in considering the deaths of non.residents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub.districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2588 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 443 deaths of actual nonresidents and 544 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2689 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 998 deaths in Poplar included 8 illegitimate children, 5 male and 3 female ; the 1067 deaths in Bromley included 7 illegitimate children, 5 male and 2 female ; the 624 Bow deaths included 1 illegitimate male child, making a total for the Borough of 16 deaths of illegitimate children Males.

At the end of the years 1898, 1899 and 1900 there was a gain of females from the Sub.Districts of Poplar and Bromley. In the Borough for the years 1901.1909 and 1911.1912 there was also a gain of females, but for the year 1910 the males gained over the females, 9 The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 29 years (see page 2) :— Borough of County of Poplar.

The 588 deaths of infants under one year of age include deaths in outlying institutions and allow for deductions of non.residents. The actual deaths inside the Borough without deducting non.residents and not including deaths occurring in outlying institutions were 499—148 Poplar, 249 Bromley and 102 Bow. ** See Health Visitor's Report (page 258). Mortality rate among infants visited was 90.10 per 1000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough, and the rate refers to those born in 1912. In 1911 the rate was 115.62, a year when diarrhoea was prevalent. It will be seen that the rate for 1912 was even lower. J In the County of London during the year 1913 there were 112,637 children born, of whom 11,869 died under one year of age. " The rate in 1910 was only 103 per 1,000 births. This is the lowest London rate recorded, and is 29 per 1,000 below the average in the preceding 10 years."—Registrar.General. 13 Notification of Births Act, 1907. During the year 4,650 notifications w ere received under the Notification of Births Act, 1907. National Conference on Infantile Mortality. An English Speaking Conference on Infant Mortality, convened by the National Association for the Prevention of Infant Mortality, was held at Westminster on August 4th and 5th. Councillor the Rev. W. H. Hunt and the Medical Officer of Health were appointed to attend the Conference. The first resolution was: "That this conference urges that the Maternity Benefit be made the property of the mother, both in practice and in law." Resolution carried with absolute unanimity. The second resolution was: "That in view of the damage liable to be wrought in growing girls by injudicious stress of education, especially during puberty and adolescence, this conference feels bound to deprecate any form of education for girls which pays insufficient attention to establishing good bodily health and development and complete fitness for maternity and the practical care of the home." Carried unanimously. The third resolution was: "That this conference urges upon the Government the necessity, in the interests of both mother and child, of legislating for the registration of stillbirths."Carried unanimously. The fourth resolution was: "That this conference urges upon the Government the necessity for more complete medical certification of death, and that the medical death certificates should be forwarded to the registrars as confidential documents under sealed cover." Carried. Resolution five was as follows: "That the time has arrived for steps to be taken with a view to securing the better training of women who apply for the certificate of the Central Midwives Board." Carried. The three following resolutions, submitted by the Chairman, were carried unanimously:— "That this Conference requests the Executive Committee to communicate with the General Medical Council and the degree and licence conferring bodies with a view to infant hygiene being given a more important place in the medical curriculum " 14 "In view of the large percentage of stillbirths and infant deaths directly attributable to venereal diseases, and considering that infant blindness and other congenital defects are in many cases due to the same cause, the English Speaking Conference on Infantile Mortality urges the respecive Governments of the countries therein represented each to appoint a Commission to inquire into the causes of prevalence, the provision of treatment, and the possibility of the prevention of these diseases." "That the attention of the Board of Education be drawn to the extreme desirability of making the grant earned by ' recognised ' Infant Welfare Centres depend in future on their efficiency on the number of registered attendances of the mothers at consultations, classes and talks; and on the number of homes visits paid under adequate supervision." Dr. Chalmers read the following resolution :— " That it be referred to the Executive Committee to take whatever steps are necessary in order to secure that no microscopical examination of milk for tubercle bacilli, provided it is negative, be accepted as final without confirmation by inoculation tests." Carried. The Conference also passed a resolution urging that the Milk Bill should be presented to Parliament, and passed with as little delay as possible. The Chairman ruled the following resolution out of order, because it was quite germane to the proceedings : " That in the opinion of this conference it is of vital importance to the nation that scientific and medical research be instituted with regard to the cause and prevention of measles, and as to the possibility of rendering children immune from such disease." OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM. Notifications ; The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1914. Notifications of Ophthalmia Neonatorum. Forty.seven cases of Ophthalmia Neonatorum were notified during the year, see Tables XXV..XXVIII., 24 Poplar, 17 Bromley and 6 Bow. Upon receipt of a notification the case is immediately visited by one of the Health Visitors. 15 The Public Health (Ophthalmia Neonatorum) Regulations, 1914. The Local Government Board issued an Order, dated 6th February, 1914, under Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, extending the compulsory notification of the disease to every sanitary district in England and Wales. The regulations require that certain additional information shall be given in each case beyond that required in connection with notifications under the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act. In districts in which the disease is already notifiable (Poplar being one of the districts) a medical practitioner when giving a notification is required by the Regulations to furnish the additional information to which reference has been made. By Article VI. every certified midwife attending on a child whom she suspects to be suffering from the disease is required to furnish a notification unless the case has already been notified by a medical practitioner. The order will come into force on the 1st April, 1914.* The Board were advised that general notification of this disease is desirable. A large proportion of the blindness contracted in childhood is due to the neglect of proper precautions against the disease, and, in the Board's view, it is important that Medical Officers of Health should have early information of all cases.

Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils with the London County Council. The Public Health Committee of the London County Council desired to have an opportunity of conferring with representatives of the London sanitary authorities with regard to the treatment of Tuberculosis within the Comity of London, and invited the Council to appoint one member with the Medical Officer, to attend a Conference on the subject on the 28th February. D 36 The Public Health and Housing Committee appointed Mr. Councillor R. H. Green to attend the Conference with the Medical Officer of Health. The Greenwich Borough Council, following the Conference of Metropolitan Borough Councils with the London County Council on the subject of the treatment of tuberculosis, adopted the following resolutions, viz.:— "(1) That, in the opinion of this Council, there is no advantage (but, on the contrary, definite disadvantage) in constituting the London County Council or any other Central Body, the Authority for dispensing relief and medical benefit to Tuberculosis patients except in Sanatoria. Owing to the vast area and the immense population of the County it would be impossible to avoid great delay in dealing with cases unless a special department were set up with a large staff and consequent heavy expense, while, if the Borough be taken as a unit both for Dispensary treatment and for recommending patients for Institutional treatment, there will exist the expert staff and machinery for dealing promptly with cases as they arise. (2) That the Sanatoria should be provided by the County Council or other Body on the same lines as the County Asylums are at present provided, and that admission thereto should be on somewhat similar lines to those at present adopted for admission to hospital in cases of infectious disease. As a safeguard (if thought desirable) against unnecessary resort to the Sanatorium it could be provided that the Local Authority sending unsuitable cases should pay the cost of receiving, maintenance and removal. (3) That the present control of the Local Government Board and the requirement that they shall approve the arrangements of the Borough Council are sufficient to ensure that such arrangements will be suitable, and that efficient Medical Officers will be appointed. (4) That all Government Grants for Dispensary purposes should, in the opinion of this Council, be paid direct to Borough Councils, and not through the London County Council. (5) That the President of the Local Government Board be asked to receive a Deputation of Representatives of this and other Borough Councils in support of the views expressed in the foregoing Resolutions. 37 (6) That a copy of the above Report and Resolutions be forwarded to each of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, and that they be asked (if they concur) to pass similar Resolutions and to forward the same to the President of the Local Government Board, and to appoint two Representatives to join the proposed Deputation." The resolutions embodied the general agreement of the representatives of the Borough Councils at the Conference as against the views expressed on behalf of the London County Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion the resolutions adopted by the Greenwich Borough Council should be supported, and recommended the Council:— That the resolutions of the Greenwich Borough Council, as stated, be approved, and the Local Government Board so informed; and that the Council's representatives at the London County Council Conference, viz., Mr. Councillor R. H. Green and the Medical Officer of Health, be appointed to represent the Council on the proposed Deputation to the President of the Local Government Board. Treatment of Tuberculosis. Late Brunswick Pier Hotel and Sanatoria and Hospital Accommodation . Early in the year the attention of the General Purposes Committee was called to the number of insured persons awaiting removal to Sanatoria for Consumptives. These were 6 in Hackney, 15 in Stepney and 29 in Poplar awaiting accommodation. The General Purposes Committee was of opinion it is desirable some provision should be made for such persons until proper Sanatoria accommodation can be found, and thought the Blackwall branch of the Poplar and Stepney Sick Asylum would afford suitable provision for cases pending removal to Sanatoria. The Genera] Purposes Committee recommended the Council:— That the London County Council and the Insurance Committee for the County of London be urged to take immediate steps to secure provision of the necessary sanatoria accommodation for consumptives, both insured persons and their dependents, and d2 38 that the disused Blackwall Asylum, formerly the Brunswick Hotel, which is situated in an isolated position open to the River and the Docks, be recommended as suitable for the purpose of the temporary accommodation and treatment of patients while waiting for vacancies in sanatoria; and that copies of this resolution be forwarded to the President of the Local Government Board, the National Insurance Commissioners, and the Councils of the East London Boroughs. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Borough of Holborn, Council Offices, 197, High Holborn, W.C. 11th July, 1913. Dear Sir, Treatment of Tuberculosis. Sanatoria and Hospital Accommodation. The Holborn Borough Council at their meeting on Wednesday last had under consideration the resolution of the London County Council of the 17th June, on the question of the arrangements to be made for the provision of Sanatoria and Hospital accommodation for cases of Tuberculosis in the County of London, when the following resolutions were passed:— (а) That the Council should express its agreement with the recommendation of the Public Health Committee of the London County Council adopted by that Council at its meeting on the 17th June, 1913, that in order to allow of a comprehensive scheme for the treatment of Tuberculosis in London, and in view of the fact that the London County Council has hitherto not been an authority providing treatment for tuberculous persons, and that the Metropolitan Asylums Board has available, the machinery necessary for the provision of residential treatment, it is essential that the Board should be enabled to become an authority providing institutions for residential treatment for tuberculous persons of all classes. (b) That having regard to the very large number of cases of infectious sickness removed from Metropolitan Boroughs 39 for treatment in the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and to the fact that the Metropolitan Borough Councils are the authorities in the Metropolis primarily charged with the prevention of infectious diseases in London, it is desirable that the constitution of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should be revised, with a view to the Metropolitan Borough Councils being represented on the Board so that the local sanitary authorities may be brought into closer relationship with the Hospital Authority in the Metropolis. I was instructed to forward copies of these resolutions to the Local Government Board, the London County Council, the Metropolitan Asylums Board and the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and to ask the latter to take similar action, if they are in agreement with the views of the Council on the matter. Yours truly, LIONEL WALFORD, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council, that the action of the Holborn Borough Council in this matter be supported. Treatment of Tuberculosis in London. Tuberculosis Dispensaries, etc. The following letter was considered by the Public Health and Housing Committee:— Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea. Town Hall, King's Road, S.W. 14th July, 1913. Dear Sir, Tuberculosis Dispensaries. The Public Health Committee reported to the Council, at their last meeting, that it had come to their knowledge that the 40 London County Council are preparing a scheme to provide tuberculosis dispensaries over the whole of London, and to deprive Borough Councils of all control over these institutions, while calling upon such Councils to provide the necessary funds to carry on the proposed dispensaries. The Council passed the following resolutions with regard thereto:— (а) That a very strong protest be made to the Local Government Board, the London Comity Council, and the Insurance Commissioners, against the attempt that is being made to infringe upon the rights and duties of the Borough Councils in this matter. (b) That a copy of this resolution be communicated to the Local Government Board, the London County Council, the Insurance Commissioners and the other Metropolitan Borough Councils. If in agreement with Resolution "a," I am to suggest the expediency of your Council adopting a similar resolution. Yours faithfully, T. Holland, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the protest of the Chelsea Borough Council be supported. The following copy of letter addressed by the Local Government Board to the London County Council was forwarded for the information of the Council, viz.:— Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W. 24th September, 1913. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to advert to Mr. Bird's letter of the 31st July last in regard to the arrangements 41 to be made for providing institutions for the treatment of tuberculosis in London. The Board retain the views which they expressed in their letter of the 11th December last, to which Mr. Bird's letter refers. They consider that the London County Council should be the Tuberculosis Authority for the Metropolis, and that through the County Council all the various agencies should be properly coordinated so as to form parts of a complete scheme of institutional treatment for this disease. The Departmental Committee on Tuberculosis pointed out that a complete scheme would comprise dispensaries and residential institutions, and they suggested that it should be considered whether in London the dispensaries should not be provided by the Metropolitan Borough Councils. It is essential that the dispensary arrangements should be closely related to the preventive work which it is the duty of the Sanitary Authority to carry out, and there are many advantages in regarding the Metropolitan Borough as the unit area for dispensaries. In their letter of the 11th December last the Board informed the County Council that they had acted on the view suggested by the Departmental Committee, and that they had invited the Metropolitan Borough Councils to provide or arrange for the provision of these institutions. The Board agree with the view contained in the resolution of the County Council that all possible use should be made of existing institutions, and in their communications with the Metropolitan Borough Councils they have throughout pressed this view. In regard to this point the Board may observe that, in their opinion, any hospitals or other voluntary institutions which are to be recognised as forming part of the Tuberculosis scheme for London should be willing to work in close co-operation with the local authority. Although the Board have invited the Metropolitan Borough Councils to provide or arrange for the provision of Dispensaries to serve the various boroughs, they would welcome any suggestions which the London County Council might be able to make for securing greater efficiency in this branch of the work. The Board agree with the County Council in thinking that as far as practicable 42 arrangements should be made for referring any specially difficult cases from a municipal or voluntary dispensary to some general or special hospital. In particular, the Board would be glad to learn what general rules the County Council would suggest should be observed in the working of the various local dispensaries so that the work performed by these institutions may properly form part of the whole scheme for London. Brief particulars of the Dispensary arrangements which have already been approved are enclosed. The Board would have wished to consult the London County Council before approving any Dispensary arrangements, but in some cases the urgency of the matter has prevented the Board from taking this course. In the further development of the Dispensary schemes, the Board propose to give the London County Council an opportunity of making any observations which they may wish to make in regard to any new proposals. As regards residential accommodation, the Board consider that upon the County Council should rest the responsibility of securing that the necessary accommodation is available. Much of this accommodation can no doubt be economically and efficiently provided by the Metropolitan Asylums Board in pursuance of agreement between the London County Council and that body. It may also be possible that the County Council could arrange with some of the great London hospitals to provide beds for special cases. So far as insured persons and their dependents are concerned, agreements with the Metropolitan Asylums Board may be made in pursuance of the provisions of Section 39 of the National Insurance Act, 1913. As regards the rest of the community, the Board are disposed to the view that arrangements with the Metropolitan Asylums Board could also be made by the County Council under the provision of Section 3 of the Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act, 1913, and Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The accommodation to be provided is to serve both the insured and the non-insured, and the London County Council should consult with the London Insurance Committee as to the arrangements which are required for insured persons, and as to the payments which the London Insurance Committee will make for the services provided for such persons. 43 The Departmental Committee made the suggestion that each area should have a Chief Clinical Tuberculosis Officer who should also act as Medical Adviser to the Insurance Committee of that area, and the Board would suggest that the London County Council should carefully consider whether this arrangement might not be carried out in the case of London. This Officer might also, in consultation with the other medical men concerned, supervise and generally direct the selection of cases to receive residential treatment. As regards the financial arrangements to be made, the Board would remind the County Council that they have already invited their observations on this question, and particularly on the point whether the arrangements with the Insurance Committee for Dispensary treatment under the Insurance Act should be made by the County Council or by the various Borough Councils, and whether the expenditure should be locally or centrally defrayed. It seems to the Board to be desirable that the cost of the scheme should, at any rate to a large extent, be borne by London as a whole. Inasmuch, however, as the Dispensaries are to be provided locally, some proportion of the cost of providing these institutions should be charged locally. / It would simplify matters if, as regards the treatment of insured persons, the County Council were recognised as the providing authority for all the institutional treatment required, whether in Dispensaries or other institutions, so that the London Insurance Committee could make one agreement with the London County Council in regard to all the services rendered to insured persons. Although Dispensaries are to be provided locally, it would seem to be practicable to regard the London County Council, for the purpose of such agreement, as the one providing Authority, if they were to make supplementary agreements with the other Authorities for the provision of dispensary services. Such supplementary agreements would afford a means by which the charge for dispensary services might be to some extent equalised as regards the Metropolis, and they would also facilitate the arrangements for securing uniform working. The Board direct me to add that they would be happy to arrange for a further conference with representatives of the County Council if it should be considered that this would facilitate the formulation of a general scheme for the Metropolis. 44 A copy of this letter has been sent to the Common Council, to the Metropolitan Borough Councils, and to the Metropolitan Asylums Board. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, F. J. Willis, Assistant Secretary. The Clerk to the London County Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee deferred consideration of the matter pending formulation of the scheme of the London County Council. [Copy.] London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, 11th December, 1913. Sir, On the 8th ultimo I forwarded for the information of the Borough Council a copy of a resolution passed by the Council with reference to the payment of grants out of the County Fund in relief of the amount which would otherwise fall on the local rate in respect of the dispensary treatment of uninsured persons suffering from Tuberculosis. I am now directed to draw the attention of the Borough Council to the following resolutions of the Council with regard to the treatment of tuberculosis in London:- (a) That any comprehensive scheme for the treatment of tuberculosis in London shall provide for the undermentioned principles to be observed in any local scheme which the Council will approve for the provision of dispensary treatment :— (i) The Council must be satisfied that the premises to be utilised as a dispensary are suitable for the purpose. 45 (ii) The scheme must include provision, either in the dispensary, or at a hospital working in connection with the dispensary, for the diagnosis not only of ordinary straightforward cases, but also for incipient, anomalous and difficult cases, specially referred on the ground of difficulty of diagnosis. (iii) The physician in charge of the dispensary (or "tuberculosis officer") must be a man of experience, not only in dealing with tuberculosis affections, but also in general medicine. (iv) Proper records and statistics in connection with the work of the dispensary shall be provided of the nature and in the form required by the Council and approved by the Local Government Board. (v) The physician in charge of the dispensary shall supply to the medical officer of health of the borough from which the patients are drawn such information as the medical officer of health may reasonably require, and the county medical officer of health shall be entitled to receive this information from the borough medical officer of health. The physician in charge of the dispensary shall also furnish the requisite information to any medical practitioner carrying out domiciliary treatment, or in a case which is referred to a sanatorium, to the medical officer of that institution. (vi) The scheme shall include provision for home visitation of patients, either by the dispensary physician or by the medical officer of health of the borough and his staff, and for the examination of the dispensary physician of such cases as the medical officer of health or a medical practitioner may require, either at the dispensary or in the home of suspects and contacts. (vii) The scheme shall be conducted with reasonable economy, and the arrangements and expenditure shall be annually submitted to the Council for its approval. (viii) The scheme shall provide for distinguishing clearly between the cost of treating insured and uninsured persons, having regard to the opinion expressed by the Council that insured persons should not be paid for out of the rates. 46 (6) That it be suggested to the local sanitary authorities that they should make arrangements to pay for patients residing in the districts under their respective jurisdiction, attending dispensaries attached to hospitals in any part of the Administrative County of London. (c) That, in the opinion of the Council, it is essential that in connection with the treatment of tuberculosis in London:— (i) All possible use should be made of existing institutions; and (ii) Approval should not be given to any scheme which fails to provide for each dispensary being linked up with a hospital to which special cases shall be referred for consultation or treatment, residential or otherwise; and that the Local Government Board be so informed. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Lawrence Gomme, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. On the 19th December a circular letter was issued by the Local Government Board, addressed to Metropolitan Borough Councils, with regard to the arrangements to be made for the institutional treatment of Tuberculosis in London. The circular letter stated that the Board had invited Metropolitan Borough Councils to provide or arrange for the provision of dispensaries for the treatment of Tuberculosis in their Boroughs, and also that voluntary institutions should be recognised as forming part of the Tuberculosis Scheme for London, to work in close co-operation with the local authority. The communication also stated that any local institution carrying out dispensary treatment should refer specially difficult cases, for consultative purposes to appointed hospitals, and 12 hospitals with medical schools, including the London Hospital, are mentioned. The Scheme for the provision of dispensaries in London includes the treatment at a voluntary or Borough Council dispensary, of any person suffering or suspected to be suffering from Tuberculosis, provided that 47 in the case of a voluntary dispensary the rules which the Board may find it necessary to make are carried out and the work is done in co-operation with the London County Council and the Borough Council; that arrangements are made to include any voluntary dispensary in the scheme of the Borough Council, in which case an agreement should be entered into with the authorities of the dispensary indicating the nature and extent of the services which they will provide, and specifying the amount of the payment the Borough Council will make to them; and a draft of any such agreement should be submitted to the Local Government Board and their approval obtained before the agreement is executed. A copy of the draft agreement should also be sent to the London County Council when it is submitted to the Local Government Board. The voluntary dispensary should be affiliated to a general hospital or hospital for consumption to which specially difficult cases would be referred for diagnosis or treatment. Beds should be available for watching cases and determining the form of treatment best adapted to the patients' needs. The Board consider that these beds should be provided not at the dispensary but by the London County Council. It is essential that arrangements should be made for the complete co-ordination of the work of the dispensary with the preventive work of the Borough Council and their officers under the Tuberculosis Regulations, 1912. The circular letter defines in detail the manner in which the co-ordinating work of the dispensary and the public health department should be carried out. In regard to finance, it appears to the Board that where the scheme of the Borough Council includes any voluntary dispensary it is desirable that the contributions of the Borough Council towards the expenses of the dispensary should be made in respect of the whole of the population of the borough, and that the payments of the London Insurance Committee for the dispensary treatment of insured persons should be made to the Borough Council. The Government Grant towards the annual cost of the scheme is limited to 50 per cent. of the amount chargeable to the rates, and no portion of the grant will be payable direct to the voluntary institutions. The Borough Council is to be regarded as the providing authority for dispensaries, although the dispensary which serves the Borough is a voluntary organisation, and the dispensary is to serve the whole of the community, including insured persons. 48 The Borough Council is to arrange with the London Insurance Committee as to the contributions to be paid by the latter in respect of insured persons, and this should take the form of a lump sum rather than for fees per case. On November 4th the London County Council resolved that under certain conditions they are prepared to contribute up to 50 per cent. of the net cost of the dispensary treatment of uninsured persons in the City of London and on the Metropolitan Boroughs after deducting the amount of the Government Grant. The scheme of the Borough Council should be forwarded to the London County Council when it is submitted to the Local Government Board, as well as the scheme for linking up the dispensary with the general hospital or hospital for consumption. The Board should be informed as soon as possible of the arrangements proposed for completing the scheme. The expenditure of the Borough Council on their dispensary scheme after deducting the payment made by the London Insurance Committee in respect of the treatment of insured persons, and any other contributions, will be met as follows:— (а) 50 per cent. from the Local Government Board. (b) 25 per cent. from the London County Council. (c) 25 per cent. out of the rates of the Borough. When preparing the scheme the Borough Council should communicate with the London Insurance Committee with a view to arrangements being made between the two bodies as to the terms on which the services of the scheme will be available for insured persons residing in the Borough; the Insurance Committee will inform the Insurance Commissioners of the arrangements proposed, and the Council should send similar information to the Local Government Board: the arrangements should not be finally completed until the Local Government Board have expressed their concurrence. The approval of the dispensaries is to be given by the Local Government Board under the National Insurance Act, under certain conditions which are set out in the letter. With respect to the provision of residential institutions both for insured and uninsured persons, the London County Council is prepared to arrange for this, and in the case of insured persons the cost will be borne by the Insurance Committee. 49 So far as the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar is concerned, there is the voluntary dispensary situate in 135, Bow Road, called the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption, which is supported entirely by voluntary contributions. This institution is working in coordination with the Public Health Department of the Borough; has been recognised by the Borough Council as the Tuberculosis Dispensary of the Borough, the Council having appointed two of its members as representatives on the Executive Committee of the Dispensary, and in addition, the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough is ex officio a member of the Committee; and, further, the Dispensary has been approved by the Local Government Board, and has been in full working order for nearly two years. The Staff consists of a principal medical officer (appointed on the lines of the "Astor" report), an assistant medical officer, a nurse (or health visitor), assistant nurse, dispenser, clerk and caretaker. The medical officers of this institution are not attached to the Borough Council Staff, but the Medical Officer of Health suggested that as matters existed the Chief Medical Officer of the Dispensary (the Tuberculosis Officer) might well be appointed Deputy Medical Officer of Health for the Borough, he being fully qualified to act as a Medical Officer of Health in the Metropolis, and the Medical Officer of Health of Poplar, at present, having no deputy as he should have. In some other districts where the dispensary is provided by the Local Authority, and the officers appointed by that body, the Tuberculosis Officer is also the Assistant Medical Officer of Health. As the Dispensary is to serve the community of the Borough as a whole, including insured and non-insured persons, and the payments of the London Insurance Committee for treatment are to be made to the Borough Council, it appears that the Borough Council should take care that an adequate sum of money is provided by the Insurance Committee for the County of London for the treatment of insured persons at the Dispensary. Up to 30th June, 1913, the Dispensary had treated 243 insured persons whose attendances had numbered 1,564. The Dispensary's applications for what is considered an adequate grant from the London County Insurance Committee on account of this work having failed, the Dispensary ceased to treat insured persons as from 30th June, 1913, and it will be remembered that on July 3rd of that year the Borough, upon the reception of the report of the Public Health and Housing Committee, adopted an amendment as follows:— "And that a protest be made to the Insurance Commissioners against the benefits of the Tuberculosis Dispensary being denied to insured persons, and urging that the necessary funds should be provided to enable the Dispensary to treat such cases." 50 It appears, therefore, that the scheme for Dispensary Treatment of Tuberculosis cases in the Borough of Poplar is being fully carried out on approved lines, with the exception that the Dispensary is not affiliated to a general or consumption hospital to which specially difficult cases can be referred for diagnosis or treatment. Under the present administration there is no doubt that if any such cases are discovered, they will, if necessary, be referred to a general hospital, but the Principal Medical Officer is quite competent to undertake the diagnosis and treatment thereof, more especially as the Dispensary is fitted with an X-ray apparatus, and is equipped with all the latest up-to-date means of diagnosing Tuberculosis both clinically and bacteriologically. The records of the cases treated at the Dispensary are all up-to-date and the particulars there of fully entered. The Council is under an obligation to provide for the Borough, Dispensary treatment for Tuberculosis, and this may be accomplished by:- 1. Provision of a Dispensary by the Council. 2. Arrangement with one of the London Hospitals. 3. Arrangement with Stepney for a joint Dispensary. 4. Agreement with the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption, Bow Road. The Bow Road Tuberculosis Dispensary has been recognised by the Borough Council and approved by the Local Government Board. The Council is represented on the management Committee of the Dispensary by two elected representatives, and the Medical Officer of Health, ex officio. The Dispensary is fully staffed and equipped with all necessary modern appliances. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion that the most advantageous course, in the interests of the Borough, would be for the Council to enter into an agreement with the Committee of the Bow Road Dispensary, and it is only by such agreement that the Government grant and London County Council and Insurance Committee's contributions, to the cost of maintenance of the Dispensary, can be made available for the existing Dispensary, thus enabling the Dispensary Committee to continue and extend its activities in connection with provision of milk and other necessaries in suitable cases, open-air treatment in the country, loans of beds and bedding, etc., and other facilities for treatment of consumptive cases which would probably not be a legal charge on a rate established institution. 51 The course suggested would also avoid the heavy capital outlay necessary in the establishment by the Council of its own Dispensary (£2,000). It would be necessary for arrangements to be made with the London Insurance Committee for treatment of insured persons, on terms to be agreed. A contribution of £400 per annum was suggested as a reasonable sum. The amount would be a matter of arrangement, but the Committee understood that the Insurance Committee offered £200 per annum to the Dispensary, but that, in view of the conditions laid down and consequent inadequacy of this amount, treatment of insured cases, as such, was discontinued at the Dispensary on the 30th June last. Assuming a minimum contribution of £1,200 per annum by the Council to the Dispensary, and a payment of £400 by the London Insurance Committee for insured cases, the actual net charge on local rates would be £200 per annum, thus:— Alternative Figures. Council's contribution to Dispensary £1,200 £1,600 Less—London Insurance Committee's contribution for insured persons, to be agreed (say) 400 200 800 1,400 Less—Government Grant 50 per cent. 400 700 400 700 Less—London County Council contribution, 50 per cent. of balance 200 350 Council's net contribution £200 £350 All the suggestions of the Local Government Board are already in full operation at the Bow Road Dispensary, with the exception of reference of special cases for consultative purposes to an appointed hospital, this having hitherto been considered unnecessary in view of the fact that the doctor in charge of the Dispensary is himself an expert in consumptive cases. Any agreement would require to be submitted to the London County Council and to receive the sanction of the Local Government Board before completion. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council—That agreement with the Committee of the Bow Road Dispensary for treatment of insured and non-insured cases of Tuberculosis E 52 in the Borough on the lines suggested, be approved in principle, and that it be referred to the General Purposes Committee to negotiate the terms of such Agreement and report thereon to the Council. The Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption. The Dispensary has now been in full working order for nearly two years, and Dr. Cullen, the Tuberculosis Officer, reported that 45 consumptive patients during the year 1913 had been brought back to working capacity as the result of treatment at the Dispensary, 16 of these patients were under Tuberculin injections. No deaths under tuberculin treatment occurred. In all probability, but for the Dispensary many of these patients would have been dead, and their dependents on the rates. It was reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee that an Assistant Medical Officer and a Dispenser had been appointed at the Tuberculosis Dispensary, Bow Road, and that the Executive Committee of the Dispensary had agreed to undertake, free of charge, the examination of sputum samples submitted by the Public Health Department, and which were examined by the Lister Institute at a cost of about 4s. per sample. Since 13th March, 1913,120 specimens of Sputum have been examined at the Dispensary for the Public Health Department free of cost. Number of Notifications (actual cases) received from the Borough of Poplar Dispensary for the Prevention of Consumption during the period from 1st January, 1913, to 31st December, 1913:— Age Periods.

There was a total of 8,310 attendances at the Dispensary. Insured persons have not been treated since the 30th June, 1913. This may account for the larger number of females shewn in the table suffering from the disease between the ages of 15—65 years. Tuberculosis Exhibition. The Public Health and Housing Committee recorded an expression of their congratulations to the Dispensary Committee on the success of the Tuberculosis Exhibition, and their appreciation of the value of the Exhibition in connection with the problem of the eradication of Tuberculosis in the Borough. Appointment of Tuberculosis Officer as Deputy Medical Officer of Health. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the suggestion that the doctor in charge of the Bow Road Dispensary should be appointed Deputy Medical Officer for the Borough. It was not proposed that any salary or other allowance should be paid, but the proposed appointment would enable the register of notifications of tuberculosis to be open for inspection by the doctor as Deputy Medical Officer, such inspection being at present contrary to the Local Government Board's regulations unless specially authorised by resolution of the Council. It would be also convenient that a properly qualified deputy should be able to act in case of emergency in the absence of the Medical Officer of Health. The Council resolved— That Mr. James Alfred Patrick Cullen, M.D. (Lond.), M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (Lond.), D.P.H., of the Bow Road Tuberculosis Dispensary, be and is hereby, appointed Deputy Medical Officer of the Borough, and the Local Government Board be so informed. (The confirmation of the Local Government Board has been received.) E 2 54 The District Insurance Committee (Poplar Borough). The General Purposes Committee reported early in the year that the Insurance Committee for the County of London, in pursuance of the provisions of Section 59 (4) of the National Insurance Act, 1911, formulated a scheme for the appointment of District Insurance Committees within the County of London, after consultation with the London County Council. The District Insurance Committee for the Borough will consist of 35 members, 7 of whom are to be appointed by the Borough Council. One of the Council's representatives must be a woman, one a medical practitioner and one the Medical Officer of Health, if willing to serve, and subject to the consent of the Council. The General Purposes Committee recommended the Council that that Councillors Mrs. T. S. Attlee, R. H. Green, A. E. Thorpe (and two others), together with Dr. Jonathan Fearnley and the Medical Officer of Health, be appointed to represent the Council on the District Insurance Committee for the Borough. Councillors M. Dalton and Edwin J. Aldrick were appointed by the Council. Deaths, Tubercular Diseases and Phthisis— Number and Rates see pages 17 and 18. Tuberculosis Order, 1913, see page 176.

If the person dying in an institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (b) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

The percentage on the total (admission) scarlet fever cases was 1.82, diphtheria cases 5.19, and enteric fever cases 13.33. Among the 13 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 1 bronchitis, 3 tonsillitis, 1 rötheln, and 1 septicœmia, 1 case was diphtheria and not scarlet fever. Among the 15 cases wrongly certified as diphtheria were 4 of tonsillitis, 1 Broncho-pneumonia, and 1 laryngitis. 4 cases were scarlet fever and not diphtheria. In the course of the year 1913 no fewer than 2,501 patients* against 1899 in 1912, 2,237 in 1911, 1,723 in 1910, 2,322 in 1909, 2,594 in 1908, 3,109 on 1907, 2,151 in 1906, 2,157 in 1905, 1,993 in 1904, 1,913 in 1903, and 2,108 in 1902, or a percentage on the total admissions of 8.1 in 1912, 10.5 in 1911, 11.2 in 1910, 10.2 in 1909, 9.27 in 1908, 9.7 in 1907, 8.3 in 1906, 9.04 in 1905, 10.7 in 1904, 10.4 in 1903, and 8.6 in 1902 were after admission to the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certificates upon which they were removed to hospital. The number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar for the years 1899— 1913 which were removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals, have been as follows:— Percentage of mistakes in total admissions.

Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever and also sputum from suspected tuberculous patients bacteriologically examined. (See pages 52, 136 and 139.) Arrangements are still made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the medical officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Fever Hospitals at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned or by letter afterwards if the result be not to hand at time of removal, or if the removal has not been effected through the Public Health Department. Infectious Diseases in Milkshops and Homeworkers' Premises. Three cases of scarlet fever, one diphtheria and one erysipelas, were connected with milkshops in Poplar. One case of scarlet fever was connected with a milkshop in Bromley. One case of scarlet fever and two of diphtheria were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected.* Thirty-one premises with outworkers were† connected with infectious cases notified, five in Poplar, eight in Bromley, and eighteen in Bow— twenty scarlet fever, eight diphtheria, and three erysipelas. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Sections 108 and 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Two cases of measles were connected with out-workers' premises—none Poplar, none Bromley, and two Bow. For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 118. Removal Difficulties; Scarcity of Nurses; Metropolitan Asylums Board. On November 1st a letter was received from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board stating that the difficulty experienced by the Managers in obtaining nurses in sufficient numbers to meet the demands *See page 176. † See page 165. 97 made upon the Fever Hospitals owing to the increasing prevalence of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria in London had rendered it impossible for the Managers to admit all cases for whose admission applications had been made, and that during the next few weeks only the most urgent cases should be selected for removal. At the meeting of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, on Saturday, 15th November, a report from the Hospitals Committee was received, in which it was stated that, owing to the unusual incidence of Scarlet Fever this autumn, it had not been found possible to admit immediately every case notified for removal. This was due to the fact that, although there were vacant beds ready for patients, they could not be used, solely in consequence of inability to procure the requisite nursing staff of the lower grades. The Chairman of the Hospitals Committee said he was pleased to be able to say that that morning there was not a single metropolitan case of Scarlet fever awaiting admission. The only case was one from Tottenham. Suggested Metropolitan Ambulance Service. The Wandsworth Borough Council having considered the need of a motor ambulance service in that borough had communicated with the London County Council urging the advisability of the establishment of such a service throughout London by the County Council, and suggested that it might be advantageous to co-operate with the Metropolitan Asylums Board or other Institutions possessing the necessary equipment, in establishing such service. The General Purposes Committee recommended— That the action of the Wandsworth Borough Council in the matter be supported. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1913—agreements as to Ambulance Services (see page 212). Nurses Registration Bill. A Bill to regulate the Qualifications of Trained Nurses and to provide for their Registration. This Bill had been prepared at the instance of the Central Committee for the State Registration of Trained Nurses, which represents by delegation the British Medical Association, the Matrons' Council of Great Britain and Ireland, the Royal British Nurses' Association, the Society 98 for the State Registration of Trained Nurses, the Fever Nurses' Association, the Association for the Promotion of the Registration of Nurses in Scotland, the Scottish Nurses' Association, and the Irish Nurses' Association, comprising not less than 30,000 medical practitioners and nurses. Hitherto no minimum standard of knowledge for professional nurses has been defined or enforced. The object of the Bill is to ensure that the community shall have a guarantee that the nurses they employ are skilled in their professional duties, and through standardisation to give security to the public that the services of fully qualified nurses shall be readily obtainable. The Bill establishes a "General Council for the Registration of Nurses in the United Kingdom," composed of persons appointed by the Privy Council, the Local Government Boards in the United Kingdom, associations of registered medical practitioners, and direct representatives of the nursing profession. The duties and powers of this Council are defined in Clause 10 of the Bill; amongst the most important of them are the standardisation of training, and the examination and registration of nurses. In 1905 a Select Committee of the House of Commons on registration of nurses, which took evidence during two sessions, unanimously reported that "Your committee are agreed that it is desirable that a register of nurses should be kept by a central body appointed by the State." The registration of trained nurses is in force in Cape Colony, Natal, the Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony in South Africa, in New Zealand, in the province of Ontario in Canada, in the State of Queensland, Australia, in the Bombay Presidency in India, in 34 of the United States of America, in the German Empire, and in Belgium. 99 alphabetical street list of infectious diseases.

For the Fluid supplied to the Works Department a charge of 1d. per gallon is made; the Public Health Department is credited with this amount although no actual monetary transaction takes place. As applicants now usually bring their own receptacles to the depots there is also a very appreciable saving in the expense on bottles alone. * See "Comments on Adverse Criticisms," Annual Report, 1911. 111 Expenditure for the Year ended 31st March, 1913, and Expenditure for Half-year ended 30th September, 1913, average Expenditure for Three Years ended 31st March, 1913, Estimate for Year ended 31st March, 1914, and for Year ending 31st March, 1915.

A total 1,094 gallons were supplied to four London County Council Public Elementary Schools for spraying and cleansing floors of class rooms. Swimming Baths, the use therein of the Electrolytic Fluid. The fluid continues to be added to the water in the swimming baths in the same quantity and strength as mentioned in the Annual Report for the year 1909, viz., 1 part of Chlorine to 2,000,000 parts of water. 7,456 gallons were supplied to the Poplar Baths, 8,244 gallons to the Bow Baths and 2,475 gallons to the Island Baths, making a total of 18,175 gallons. ' The Bath Superintendents repeat their statements that the addition of the fluid prevents the formation of slime in the water, the slime is not found at the bottom of the baths when they are emptied, and there is no offensive smell when the baths are being cleansed. It should be said that the electrolytic fluid in the Poplar Baths is not used with the idea of rendering unnecessary periodic changes of the pond water, but to keep the water in the pond fresh and free from harmful organisms all the time it is in use. The class of persons who use the swimming ponds in Poplar is always likely to contain uncleanly or infected individuals, and it is to guard against danger from the latter that the fluid finds its chief application. At Poplar the electrolytic fluid costs in its preparation about £2 per 1,000 gallons, or a little less than id. per gallon. Thirty gallons are added to a swimming pond of 85,000 gallons capacity on first filling, and subsequent additions are made as required, at intervals of two or three days. Comments on Adverse Criticisms respecting the process. See annual report, 1911. At Poplar, the hypochlorite of magnesia solution is prepared by the electrolysis of Water Board water, containing certain definite proportions of sodium chloride and magnesium chloride. 113 In spite of adverse criticisms, the process has been a success for •eight years.* Hypochlorite of magnesium belongs to the magnesia and not to the alkali group. It is not caustic, is non-poisonous, and to the clothes is the least destructive of all the hypochlorites. It is obvious that the stable solutions of electrolytically-made hypochlorites of magnesium are preferable to those of sodium and potassium or even calcium, because for the purposes of rendering the three last mentioned solutions stable there would have to be used hydroxide of the metals of the alkali or the alkaline earth calcium, which are extremely caustic, alkaline, and very soluble, and where varying strengths of electrolytic fluid, containing the hypochlorites of sodium and potassium, are produced, one may add too much or too little of the hydroxides of the alkalies when working with unskilled labour. But when the extremely insoluble hydroxide or oxide of magnesium is added and mixed, one can add and stir in any quantity, but only the necessary amount will be absorbed. * In addition to the plants already supplied to the British War Office and Admiralty, quite recently plants have been sent to Finland, Buenos Aires and Rangoon. The Cateshead Municipal Corporation have also given an order for a plant to be erected, and while this report is being written, a large plant is being installed for the Portsmouth Corporation. It is interesting to note that in the last case, the fluid to be electrolysed is sea-water itself which, of course, is close at hand, and a ready and powerful disinfectant is manufactured by this process without cost of materials but merely that of electric current. One feels sure that, when this is generally known, without doubt, other seaside towns will follow the example of Portsmouth, and afford an unlimited supply of a disinfectant for municipal purposes for the benefit of the health of the townspeople and visitors. Since the apparatus was first installed, eight years ago, many improvements have been made which have been described in previous reports. Recently a very important improvement has been introduced for the reception of the fluid from the electrolysers. Instead of the glass receptacles, which are apt to break, and are very costly, specially made cheap metal drums have been substituted. Whilst this report is being written, a double cell has been constructed of slate, in such a form that the "creeping" of the current (which comes direct from the Council's mains) from one cell to another is prevented. This is a most important item. All slate Contains metal, and the current in "creeping" from the electrodes in one cell to the electrodes in the other cell causes erosion to take place, and sooner or later a "dead short" happens, and a new double cell is required, which is an expense. The present cells are earthenware, and replaced the original slate ones and were made by a firm of potters in the Borough at the special request of the Medical Officer of Health and under his direction and supervision, potters outside the Borough having refused to make them as they stated the baking would be a failure. However, the tanks or cells were made and as stated above are the present ones, having been in use for some years. Electricity, on account of moisture, will even creep with an earthenware cell and efficiency will be lost and if the partition of the earthenware cell or tank is not properly glazed it •will in course of time become destroyed by the electrical current (240 volts and 20 amperes) acting upon the fluid which soaks into the unglazed earthenware. Earthenware cells take a long time to make (possibly four months), and one is never certain that in the firing of earthenware there will not be defects in the articles when they are taken out of the kilns. A slate double-cell can be made in a few days, is cheap, and as now constructed will not permit the current to "creep" and erosion to take place, whereby we have cheapness, safety and greater efficiency. The current being taken direct from the Council's mains saving the expense of a "converter" w ith its consumption of current and necessary skilled attention. 114 victoria park bathing lake. Condition of the Water in Men's Bathing Lake. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Town Clerk's Office, Town Hall, Bethnal Green, E. 25th July, 1913. Dear Sir, Men's Bathing Lake, Victoria Park. The Bethnal Green Borough Council has again had under consideration the question of the condition of the water in the men's bathing lake, Victoria Park, and I am to inform you that the Council, at its meeting held last evening, passed a resolution on the subject in the following terms:— "That the Council call the attention of the London County Council to the fact that owing to the large number of bathers during the summer months in the Victoria Park men's bathing lake, the water becomes polluted more rapidly than it can be renewed by the means available at present, and that the Council therefore request the London County Council to provide means by which an adequate supply of fresh water to the lake can be maintained during the summer months." In view of the very large number of persons using the lake at this period of the year, serious consequences might arise if the water in the lake is not kept in a fit condition for bathing. I am directed by the Council to transmit a copy of the above resolution to the Poplar Borough Council, and to express the hope that that authority will see its way to support the representations made by this Council to the London County Council, and urge the County Council to give immediate attention to the matter. Yours faithfully, C. G. E. FLETCHER, Town Clerk. Leonard Potts, Esq., Town Clerk to the Borough of Poplar. 115 This matter had been before the Council on several occasions during the past three years, and strong protests against the condition of the water had been made to the London County Council, urging that the bathing lake should be thoroughly cleansed annually instead of triennially, and arrangements made for more adequate flushing during the summer months; also that more adequate supervision should be exercised in respect of the condition of persons using the lake. The County Council, however, considered the water was in sufficiently good condition for the purpose. In the summer of 1911 a temporary military encampment was formed in the park; complaints of the condition of the water were made by the Army Medical Authorities, and bathing in the lake by the men was forbidden. The lake was thereupon emptied and cleansed. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion more adequate attention should be given by the London County Council to the condition of the lake. And recommended the Council that the action of Bethnal Green Borough Council in this matter be supported. verminous children attending schools.* london county council (general powers) act, 1907, children act, 1908.

The Council is empowered by the Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897, to give any person applying, on the ground that he is infested with vermin, free use of any apparatus for cleasning his person and clothing, and may expend any reasonable sum on buildings, appliances and attendants for this purpose. Provision was made in 1905 for cleansing verminous persons. During the year 258 persons (including 250 from Common Lodging Houses—see below) had applied for baths and for their clothes to be disinfested.

Deaths. Five patients died—none Poplar, three Bromley, and two Bow. small-pox. A case of small pox (a male, aged 16 years, of Abbott Road, Bromley) was notified and removed to South Wharf, Rotherhithe, on 9th March, but was returned home and certified on that date to be not suffering from the complaint or any other notifiable disease. It was reported that the patient was to be admitted subsequently into the London Hospital for special treatment of a serious ailment of the heart, and the Secretary was duly informed of the circumstances by letter dated 27th March. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a reference to them from the Council to report on the subject of the Isolation of Small Pox Contacts, especially in relation to a case of Small Pox which occurred in the Borough. A report was presented as follows :— "As directed by the Public Health and Housing Committee a full report is here presented respecting the case of Small Pox which recently occurred within the Borough, and also, as requested, the Medical Officer of Health reports upon the isolation and maintenance of contacts. "On 1st May, 1913, by telephonic message from a medical practitioner the Medical Officer of Health was requested to see a patient in Naval Row. The request was immediately complied with. The patient, a female, aged 34 years, was suffering from Small Pox, and stated she had never been vaccinated, was of no occupation, and had been living apart from her husband. She had been residing in Poplar since 12th April and previous to that date had been resident in the Borough of Shoreditch. She fell ill on the 26th of April, the rash appeared on the 29th. The patient was removed, as soon as possible—on the 1st of May—by the Metropolitan Asylums Board to the Board's Small Pox Hospital. 123 "The Vaccination Officer and Public Vaccinator were immediately communicated with, and the tenant Landlady, together with her three children, were at once re-vaccinated, and the children excluded from School. "A visitor to the house, a resident in West Ham, who was present in the house, was also re-vaccinated, and two other visitors from a house in Sussex Street, Poplar, were re-vaccinated. "The elder daughter of the landlady was employed in a City factory. "The Medical Officers of Health for the City of London, and the Boroughs of Shoreditch and West Ham, were immediately communicated with by telephone and letter respecting the case and the contacts residing or employed in their respective districts. " The firm where the elder girl was employed, upon being communicated with by the Medical Officer for the City, stated they would not permit her to return to work for a fortnight and probably longer as work was slack. " As soon as possible all the inmates of the house were bathed at the Council's Shelter and their clothes disinfected ; the patient's room with contents was disinfected and the walls of the room stripped and limewashed. "The washing on the premises, received from a person outside the Borough, was taken away and disinfected at the Council's Station. "The houses in Naval Row and Sussex Street were visited by the Sanitary Inspectors for sixteen days after the removal of the patient to enquire whether all the inmates where in good health. Happily no further cases have occurred. "The house appeared to be a resort of seamen, the landlady stated she took in seamen lodgers, but gave the Medical Officer no coherent statement. The Public Health Department of the London County Council was immediately communicated with as it was stated the premises were not registered as a seamen's lodging-house. "The landlady stated she was without means, and was therefore referred by the Medical Officer of Health to the Poplar Board of Guardians. "The Medical Officer of Health states that there is no enactment which empowers the isolation of contacts, and maintenance of contacts . by the Council, but the Local Government Board has stated that whenever maintenance by the Council is carried out upon the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health such a procedure must be at once fully reported to the Local Government Board and reasons given why the Medical Officer of Health has recommended maintenance. For reasons 124 which at present need not be entered into the Medical Officer did not consider this was a case in which consideration might have been shown by help from the Council to prevent the family becoming paupers. "A letter was received from the Clerk to the Guardians which stated inter alia that 'the Relieving Officer reports that he is informed the children play in the recreation ground and the other members of the family are in no way isolated." "As stated above there is no power to isolate contacts and in the opinion of the Medical Officer of Health a person who has been in contact with a Small Pox case, and is immediately vaccinated or re-vaccinated and has had his or her clothing disinfected, is absolutely of no danger to the public. If there were danger to the public then all nurses in attendance on Small Pox cases would have to be continually isolated and not allowed to mix with the public or travel in public conveyances, etc.; even the Medical Officer himself would have to be isolated, as he is in close contact with patients and is engaged some time examining them, especially when there is any doubt. However, for the information of the Committee, the Medical Officer states that he, for the protection of the public, always puts on an overall before going into the room occupied by a small Pox patient (the overall after use is taken to the Station and disinfected), he is also re-vaccinated from time to time as he finds he is susceptible to vaccination which shews that he would be liable to contract Small Pox if he were not re-vaccinated. "As to the isolation and maintenance of contacts by the Council, it will be remembered that during the last Small Pox epidemic of 1901—2, in this Borough there was an attempt to carry out as thoroughly as possible preventive measures in a practical maimer, according to the opinion of the Royal Commission on the second question upon which the Commission were requested to report. These measures were applied in detail by the Public Health Department, but the Medical Officer of Health is of opinion, from the experience then gained, that although the maintenance was thoroughly carried out on the part of the Department the isolation of the inmates was not satisfactorily effected as in some instances friends visited the houses and numbers of the residents of the houses did not remain isolated, for at night time many of them went out and in some cases visited places of amusement. "The expenditure from 4th December, 1901, to 12th September, 1902, was as follows:— £ s. d. Maintenance (Food) of Contacts in their Homes 1,089 3 3½ Rents and Insurance Clubs, etc. 259 9 11 Medical Attendance 25 14 6 Compensation for Clothing, etc., destroyed 26 4 1¾ 125 Miscellaneous petty items 14 3 8½ Glaucus Street Shelters, Food 60 1 11¼ Ditto Washing 16 5 2¾ Ditto Periodicals 2 0 3 Lime, etc., for cleansing infected houses 19 13 3½ £1,512 16 3¼ "The amount of £1,512 16s. 3¼d. was allowed by the Local Government Board after some correspondence. "There were 410 infected premises, and entire maintenance, etc., was carried out in 224 houses. With the other cases where isolation was not observed, daily observation was kept upon the premises. "The above amounts do not include any expenditure for Gear, Tools and Overalls used in the cleansing of infected houses. "Wages of any description are not included. The cost of fitting up and furnishing the two Shelters is not included. ''If isolation without vaccination is carried out it means shutting up the occupants of the houses for fourteen days, then if another case of Small Pox occurs at the expiration of that period it means shutting them up for a further period of fourteen days, and if a third case occurs then another fourteen days must elapse before the occupants can be freed from isolation, and so on. The Medical Officer of Health can call to mind that during the epidemic of 1901—2, cases of Small Pox occurred again and again in this manner, necessitating the occupants of some of the houses being isolated and maintained for over two months. "For the information of the Committee, the following words in italics formed the question upon which the Royal Commission were requested to report, and those in inverted commas are some answers to that question, viz.:— "What means, other than vaccination, can be used for diminishing the prevalence of Small Pox; and how far such means can be relied on in place of vaccination?' 'We have no difficulty in answering the question, What means other than vaccination can be used for diminishing the prevalence of Small Pox ? We think that a complete system of notification of the disease, accompanied by an immediate hospital isolation of the persons attacked, together with a careful supervision, or if possible isolation for sixteen days of those who had been in immediate contact with them, could not but be of a very high value in diminishing the prevalence of Small Pox (499). 126 'We can see nothing to warrant the conclusion that in this country vaccination might safely be abandoned, and replaced by a system of isolation. If such ?. change were made in our method of dealing with Small Pox and that which had been substituted for vaccination proved ineffectual to prevent the spread of the disease (it is not suggested that it would diminish its severity in those attacked), it is impossible to contemplate the consequences without dismay (503). 'Power should, in our opinion, be conferred on Sanitary Authorities to give compensation for loss of wages, and generally for any expenses occasioned either by the isolation of the patients, or persons who have come in contact with them, or such supervision of them, a is necessary, whether in hospital or elsewhere (506).' "As stated above, the Medical Officer reported that there was no difficulty in feeding the contacts and keeping the accounts when the staff of the Public Health Department was increased, but there was considerable difficulty in effecting complete isolation of the contacts, and the Committee will see that the Commission stated that they could see nothing to warrant the conclusion that in this country vaccination might safely be abandoned and replaced by a system of isolation." The Public Health and Housing Committee reported to the Council that they were of opinion the precautions taken in this case were sufficient, and while the isolation of contacts may, in the case of epidemics, be desirable, there is no authority to enforce it, and it is not practicable to make voluntary isolation effective. At the time of the Small Pox epidemic in 1901-2 the Local Government Board expressed the view that quarantining of contacts was not necessary in Districts properly administered as regards sanitation and vaccination, and that if actual patients were at once removed, the dwelling and articles exposed to infection properly disinfected, and the other inmates re-vaccinated or vaccinated, there was nothing to be gained by keeping these inmates at home commensurate with the expense involved; that these inmates were unlikely to infect other people unless and urtil they themselves developed Small Pox, and all that was necessary was to keep them under observation for a fortnight. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council— That the action of the Medical Officer of Health, in the case in question, be approved. VACCINATION. Vaccination Acts (Repeal) Bill.

Distribution of Leaflets throughout the Borough. The Public Health and Housing Committee on the 19th November, 1912, considered the question of the prevalence of Measles in the Borough, and the high mortality arising therefrom. Measles not being a compulsory notifiable infectious disease, information is generally received only in respect of cases occurring in connection with public Elementary Schools. The Committee were of opinion the seriousness of measles is not generally recognised, and that if proper precautions were taken, the spread of the disease, and its fatal effects, might largely be prevented. The Committee considered it desirable the leaflet, which is always left (with other papers) at any house where a case of measles is discovered, should be circulated throughout the Borough and recommended the Council that the leaflet on Measles above referred to, be printed and distributed from house to house throughout the Borough. Order of Local Government Board—Admission of (Non-pauper and Pauper) cases into Hospitals of Metropolitan Asylums Board. Forty-two cases were removed to the hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board—14 Poplar, 15 Bromley, and 13 Bow. 145 A communication, dated 11th April, was received from the Clerk of the Metropolitan Asylums Board to the effect that for the present the admission of non-pauper cases of Measles and Whooping Cough to the Managers' Hospitals had been suspended. A subsequent letter, dated 26th April, was received stating that such suspension has now been removed. Milkshops. No cases of measles occurred in connection with milkshops. Disinfection and Outworkers. One hundred and ninety-seven rooms (165 houses) were disinfected by the Public Health Department (see page 107), and the remainder were disinfected by the tenants, medical practitioners giving certificates that disinfection had been satisfactorily carried out. Respecting outworkers and the articles disinfected by the Council see pages 96 and 107. Suggested Conference of Metropolitan Local Authorities—re Measles. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee:— METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF WANDSWORTH. Council House, Wandsworth, S.W., 23rd December, 1913. Dear Sir, Measles. This Council has on several occasions had under consideration the subject of Mortality from Measles, and in July last sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chairman of the Medical Research Committee, a resolution expressing the opinion that it was vitally important to the Nation that scientific and medical research should be instituted as to the cause and prevention of Mealses, and as to the possibility of rendering children immune from such disease. 146 This Council has again had the subject under consideration and has directed me to call the attention of the London County Council, the City Corporation, and the other Metropolitan City and Borough Councils to the expense to the ratepayers caused by the continued prevalence of the disease in the Metropolis. They understand that during the six months ending 29th June last, 3,091 cases of Measles were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Board's Hospitals, and in addition to the expenditure of the Asylums Board there are the heavy expenses of the several Boards of Guardians and other Bodies in connection with the disease. I am directed to ask whether, in the opinion of your Council, it is desirable to convene a Conference to consider if some steps could be taken with a view to lessening the incidence and mortality of the disease. Yours faithfully, D. A. NICHOLL, Town Clerk. The Town Clerk, Town Hall, Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that, in the opinion of the Council, it is desirable a Conference on the subject of Measles be convened as suggested. SPOTTED FEVER.

As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 161 and 162. * See Footnote, page 157. 157 There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept. The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers is 1,254, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table A, page 161, and Tables C and D, pages 164 and 165. The places where the outworkers are employed were all of them inspected twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 252 and 253 and the Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 216-251. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 96. * A special form is submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health (see pages 164-167) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of Section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors have been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited where any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the journals, registers and index files. It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried on—outworkers' premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops* and even factories ; workshops may become factories ; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, betueen the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. * To wit, in Table A, under "Laundries, Domestic Workshops," there were 10 on the register at the end of the year, but during the year, especially in the summer, some of these premises were "Workshop Laundries," and the inspections would come under Workshop Laundries. 158 Shops Acts, 1912 and 1913 (see page 212). The Home Work Order of the 20th January, 1913 (No. 91). In pursuance of Sections 107, 108, and 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, the Secretary of State made an order relating to the following classes of work:— 1. The making or filling of Cosaques, Christmas Crackers, Christmas Stockings or similar articles or parts thereof, and any work incidental thereto. 2. The weaving of any textile fabric, and any process incidental thereto. Order of the Secretary of State, dated May 21, 1913, extending Special Exception:—Employment at Night of Male Young Persons of 16 years and upwards (No. 565). Special exception by which a male young person may be employed during the night shall extend, so far as regards young persons of the age of 16 years and upwards, to the factories or parts thereof in which is carried on the process of Galvanising Sheet Metal and Wire.

A Bill to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to Sunday employment, and to regulate the conditions of Labour upon the basis of six Working Days in the Week with Sunday as the normal weekly RestDay, and for other purposes connected therewith. 160 The object of this Bill is to amend and consolidate the Acts relating to Sunday employment and to regulate the conditions of labour upon the basis of six working days in the week with Sunday as the normal Rest-day. By clause 1, Sunday employment is made generally unlawful, both for a person who is himself carrying on an occupation and for persons employed by him. Clause 2 deals with the Sunday closing of shops. Clause 3 enables certain occupations of necessity or mercy (specified in the First Schedule) to be carried on upon a Sunday. By clause 4 a local authority is given power, with respect to such occupations only as are specified in the Second Schedule, to make orders permitting them on Sunday, on the grounds of necessity or mercy, and to grant exemptions to Jews who observe Saturday as the weekly rest-day. Under Clause 5, the Home Secretary may supervise the powers of the local authority as to the making of orders, and may add occupations to, or withdraw them from, the Second Schedule. By Clause 6 it is provided that in cases of employment on Sunday, with certain necessary exceptions, an equivalent period of rest shall be given within the week, and that no person shall be employed on more than 26 Sundays in the year. The remaining clauses contain the necessary machinery for carrying the Act into effect. TABLE A.

The London County Council submitted revised draft Bye-laws in the form approved by the Local Goverment Board, relating to the conduct of the business of (1) Fish Curer; (2) Fried Fish Vendor ; (3) Rag and Bone Merchant. The Public Health and Housing Committee received copy of Petition to the Local Government Board which was proposed to be signed by marine store dealers, soap makers, tallow melters, bone boilers, artificial manure manufacturers and glue makers, against the confirmation of the bye-laws, on the ground that the regulations relating to Rag and Bone Dealers will limit the supply or increase the price of bones and fat required for use in their respective businesses. The Public Health and Housing Committee reported that the Council had already approved the original draft Bye-laws, which are Public Health regulations only, and the alterations made therein by the Local Government Board are merely for the purpose of more explicit definition and do not materially affect the regulations proposed. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council that the draft Bye-laws, as revised, be approved, but the Council referred the matter back to the Committee. The Committee considered the reference back of their recommendation that Bye-laws made by the London County Council be approved. The Bye-laws provide as follows:— Fish Curers. No person suffering from infectious disease may assist in preparation, storage or distribution. Gutting, cleansing and curing (otherwise than by drying or smoking) to be carried on in a room or place with roof (if done in wet weather), such room to be adequately lighted. Area of windows or openings to be equal to l-10th of floor area, half to be made to open. Openings to be provided for permanent ventilation : walls and floor, so far as necessary to prevent absorption of filth, to be made of impervious material, and drainage to be provided. 173 Precautions to be adopted to prevent effluvium arising, and the work not to be done in any place in which animals or poultry are kept. Means for securing personal cleanliness to be provided. Vessels with closely fitting covers to be provided for garbage, and to be kept clean. Floors, walls and ceilings to be kept in repair and limewashed four times a year. Kilns for smoking or drying to be of proper fire proof materials and fumes to be effectually conveyed away. Impervious material for gutting surfaces to be provided. Vats or tanks for salting, etc., to have impervious interior surface. (These bye-laws were allowed by the Local Government Board, 28th February, 1914). Vendor of Fried Fish. Similar provisions are made as in the case of a fish curer, and, in addition baskets, etc., in an offensive condition which have contained wet fish are not to be kept on the premises more than 24 hours; fish to be thoroughly gutted and cleansed before frying. (These bye-laws were allowed by the Local Government Board 28th February, 1914). Rag and Bone Dealer. No article intended for food to be in a place where sorting, dusting or grinding of rags is carried on. No bones, fat or rags collected from dust wharf, dust bin or cart, or infected premises, to be brought on to premises, unless acquired in ordinary course of business from a sanitary authority. No rags, bones, rabbit skins, etc., to be stored in a room or place unless such room or place is enclosed with walls of brick, stone, concrete or other impervious material, so constructed as to prevent the harbouring of vermin, and to have rain-proof ceiling or roof. 174 The room or place to be lighted with windows or openings equal to l-10th of floor space, and to have permanent openings for ventilation. Floor to be constructed of, or covered with, impervious material, to prevent harbouring of vermin. (This Bye-law not to apply to storage of rags in bales or sacks in a room used solely for such storage, and not to apply to room in which materials are manipulated until 12 months after confirmation). Rags, bones, fat, rabbit skins, etc., not to be stored or manipulated in any room used as sleeping room, or which communicates with any sleeping apartment, except by means of close fitting and self-closing door. Proper receptacles, with closely fitting covers to be provided for storing and conveying bones and fat, and refuse from rag sorting. Refuse from rag sorting to be burned or put into suitable vessels daily. Storage receptacles to be removed at least once a week. Floor surfaces, yards, window lights, utensils and appliances to be cleansed as often as necessary to ensure cleanliness and prevent harbouring of vermin. Inner surfaces of parts of premises used for the business to be limewashed twice a year. Premises to be kept in repair and properly drained. The Public Health and Housing Committee were still of opinion the Bye-laws are reasonable and necessary, and repeated their recommendation to the Council which was adopted. The Bye-laws have not yet been confirmed by the Local Government Board. 175 COFFEE SHOPS, EATING-HOUSES, FRIED-FISH SHOPS, HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS, ETC.† London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908.—Sanitary Regulations for Premises used for Sale, etc., of Food for Human Consumption.

London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. 908 visits were paid to these premises during the year and the Sanitary Regulations under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 8, were enforced. Want of cleanliness was found in 176 instances, and 61 other defects existed. 98 intimations were served, which in 14 cases were followed up by Statutory notices. A register of these premises is kept. See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 216-251. HAIRDRESSERS' PREMISES. The hairdressers' premises were inspected during the year. MILKSHOPS. Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908.—Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Register Names of Dairymen in certain circumstances. Tuberculosis Order, 1913 (Board of Agriculture and Fisheries). Milk and Dairies Bill. † See Tables A and C, pages 161 and 164. 176 Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order. At the end of the year there were in the Borough 396 registered premises (including 13 cow-houses, 1 Poplar, 5 Bromley and 7 Bow) where milk is sold, 128 Poplar, 179 Bromley and 89 Bow. These milkshops were kept under observation (see Inspectors' reports pages 216251). Cleansing of premises was necessary in 21 instances. Four other defects were remedied. 17 milkshops had been placed on the register during the year, 4 Poplar, 9 Bromley, and 4 Bow. 34 Premises were on account of change of occupiers re-registered as milkshops, 10 Poplar, 19 Bromley and 5 Bow. The sale of milk was discontinued on 13 premises—4 Poplar, 2 Bromley and 7 Bow. For milkshops connected with infectious diseases, see page 96. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908. Part II. Sanitary Provisions. Power to Sanitary Authorities to remove from or refuse to enter on Register Names of Dairymen in certain circumstances. No circumstances arose during the year calling for the enforcement of the power given to the Sanitary Authority under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section (5). See Sanitary Inspectors' reports, pages 216-251. Order of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (Dated 13th February, 1913.) Tuberculosis Order of 1913. This Order aims at securing the destruction of every cow found to be suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, or to be giving tuberculosis milk, as well as of all bovine animals which are suffering from tuberculosis with emaciation, since these are known to disseminate freely the germs of the disease. 177 Milk and Dairies Bill. A Bill to make better provision with respect to the sale of milk and the Regulation of Dairies. The main objects of this Bill are to provide for— (1.) The more effective registration of dairies and dairymen. (2.) The inspection of dairies and the examination of cows therein and the examination of milk. (3.) The prohibition of the supply of milk from a dairy where such a supply has caused or would be likqly to cause infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. (4.) The prevention of the sale of tuberculous milk. (5.) The regulation of the importation of milk so as to prevent danger to public health arising therefrom. (6.) The issue of regulations for securing the supply of pure and wholesome milk. (7.) The establishment by local authorities in populous places of milk depots for the sale of milk specially prepared for infants. The provisions as to registration supersede the provisions as to the registration of dairies contained in the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Acts and the orders made thereunder. The provisions as to the inspection of dairies and the prohibition of the supply of milk are based on the provisions of the Public Health (Scotland) Act, 1897. The clause as to the prohibition of the sale of tuberculous milk is taken from the model milk clauses, which have been incorporated in many local Acts, but the scope of the enactment is somewhat extended. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries have issued an order under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, dealing with tuberculous cows, and providing for the payment of compensation in cases of slaughter. The Treasury are prepared, subject to the assent of Parliament, to sanction the payment from the Exchequer of one half of the net amount paid by way of compensation for a period of five years. 178 SMOKE NUISANCES. Number of Nuisances. Smoke Abatement Bill. Number of Smoke Nuisances. 54 smoke nuisances were dealt with during the year:—13 Bow East, 4 Bow West, 8 North Bromley, 4 Bromley Central, 8 East Combined, 8 West Combined, and 9 Poplar South. 34 intimations and 23 statutory notices were served. 1 summons was applied for. Smoke Abatement Bill. A Bill to provide for the Abatement of Smoke. The Smoke Abatement Bill has for its purpose the prevention of nuisances caused by the improper emission of smoke. By section 1 it is made incumbent upon the owner, occupier, or user of a furnace to have such furnace constructed so that it will consume its own smoke ; and the emission of smoke or grit from such furnace or its chimney is constituted a nuisance. At the same time the Local Government Board are given power to make special exemptions in those cases in which it is impracticable to avoid making smoke in carrying on a business, but such power to exempt is limited to ten years from the passing of the Act, and an exemption itself must be renewed every two years. Section 2 lays down the penalties for offending against the Act, and also the procedure of prosecution. By section 3 the Local Government Board are authorised to set up local smoke abatement authorities in those areas in which the local sanitary authorities are failing to carry out their duties with regard to smoke abatement. In London, the London County Council is made the local smoke abatement authority. Under section 4 local smoke inspectors may be appointed by the local authority, subject to certain requirements as to experience, and to the control of the Local Government Board. By section 5 the Local Government Board are given the right to inspect the records of offences under the Act, in order to see if the local authority is properly carrying out its duties, and, subject to such obligation being satisfied, the Local Government Board may pay not more than half the salary of local smoke inspectors by way of grant in aid. 179 The same section requires the central authority themselves to appoint Government smoke inspectors, and authorises such inspectors to prosecute in cases where the local authority has failed to do so. The manner of providing for the expenses of local smoke abatement authorities is dealt with in section 6, together with a power of allocation by the Local Government Board. By section 7 existing powers as to the abatement of smoke nuisances are expressly preserved. ICE CREAM. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, Sec. 43. Twice annually and as often as may be necessary all the known premises within the Borough where ice-creams are manufactured are inspected. There are 120 such premises within the Borough, 49 Poplar, 40 Bromley and 31 Bow. (See Table A, page 161.) Cleansing of premises was necessary in 29 instances. 11 other nuisances were remedied. See Inspectors' reports, pages 216-251. MOTOR VEHICLES. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards ; Speed of Motor Omnibuses and Tramcars ; Street Traffic Regulation Bill. Motor 'Buses—Mud Guards. From time to time the General Purposes Committee have considered the matter of the provision of proper splash guards on motor omnibuses (see Annual Reports, 1910-1912). The Works Committee considered a memorial signed by 80 ratepayers in West Ferry Road, complaining of the vibration caused by the motor omnibuses recently placed on the route to Millwall Docks by the London General Omnibus Company, and also of the mud splashing by such M 180 vehicles in wet weather. The Works Committee directed the Omnibus Company be communicated with, asking that the speed of motor 'buses should be reduced when the roads are muddy, especially in West Ferry Road, where the narrowness of the thoroughfare renders the nuisance particularly acute. The Works Committee were informed that Messrs. Thomas Tilling, Limited, proposed fixing splash guards, in course of construction, to a number of their omnibuses, and the Borough Surveyor would make an inspection as soon as the first batch were fitted, with a view to pressure being brought to bear upon the Authorities to require splash guards to be affixed to all motor omnibuses should the experiment prove successful. At a later date the Works Committee reported that, communications having been addressed to the London General Omnibus Company, suggesting a reduction of speed in West Ferry Road and other thoroughfares in wet weather, the Company state in reply that they have given instructions to their drivers to proceed at a slower speed through the roads likely to give trouble by mud-splashing. Speed of Motor Omnibuses and Tramcars. The General Purposes Committee reported to the Council that:— In accordance with the resolution of the Council a deputation attended before the Chief Commissioner of Police on the subject of danger arising, from motor 'bus traffic, to children attending schools in the neighbourhood of Bow. The Commissioner undertook to make representations to the London General Omnibus Company with a view to reduction of speed at the several points in question, and to take any other steps possible to ensure safety. The Works Committee were of opinion that the speed of Motor 'Buses and Tramcars between St. Leonard's Road and Brunswick Road should be limited, and that a police officer should be stationed in East India Dock Road near this point for the purpose of regulating the traffic and affording children and other pedestrians facilities for crossing in safety. The Works Committee directed the London General Omnibus Company, the London County Council, and the Police Authorities be communicated with on the subject. 181 The following letter was submitted to the Works Committee London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 12th December, 1913. Sir, Motor Car Acts, 1896 and 1903. With reference to your letter, dated 17th October, 1913,1 am directed to state that, after full consideration, the Council does not see its way to apply to the Local Government Board for the issue of regulations prescribing a reduced speed limit for motor vehicles in East India Dock Road between St. Leonard's Road and Aberfeldy Street. So far as the speed of tramcars is concerned, I am to point out that special instructions have been given to motormen to exercise caution in this part of East India Dock Road and that the Council is satisfied that the cars are not run at an excessive speed. As the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council is aware, temporary street refuges have been recently fixed in this road, with a view to the better regulation of the traffic, etc. In these circumstances there does not appear to the Council to be any justification for a reduced speed limit. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, L. Gomme, Clerk to the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Street Traffic Regulation Bill.

The Stepney Borough Council called attention to a practice adopted by a certain class of milk vendors of carrying on their vehicles, when selling milk by retail, vessels containing water side by side with vessels containing pure milk, and of pouring water into the can they are about to deliver to a customer and adding a quantity of milk. If a sample be taken in the course of delivery and the vendor declares at the time a sample is demanded by an Inspector that he is selling a mixture of milk and water^ no conviction can be obtained, and the evidence of the consumer that unadulterated milk was expected is liable to be tampered with before the hearing. The Stepney Borough Council, therefore, urged the Local Government Board to promote legislation to make the sale of milk and water for human consumption illegal, and to prohibit milk sellers from carrying water in addition to milk upon their vehicles. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council— That the action of the Stepney Borough Council in the matter be supported. Suggested Repeal of Clauses Relating to Warranties. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the circumstances of the prosecution of a milk seller of Benledi Street, in respect of a sample of milk found on analysis to be deficient in fat to the extent of 15 per cent. The summons was dismissed on production of a written warranty from the wholesale vendors, who obtained their milk from farmers in the country, who gave the company a written warranty. The Committee considered the question of proceeding against the wholesale vendors in this case, but in view of the fact that the same company had already successfully appealed against a conviction, on proof of warranty to them, the Committee were advised a prosecution would probably be unsuccessful. The operation of the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in respect of warranties is to render ineffective the protection against adulteration intended to be afforded by the act to consumers, especially where the vendors are in a large way of business. The Committee on previous occasions directed attention to similar cases, and were of opinion the clauses relating to warranties should be repealed, and that the retailer should be absolutely responsible for the 191 unadulterated character of the food he sells, and should be left to his remedy of proceedings against the wholesale vendor in any case of breach of warranty. The Committee recommended the Council to— Concur in such opinion, and that representations on the subject be made to the Board of Agriculture and the Local Government Board. Suggested Amendment of Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the question of taking proceedings in respect of a sample of milk taken for analysis and found to contain a large proportion of formaldehyde as a preservative, contrary to the provisions of the Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912. The milk was supplied to the vendor by a local dairyman who obtained his supply from a Limited Company, who obtained it from a farmer. All these had been written to for explanations, in accordance with the regulations, and all denied the possibility of the addit ion of the preservative while the milk was in their possession. The Public Health and Housing Committee were advised, that in view of the fact that wilful neglect to observe the regulations must be proved to secure conviction, proceedings were not likely to be successful in the absence of admission of the offence or of direct evidence against either of the parties. The Committee directed communications be addressed to the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture, urging amendment of the regulations, to provide that the retailer should be liable in respect of preservatives found in any milk or cream sold by him, and also that the certificate of the Public Analyst should be accepted, without attendance of the Analyst in case of Police Court proceedings, as in the case of proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Facing or Polishing Rice for Sale. The Council of the Royal Borough of Kensington called attention to samples of rice found to contain various percentages of powdered talc, . used for facing or polishing rice for sale, and had urged upon the Local Government Board that the addition of any mineral matter to rice should be totally prohibited, and the Council was asked to support such action. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended— That the action of the Kensington Borough Council in this matter be supported. 192 Sale of Food and Drugs Bill. A Bill to make further provision for securing the purity of Articles of Food and preventing the misdescription thereof. Merchandise Marks Bill. A Bill to amend the Law as to Trade Marks and Trade Descriptions. Medical Prescriptions Bill (h.l.). A Bill intituled an Act to restrict the undue use of certain Medical Prescriptions. The object of this Bill is to prevent medical prescriptions which contain scheduled poisons from being used as a mean* of obtaining an undue quantity of the medicine prescribed. At present it is not an uncommon practice for a patient who his received a prescription for his or her doctor to use the prescription again and again without further medical authority. It is obvious that this practice, in some cases at least, leads to abuses. If a doctor see3 a patient and prescribes a certain quantity of a certain medicine it by no means follows that the doctor intends the patient to use that medicine repeatedly or indiscriminately. The Bill proposes, therefore, that where a medicine prescribed by a doctor contains a scheduled poison the prescription is net to be dispensed more than once unless the doctor gives directions either specifying the number of times it may be dispensed and supplied to the patient or stating that it may bs supplied to him or her as often or in such quantities as is desired.

The Closing Orders made on the 6th June, 1912, in respect of 61, 63, and 67 Bath Street, were determined on the 16th January, 1913. On the 21st November, 1912, the Council made Closing Orders, pursuant to Section 17 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, in respect of Nos. 147 and 149, Stebondale Street, and on the 16th January, 1913, made similar Closing Orders in respect of Nos. 46, 47, 48 and 49, Park Street, prohibiting the use of such premises for human habitation, until, in the judgment of the Council, they should have been rendered fit N 196 for that purpose. The necessary works to render the houses fit for human habitation having been carried out, the Council determined the orders on the 24th April, 1913. A closing order was made on the 21st November, 1912, in respect cf 28 Rook Street. The question of the demolition of these premises was considered by the Committee on the 2nd December, 1913. The owner agreed to do the necessary work and the Closing Order was determined by the Council on the 26th February, 1914. A Closing Order made on the 13th March, 1913, in respect of 5 Franklin Street, was determined by the Council on 17th July, 1913. The Closing Orders made on the 5th June, 1913, in respect of 61 and 61a Lamprell Street, were determined on the 20th November, 1913. Demolition Orders. Section 18 (2). On the 20th November, 1913, the Council made Demolition Orders in respect of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 Victoria Cottages. The Closing Orders had been made on the 19th December, 1912. Nos. 8 and 18 are still closed. Regulations-)" as to Underground Rooms habitually used as Sleeping Places. Section 17 (7). Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909. During the year no closing order was made under these regulations. Enlargement of Woolmore Street and Alton Street Schools. Demolition of Houses. The London County Council proposed to proceed immediately with the demolition of the houses on sites acquired for the enlargement of Woolmore Street and Alton Street Schools : seventeen houses were to be demolished in Alton Street and Flint Street, and five houses in Ashton Street and Woolmore Street. The rooms demolished number 97, and the total number of persons displaced, 175. The County Council submitted a schedule of rooms to let in the neighbourhood, and had arrived at the conclusion that in view of the housing conditions prevailing, it would not be desirable or expedient to undertake the erection of new dwellings under a special scheme for re-housing the persons displaced, and had asked the Local Government Board to decide that a re-housing scheme is not necessary. The provision of the additional school accommodation was stated to be urgent. f Set out in extenso on pages 212-214 of Annual Report of Medical Officer of Health 1910. 197 Upon the matter coming before the Council, the following resolution was passed :— That the Council do not concur in the opinion of the Committee and that the Local Government Board be asked to require the London County Council to formulate a scheme for re-housing the persons displaced by the demolition of their homes for school sites in the Borough. Housing of the Working Classes Bill, 1913. The following letter was submitted to the Public Health and Housing Committee :— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 29th July, 1913. Sir, The Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the Council have had under consideration clause 8 of the Housing of the Working Classes Bill, 1913, which was withdrawn after having passed second reading in the House of Commons. The clause reads as follows :— " The London County Council may at any time make an arrangement by agreement with the Council of any metropolitan borough for the exercise by the County Council on any occasion of any of the powers of the Council of the metropolitan borough under Part II. of the principal Act, subject to such terms and conditions as may be contained in the agreement, and, subject thereto, for dealing with any expenses incurred by the Council in the exercise of any such powers as though they were expenses incurred by the County Council under Part I. of the principal Act." The powers referred to are those relating to closing and demolition orders and the removal of obstructive buildings, and presumably should be taken to include the provisions of sections 17 to 21 of the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, which extends the powers of local authorities in this respect. It appears to the Committee that the application of this clause would be of great assistance to the Council in its administration of the Housing of the Working Chsses Acts, and they propose n2 198 therefore to recommend the Council, when it re-assembles in October next, itself to promote legislation on these lines in the session of Parliament of 1914. The Committee are strongly of opinion that the vigorous enforcement of the provisions of Part II. of the Act of 1890, as extended by the Act of 1909, relative to closing and demolition orders and the removal of obstructive buildings, would do much to ameliorate the evils existing in many unhealthy areas and groups of insanitary houses, which are, unfortunately, far too numerous to permit, on account of the excessive cost, of their being dealt with in a complete and comprehensive manner by means of improvement or reconstruction schemes. The Committee feel that the present divided administration does not conduce to uniformity of action throughout London, and that under the law as it now stands the incidence of cost is unevenly divided. It is in fact more frequently the case that the boroughs in which there is the greatest cause for a rigorous enforcement of the provisions of the Housing Acts are the most severely handicapped on financial grounds. I am to add that the suggested legislation is intended to supplement, and not in any way to detract from, the present powers of the metropolitan borough councils whose support of the proposal the Committee seek to enlist. A second proposal for legislation which the Committee have before them is that powers should be sought to enable the Council to charge part of the cost of acquiring insanitary property for the purposes of a new school site against the Dwelling House Improvement Fluid, out of which the expenditure of the Council under the Housing Acts is met. It is found in practice, when acquiring a si+e for a new school, that it is often much cheaper to take good residential property with large gardens than a slum area upon which the buildings are thickly crowded. The Education Committee of the Council feel bound to advise the Council to acquire the site involving the minimum of expenditure, and the result is that often well-built and respectably occupied houses are destroyed, leaving insanitary property in the neighbourhood. It is obvious that the reverse policy should prevail if this can be done without sacrifice of suitability, but it is felt that if the selection of a slum area for a school site is made in the interests of public health and housing, the additional cost should not fall on the Education Account. It often happens that a Metropolitan Borough Council 199 urges the acquisition of an alternative site more expensive than that selected by ?he Council, and in one such case in 1911, a certain Borough Council offered to contribute towards the additional cost which would be involved if the site which it suggested were chosen. The Borough Council, however, had no power to make such a contribution, and the proposal was perforce dropped. Inasmuch as Part II. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, permits of the clearance of small insanitary areas as the joint expense of the Council and the Metropolitan Borough Councils, it occurs to the Housing of the Working Classes Committee that if the Council were enabled to charge part of the cost of acquiring a school site on an insanitary area against the Dwelling House Improvement Fund, it would be useful if power were also obtained to enable a Borough Council to contribute towards the cost, should it deem it desirable to do so. The Committee propose therefore that the application to Parliament should include such a provision. Both proposals are purely permissive and any action under the new powers, if obtained, must, in so far as the Borough Councils are concerned, be the subject of future agreement. In submitting the application, however, it will be necessary for the Council to show in evidence the extent to which further powers are required, and doubtless Parliament will attach weight to the wishes of the Metropolitan Borough Councils in the matter. I have accordingly been directed to ascertain the views of the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar on the subject. I shall be glad to be favoured with a reply to this letter as soon as convenient, and in any event not later than the last week in September next. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BIRD, Deputy Clerk to the Council. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion it is desirable powers should be obtained by the London County Council as suggested, in order that the cost of dealing with insanitary property may be charged over all London, and also that slum properties may be dealt with as sites for schools, where the conditions are suitable, without undue charge on the Education Funds and recommended the Council That the proposals of the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council in this matter be approved and supported. 200 Housing of the Working CjAsses Bill. A Bill to provide for the tetter application and enforcement of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and to amend the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899. This Bill amends and adds to the powers of Local Government Board and those of local authorities under the Housing Acts. These Acts are already very complicated, and, until a consolidating enactment is passed, an amending Bill, drafted as it must be with reference to the existing Acts, cannot avoid adding to the complication. The Bill adopts the principle of the existing Act«, especially those of the principal Act of 1890, and, apart from some minor alterations, aims only at the better enforcement of those principles, in the view that, subject to minor alterations, existing legislation would be sufficient, if it were properly enforced. The main alterations proposed with a view to enforcing the Acts are— (a) A special department of the Local Government Board is to be formed which will be employed exclusively in the supervision of the operations of local authorities under the Housing Acts. This department will co-ordinate the work of the various officers of the Board already employed in the work. It will assist local authorities by advice and information, and will annually make a special report to Parliament on housing matters. Where a local authority is culpably neglecting its housing duties, the Local Government Board will be empowered, after application to the Court, to deal with slums and to provide housing accommodation itself in place and at the cost of the local authority. (b) In some areas the failure to deal with the slum evil and to carry out housing schemes under Part III. of the principal Act arises not from any unwillingness on the part of the local authority, but from financial difficulties. It is therefore proposed by the Bill to provide parliamentary grants in aid of housing operations. Various other alterations of the existing Acts are proposed by the Bill with a view to lessening the cost of, and facilitating in other ways the exercise by, local authorities of their housing functions. In particular, an amendment is proposed of the compensation sections of the Act of 1890 which aims at carrying the principles of these sections—at present often nugatory—into effect. 201 Housing of the Working Classes Bill (No. 2). A Bill to amend the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890 to 1909, and the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, 1899 ; and to encourage the private ownership of dwelling-houses and business premises amongst the working classes. The object of this Bill is to enlarge the powers and stimulate the activities of voluntary associations and also of municipal authorities with a view to securing a better supply of housing and, to some extent, of shop accommodation for the working classes ; and especially to enable State credit to be used with a view to enabling occupiers to become owners. The Bill proposes to do this in three ways :— (1) Section 67 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, as amended by section 4 of the Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909, allows the Public Works Loan Commissioners to lend up to two-thirds of the amount required by voluntary associations who are undertaking the work of providing dwelling-houses for the working classes ; but there is no provision in these sections (which extend only to " dwellings for the working classes ") to cover the case of small shops. In many poor class neighbourhoods it is desirable that power should be available for constructing a house and shop together. (2) Many members of the working classes, especially in the north of England, desire to acquire the ownership of their own houses. In Oldham, according to the Local Government Board Report of Ma}', 1909, out of 33,000 inhabited houses, over 10,000, or about a third, are owned, or in course of being purchased by artisan proprietors. The Bill proposes to assist voluntary associations ; whether friendly societies, building societies, co-operative societies, insurance societies, or similar bodies who are promoting this work of house purchase. The societies at present generally advance up to three-quarters or four-fifths of the purchase price of a house to their members, and then receive payment of principal and interest over a period of years, the advance being secured, till paid off, by a mortgage on the house. It is the experience of these societies that with money borrowed at, say, five per cent, (which is the usual rate), an occupier can by repayments spread over a period of fifteen years to twenty years acquire the ownership of his house. These repayments generally do not exceed in amount, and in many cases are actually less than, previously paid in rent. 202 The Bill proposes to allow Government money to be advanced at a low rate of interest, say, three and a half per cent., to authorised societies up to two-thirds of the amount required ; with twothirds of the capital required thus provided at a low rate of interest better terms could be offered by the societies to the purchasing tenant than at present. The society would be an intermediary between the purchasing owner and the State. Its active interest would be engaged by requiring that one-third of the capital necessary should be found by the society; and, in addition, it would have to be authorised by the Local Government Board. Regulations would also be made requiring societies who obtained a loan to make proper provision for safeguarding the interest of purchasing owners, who would be in the position of mortgagors, while, at the same time, preventing the machinery of the Bill from being exploited by speculative builders. (3) The Small Dwellings Acquisition Act of 1899 was passed with a view of encouraging local authorities to assist artisans to purchase their own houses. Very little use has, however, been made of its provisions. The Bill, therefore, proposes, to relax some of these provisions with a view to encouraging local authorities to set the Act in operation. Cottage Homes for Aged Persons Bill. A Bill to facilitate the provision of Cottage Homes for Aged Persons. The object of this Bill is to facilitate the provision of homes for old people over 65. It is intended chiefly to be operative in rural parishes where difficulty arises in finding comfortable and respectable accommodation for old agricultural labourers and other working folk of advanced age. The Bill enables a council to erect cottage homes where sites for that purpose are given to them. It proceeds on the principle of co-operation between the local authority and landowners or other private presons to provide homes in the locality for those who have spent many years of their lives in working in the district, and in this way to enable old people to pass their later years in comfortable homes and familiar surroundings. It limits the sum which may be expended out of the rates, and permits a small rent to be charged. All taint of pauperisation is thus avoided, and the charge thrown on the rates will be extremely small, but the power of incurring this small charge will enable the desired object to be attained. The Bill is adoptive, and not compulsory. 203 WATER. Water Certificates. Water certificates were authorised to be given under Section 48 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891—2, 4, 6 and 8, Morant Street ; 59 and 61, Bow Lane, Poplar ; Caretaker's House, J.

Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill.* The Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee have under consideration a Bill to be promoted at the joint cost of the Borough Councils, by re-introduction of a Bill on the lines of the Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill of 1908. The Bill would provide that all means of drainage, other than a sewer approved by the proper Authority as a sewer, shall be a drain maintainable by the owners. Public Health (Sewers and Drains) Bill. A Bill was introduced into the House of Commons to amend the Public Health Acts with respect to sewers and drains, but this Bill does not relate to the Metropolis. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. The Borough Surveyor reported to the Works Committee that the 2 ft. brick barrel sewer in Cadogan Terrace, Bow, was giving trouble, and an examination had revealed a falling in of the crown opposite Nos. 115 and 124, whilst a further collapse was indicated by the condition of the length opposite Nos. 109 to 115. *This Bill was set out in extenao Annual Report, 1910, pages 210 and 217. 204 The invert was also of such irregular formation as to impede the flow, and fouling and blockage of the sewer consequently occurred. The sewer was of very old construction, the records shewing it to have been in existence at the formation of the Board of Works for the Poplar District in 1855, and it was one of the sewers transferred to that authority by the Commissioners of Sewers. It consisted of a half-brick ring, and the jointing was disintegrated. The manholes were of very old pattern and contained deep sumps which contributed to a sluggish flow as well as causing a deposit of solid matter to collect therein. The Borough Surveyor submitted plan for re-construction of the sewer in 12 in. stoneware pipes at an estimated cost of £1,000. The Borough Surveyor also reported that the Wright's Road Sewer from Beale Road to Libra Road, was in such condition as to necessitate re-construction before the paving works in the road were executed. The sewer was 3 ft. by 2 ft., a half-brick in thickness, and egg shaped. It was constructed in 1865, and the sluggish flow and deposit were consequent upon the defective condition of the invert and sides. It was proposed by the Borough Surveyor that the sewer be reconstructed in 12 in. stoneware pipes at an estimated cost of £327. The Borough Surveyor examined the sewer in the portion of Chrisp Street proposed to be paved, and found it to be defective. It was an old brick barrel. The surveyor recommended that the sewer should be reconstructed in stoneware pipes before the paving was laid. CONSTRUCTION OF WATER CLOSETS-NEW BYE-LAWS. Bye-Laws made by the London County Council under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Bye-Laws under Section 39 (1). With respect to water-closets, earth-closets, privies, ashpits, cesspools, and receptacles for dung, and the proper accessories thereof, in connection with buildings, whether constructed before or after the passing of this Act. BYE-LAW made by the Council defining the person responsible under the bye-laws made in pursuance of the provisions of section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in so far as they relate to the construction of any water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ashpit, cesspool, or receptacle for dung, and the proper accessories thereof. 205 Notwithstanding anything contained in the bye-laws made by the London County Council in pursuance of the provisions of section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the case of the construction of any water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ashpit, cesspool, or receptacle for dung and the proper accessories thereof, the builder shall observe all the requirements contained in the said bye-laws, and he shall be liable to the penalties provided for a breach of the said bye-laws. Provided that this bye-law shall not remove or interfere with any of the obligations which have been specifically imposed by the said bye-laws upon the owner or occupier of any premises. In this bye-law "builder" means the builder, contractor, or person actually carrying out the work, but does not include a workman in the employ of such builder, contractor, or person. The foregoing bye-law was made by the London County Council on the 15th day of April, 1913, and the common seal of the London County Council was hereunto affixed on the 19th day of June, 1913.

Pans and Traps without Notice. In Two cases where w.c. pans and traps were fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council Bye-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builders were written to asking them to open the ground, otherwise legal proceedings which had been authorised by the Committee, would be instituted against them for infringing the bye-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work is found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work. Overcrowding. Certificates were given under Section 4 (3) (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, respecting five cases of overcrowding, and the Committee directed that the necessary notices should be served; 54 cases of overcrowding were abated upon service of intimations, so that there were in connection with private houses, 59 of overcrowding abated; no cases of overcrowding were found in workshops (see Miss Tattersall's report, page 252); 121 cases of overcrowding were also abated in connection with houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family (see Mr. Johnson's report, page 254). Legal proceedings were not instituted in any instance. General. 8,259 communications were received, and 873 complaints (including 54 smoke) as to nuisances were made. 5,024 communications were despatched. Condition of Highways. The Borough Surveyor reported that the Highways on the whole were in better condition than they were three years ago, although the character of the traffic at the present time is more detrimental to the roadways than was the case even so recently as the date on which the last paving scheme was approved by the Council. Overcrowding of Railway Carriages. The attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee was called to the dangerous and insanitary over-crowding, at certain hours, of the District Railway trains running through the Borough between the City and East Ham and Barking. The Committee was advised this 209 excessive over-crowding is dangerous to health and life, and were of opinion more adequate accommodation should be provided. The Committee recommended the Council that the attention of the Board of Trade be called to the matter. Suggested Additional Public Urinals. A suggestion that additional urinals should be provided in the borough the Borough Surveyor pointed out that there exists 33 surface urinals and 3 sanitary conveniences having accommodation for both sexes. As compared with surrounding Boroughs the Surveyor reported that Poplar stands as follows:— Name of Borough. Number of Conveniences and Urinals. Male Population. Stepney 61 140,000 equals 1 urinal for every 2,300 males. Bethnal Green 12 62,500 „ 1 „ 5,200 „ Hackney 25 103,000 „ 1 „ 4,000 „ POPLAR 36 81,000 „ 1 „ 2,200 „ Regarding the condition and repair of existing urinals, the Borough Surveyor reported that it has been the practice for years part to substitute modern stalls in two or three urinals annually and at the same time thoroughly renovate these urinals. As a consequence very few defective urinals now exist, and these would be attended to shortly. Cul-de-sac.—Priscilla Road. Attention was called to the condition of a portion of Priscilla Road, by the flank of No. 48 and in front of Nos. 45, 47 and 49, forming a cul de sac. This is repairable by the owner:, and it is proposed to make up the carriageways in flints, and to kerb and pave the footway on the south side with patent stone, the cost being apportioned on the owners under Section 3 of the Metropolis Management Act, 1890, and Section 14 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1911. It is not intended that the Council should adopt the place as a public highway. The Works Committee recommended that the cul de sac in Priscilla Road be made up as proposed, and the cost apportioned upon the respective owners, but that the place be not adopted as a public highway. 210 Suggested New Open Space—Cubitt Town. The following letter was submitted to the Works Committee:— London County Council, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 16th August, 1913. Sir, With reference to your letter of 6th June last, on the subject of the acquisition of certain land at Cubitt Town, Poplar, for the purpose of a public open space, I am directed to inform you that as a result of further negotiations with the owners of the property, the Parks and Open Spaces Committee are prepared to recommend the council to purchase, in addition to the land which has been the subject of previous correspondence, a strip of adjoining land, nearly an acre in extent, which has a frontage to East Ferry Road from the Welcome Institute to a point nearly opposite No. 11, Charteris Terrace. The purchase-money has been provisionally agreed at £10,000, and of the total area cf about 17 acres it is proposed to utilise about 3 acres 28½ poles, shown by pink colour on the accompanying plan, as a school background in connection with the George Green's School, leaving the remainder for use as a public open space. Having regard, therefore, to the modification of the original scheme, the Parks and Open Spaces Committee will be glad to know whether, in the event of the Council acquiring and utilising the land in the manner now suggested, the Poplar Metropolitan Borough Council will be prepared to contribute one-third of the total cost, including legal and incidental expenses, of such part of the land as will be devoted to open space purposes. Such contribution would, of course, be within the maximum of £3,000 offered by the Borough Council towards the cost of purchasing the land included in the original scheme. I send herewith a plan showing the total area of land proposed to be acquired for the two purposes mentioned. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, MONTAGUE H. COX, Assistant Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Works Committee were of opinion that the additional land proposed to be acquired will be of public advantage, and recommended that, subject to the Council's contribution not exceeding the £3,000 already agreed, the Council do agree to contribute one-third of the total cost, including legal and incidental expenses, of the acquisition of such part of the land as will be devoted to public open space purposes. 211 Police Court Proceedings.

March, 1914. 216 Report op Sanitary Inspector, Bow West Division. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1913. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my twenty-fourth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ended 31st December, 1913, as follows:— Inspections on complaints of nuisances 1,056 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 435 Do. on house-to-house visitation 12 Do. Canal Boats 55 Re-inspections 1,701 Making a total of 3,259 visits. Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,503 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out in 27.74 per cent. of the premises thus inspected—requiring the service of 381 written intimations, 257 statutory, and 26 final notices. In many of these cases, on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precede the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in no case was it found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings to ensure enforcement.

Milk Shops. There are 58 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected at least four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out, which is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation of milking; I find that in all of the sheds a pail of warm water is provided for this purpose. Canal Boats. These boats are visited whenever found to be lying alongside a wharf. 26 have been inspected during the year without cause of complaint. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed slaughter houses in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. Only small animals are allowed to be killed in these registered premises. Ofttimes a visit is made while slaughtering is in progress, and the carcases are inspected. Killing is often carried out during the late evening hours. Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Included under this heading are nine fried fish shops, which are visited for the purpose of inspecting the class of fish used in the trade and sold to the public. Bake-Houses. There are 17 bake-houses in the district, and all are regularly inspected. The work of cleansing is carried out satisfactorily. Hairdressers' Shops. There are 20 of these shops upon the register and they are visited frequently. The utensils used in this business are kept clean. 226 Ice Cream Shops. There are many of these shops throughout the district, but on a small scale; the owners only supply the ice cream during the summer months, and during that period frequent visits are made and the utensils inspected. The place where the ice cream is stored overnight is particularly investigated. Schools. There are 5 in the Bromley North District and these are visited twice a year re drinking water supply and w.c. accommodation. On each visit everything has been found in perfect order. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view to preventing the sale of unsound food Night inspectors have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound and fit for human food. Unsound Food. Large quantities of unsound food are received from outlying wharves and sent into the Bromley North Division for destruction ; such food stuff is not allowed to be destroyed until the District Inspector has verified the amount and weight of each load sent from the wharf to his district. The goods are then destroyed under his supervision. The following quantities have been destroyed so as to prevent its reappearance on the market as a cheap food for the working class. The residue is used only for cattle food and manure. Total destroyed:— 6,941 tins of various meats. 11 tons, 5 cwts., 2 qrs., 16 lbs. meat. Smoke Nuisances. A few smoke nuisances have been notified, but on the service of an intimation in each case the nuisance was abated. Offensive Matter. There is a great improvement in the manner in which offensive material is conveyed through the district. In one instance only was the driver and owner fined for improperly conveying offensive material through the street. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Cert. Sanitary Inspector Exam.

Public Health Department, 31st December, 1913. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my thirteenth Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith in the West Combined District during the past year, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. Inspection of Division. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds, 1,619 houses or other premises have been visited, necessitating 3,700 re-inspections, 247 of these visits being on account of infectious diseases. In addition to these a large number of pulmonary tuberculosis notifications and notifications of tuberculosis in neck and legs have been attended to, and dealt with as circumstances required. This number shows an increase of 75 infectious cases as compared with last year, owing to the epidemic of scarlet fever which occurred in the summer, and which was general in the metropolis. House to House Inspections. These visits were carried out under the Public Health and Town Planning Acts as opportunity offered in various localities, and any works requiring attention were put in hand. Drain Reconstructions. The drains of 38 premises have been taken out and reconstructed in compliance with the Bye-laws of the London County Council and Borough Council, they have been intercepted, ventilated, and provided with proper means of access for cleansing in times of stoppages, the whole work being thoroughly tested before being passed. The drains of a number of premises have also been amended where found necessary. 235 Coffee and Eating Houses. These premises have been periodically inspected during the year ; alterations in tenancy and new shops opened have been registered, and the register brought up-to-date. While inspecting these places, so far as possible attention has been paid to the food. The premises have been cleansed when found necessary. Food Inspection at Wharves, etc. At Aberdeen Wharf, where food of different kinds is landed for transit, inspections have been made from time to time, and everything found in first-class condition. The butchers' premises and stalls in Chrisp Street market were inspected at night times and at week-ends. In each place where sausages and brawn are made, special attention has been given. These premises are registered, and the businesses are conducted in a clean and proper manner, and the premises are regularly cleansed. Odd consignments of damaged wheat, rice, and barley, etc., have been received into the district from the docks to be made up into poultry food. These consignments have been inspected throughout the process. Odd lots of foodstuff, tinned and otherwise, have been surrendered during the year and destroyed in the Council's destructor. Factories and Workshops. These places have been visited periodically, and where necessary cleansing “notices” have been served and complied with. New workshops opened have been placed on the register and duly inspected. No case of overcrowding or infectious disease had been found to exist, but several cases of infectious diseases notified as residing in the district were dealt with by notifying the authorities in whose districts they worked. 236 Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live have been visited at intervals. Changes of address have been noted and registered, and where necessary, “notices” for cleansing have been served and the work carried out. Bakehouses. The occupied bakehouses have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out satisfactorily, and the places kept in very good order. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops. These places were regularly visited during the year. All dippers and storage vessels have been closely inspected as to cleanliness, and have, generally speaking, been kept as clean as possible. Where infectious disease has occurred at any milkshop, the milk on the premises has been destroyed and the utensils disinfected before milk has been allowed to be sold again; no case has been “nursed” at home where milk was sold. Smoke Nuisances. All complaints from outside quarters (which have been very few this year) have been attended to, and also my own observations of shafts. No legal proceedings have been necessary, all “notices” whether verbal or statutory having been attended to. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907. During the year 54 samples of various kinds have been purchased for analysis, including several from the workhouse and relief stores while the milk was being delivered. Legal proceedings were compulsory in three instances owing to extent of adulteration of articles sampled, and in several others preservatives were freely used. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. All cases of infectious diseases notified during the year have received attention, with a view to tracing their origin if possible. In some cases 237 “patients” had been playing with each other during the period of invasion. Very many visits to premises have been paid respecting notifications of tuberculosis, and where possible, precautions taken upon advice tendered to the “patients” and household generally. Ice Cream Regulations. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902. All premises where ice cream is made have been inspected, and attention given to the utensils used. They have been kept in a most clean and satisfactory condition. London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904.

I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is stored and sold in the district with the object of enforcing the regulations of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, as amended by the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Amending Order of 1886, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, Section 5 (Milk Clauses), in respect to the sanitary condition of the premises, cleanliness of the measures, counter pans, means of storage, and prevention of contamination, especially in respect to other articles kept for sale in close proximity to where milk is kept. Number of Milk Sellers registered 36 Number of Milk Sellers, change of ownership 2 Number of Milk Sellers discontinued selling milk 1 Number of Milk Sellers added to register 1 Overcrowding. During the year fifteen cases of overcrowding were dealt with : in each case the nuisance was abated after service of an intimation followed by a statutory notice, without recourse to legal proceedings. Outworkers. The premises where male outworkers live and work have been inspected, no case of overcrowding discovered, premises were found to be in a sanitary condition. Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, etc. Periodical inspection has been made of these premises during the past year ; change of proprietorship, new premises opened and those closed have been duly reported and noted in the register. At each inspection particular attention was paid to the food under preparation, and in no instance was there cause for complaint; in some cases it was necessary to serve intimations and statutory notices respecting cleansing of the kitchens, etc. Hairdressers' Shops. The whole of the hairdressers' shops throughout the district have been inspected, the sanitary conditions of the premises, cleanliness of the articles used in the business being carefully noted. In some few cases intimations were required to be served. Generally there is a marked improvement in these premises. Q 244 Smoke Nuisances. During the year the shafts throughout the district have been under careful observation, and in two instances only, nuisances were detected. In these cases intimation and statutory notices were served, which has had the effect of abating the nuisances, therefore there was no necessity to institute legal proceedings. Unsound Food, Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the district have been frequently inspected, there has been no occasion to seize any article exposed for sale. Cleansing of Cisterns (Bye-law under Public Health (London) Act, Section 50). The cisterns of the undermentioned buildings have been inspected, and the usual cleansing has been carried out in accordance with the Bye-laws:— Adelaide Buildings 2, Baffin Buildings 2, Grosvenor Buildings 106, Hudson Buildings 2, Melbourne Buildings 4, Montreal Buildings 4, Ontario Buildings 4, Ottawa Buildings 4, Quebec Buildings 4, Council Buildings 5, St. Lawrence Cottages, Norfolk Street 14, Sidney Buildings 4, Toronto Buildings 2, Winnipeg Buildings 4. Public House Urinals. The public house urinals in the district have been frequently inspected, and the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, strictly enforced (see tabulated list, page 207). Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, etc. There is only one wharf in my district, viz., Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour (Ramornie Meat Co.), where food (all tinned) is landed, some of which is warehoused for various firms. The Ramornie Meat Co.'s consignments are examined by an expert examiner employed by the firm before being sent out, either for home consumption or for exportation. A large amount is purchased for the Mercantile Service, all of which is again examined, specially labelled and passed by Board of Trade officials before leaving the premises. The following tinned foods were found, on examination by the consignees, to be unfit for human consumption and were rejected, being set aside by the consignees in a separate building for the purpose of being 245 sent to a fat boiler in the district to be rendered down for fat, precaution being taken to prevent the condemned food being used for any other purpose:— February 7—176 tins of Beef, Mutton, Soups and Ox Tongues. April 10—835 „ „ „ June 3—375 „ „ „ July 7—303 „ „ „ August 19—589 „ „ „ October 18—268 ,, ,, ,, November 25—762 „ ,, „ December 29—615 „ „ „ 3,923 Public Elementary Schools. I have, as specially instructed, inspected the Public Elementary Schools in my district, particularly in respect to the water supplies and sanitary conveniences. The water supply for drinking purposes at each school was found to be drawn from the rising main. The storage cisterns (which are used for supplying the sanitary conveniences only) are cleansed out every three months, the sanitary conveniences were found to be in a clean and satisfactory condition. In some cases the drinking cups were found to be missing but have since been reinstated.

Q 2 246 Report of Inspector, South Division of Poplar. Public Health Department, December 31st, 1913. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to present my Annual Summary of the sanitary work, executed in the South Division of Poplar for the year ended 31st December, 1913, viz.:— The details of which were entered in my journal day by day and reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee month by month.

House-to-House inspections were carried out as follows:— The whole of— Sections of— Davis Street (model dwellings). Stebondale Street. Manchester Road. East Ferry Road. Marshfield Street. Janet Street. Mellish Street. Claude Street. West Ferry Road. Of the total premises inspected 1,098 were found to be in fair condition; 37 per cent, required various works of sanitary improvement, which necessitated the service of 595 written intimations, 151 statutory notices, and 19 final notices. 247 Drains. During the year 57 drains were proved defective by the smoke and chemical tests, and in 313 instances the application of tests revealed no defects. Drainage construction and reconstruction, including means of access and ventilation, were carried out at the following premises:— Weet Ferry Road, 369, 371, 373, 375. West Ferry Road, 285a, Stable premises. West Ferry Road, Magnet Beer House. West Ferry Road, Langbourne Wharf Chemical Works. Tobago Street, 14, 16, 18. Byng Street, Messrs.

Improved or additional sanitary accommodation for workmen has been provided at the following factories.— East Ferry Road, Engineering works. Middlesex Chemical Company, West Ferry Road. Messrs. Bellamy's works, Byng Street. Messrs. Power and Dean, Ransomes Wharf Road (repaired). Star Manufacturing Company, Davis Street. Messrs. R. Walbers, Moiety Road. Manganese and Bronze Company, St. David's Wharf, West Ferry Road. Messrs. Coubro and Scruttons, West Ferry Road (repaired). Messrs. Hunt's, Engineers, Mellish Street (repaired). Public House Urinals. Public house conveniences were inspected and nuisances abated on the service of written intimations, and in two instances were reconstructed with improved sanitary arrangements. Workshops and Workplaces. The workshops and workplaces—numbering 41—were regularly inspected and their sanitary condition improved in many instances by limewashing, better ventilation and paving, etc., in response to the intimations and notices served. Hairdressing and Shaving Rooms. The hair cutting and shaving rooms were inspected and dealt with where necessary. In every case an antiseptic was in use. Smoke Nuisances. The number of complaints with reference to black smoke issuing from the numerous factory chimney shafts in Millwall and Cubitt Town have been considerably less during the past year. The nuisances occurring were in most cases abated on the service of an intimation, and when necessary followed by a statutory notice. The smoke-preventing appliances attached to many of the furnaces, in conjunction with careful stoking as the result of previous proceedings, repeated visits, and cautions, no doubt contributed to this result. 249 Inspection of Schools. The schools in my division number eight, each of which was inspected during the year. The sanitary condition of the lavatories, conveniences, water supplies, and fittings was satisfactory. Tuberculosis and Measles. In addition to the ordinary notification of infectious diseases, in all cases of measles notified from schools and in cases of tuberculosis the homes of the patients were inspected and advice given re isolation and disinfection, to prevent the spread of infection and all insanitary conditions were dealt with. Housing and Town Planning Act, 1909. The premises, 232, 234, 236, West Ferry Road, were reported to be dealt with under this Act, as unfit for human habitation and upon your representation to the Council closing orders were made—at the date of this report the premises are unoccupied. Premises where Food Stuffs were Sold or Prepared for Sale. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises:— Bakehouses, 7. Slaughterhouses, 1. Tripe dressers and sausage makers, 9. Dairies and milk shops, 19. Ice cream vendors, 22. Coffee shops and dining rooms, 33. Fish shops, 12. In all cases where cleansing, limewashing, or other works of sanitary improvements were necessary the matter was brought to the notice of the occupiers by written intimation, which in every case was complied with. The regularity of the periodical inspection of these premises has impressed upon the occupiers the necessity of cleanliness and lime. washing, etc., of kitchens and places where food is prepared or stored. This was proved by the amount of work already completed or in progress (without notice) at the time of my visits. Riverside Wharves and Food Preserving Factories. Frequent visits were made to the undermentioned wharves and factories, and records were kept of all unsound foodstuffs and methods of destruction. 250 Sufferance Wharf and Food Preserving Factory, West Ferry Road (for export only) The tinned food stuff rejected and destroyed by this firm during the year amounted to 231 cases, each containing about 48 tins, which contained principally preserved fish. These cases were marked unsound and sealed and were put overboard at sea from the firm's boats. Maconochie's Wharf and Food Preserving Factory, West Ferry Road. The total amount of food stuffs rejected as unsound by this firm and destroyed in the furnaces on the premises at the time of my visits during the past year was 1,226 tins, varying in weight from ¼lb. to 141b., and consisting of meat, fish, poultry, fruit and vegetables. St. Andrew's Wharf and Cattle Food Factory, West Ferry Road. 711 bags of unsound walnuts (in rancid condition) were received at the above factory with a guarantee that the stuff should be used for cattle food and for the extraction of oil for soap or paint making. No notice was received from H.M. Office of Customs under the regulations made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, of food stuff imported by water into this district during the past year, and no infringement of the Act was observed by me. Inspection of Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls in the main thoroughfares were regularly visited. Surprise visits were made frequently on Saturday nights and occasionally on Sunday mornings. Although several small articles were destroyed as suspicious or tainted, in no instance was I justified in seizing any food stuff exposed for sale during these visits. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-three samples of food were purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis as under:— *Milk 29. Butter 11. Margarine 5 Lard 1. Coffee 3. Cocoa 1. Cod Liver Oil 1. Glycerine 2. * 10 of the milk samples were obtained from itinerant vendors, 8 of which were purchased on Sunday morning. 251 Of the samples taken, 3 were certified to be so adulterated that summonses were issued against the respective vendors. The remainder were certified genuine and free from preservatives. The nature of samples and extent of adulteration with results of prosecutions are indicated below:— Sample 7 F.—Milk deficient in fat, 16.6 per cent, vendor fined £1 and 23s. costs. Sample 11 F.—Milk deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 3.3 and 5 per cent, respectively, vendor fined 17s. and 23s. costs. Sample 29 F.—Milk deficient in solids not fat 5.8 per cent, vendor fined £2 and 23s. costs.

Public Health Department, 31st December, 1913. Sir,— I beg to present my fourteenth Annual Report which deals with the work done in factories and workshops, among outworkers and other miscellaneous inspections during the year 1913. Verminous Children, Phthisis and Scabies. The homes of children attending school in a verminous and dirty condition have again absorbed much time and though there is still much room for improvement it is encouraging to note an increased attention to cleanliness, both in the homes and persons of the children. The homes of children suffering from scabies (itch) have also been visited, leaflets left, advice given, and frequently disinfection of bedding carried out. I have had under observation the homes of tuberculous patients attending the dispensary especially where shelters, bedsteads or bedding have been lent by the Committee. Inspection of Schools. The sanitary accommodation for the girls and infants in the 36 elementary schools in the Borough have been inspected and various defects remedied or reported to the London County Council (Education Department). Outworkers and National Insurance Act. The outworkers' lists have been inspected at the premises from which work was given out, and 128 lists have been received from employers in the Borough; 327 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs containing the names of persons who live in Poplar; 223 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. There is again a marked decrease in the number of outworkers employed. This decrease has been gradual for some years and it appears probable that in the future more work will be done in factories and workshops and less in the homes of the people. 253 The following is a tabulated statement of further details:— Tabulated statement of Inspections of Insanitary Conditions found existing, and of Re-inspections, &c., during the twelve months ended 31st December, 1913.

Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., January 5th, 1914. Sir,— I beg to present the sixth Annual Report of my work. The paid Organising Secretary of the Poplar Health Visiting Association commenced her duties early in January. I now, therefore, have no communication with the Voluntary Helpers, and know nothing of the work carried on by the Association except as regards the visiting. Case Papers are sent out from this department weekly or on request, direct to the Organising Secretary, who returns them monthly for the purpose of tabulating the number of visits paid, etc., for the report to the Public Health and Housing Committee. I regret to have to report a still further decline in this branch of the Association's work, there being a decrease of 4,422 in the number of visits paid, compared to 1912. With your permission I undertook to organise the work of the Demonstrators at the Tuberculosis Exhibition, attending each day, and lecturing to “Mothers” each afternoon. My grateful thanks are due to those ladies and gentlemen, who by their hearty co-operation, made my task such a pleasant one, and helped to make the exhibition the success it undoubtedly was. Later on I also organised a “Baby Show” in connection with a “Garden Fete” held in the Poplar Recreation Grounds, and would like to express my thanks to everyone who helped, more especially to Doctors Cullen, J. Fearnley, E. Gorrie, Rome Hall and G. R. Young, who very kindly undertook the difficult task of judging. My thanks are also due to the Charity Organisation Society and the Children's Invalid Aid Association for help received during the year. The reduction in the number of “Mothers working at Home,” I put down as due to the operation of the National Insurance Act. The number of infants kept under supervision during 1912 shows an increase (665), the rate of mortality amongst them a decrease (25.52 per 1,000) in comparison with 1911. Included under the heading “Miscellaneous” are visits paid while carrying out investigations for the London County Council Inspector of Mid wives and in connection with births not notified. The cases referred to this department by the hospitals have been very few. 259 VISITING. (1) Poplar Health Visiting Association.

Mr. Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors, I submit for your consideration a report for the year 1953 on the health and sanitary conditions of the City of Westminster. This is the first report which I have had the honour of submitting; but as I took office on the 1st October, 1953, the report can fairly be regarded as the twenty-ninth in the series for which Dr. Shinnie was responsible. Not only was he Medical Officer of Health for the first nine months of the year, but during his long years of service with the City Council he established a pattern, and set a standard, which are and will long continue to be a guide and an inspiration to those who follow in succession to him. For those who have had the privilege of knowing him, and working with him in various capacities for many years, as I have done, a personal regard and esteem are added to the admiration which is universally felt for professional standards and attainments of the highest order, combined with that outstanding devotion to duty and to the interests and welfare of the City and its inhabitants, which so signally marked Dr. Shinnie's career in war and peace. Tributes to his work have already been paid by both members and officers of the City Council, and I feel that I am fortunate in succeeding one who has established such happy relationships with the Council and all who work for it. His example is difficult to follow; but I can assure all concerned that it will be my constant endeavour to maintain the high standards which have been established. I have the honour to be Your obedient Servant, J. A. Struthers, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1954. (6636) A 5 10 STATISTICS AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS.

Two notifications of diphtheria were received and the patients removed to hospital, but the diagnosis was not confirmed. This is the third year in succession in which the City has been free from this disease. It must be emphasised, however, that this freedom must not give rise to complacency or lessening of vigilance. The need for protecting their infants by immunization cannot be too strongly impressed on the parents. Diphtheria was until recently a terrible scourge in this country, and it may reappear. Facilities for immunization are available at all the child welfare clinics in the City. Dysentery. Notification was received of 181 confirmed cases of dysentery during the year as compared with 47 last year. The increase is largely accounted for by outbreaks in children attending the three day nurseries in Westminster and also to a lesser extent by a comparatively large number of sporadic cases for which no common source could be found. The majority of cases were of a mild nature and it was only found necessary to remove 19 cases to hospital. Measles. 493 cases of measles were notified in the City during the year as compared with 781 in 1952. There were no deaths from this disease. Poliomyelitis. Nine confirmed cases of poliomyelitis occurred during the year as compared with ten confirmed cases last year. Four of these cases were paralytic and five non-paralytic. Of the four paralytic cases, three were under 15 months of age. There were no cases in the first or last quarters of the year; and no deaths. Psittacosis. One confirmed case of psittacosis occurred in Westminster during the year. It was ascertained that the patient, who recovered completely, owned a budgerigar and that one week before admission to hospital, she had visited bird stalls in another part of London. As her own budgerigar was apparently healthy and was not known to have suffered from any recent illness, the infection was probably derived from the latter source. The Minister of Health was informed of the case and the patient advised as to the steps to be taken regarding her own bird. 13 Typhoid. One case of typhoid fever, in a woman of 22, was notified during the year. The alleged source of infection was a meal of oysters which she had consumed with a party of three others in a restaurant in Westminster. Specimens were obtained from other members of the party, from members of the staff of the restaurant and from contacts at her home address, and all proved negative. No other cases developed. Smallpox. The Medical Officer of Health had occasion during the year to investigate a case of suspected smallpox at the request of the medical practitioner attending the patient. The patient was a child of 10 months of age who had been vaccinated 14 days before the appearance of the rash. Generalised vaccinia was diagnosed and the child made an uneventful recovery. Information was received on two occasions that contacts of smallpox or suspected smallpox were arriving in Westminster. These contacts, numbering 33, were kept under surveillance by officers of the department during the period of incubation and none developed the disease. Whooping Cough. There were 317 confirmed cases of whooping cough in Westminster during the year as compared with 233 last year. Investigations established that there was a small, localised, epidemic during the September quarter, when, in all, 205 notifications were received as compared with 14 and 27 in the March and June quarters respectively and 24 in the corresponding quarter in 1952. There were no deaths during the year. The number of notifications received in the December quarter was 71. 14 Deaths, 1953. Causes of Death at Different Periods of Life in the City. Causes of Deaths.

The examination of material submitted by the Medical Officer of Health, including faeces, urine, food and other material in connection with food poisoning, has been carried out at the Public Health Laboratory of the Medical Research Council, opened at the County Hall, Westminster Bridge, on the 1st April, 1953.

(1952—Pulmonary, 225 new cases; Non-Pulmonary, 16 new cases.) Deaths from Tuberculosis. Pulmonary—28 (24 males, 4 females). Non-Pulmonary—2 (2 males). Mass X-Ray Service. In the course of the year, the Mass X-Ray Service of the SouthWest Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board operated in Westminster, when 14,451 residents and people working in the City were examined. Of these, 75 persons were referred for further investigation to Chest Clinics where 15 were found to be suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis. 17 Welfare of Old People. Aged Persons in need of care and attention. Under the provisions of the National Assistance Acts, a Medical Officer of Health is empowered to apply to the Courts for an order for the compulsory removal to a hospital or other suitable place, of persons who are suffering from grave chronic disease or, being aged, infirm or physically incapacitated, are living in insanitary conditions and unable to devote to themselves, and are not receiving from others, proper care and attention. Fortunately it has not been found necessary to invoke these powers during the year. Aged and Infirm Persons. Number of aged and infirm persons visited during the year 1953 250 Total number of inspections made with regard to these 1,012 Primary 197 Re-inspections 815 Cases of aged and infirm persons brought to the notice of the Medical Officer of Health during 1953 197 The Westminster Old People's Welfare Association. This Association formed in 1947 continued its activities for the welfare of aged persons in the City. These activities include nine Old People's clubs in different parts of the City where recreation and light refreshments are provided. Two of these clubs are organised by the W.V.S., one by the British Red Cross Society, and another at St. Martin-in-theFields in co-operation with the Association. Holidays at seaside resorts are provided for the aged as well as summer outings, Christmas parties, and other entertainments. Valuable work is also carried out by voluntary workers of the Association in visiting the ailing and lonely in their homes. A library service is provided by the City Librarian. The chiropody service provided by the Association has proved of immense benefit to the old people who are affected with foot troubles. The Association have arrangements with two clinics in different parts of the City where the aged can attend for treatment, and home treatment is arranged for those who are home bound. The charge to the elderly patients varies from 1s. per foot per treatment to 2s., the balance of cost which varies from 3s. to 6s. per treatment is borne by the Association. Under the provisions of the National Assistance Act, 1948, a local authority may make contributions to the funds of any voluntary organisation whose activities consist in or include provision of recreation or meals for old people. The City Council under this authority make an annual grant to the Association and office accommodation is provided for them in the Public Health Department. 18 British Red Cross Society—Mobile Meals Service. The Westminster Division of the British Red Cross Society has continued this service which it established in the City in 1945 for the delivery to their homes of hot mid-day meals to aged people who are themselves unable to prepare meals of this sort. The service is operated with two vans provided by the City Council and loaned to the Society. The City Council also makes a grant to the Society of 75 per cent, of the running costs of the vans. The meals are purchased from a London County Council civic restaurant where they are placed in individual containers. By this method a variety of meals are obtained to suit different tastes. The containers are kept hot in a heated chamber in the vans until delivered at the homes of the old people. The cost of the meal is 1s. 6d., the old people are charged l0d. the London County Council bearing the difference of 8d. per meal. Some 8,238 meals were delivered by this service during the year. This was accomplished by the British Red Cross Society with the service of one paid driver-organiser and a band of enthusiastic voluntary workers. International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation. Arrangements continued during the year for the authentication by the Medical Officer of Health of International Certificates of Vaccination and Inoculation completed by medical practitioners in Westminster. These certificates are required by passengers proceeding abroad from this country, and the purpose of the authentication is to provide proof to those health authorities abroad who desire it that the signature of the person issuing the certificate is that of a registered medical practitioner. Some 3,388 certificates were authenticated during the year. Slaughter of Animals Act, 1933—Slaughterman's Licences. The Council during the year granted Slaughterman's licences to fifteen men who had been accepted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to act as their inspectors in different parts of the country. These licences are required to be held by the pupils while undergoing training in humane slaughtering as inspectors of the R.S.P.C.A. Paddington Group Hospital Management Committee. The Council at the invitation of the Paddington Group Hospital Management Committee appointed Councillor Havinden to serve on House Committee No. 1. 19 SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES.

Food and Drugs Act, Sections 17 and 18. Food Poisoning. The following return was made to the Ministry of Health in accordance with the requirements of Appendix D (I) of the revised Memo. 188/ Med/49, giving details of food poisoning notifications received during the year and returned to the Registrar General:— lst Quarter. 2nd Quarter. 3rd Quarter. 4th Quarter. Total. — 3 6 3 12 31 In nine of the twelve confirmed cases of food poisoning notified only one individual was concerned. In the remaining three cases it was found that the individual was one among others who had suffered similarly. In addition to the above notified cases, various outbreaks have occurred during the year in the City. None of the persons concerned was notified as suffering from food poisoning, but from the investigations carried out it was apparent that those affected were suffering from illness of that character. It was possible in only two of these outbreaks to identify positively the causative agent. It is usually found that in such outbreaks few, if any, patients consult a doctor. Bylaws for the Protection of Food. Bylaws under Section 15, Food and Drugs Act, 1938, were made by the London County Council with effect from November, 1952, for securing the observance of sanitary and cleanly conditions and practice, and in connection with the sale, &c., of food intended for human consumption.

The following action was taken during the year in this connection:— Premises visited 8 Visits made 29 Pigeons destroyed 41 Noise Nuisance. Complaints 32 Investigations made 49 The type of noise of which complaint has been made varied considerably and included noise created by machinery of several kinds, electric fans of ventilating plants, dance bands and amplifiers, radio sets, and various noises arising from the demolition of buildings, pneumatic drills, compressors, &c.

The resident population of 99,380 in 27,349 dwellings received water from the Metropolitan Water Board's mains or from deep wells. Eighty. nine deep wells were in use at 31st December, 1953. In 86 of these the water is used for domestic purposes. In the others, one supply is used 36 for cooling purposes, one for supplying boilers, and one is a stand-by in case of fire. Satisfactory reports were received of 104 bacteriological examinations and 20 chemical analyses of water from these wells. One complaint of contaminated drinking water was received during the year and this was found to be due to defective tank coverings allowing rain water to enter storage tanks. This defect was immediately rectified. Disinfection and Disinfestation. Rooms. Articles. Articles Destroyed Articles Washed. Vehicles. Books.

Arrangements have also been carried out for the cleansing and disinfestation of the clothing of old people prior to their being admitted into homes. Vagrants who come voluntarily to the Cleansing Station or who are brought by the Police are cleansed and their clothes disinfested. Furniture of incoming tenants to the Council's housing estates, found on inspection to be verminous, is fumigated with hydrocyanic acid gas by a firm of contractors before transfer to new accommodation. It was not found necessary to carry out any fumigations during the year. 37 Burial or Cremation of the Dead. Under the provisions of Section 50 of the National Assistance Act. 1948, it is the duty of the City Council as a Sanitary Authority to cause to be buried or cremated the body of any person who has died or is found dead in the area, where no other arrangements have beeD made for the disposal of the body. The Council is empowered to recover the cost of burial from the estate of the deceased, and is eligible to receive payments in respect of the cost of such burial from death grants payable under the provisions of the National Insurance Act, 1946. Where persons without known relatives die in the City, it is frequently necessary not only to arrange for their burial, but to dispose of the contents of their homes. This course is necessary to enable the proceeds to be applied towards the cost of burial and also to avoid rent accruing and to release the accommodation for housing purposes as early as possible. During the year 33 burials were undertaken by the City Council in its cemetery at Hanwell, the requests for such burials being received from the following sources:— H.M. Coroner's Officer 17 Relatives of the deceased 9 Friends of the deceased 3 Hospitals in the City 4 33 Coroner's Court and Mortuary. During 1953, 294 bodies were received in the Mortuary on Coroner's Warrants, etc. Five bodies were admitted to await burial. Number of Cases. Inquest cases 79 Non-inquest cases 215 Post mortem examinations held 249 Causes of death in the foregoing were as under :— Accidental drowning — Found drowned 5 Suicide by drowning 1 „ by other means 22 Accidents— Street 11 Domestic 14 Others 10 Natural causes 217 Misadventure 4 Murder 1 Miscellaneous cases 9 38 Civil Defence in 1953. The Civil Defence duties assigned to the Medical Officer of Health are mortuary service, decontamination and salvage of food, cleansing of contaminated persons, and health and medical services in public shelters. A comprehensive scheme has been prepared for the mortuary service based on the experience of the last war. A number of the Council's officers have been trained in the administration of war-time mortuaries and premises have been earmarked for this purpose. A scheme has also been drawn up based on civil defence requirements in the last war for the decontamination and salvage of food, and a site has been earmarked as a treatment centre. The City Council's Public Analysts have agreed to undertake the examination of contaminated foods.

County of London 60.0 (Census 1911). † Based on the returns furnished under the scheme for rationing of food. ‡ See italics end of first paragraph, page 2. 2 The rates for 1914 in Tables IV., V., VI. and VII., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the censuses of 1901 and 1911. The rates for 1915—1919, were calculated upon the populations estimated by the Registrar General. The following estimates of population have been adopted in the General Register Office, Somerset House, for the calculation of the death rate and birth rate of the Borough for the year 1919: For the death rate 153,644 „ „ birth „ 160,051 During the year 1919 births took place in institutions within the Borough as follows:— Males.

During the year the marriages of 3,326 persons were registered in the Borough, giving an annual rate of 20.78 per 1,000 of the estimated population, the rate for England and Wales being 19.7, and for London 22.1. The rate in England and Wales in 1919 was 18.5 per 1,000 of the estimated population. 5 The annual marriage rate per 1,000 living being :— Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

During the year 2,337 deaths were registered in the Borough of Poplar, 451 deaths having occurred in the Sub-District of Poplar, 1,609 in Bromley, and 277 in Bow; from the 451 deaths which took place in Poplar there must be deducted 34 deaths of non-residents, and to the remainder must be added 393 deaths which occurred in outlying institutions, making a total of 810 deaths of Poplar parishioners. Treating the 1,609 registered deaths in Bromley in a similar manner, viz., deducting 902 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 163 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this sub-district will be found to be 870. From the 277 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 4 nonresidents and added 260 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 533 deaths. In dealing separately with the sub-districts as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II., and III., that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, certain additions and deductions from the sub-districts have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 2,337 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 549 deaths of actual non-residents, and 425 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 2,213 upon which the death rate is calculated. The 810 deaths in Poplar included 8 illegitimate children, 3 male and 5 female; the 870 deaths in Bromley included 7 illegitimate children, 2 male and 5 female; the 533 Bow deaths included 1 illegitimate female child, making a total for the Borough of 16 deaths of illegitimate children Males.

Mortality rate among infants visited was 67.9 per 1,000. The infants visited are for the most part in the poorest portions of the Borough, and the rate refers to those born in 1918. In 1910 and 1911 the rates were 105.69 and 115.62, because diarrhoea was prevalent in 1911. The infantile mortality rate is based on deaths occurring in any one year and births occurring in that and the preceding year The rate of mortality amongst infants visited by Health Visitors is calculated upon births occurring in one particular year and deaths in that and the following year. The children born in 1910 and dying during 1910-11 are shown in the rate for 1910, so that the diarrhoea months June, July, August and September of 1911 affected not only the children born in 1911, but also those born in 1910 who had not yet reached one year of age, hence the higher rates amongst infants visited during the two years 1910 and 1911. 1908 Mortality rates amongst infants visited 104.19 1909 „ „ „ 98.75 1910 „ „ „ 105.69 1911 „ „ „ 115.62 1912 „ „ „ 90.10 1913 „ „ „ 83.20 1914 „ „ „ 117.00 1915 „ „ „ 98.20 1916 „ „ „ 78.07 1917 „ „ „ 79.2 1918 „ „ „ 67.9 9 Notification of Births Act, 1907.

The rates are calculated per 1000 of the estimated gross population. * In Column 6 are included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the borough, but excluding the deaths of soldiers and sailors that have occurred in hospitals and institutions in the district. In Column 12 are entered the number in Column 6, corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. †"Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence—e.g., casuals—are not included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses and nursing homes (but not almshouses) are regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement are referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from violence are referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (6) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known ; and (d) failing this, to the district where the bodv was found.

Verminous Rooms.† Licensed Premises' Urinals. Verminous Rooms. Verminous rooms are still brought to the notice of owners upon the "Intimations" which are followed, if necessary, by "Statutory Notices," more especially as there are generally other defects upon the premises, and certainly verminous premises are "in such a state as to be a nuisance to health," and owners, if they do not already know, are informed when defects are being dealt with under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, that the vermin must be got rid of, otherwise the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, will be brought into operation. When a notice is served for cleansing under the byelaws for houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, should the premises be verminous a special intimation to that effect is enclosed. During the year 154 Intimation Notices were served in respect of verminous rooms, and the verminous rooms cleansed were :— East Combined Division 28 West Combined Division 19 Poplar South Division 9 Bromley North Division 12 Bromley Central Division 11 Bow East Division 29 Bow West Division 26 Houses Let in Lodgings 20 Two summonses were applied for.

I am, Sir, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E. June, 1920. 100 Report to Medical Officer of Health of Miss A. E. Hall, Chief Health Visitor. Public Health Department, Bow Road, E. 3. January lst, 1920. Sir, I beg to present the twelfth Annual Report of the work of the Maternity and Child Welfare Department, the fifth under the Local Government Board's extended scheme for the Prevention of Infantile Mortality. The visiting areas remain as before:— Poplar Infant Welfare Association. Undertake all the work south of the first bridges. The Royal College of St. Katharine. Undertake all the work between the first bridges and Bow Road. The J'ublic Health Department. Undertake all the work north of Bow Road. The working arrangement between the above bodies and this department continues to work smoothly. The Treatment of Minor Ailments, and Ante-Natal Clinics were opened in June. The midwives in the district were invited to the opening of the latter to meet Dr. Dobson, and talk over things generally, and, although the feeling appeared to be against the necessity for such a Clinic, all promised their support. Flannel and wools, etc., were obtained to be retailed to the mothers attending, at cost prices, and advice on cutting out and making given. Two courses cf lectures were arranged —one to be delivered by Dr. Dobson, and one by myself. The attendances were very gratifying, but all educational work had to be suspended when the Clinics were made distributing centres for free milk. A very successful and unique party was given in July, jointly by the Mayoress (Mrs. W. Lax), Lady Yeo, and Mrs. Reginald Blair, between sixty and seventy mothers, with their twin children, accepting invitations. The usual Baby Show was organised in connection with the Mayor's Garden Party. Payment of the midwives' fee was made in two necessitous cases. Part payment for Convalescent Home in one case. The number of mothers delivered in institutions appears to be increasing (368), and knowing the difficulty there has been in obtaining vacancies for one or two cases, I think the time has arrived when the establishment of a Maternity Home in our own Borough should be considered. 101 Visiting.

To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Sir and Gentlemen, In accordance with "The Sanitary Officer's (London) Order, 1891," of the Local Government Board, dated 8th December, 1891, I have the pleasure of submitting to you my twelfth Annual Report, which Report deals with the Year 1904, and includes the Annual Reports of the Sanitary Inspectors, also the Report of the Lady Inspector and that of the Assistant Sanitary Inspector engaged in enforcing the bye-laws for Houses let in Lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. VITAL STATISTICS. The population of the Borough, estimated to the middle of the year 1904, on the theory of the basis of the rate of chunge between the censuses of 1896 and 1901 being maintained, is 169,519 :— Registration London. Poplar. Bromley. Bow. 4,648,950 59,378 67,696 42,445 2 being 62.1 (see footnote) inhabitants per acre in Registration London, 72.84 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 50.92 per acre in Poplar Parish, 111.8 in Bromley, and 76.47 in Bow.* These estimated populations are the figures used in calculating the various rates in the present Report for the year 1904. The various rates quoted in this Report for the years 1893 to 1900 are the rates as stated in previous Reports.; they are calculated upon the then estimated populations, and as far as possible from past Annual Reports for the Parish of Bow figures respecting certain diseases have been extracted and the rates worked out so that the three parishes might be compared, but the rates in Tables IY., V., and VI., have been calculated upon revised estimated populations based upon the known censuses of 1891, 1896, and 1901. The births during the 52 weeks were:— Males. Females. Totals. Poplar 991 939 1930 Bromley 1141 1165 2306 Bow 685 623 1308 Totals 2817 2727 5544 Of these births, 68 were illegitimate in Poplar, 29 males and 39 females. In Bromley there were 43 illegitimate births, 18 males and 25 females. In Bow there were 7 illegitimate births, 3 males and 4 females, making a total of 118 in the Borough. Of the 1930 births registered in Poplar, 59 occurred in the Poplar Union Workhouse, and of the 2306 registered in Bromley, * kese figures are calculated upon the acreage of the district including the water area, but exclusive of area covered by water they are:—93.0 per acre for the Borough of Poplar, 100.3 for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley combined, and 78.0 for Bow. County of London 62.1(no account being taken of tidiJ water and foreshore.) 3 5 occurred in the Sick Asylum and 35 in the Stepney Union Workhouse, 2 in the City of London Union Infirmary, and 0 in the Poplar Hospital. The annual birth rate per 1000 living being: — Poplar. Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

The annual marriage rate per 1000 living being: — Poplar and Bromley. Bow. Borough of Poplar.

Treating the 1887 registered deaths in Bromley in the same manner, viz., deducting 814 deaths of non-parishioners and adding 204 deaths in outlying institutions, the deaths to be assigned to this parish will be found to be 1277. From the 548 Bow deaths, there must be deducted 24 non-residents and added 239 deaths in outlying institutions, making a total of 763 deaths. In dealing separately with the parishes as above, it will be seen by referring to Tables I., II. and III. that in considering the deaths of non-residents and those from outlying institutions, that certain additions and deductions from the parishes have to be made in respect of themselves, but when considering the Borough as a whole, then from the 3264 deaths which were registered there must be deducted 522 deaths of actual non-residents and 412 deaths in institutions entirely outlying must be added, making a total for the Borough of 3154, upon which the death rate is calculated. The 1114 deaths in Poplar included 9 illegitimate children, 4 male and 5 female; the 1277 deaths in Bromley included 25 illegitimate children, 16 male and 9 female; the 763 Bow deaths included 8 illegitimate children, 2 male and 6 female, making a total for the Borough of 42 deaths of illegitimate children.

Poplar 387 429 816 Bromley 487 542 1029 Bow 275 270 545 Totals 1149 1241 2390 The male births in the Borough exceeded those of the female by 0, but the male deaths exceeded those of the female by 182, which makes a gain of 92 females. At the end of the years 1888, 1899, and 1900 there was also an excess of females for the Parishes of Poplar and Bromley. In'the Borough for the years 1901, 1902 and 1903 females also exceeded the males. The following figures are the death rates per 1000 living for the past 20 years (see page 2) :— Poplar. Bromley. Bow.

See Table XIII., page 24, East Districts. The Deptford Borough Council had under consideration the suggestion that the duties of the Guardians in respect of the registration of births and deaths might with advantage be transferred to the Borough Councils and the registrations effected at Municipal buildings, instead of at the private residences of the Registrars, and they asked for the opinion of the Council on the matter. The Committee concurred in the suggestion, and recommended the Council accordingly. The following are death rates per 1000 living from the seven principal zymotic diseases and respiratory diseases, and proportion of deaths to 1,000 deaths from all causes. See Table XVI., page 26.

A copy was received, of a resolution moved by Sir J. Crichton Browne and adopted at a meeting presided over by the Bishop of Stepney, to the following effect, viz.:— " That this Meeting is of opinion that the Diseases, physical and " mental, resulting directly or by inheritance, from Venereal " Disease are so serious and numerous that it is desirable that " there should be full enquiry into the matter; particularly in the " direction whether there is adequate provision for the treatment " of the poorer classes in the various stages of the disease, and " urges that the public bodies connected with the health of the " people should take action in this matter." 11 It was suggested the Council should support an appeal to the Government for an enquiry as suggested. It was pointed out the facilities for treatment of in patients are quite inadequate, and could be probably largely developed in existing hospitals if the desirability of such development could be shown. The Committee recommended the Council to support an appeal to the Government for an enquiry as proposed. TABLE I.

The percentage on the total scarlet fever cases was 5.0, diphtheria cases 4.9, and enteric fever cases 17.6. Amongst the 20 cases wrongly certified as scarlet fever there were 9 of measles, 1 of rotheln, and 1 of tubercular meningitis. Amongst the 24 cases wrongly certified as diphtheria were one of measles, 2 of stomatitis, and 2 of retro-pharyngeal abscess. Amongst the 9 cases wrongly certified as enteric fever were 1 of measles, 2 of pneumonia, 1 of lumbago, 1 of malignant-endocarditis, 1 of tuberculosis of lungs, 1 of infantile diarrhoea, and 1 of tonsillitis. In the course of the year 1903 no fewer than 1,913 patients against 2,108 in 1902 or a percentage on the total admissions of 37 10.4 in 1903 and 8.6 in 1902 were, after admission at the fever hospitals, found not to be suffering from the diseases mentioned in the medical certificates upon which they were removed to hospital. The number of cases wrongly notified in Poplar and London for the years 1899—1904, and removed to Infectious Diseases Hospitals have been as follows : — Percentage of mistakes in total admissions. Poplar. London. 1899 49 cases 8.4 6.3 1900 60 „ 7.3 7.9 1901 131 „ 13.1 9.2 1902 93 „ 6.3 8.6 1903 46 „ 6.5 10.4 1904 54 „ 5.5 Facilities are still afforded to practitioners to have swabbings from throats of doubtful cases of Diphtheria, and specimens of blood from doubtful cases of Typhoid Fever bacteriologically examined. In every case of wrongful notification the Public Health and Housing Committee requires an explanation from the Practitioner concerned, and where this is not satisfactory the facts are reported to the Council. The Committee fully concur with the Metropolitan Asylums Board that "the introduction into the Board's Hospitals of cases of other diseases than those which such hospitals are designed to treat" should be prevented as far as practicable. Arrangements are made that the positive results of bacteriological examinations are communicated to the officers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board at the time when the removals of patients are telephoned. One case of erysipelas and one of measles were connected with milkshops in Poplar. One case of diphtheria, one of small pox, two of chicken pox, two of scarlet fever, three of measles and two of erysipelas were connected with milkshops in Bromley. One case of scarlet fever and four of measles were connected with like premises in Bow. The sale of milk was stopped until after the premises and utensils had been disinfected. 38 For notices which had been received from Port Sanitary Authorities respecting passengers coming to the Borough of Poplar see page 54. Nineteen premises with outworkers were connected with infectious cases notified, 6 in Poplar, 6 in Bromley, and 7 in Bow. One small pox, 5 scarlet fever, 8 diphtheria, 1 typhoid fever, 1 erysipelas, and three chicken pox. No notices were served under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, Section 110, but, where there was any risk of infection the work was discontinued, and any work found on the premises was disinfected before being returned. Eight cases of measles were also connected with outworkers' premises, and where work was found on the premises, it was disinfected before being returned if there were any likelihood of infection, but there is no power to prevent work being executed on outworkers' premises where measles exists. See page 87. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered a communication from a Eelief Committee of the Poplar Guardians complaining that no maintenance allowance was granted to a family on the withholding by the Medical Officer of Health of a clearance certificate after a case of infectious disease, to a person engaged on homework. The Eelief Committee was informed the Council has no power to grant relief as suggested. Under Section 110 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, if any inmate of a house is suffering from an infectious disease, the Council may make an order forbidding homo work to be given out to any person living or working in that house. The Committee were of opinion that when it is necessary, in the interests of public safety, for such action to be taken, the Council should have discretionary power to award compensation in any case, and recommended the Council that the Local Government Board be asked to promote legislation in the direction indicated. Pending the reply of the Local Government Board to the request of the Council to promote legislation giving Sanitary Authorities discretionary powers to award compensation to inmates of a house 30 or laundry who have lost their home or laundry work through a case of infectious disease on the premises, the Committee considered the maintenance of such persons should be left to the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health in each case, and the Committee recommended the Council— " That the maintenance of the inmates of a house who have " lost their home or laundry work through an infectious " disease existing or having existed on the premises, should " be left to the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health: " maintenance to be either in money or kind. The Medical " Officer to report to the Public Health Committee at their " next meeting the action he has taken in any case, and " application to be made to the Local Government Board for " relief under the Local Authorities Expenses Act in respect " of any expenditure incurred." The Committee considered a communication from the Incorporated Guild of Hairdressers, which Guild, in conjunction with the City Corporation, had arranged a set of regulations for the conduct of the business of a barber and hairdresser, with a view to the prevention of the spread of contagious diseases through improper methods in barbers' shops. It had been arranged that any hairdresser applying to the Guild for a certificate should be furnished with a form of certificate of suitability of his premises, to be signed by the Medical Officer of the City of London, after inspection, and subject to this, and compliance with the regulations approved, the Guild certificate would be granted. It was suggested by the Guild that similar arrangements should be made with the Borough Councils for inspection and certification in their respective Boroughs by the Medical Officers. The Committee were of opinion such a course is desirable in the interests of public health, and recommended the Council— "That the Medical Officer of Health be authorised to give "certificates of suitability of premises to applicants for the " Hairdressers' Guild Certificates." 40 ALPHABETICAL STREET LIST OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

The attention of the London County Council was called to the spread of small-pox through the agency of vagrants, and it was suggested the Council should convene a Conference of the Sanitary Authorities of England and Wales to consider the question. The London County Council agreed to convene the Conference, and on the 10th November at the County Hall, Spring Gardens, together with Mr. Councillor Bacon, I attended a Conference on the "Spread of Infectious Disease by Vagrants." The following are the Resolutions adopted by the Conference. GENERAL MEASURES FOR THE PREVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE BY VAGRANTS. (1) (a) That this Conference of urban and sanitary authorities of Kngland and Wales recognises the increasing amount of habituai D 50 vagrancy as the cause of wide-spread and disastrous consequences to the public health, and is of opinion that much more effective measures than are at present adopted should be taken for preventing the spread of infectious disease by vagrants, and for effectually dealing with this great and growing danger. (b) That the evil can only be met by conferring further powers upon the local authorities, viz., the sanitary authority, the board of guardians, and the magistracy. (2) That means should be provided for the detention and isolation of any vagrants found wandering in a public place, if reasonably suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. (3) That this Conference is of opinion that it is desirable that (a) Parliamentary powers should be sought for the compulsory vaccination and re-vaccination of all vagrants unable to produce proof of being sufficiently protected against small-pox on entering casual wards or common lodging houses, who, in the opinion of the sanitary authority, have been exposed to the infection of smallpox, and also that sanitary authorities should have power to grant such compensation as they think necessary to persons vaccinated or re-vaccinated at their request who may be prevented on that account from work; (b) It should be an offence to withhold information or make false statements to the sanitary authority in carrying out its powers with respect to the disease. (4) That in order to deal effectually with the transmission of notifiable infectious disease by tramps, power should be given to county councils to enforce the existing laws in all cases where sanitary authorities in the county refuse or neglect to do so. • (5) That the Local Government Board should obtain power to secure weekly reurns of all cases of infectious disease from all central authorities throughout the country, and circulate the same. 51 (6) That it is desirable that in districts comprising groups of counties and county boroughs, intelligence bureaux should be established, to which information should be sent from sanitary authorities and workhouses in the district, of persons of the wandering class who have been exposed to the infection of smallpox; and that a printed copy of such information should be distributed from the bureau to every sanitary authority and board of guardians in the district, and that the expense of working the bureau should be met by contributions from the county councils and county boroughs forming the district. (7) That this Conference is of opinion that the port sanitary authorities should be authorised to take more stringent precautions to prevent the importation of disease by persons arriving by vessel at the ports who are suffering from small-pox, or who have been exposed to infection by that disease. COMMON LODGING-HOUSES AND CASUAL WARDS. (8) That the local authority should have increased control over common lodging-houses, their keepers and occupants. Thus the Local Authority should have power— (a) To medically examine the inmates. (6) To detain and isolate persons exposed to infection and to disinfect them and their clothes. (c) To temporarily close a common lodging-house in whole or in part, compensation to be given to the keeper of the house. (9) That the local authority should have power to order the keeper of a common lodging-house in which there has been infectious disease to refuse fresh admissions for such time as may be required by the authority. (10) That the local authority should be empowered to require medical examination and disinfection of all persons entering casual wards. D 2 52 (11) That the local sanitary authority should have power to require the removal and isolation of any inmate of a casual ward who may reasonably be suspected of being liable to convey infectious disease. (12) That the local authority should have full power to require the cleansing of the person and the disinfection of the clothes of any person in a casual ward, whether infected or exposed to infection. LABOUR BUREAUX. (13) (a) That the time has arrived when the Local Government Board should promote legislation for the establishment of labour bureaux in the areas of every county council and every county borough council. (b) That this Conference is also of opinion that it is desirable that a national voluntary agency should be formed for assisting bona-fide working men while travelling through the country in search of work, and that such agency should be worked on the same lines as the Inter-Cantonal Union of Switzerland for the relief of poor travellers. (14) That the unemployed travelling buna-fide in search of work, not being habitual vagrants, should not be treated as vagrants, but as far as possible be assisted to obtain employment. LABOUR COLONIES. (15) That the time has arrived when the Local Government Board should promote legislation for the establishment of labour colonies for the compulsory detention of habitual vagrants until they have acquired power to work and self restraint. (16) That this Conference approves and affirms the resolutions passed by the executive council of the Association of Poor Law Unions in England and Wales at their meeting in September, 1903, as follows: — (a) That boards of guardians should be grouped in suitable areas to provide labour colonies for vagrants. 53 (b) That such colonies should be established and governed by the joint committees of the boards of guardians of the unions in the said areas. (c) That habitual vagrants should be sent to such labour colonies by magistrates. (d) That the expenses of each colony should be spread over the unions in the areas served by such colonies. CHILDREN OF VAGRANTS. (17) That the powers of the poor law guardians under the Poor Law Acts of 1889 and 1899 to assume and exercise, in certain circumstances, parental rights over the children of pauper parents, should be extended so as to confer similar rights over the children of habitual vagrants. GENERALLY. (18) That, in order to give practical effect to the foregoing resolutions, this Conference is in favour of uniting with the County Councils Association, the Association of Municipal Corporations, the Association of Metropolitan Borough Councils, the Magistracy, and the Association of Poor Law Unions of England' and Wales for the following purposes, viz.:—(a) To enlist the sympathy and cooperation of members of Parliament; (b) to appoint representatives to wait on the Local Government Board; (c) to give evidence before the Inter-Departmental Committee of the Government on the Vagrancy Question; (d) to take such other measures as may be thought desirable in support of the resolutions arrived at by the Conference. That a Committee be appointed to give effect to this resolution. DISINFECTING DEPARTMENT. The following figures give the number of rooms and articles disinfected: — 54 District. Number of Rooms.

The Port Sanitary Authority was communicated with, and four corrected addresses were furnished, one person was found to be living in 57 Stepney and the remaining six were not traced in the Poplar Borough. Through the Medical Officer of the London County Council, information was received respecting a person proceeding to the Poplar Borough out of the s.s. "Claverdon" from Rio-de-Janeiro. At the address given the person was not known. PUERPERAL FEVER. Fifteen cases of puerperal fever were notified, nine Poplar, four Bromley, and two Bow. Four cases were treated in the Sick Asylum, two in the London Hospital and one at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Of the four cases treated in the Sick Asylum one case was notified as occurring in that institution, one in the Poplar Union Workhouse, and the other two were admitted from the Parish of Poplar. The two London Hospital cases were admitted from Poplar Parish, and the St. Bartholomew's case from the Parish of Bromley. Five deaths occurred from puerperal fever. Three Poplar, one Bromley and one Bow. Upon receipt of a notification of puerperal fever, the medical attendant is forthwith communicated with, requesting him to warn the attendants and midwife (if there be one), as to the dangerous infectious nature of the disease. The midwife (if there be one) and the attendants are immediately interviewed, and written to, warning them neither to attend nor go near any confinement case until some weeks have elapsed, and then only after they have had their clothes disinfected, which will be carried out by the Sanitary Authority for the district in which they reside. Should the midwife (if there be one), and the attendants reside out of the Borough, the facts are made known to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which they reside. I he Committee had brought under their notice the matter of a nurse who had been nursing a case of puerperal fever, and had 58 been advised she was not to attend another confinement for some weeks after she had ceased nursing the patient, and was thereby debarred from obtaining her livelihood. The Committee were of opinion the subject of compensating such cases as this, as well as any midwife who may be suspended by the rules of the Central Midwives' Board, made under Section 8 (3) of the Midwives Act, 1902, should be brought under the notice of the Central Midwives' Board, and legislation promoted to enable compensation to be given by the Local Supervising Authorities. The Committee recommended the Council to endorse their opinion, and communications on the subject be addressed to the Central Midwives' Board and the London County Council. SMALL-POX. Of the 42 cases of small-pox notified within the Borough, 41 patients had the disease, as one case was returned home not having the complaint. One case notified to the Borough of Stepney was removed from the Stepney Union Workhouse. (1) Park Place, female, aged 49 years. The patient had been vaccinated in infancy, two good marks; and another very small one. The case was one of discrete small pox. There was no account as to how the patient had contracted the disease, she stated she had not been out of the house since Christmas. The patient was taken ill on the 22nd January, notified on the 28th January, and removed to the Small Pox Hospital same day. The inmates of the house consisted of husband and nine children, all of whom went to the Council's shelter, Glaucus Street, were bathed and their clothes disinfected, and remained at shelter until the house throughout was disinfected, cleansed, stripped and limewhitened. The father wished to have himself and his children re-vaccinated. 59 The Medical Officer of Health of the district where two of the daughters (contacts) worked was notified. The patient was an out-worker and work was found upon the premises at the time she was removed. The work was taken to the disinfecting station, Glaucus Street, the firm notified, and also the Medical Officer of Health of the district. (2) A coloured man suffering from small-pox walked into the Poplar Hospital on the 18th February and could give no proper account of himself except his name. He stated he had been sleeping with other coloured men in a lodging-house near a church in Poplar. The ambulance nurse, before taking the patient to the South Wharf, endeavoured to find out his address by calling at several lodging-houses, but the patient was not known. As soon as the authorities at Poplar Hospital telephoned to the Public Health Department that the case had been removed, the chief disinfectoir commenced calling at the Seaman's lodginghouses and Common lodging-houses. The London County Council was communicated with so that the inspectors of the Common lodging-houses might make enquiries. The Medical Officer of the South Wharf was telephoned to and asked to put further questions to the patient (who was evidently a sailor) as to the name of his ship and where he came from. The patient did not know the name of his ship, but he stated he had come from Newport News. The Medical Officer of the Port of London was immediately telephoned to and asked to make enquiries as to all ships which had arrived from Newport News. On the 19th February, the Port of London Medical Officer telephoned that the patient, with two other coloured men and nine other men, all cattlemen, had left the s.s. "Austriana" in Victoria Docks on the 16th February, but he did not know where they had gone to. GO In the meantime, the Sanitary Inspector, Mr. Johnson, and the Chief Disinfector, were making enquiries at the Seamen's and Common lodging-houses, and Mr. Johnson found that the patient had slept at a Common lodging-house in High Street, Poplar, with the two coloured men on the nights of the 16th and 17th of February. The Inspectors of the London County Council found some of the other contacts in Common lodging-houses in Whitechapel. The two coloured men were re-vaccinated and taken to the Council's Shelter, Glaucus Street, to be bathed and their clothes disinfected. The men spent the night at the shelter. The bed and bedding from three rooms at the Common lodginghouse were removed to the disinfecting apparatus and the three rooms were disinfected and limewashed. (3) Female, aged 16 years, Suffolk Street, removed 3rd March, stated to have been vaccinated in infancy. The patient during the day was a servant in Burdett Road, and slept at night at Alton Street, but when taken ill was sent home to her parents in Suffolk Street. Patient was an "out-patient" at Poplar Hospital at the same time as the negro from the s.s. "Austriana" was waiting to be seen. All the inmates of the house, five in number, were passed through the Council's Shelter. The father and step-mother slept at the Shelter, while the room was being disinfected. (4) A medical practitioner telephoned on the 4th March, asking me to see a case which he had been called to, and which had been considered to be chicken-pox. I visited the patient, a male, aged 34 years, of Duff Street. The patient was an official at an institution in a street off the East India Dock Road, used by seamen, and registered as a Common lodging-house. 61 The patient was found to be suffering from a mild discrete form of small-pox; he had been well vaccinated in infancy, but not since. On the ICth and 18th of February the negro rerftoved from the Poplar Hospital (on the 18th February) had visited the institute. I was informed that at the institute there were other patients with spots on them, and they were considered to be suffering from chicken-pox, and in fact these cases were notified to me as suffering from chicken-pox during the afternoon. I visited the institute and examined three patients, who, in my opinion, were suffering from small-pox. (5) Female, aged 36 years, assistant in the bar of the Common lodging-house, vaccinated in infancy; confluent case of small-pox, removed on the 4th March. (6) Male, aged 20 years, porter, an exceedingly benign case of small-pox, well vaccinated in infancy; removed 4th March. (7) Male, aged 17 years, inmate of Common lodging-house, very mild benign case, well vaccinated in infancy; removed on the 4th March. (S) Male, aged 24 years, Castor Street, stated to have been vaccinated in infancy. No history as to the origin of disease. Removed 5th March. (9) Male, aged 27 years, Lower North Street, a seaman, who had been in and out of the Common lodging-house mentioned above; removed 6th March. (10) March 10th. Male, aged 59 years, moved from the London Hospital, but gave an address of a seamen's lodging house in King Street. Enquiries were made at all the Seamen's lodging and Common lodging-houses, but he was not known, and as the address given was on the borders of Stepney, the Medical Officer of Health for that Borough was communicated with. 62 At South Wharf, he could not make any definite statement, as he was too ill. (11) March 12th. Male, aged 14 years, Claude Street, unvaccinated. No information could be obtained as to the source of infection; there were five unvaccinated children in the house, and these, together with three other inmates, were taken to the Shelter, re-vaccinated, and remained there during the whole time the house was being disinfected. (12) March 18th. Female, aged 22 years, waitress in the buffet in the institute off the East India Dock Road, from which four other cases had been removed. She slept with the female patient who was removed on the 4th March, and had refused re-vaccination. (13) March 18th. Female, aged 21 years, a servant to the Superintendent of institute off the East India Dock Road, refused re-vaccination. (14) March 22nd. Female, aged 25 years, Castor Street, wife of the patient removed on the 5th March, refused re-vaccination. (15) March 22nd. Female, aged 18 months, child of above, third case in the house, unvaccinated. This case died. (16) March 22nd. Male, aged 4 years, brother of above, unvaccinated, fourth case in house. With respect of these Castor Street cases, when the first case was removed on the 5th March, I visited the house and interviewed the mother, who stated that the children had been vaccinated, but when the children were removed suffering from small-pox to the South Wharf, she said they had never been vaccinated and this was confirmed by the Medical Officer in attendance. The other inmates, who had refused re-vaccination were vaccinated when the further cases occurred. 63 (17) March 23rd. Male, aged 21 years, High Street, Poplar, vaccinated, had been daily frequenting the institute off the East India Dock Road. (18) March 24th. Female, aged 32 years, Claude Street, mother of patient removed on the 12th March, re-vaccinated after infection, modified case of small-pox. (19) MaiJch 24th. Female, aged 11 years, Claude Street, unvaccinated, but vaccinated after infection. Very modified case of small-pox, third case in house. (20) March 24th. Male, aged 9 years, Claude Street, unvaccinated, but vaccinated after infection, very modified case of small-pox, fourth case in house. (21) March 24th. Male, aged 7 years, Claude Street, unvaccinated, but vaccinated after infection, very modified case of small-pox, fifth case in house. (22) March 24th. Male, aged 5 years, Claude Street, unvaccinated, but vaccinated after infection, very modified case of small-pox, sixth case in house. (23) March 24th. Male, aged 2 years, Claude Street, unvaccinated, but vaccinated after infection, very modified case of small-pox, seventh case in house. (24) March 25th. Male, aged 21 years, Stepney Union Workhouse (notified to Stepney Borough). Patient had been visiting the institute off the East India Dock Road, whence a number of cases had been removed, caused in the first instance by a negro cattleman from the s.s. " Austriana." (25) March 27th. Male, aged 42 years, Devonshire Terrace, West Ferry Road. No history as to the origin of this disease could be obtained, but Devonshire Terrace is very near to Claude Street, from a house in which street seven cases had been removed. 64 The first case was removed on the 12th March, having been taken ill on the 6th, and the other six patients were removed on the 24th March. The patient from Devonshire Terrace died from confluent smallpox, vaccinated in infancy only. (26) March 29th. Male, aged 26 years, Claude Street, next door to the house from which the seven cases mentioned above had been removed. (27) April 3rd. Male, aged 23 years, removed from a house in Park Street. The patient is a brother to the man removed on the 5th March from Castor Street, from which house three other patients were removed on the 22nd March, making four cases in all. The patient came to see his mother at Castor Street, but finding her not there, he called at Park Street. His mother, noticing spots upon his face, communicated with the Sanitary Inspector. The patient would not, or could not, give any address at which he had been stopping the previous night; he simply stated he had been sleeping in the open air. It was known at a certain house in West Ham, relatives had been in contact with the Castor Street cases, and the Medical Officer of Health of West Ham had been communicated with. On the morning of the 5th April, two cases of small-pox were removed from this house in West Ham. (28) April 5th. Female, aged 23 years, Augusta Street, stated to be unvaccinated, sister-in-law of the patient removed from Castor Street (case 14). (29) April 6th. Male, aged 18 years, stated to be unvaccinated, brother of patient removed from Castor Street on the 5th March. Had been living in the house at West Ham (see case 27) came 65 to Augusta Street (see case 28) on the morning of the 6th April, and then walked to Council's Shelter, Yeo Street, where he knew his mother was staying pending disinfection of the house in Park Street (see case 27). He was found to be suffering from smallpox and removed. (30) April 6th. Female, aged 11 years, Eastward Street, unvaccinated. The patient is sister of the Augusta Street case (No. 28 above) and had been staying there. This made the ninth case (two outside the Borough and seven within) due to the first Castor Street case. (31) April 7th. Female, aged 29 years, High Street, Poplar, stated to have been vaccinated in infancy. Sister of patient removed with small-pox on 23rd March, whom it will be remembered contracted the disease through visiting thg institute off the East India Dock Road. (32) April 13th. Female, aged 6 years, Kerbey Street, unvaccinated. The father had attended the dispensary of the institute off the East India Dock Road on the 15th and 18th February, and 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 10th March. On 25th or 26th March, an unvaccinated child of the same family, aged 5 years, was taken ill, and seen by a doctor who stated the patient was suffering from chicken-pox. The scars and pigmentations suggested that the child had had small-pox, see case 34 below. The father and mother and the seven children were taken to the Council's Shelter. (33) April 15th. Female, aged 13 years, sister of the above, Council's Shelter, Glaucus Street. Vaccinated in infancy and after infection. An exceedingly mild and benign attack. This patient was kept under observation at the South Wharf from 15th to 18th April, and then sent to the Hospital. (34) April 15th. Male, aged 5 years, brother of above, Council's Shelter, Glaucus Street. Unvaccinated. This case is the patient referred to in number 32 above. Dr. S. Bingham, appointed by E 66 the London County Council, was called in to examine number 33 above, and he considered this case was still infectious. The patient was notified and removed. If these four cases be due to the father visiting the institute off the East India Dock Road, then 24 patients (15 inside and 9 outside the Borough) contracted the complaint from the first case removed from the institute. (35) April 17th. Female, aged 15 months, unvaccinated until after infection, Augusta Street. Daughter of patient removed from same house on 5th April. (36) April 20th. Male, aged 41 years, Upper North Street, father of patient removed on 6th April from Eastward Street (a relative of the Castor Street case). This Upper North Street patient died from confluent small-pox. Vaccinated in infancy only. (37) April 21st. Male, aged 12 years, Eastward Street, unvaccinated until after infection. Second case in house. (38) April 21st. Male, aged 2 years and 3 months, Eastward Street, unvaccinated until after infection. Third case in house. These two patients make thirteen cases (two outside the Borough and 11 within) due to the first case in Castor Street. (39) April 22nd. Female, 11 years, Tetley Street, unsuccessfully vaccinated in infancy. No history as to infection. (40) May 3rd. Male, 22 years, Tidey Street, well vaccinated in infancy and stated to have been re-vaccinated at 9 years of age. An exceedingly mild benign discrete attack. The disease was of so mild a nature it was difficult to diagnose. Together with Dr. S. Bingham, the London County Council expert, I examined the patient. The patient was a carman engaged in delivering coals and stated G7 he had made a call at a house in Limehouse where small-pox had existed. The wife of the patient was re-vaccinated and the two infants, aged 5 months, were vaccinated, and remained at the Council's Shelter until danger caused through the infection had passed. (41) June 26th. Male, aged 26 years, High Street, Bromley. Patient had visited, at Palmerston Road, Forest Gate, on the 12th June, his sister, who was suffering from small-pox. On the 14th June, the patient was notified as a contact by the Medical Officer of Health of the Walthamstow Urban District Council, his clothes were disinfected and he was advised to get himself re-vaccinated, as well as all his household. After the patient's removal, his wife and servant were re-vaccinated and his children were vaccinated. (42) May 6th. Male, aged 19 years, Tetley Street, second case in house, brother of patient removed on the 22nd April. Vaccinated in infancey. Mild discrete attack. Refused re-vaccination at the time his six brothers and sisters and uncle were vaccinated or re-vaccinated. The usual precautions were taken in all the above cases. The contacts were notified by telephone and afterwards by letter to the Medical Officers of the districts in which they lived or gained their livelihood, and if contacts worked in the Poplar district, the firms for whom they were engaged were notified, and requested not to allow them to remain at work until they had had a bath and their clothes disinfected. The rooms from which the patients were removed were disinfected with formalin, stripped of their paper (if any) and then either washed down or limewhitened. Enquiries were made in all instances as to who executed the laundry work. E 2 68 The Public Vaccinator and the Vaccination Officer were also notified, and in many instances re-vaccination was carried out. In the case at the Common lodging-house, the Medical Officer of the London County Council was immediately notified of the fact. As far as possible contacts were kept under observation. With such precautions and active steps there is no doubt the repetition of the out-break of the disease such as there was in the years 1901 and 1902 was prevented. It will be seen that three of the above cases died, Nos. 15, 25, and 36. The Committee considered a reference from the Council on the subject of the maintenance in their own homes of small pox contacts. It was pointed out to the Council that the Local Government Board would be prepared to sanction maintenance of contacts in their own homes only in cases in which the Medical Officer advised that it was essential. The Committee were of opinion the matter should be left to the discretion of the Medical Officer of Health in each case, and recommended the Council: "That the maintenance of small-pox contacts in their own homes be left to the absolute discretion of the Medical Officer of Health." A man, aged 40 years, of Teviot Street, was notified as suffering from small-pox. He was removed to the South Wharf on the 24th March, and detained there under observation until the 31st March, when he was returned home as not suffering from that complaint, or any other notifiable disease. NOTIFICATION OF CHICKEN POX AND DIAGNOSIS OF DOUBTFUL CASES OF SMALL POX. The London County Council resolved and ordered that section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to the notification of infectious diseases should apply in the 69 tive County of London, for a period of four calendar months from the 8th April, to the disease known as chicken-pox. The Local Government Board approved the resolution of the London County Council as a case of emergency. The Local Government Board also approved the resolution of the London County Council extending the period for notification of chicken-pox for a further period of three months expiring on 7th November. With a view to facilitating the diagnosis of doubtful cases of small-pox occurring in the Administrative County of London, the Council made an arrangement under which, without fee, the services could be obtained of Dr. S. Bingham, formerly Medical Superintendent of one of the small-pox hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, or Dr. W. MacWanklyn, late small-pox referee to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, and Medical Superintendent of the River Ambulance Service. This arrangement continued in force until 7th August, 1904, but the sen-ices of Dr. MacWanklyn were retained until the 7th November. SHELTER. During the year 159 persons passed through the Council's Shelter in Yeo Street. The attention of the Public Health Committee was called to the Lower Shelter, which was not at all suitable or adequate to meet with the pressure of work. The Lower Shelter was the house of the Caretaker of the Glaucus Street Depot, and consists of two bedrooms, a caretaker's living-room and bedroom (one room), and a waiting-room, which was used for the contacts to have their meals in, a scullery and a bath-room. The great objection to the Lower Shelter, was, that those persons who had had their bath, and their clothes disinfected, came in 70 contact with those persons who were waiting for a bath and had not had their clothes disinfected, hence, there might have been re-infection. It was reported to the Committee that when the Upper Shelter, which consists of workshops, was given over by the Works Department, it was so arranged that the infected and disinfected contacts did not meet one another. Certain portions of what was used as the Upper Shelter had again been taken over by the Works Department, and, although these workshops might again be given up to the Public Health Department, it was pointed out to the Public Health Committee that to rely upon such an arrangement is not at all a proper state of affairs. At the time of the report there were two rooms in what was the Upper Shelter, divided by a workshop, a store room in which the Public Health Department keeps the necessary articles for stripping and cleansing rooms, and a bath room. The Committee referred the question of provision of adequate shelter accommodation at the Depot to the Borough Surveyor and myself for report. The Surveyor stated that the Upper Shelter, which was given over at one time by the Works Department to the Public Health Department, and was being used at the time of the outbreak as a workshop was still required by the Works Department, so that it appeared that if the house which was being used, and was once the Caretaker's house, was still to be used as a Shelter, structural alterations must have been carried out, and more room afforded; provision would also have to be made for the infected and disinfected contacts not to meet one another. It is also essential in a shelter that at least two waiting rooms should be provided, to prevent infected contacts of small-pox cases mixing up with contacts of other diseases. Another bath would have to be fitted up. 71 The Surveyor stated the present structure would not allow of extensive alterations, but as it was absolutely necessary, for the well-being of the community at large, the Borough should have a proper shelter, the Committee directed the Works Committee be asked to place the workshops at their disposal during the outbreak. The Works Committee agreed to the necessary temporary accommodation being afforded at Bromley Depot to meet the necessities of the outbreak. In the near future a permanent new shelter with disinfecting station will be erected on the land acquired by the Council in Glaucus Street. See "Mortuaries" page 91. VACCINATION.

The Committee recommended the Council to endorse their opinion, and the Metropolitan Asylums Board be requested to take such steps as may be necessary to prevent in future the discharge of patients while in a condition liable to convey infection. In accordance with the directions of the Council, the Town Clerk addressed a letter to other Metropolitan Borough Councils giving the facts of the above cases, and stating the reply of the Metropolitan Asylums Board: "That they are unable to obtain any definite evidence clearly associating the admission of the other members of the family with his discharge from Brook Hospital." The Town Clerk, in his circular letter to the Metropolitan Boroughs, inquired "whether any cases of infection, or suspected infection, from the premature discharge of patients from hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Boards have occurred in your Borough, and to ask you to be good enough to bring the matter to the notice of your Council, with a view to pressure being brought to bear upon the Metropolitan Asylums Board to secure the adoption of more adequate precautions against premature discharges and consequent spread of infection." Various replies were received, some Boroughs had had similar experience to the Poplar Borough, and some had not. The Committee recommended the Council: "That the attention of the Local Government Board be directed to the matter, and they be urged to take the necessary steps to enforce adequate precautions being in future taken to prevent the discharge of patients from Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals while in a condition likely to convey infection to other persons." The following circular letter was; received from the Metropolitan Asylums Board: — 75 "Metropolitan Asylums Board, Embankment, E.C., 17th June, 190Jf. Sir, RETURN CASES OF SCARLET FEVER. The attention of the Managers has been called to the fact that a circular letter has been issued by the Poplar Borough Council with reference to an alleged premature discharge of a patient from one of the Board's Hospitals. Without entering upon the merits of the particular case referred to, I have been requested to bring the following facts under the notice of your Council. At the present time there is an entire want of precise knowledge both as to the causation of scarlet fever and also as to the period of infectivity of patients suffering from the disease, and in the absence of definite scientific knowledge it is impossible for anyone to assert positively that infection has or has not ceased in any given case. Until recently there was a consensus of opinion that the desquamation which occurs in such cases was coincident with the infectivity of the patient, and that the cessation of desquamation could, therefore, be taken as an indication to determine this latter point; but the Board understands that this opinion has undergone considerable modification during recent years, it being held by many of the more prominent physicians, medical officers of health, superintendents of fever hospitals, and other medical authorities that desquamation, especially that in the latter stages, cannot be taken as evidence of infectivity. The Board have long been aware that so-called return cases have from time to time occurred, and with the object of obtaining the fullest information as to their cause, and with the view of adopting (if practicable) further precautions, they three years since appointed a medical officer to conduct investigations into the circumstances of all such alleged cases, and the report of this officer will shortly be in print. As the result of this and other steps which the Board are taking they trust that they may be enabled to throw much light upon this at present obscure subject. 76 Notwithstanding this absence of scientific knowledge, the Board are confident that the most careful judgment is exercised in every case by the medical officers whom they have placed in charge of their hospitals. The Board are of course alive to the responsible duties which rest upon them, and they can assure the Council that they are taking every means rightly to discharge these, both as regards the patients and the public.

An "Order" was made by the London County Council applying to Measles in the Administrative County of London, the provisions 85 of sections 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72; 73 and 74; of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with respect to dangerous infectious diseases. The "Order" was duly approved by the Local Government Board, and came into force from and including 1st April, 1903. Practically the Infectious Diseases Prevention Sections, and not the Notification Sections, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, apply to Measles; or in other words, the effect of the "Order" is that the precautions taken in the case of notifiable diseases with regard to disinfection and the exposure of infected persons are now applied to Measles, but the provisions of the Act with regard to notification and removal do not apply. Arrangements are made upon the receipt of a notice from the Head Teachers of a School, or any other person, of the existence of Measles in a house, for the Sanitary Inspector to call, and leave the same papers as would be left when a notification is received at the Public Health Offices. Upon the Measles Order coming into force on the 1st April, 1903, a Measles Register was instituted, in which entries are made of premises where cases are stated to exist. The bulk of the cases thus dealt with has been upon information received at the hands of School Teachers; by notification, as provided for, by the School Management Code of the London County Council, and the remainder from various sources, i.e., through medical practitioners, parents, landlords, lodgers, neighbours, police, and in fatal cases by the Registrar's Returns, these latter in some instances being the first intimation received of the existence of the disease upon the premises. The details in the Register cover a variety of information, viz., date, name, address, source of notification, number of rooms disinfected, details as to articles disinfected, etc., and remarks. 86 At the end of the year there were 868 entries in the Register, representing the number of premises where Measles had been stated to have occurred. Upon enquiry 10 cases were stated to have recovered, 158 were found not to be cases, but 54 of these cases were stated to be suffering from a different disease other than the one notified, 43 wrong addresses and unknown were given, 3 belonged to other Boroughs, and 33 moved away before enquiries could be made. So that practically as far as is known, 627 cases of Measles occurred in the Borough. Eight cases of Measles occurred in connection with milk shops. Three hundred rooms were disinfected by the Public Health Department, and the remainder were disinfected by the tenants, medical practitioners giving certificates that disinfection had been satisfactorily carried out. Respecting the articles disinfected by the Council, see page 54. Owing to the prevalence of Measles in the Infants' Department of the Fairfield Road Board School, the Medical Officer of the School Board advised the closure of Class-room B. for a period of two weeks. The class-room was disinfected by the Public Health Department. The Head Teacher of the Infants' Department, Cubitt Town Board School, wrote on the 9th March that "In accordance with a telegram received from the Clerk of the London School Board this afternoon, I have closed the baby-room till after Easter. A serious outbreak of measles has occurred in the baby-class this week." The Babies' Room was closed for a period of three weeks from the 9th March, and was disinfected by the Public Health Department. Owing to the prevalence of Measles in the Infants' Department of the Oban Street School, the School Medical Officer of the 87 London County Council advised the closure of Class-room A for a period of three weeks from the 25th April. The Medical Officer of the Educational Department of the London County Council was communicated with on 17th May, respecting the prevalence of measles at the Woolmore Street School, but it was not considered closure of the school would be effective as the "second crop" had gone. Owing to the prevalence of Measles in the Infants' Department of the Tidey Street School, certain class-rooms were closed from the 17th May until after the Whitsuntide holidays, and disinfection of the class and cloak-rooms was carried out by the Public Health Department. Owing to the prevalence of Measles in the Infants' Department of the Tidey Street School, a letter was received on the 3rd November from the Medical Officer (Education) London County Council, stating he had advised the closure of Class-room B. until the 14th November. MEASLES.—HOMEWORK: (See page 38). On the 6th of May I reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee: — With respect to section 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, "prohibition of homework in places where there is an infectious disease," this section does not apply in the case of measles, for by sub-section 5 of section 110 the Infectious Diseases to which this section applies are the Infectious Diseases required to be notified under the law for the time being in force in relation to the notification of Infectious Diseases, and the Infectious Diseases in London are expressed in sub-section 8, Section 55, of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. 110 (5). The infectious diseases to which this section applies are the infectious diseases required to be notified under the law 88 for the time being in force in relation to the notification of infectious diseases, and the work to which this section applies is the making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing and repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto and such other classes of work as may be specified by special order of the Secretary of State. Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Infectious Diseases.— Prevention. 58. The following provisions of this Act relating to dangerous infectious diseases shall apply to the infectious diseases specifically mentioned in, the foregoing enactment of this Act relating to the notification of infectious disease, and all or any of such provisions may be applied by order to any other infectious disease in the same manner as that enactment may be applied to such disease, subject to the same power of revoking and varying the order, and every such infectious disease is in this Act referred to as a dangerous infectious disease. The sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which are made to apply to Measles under section 58 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by the order of the London County Council, approved by the Local Government Board are 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72, 73, 74, so that clothing can be made in a house where Measles exists, and can only be dealt with under section 68 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. It would appear that sub-section 5, sec. 110, of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1901, requires amending by inserting after the words " for the time being in force in relation to the notification of infectious diseases," the following words: "and any other diseases included under section 58 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, by an order of the London County Council or Sanitary Authority, approved by the Local Government. Board." It was suggested to the Committee that the attention of the Home Office, the Local Government Board and the London County Council be called to this section. 89 The Committee were of opinion section 110 (5) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, should be amended, so that home work on wearing apparel may be prohibited where measles or other infectious disease, to which any of the infectious diseases clauses of the Public Health (London) Act have been applied by order of the London County Council, exists in the same manner as in the case of the infectious diseases specified in section 55 (8) of the Public Health (London) Act. The Committee recommended the Council "That the Council concur in this opinion, and the representations on the subject be made to the Home Secretary, the President of the Local Government Board and the London County Council." DIARRHŒA.* Deaths from Diarrhoea, for the past twelve years were as follows: — Borough of Poplar. London. Poplar Bromley.

Four mortuaries are possessed by the Council: — Bickmore Street, Poplar Originally provided by the Overseers of the respective parishes for the reception of bodies cast ashore or found in the streets. St. Leonards Road, Bromley Bow Church, Bow Wellington Road Originally provided by the Poplar District Board for the reception of bodies of persons who died from infectious diseases. Pending the provision of a proper mortuary, that at Bickmore Street has been used as a mortuary and post-mortem room under the Public Health (London) Act. The Council is required by the Public Health (London) Act 1891, to provide a mortuary and may make bye-laws with respect to the management and charges for the use of same. If required by the London County Council separate accommodation for the reception of dead bodies, during the time required to make postmortem examinations ordered by the Coroner, shall be provided. 92 The London County Council is required to provide proper accommodation for the holding of inquests, and may by agreement with the Borough Council provide in connection with a mortuary a building for post-mortem examinations provided by that authority, on terms to be agreed upon. The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council 'to acquire the land in Glaucus Street adjoining the stone yard for the erection of a shelter and disinfecting station as well as a coroner's court and mortuary. The Council adopted the recommendation of the Committee. Later on, the Public Control Committee of the London County Council agreed to recommend the Council to approve the provision by the Poplar Borough Council of a Coroner's Court in connection with mortuary, etc., proposed to be erected in Glaucus Street.

No over-crowding was discovered. "Respecting the canal boat 'Kennet,' No. 324, on the 4th of May, I endorsed notice served on the owner by the inspector at Berkhampstead, requiring certain works to be done to the cabins in a given time. The work had been duly executed at time of my inspection, and the notice was returned to Berkhampstead. "No cases of infectious diseases were found to be existing. One 'master's' wife died of pneumonia during the year, and the boat was dealt with in the district of registration." †Mr. Langley's 39 inspections of non-registered boats included two visits to one boat. ‡Mr. Miners' 55 inspections of non-registered boats included two visits to each of four boats. 96 **Mr. Field reported: — No contraventions were discovered with the exception of the undermentioned boats: " Bride." "Cabin very damp and dirty, paintwork of interior of cabin very dirty, and portion of liniing roughly boarded and not painted, cabin top leaky through seams, decking and deck planks rotten, combing at junction with cabin very rotten, all woodwork saturated with moisture, no glass in skylight (which was boarded up). Name of boat on after combing, but registered number and place of registration on forward combing, so that the boat would appear to be an ordinary unregistered barge. Whole of hull appeared much worn and dilapidated and in a rotten condition. "At the Thames Police Court, on April 25th, owner was fined 5s. and 2s. costs for improper marking, and 20s. with 23s. costs for damp, dirty, and rotten state of the canal boat, that is to say, not keeping boat in a habitable condition." " Northampton." "After cabin occupied by man, wife and grandchild. Fore cabin occupied by extra hand, and used for storage of com for the towing horse. Cabin badly ventilated and defective stove allowing smoke to leak into cabin. "Letter sent to owner and registration authority at Birmingham." " Hart." "After cabin occupied by man, wife and sister of wife said to be 13 years of age. "Letter sent to owner and registration authority at Uxbridge." 97 workshops, workplaces, laundries and outworkers. As to the number and description of workshops on the registers see Tables A and B, pages 98 and 99. There are two registers of workshops kept, one for females, and the other for males. A register of bakehouses is also kept The registered workshops were inspected two or three times in the year, some every month. The number of premises notified within the district as used by outworkers in 651, but this number varies with each six monthly return, see Table D, pages 101, 102 and 103. The places where the outworkers are employed were inspected all of them twice during the year, some more frequently. See Miss Tattersall's report, pages 226 and 227, and the Sanitary Inspector's reports, pages 173, 174, 180, 192, 197, 203, 205, 217 and 222. For outworkers connected with infectious cases, see page 38. The special form submitted by the Secretary of State for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health {see page 101) in preparing the report on factories and workshops in pursuance of section 132 of the Factory and Workshop Act 1901, did not come to hand until the end of the year, and as far as possible, from the records, journals, registers and index files kept, the return has been prepared. In order that the form may be filled in without any difficulty from year to year, the Sanitary Inspectors hare been urgently requested to give full and complete descriptions of the premises visited when any work is carried on, and to classify such premises in their note books before handing them to the clerks for the particulars to be entered in the Journals, registers and index files.* It can be easily understood that the classification of premises where work is executed will vary from time to time, according to the pressure of work or the nature of the work carried oil—outworkers premises may become domestic workshops, and also workshops, and even factories; workshops may become factories; and workplaces may become workshops or factories, between the visits of the Sanitary Inspectors. Whilst this report is in course of preparation, many workshops and workplaces not hitherto registered are being added to the respective registers and will consequently appear in the Annual Report for 1905.

Butter.—"Containing excess of water to the extent of 0.4 per cent." Vendor cautioned. Mustard.—"Adulterated with 5 per cent. of wheat flour." Vendor cautioned. Butter.—"Adulterated with foreign fat to the extent of 78.0 per cent." This sample was sent to the Analyst as Is. salt, and returned as a sample of margarine. The question of legal proceedings was submitted to Mr. Young, the Solicitor acting for the Council, as the sample had been served in a plain wrapper, but enclosed in a paper bag marked "margarine." The sample had been taken from a parcel marked "margarine." The whole question was, whether the wrapper was properly marked. Mr. Young advised no proceedings. Butter.—"Adulterated with foreign fat to the extent of 75.7 per cent." This refers to the sample (Marked‡) for which legal proceedings were taken on the 21st July. See page 111. 113 Butter.—Adulterated with foreign fat to the extent of 64.7 per cent." This refers to the sample for which legal proceedings were taken 26th September*. See page 111. Milk.—"Deficient in solids, not fat, to the extent of 3 per cent." Vendor cautioned. Butter.—"Adulterated with foreign fat to the extent of 74.8 per cent." This sample was taken on demand by the Inspector. The question for legal proceedings was whether the package was properly marked. The Committee directed a letter of caution be sent to the vendor. In the case of the prosecution of the vendor of the sample of milk (see legal proceedings**, page 110) deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 15 per cent, and 5 per cent. respectively, notice was received on behalf of the vendor of intention to rely on the warranty given by the farmer supplying the milk. The contract containing the warranty in question was dated September, 1903, and it appeared from cases already decided, a specific warranty with each delivery is not necessary to afford protection against conviction of the vendor, and no proceedings could have been taken against the farmer, as such proceedings must have been taken within six months of the datei of the warranty, so that under these circumstances further action was abandoned. In any case it is almost impossible to obtain convictions where warranties are set up in defence, since no proof can be given that the milk is not sold in the same state as received by tha vendor, and the persons giving the warranty would affirmi they had reason to believe the milk supplied was in accordance with the. warranty given. The attention of the Committee was called to similar cases which had occurred in other London Boroughs, and to the immunity from conviction under the sale of Food and Drugs Acts, which is being increasingly secured by vendors and dealers, by means of such warranties. H 114 The Paddington Borough Council and the Woolwich Borough Council appealed to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture to promote legislation in the matter, the Woolwich Council suggesting the repeal of the Warranty Sections of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, leaving the person selling the adulterated article to his common law remedy against the person from whom he purchased for damages for breach of warranty. The Public Health and Housing Committee were of opinion legislation on the matter is urgently required, and that so long as vendors are enabled to rely upon a warranty as a defence against charges of adulteration, the conviction of offenders will become increasingly difficult to obtain. The Committee recommended to the Council that the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture be urged to promote legislation for the repeal of the clauses of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts enabling warranties to be set up in defence in cases of prosecution of vendors of adulterated articles; or for an amendment of the law so as to require the retail dealer relying upon a warranty to bring before the Court for conviction in his stead the person giving the warranty. The Camberwell Borough Council addressed a communication to the Local Government Board requesting them to take such steps as may be necessary in order that a limit may be fixed to the amount of boracic acid which may be mixed with food. At present there is no standard with regard to the amount of preservative which should be allowed. The Committee recommended the Council to support the application of the Camberwell Borough Council to the Local Government Board. A letter was received from the Board of Agriculture forwarding the following extract from the report of one of their Inspectors on the subject of the number of samples taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, in the Borough, for analysis, and requesting the observations of the Council thereon:— 115 [Extract.] Date, 3rd February, 1904. Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1S99. Local Authority, POPLAR. 1900. 1901. 1902. 1903. Exmd. Adult. Exmd. Adult. Exmd. Adult. Exmd. Adult. Total 342 26 362 33 369 57 373 31 Milk 122 13 106 12 151 34 140 Butter 50 8 83 9 86 14 109 The above statement shows the total number of samples and the number of milk and butter samples taken in the Borough of Poplar in each year since 1900. Having regard to the large number of articles liable to adulteration, or which are likely to be sold under a false description, the Board of Agriculture considered the number of samples hitherto taken could scarcely be regarded as sufficient to test adequately the food supply of the district. The letter stated: Many local Authorities consider it necessary to take annually a number which will give a proportion of at least 3 per 1,000 of the population, while the Local Authorities of some of the Metropolitan Boroughs cause a much larger number than this to be taken. For instance, during the year 1902, 1,250 samples were taken in the City of London (population 26,923); 1,802 in Westminster (population 117,178); 1,935 in Southwark (population 206,180); 402 in Holborn (population 59,405); and 759 in Bermondsey (population 130,760); and the general tendency is in the direction of a still further increase. The communication drew the attention of the Poplar Borough Council to the obligations imposed upon them by sub-section 1 h 2 116 of Section 3 of the Act of 1899, and the responsibilities vested in the Central Authority by sub-section 2 of the same section; and the Board of Agriculture asked the Poplar Borough Council to consider whether it would not be desirable to give directions for a larger number of samples per annum to be taken for analysis. The Sections of the Act referred to above are as follows:— 3.—(1.) It shall be the duty of every local authority entrusted with the execution of the laws relating to the sale of food and drugs to appoint a public analyst, and put in force from time to time, as occasion may arise, the powers with which they are invested, so as to provide proper securities for the sale of food and drugs in a pure and genuine condition, and in particular to direct their officers to take samples for analysis. (2.) If the Local Government Board or Board of Agriculture, after communication with a Local Authority, are of opinion that the Local Authority have failed to execute or enforce any of the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts in relation to any article of food, and that their failure affects the general interest of the consumer or the general interests of agriculture in the United Kingdom, as the case may be, the Board concerned may, by order, empower an officer of the Board to execute and enforce those provisions or to procure the execution and enforcement thereof in relation to any article of food mentioned in the order. Sub-section 3 provides that the expenses incurred under any order made under sub-section 2 shall be paid by the local authority. The Board of Agriculture considered that at least three samples per annum should be taken per 1,000 of the population. The present number in Poplar is 2.2 per 1,000, which, with the exception of St. Pancras (2.1) is the lowest in London, the average —exclusive of the City—being 3.7. At the present time the Council is in communication with the Local Government Board respecting the work of analysing samples under the Food and Drugs and Margarine Acts. 117 unsound food and examination of food stuffs at wharves, etc. The attention of the Public Health and Housing Committee was called to the "Sanitary Record" of the 27th October, in which the following article appeared:— "Unsound Meat. "We understand that the meat trades are seeking an amendment of the law, to shift from the owner or trader the onus of proving that meat seized as being unsound was not. intended for human food, and to place the burden of proof that it was so intended upon the Local Authorities or prosecuting Inspector. We have not learned what steps have been taken v/ith this object, but we have no hesitation in saying that it would be a most unwise and retrograde change in the law. It would be detrimental to the public health and public policy, and we cannot believe that there is any probability of its being accepted by Parliament. The Corporation of Glasgow are moving in the matter, with the intention of opposing the suggested amendment of the law." It was reported to the Committee that in the case, which was decided at the Thames Police Court on the 28th of October, Langley v. Carle, when the defendant was fined £10 10s. ard £5 5s. costs, Mr. Dickinson, the magistrate, stated, when innict ing the penalty, he hoped that this case would be a lesson ta the trade to examine meat, either upon purchase at the market or immediately upon it being delivered at the premises of a butcher, as it was easy enough for a butcher to state, as in the case before him when an article had been seized, thatf he (thel butcher) would have found the article to be bad when he was about to use it. The offence in the case of Langley v. Carle was aggravated by the fact that the heart and liver which were attached to the diseased lungs had been cut off for sale, and the lungs hung up in the sausage and faggot factory, and not put on one side. The lungs in question belonged to a pig, and were no doubt tuberculous and one of the recommendations of the Royal Commission on 118 Tuberculosis was that when any part of a pig is tuberculous the whole carcase should be destroyed. At present the law stands as follows: Public Health (London) Act, 1891. SECTION 47. (1) the proof that the same was not exposed or deposited for any such purpose or was not intended for the food of man, resting with the person charged; (3) Where it is shown that any article liable to be seized under this section, and found in the possession of any person was purchased by him from another person for the food of man, and when so purchased was in such a condition as 10 be liable to be seized and condemned under this section, the person who so sold the same shall be liable to the fine and imprisonment above mentioned, unless he proves that at the time he sold the said article he did not know, and had no reason to believe, that it was in such condition. (8) Where a person has in his possession any article which is unsound op unwholesome or unfit for the food of man, he may, by written notice to the sanitary authority, specifying such article, and containing a sufficient identification of it, request its removal, and the sanitary authority shall cause it to be removed as if it were trade refuse. This last subjection clearly shows that; a butcher should examine all his meat immediately upon arrival at his premises, and put on one side any which is diseased or unsound, or unwholesome, or unfit for the food of man, and should not run the risk of an officer of a sanitary authority doing it for him, and further, taking such steps as the law empowers the officer to do. It was suggested to the Committee that they recommend the Council to ask the London County Council to oppose any such alteration in the law as the question is one which affects the whole of London, and in fact, the country generally. It was also suggested that the attention of the Borough's Members of Parliament might also be called to the matter. 119 The Committee directed that the Medical Officer's report on the subject of unsound food be sent to the London County Council and to the local Members of Parliament. With respect to the examination of food stuffs see Sanitary Inspectors reports, pages 173, 181, 192, 197, 203, 218 and 223. Also, with respect to the examination of food stuffs at wharves, see Inspector's reports, pages 203, 218 and 223. The Committee considered reports showing that an increasing quantity of fish purchased by small dealers at Billingsgate is found an hour or two afterwards to be in a condition unfit for food, and is brought to the Council's Inspectors to be condemned. The Committee were of opinion more supervision is needed at Billingsgate to prevent decomposing fish being sent out of the market for human consumption, and directed that communications on the subject be addressed to the Markets Committee of the City Corporation and to the Fishmongers' Company. See Mr. Field's report, page 182. clean milk. A report was received from the Medical Officer of Health for Islington on "Clean Milk," and a copy of a letter referring to the report, which was sent to the London County Council by the Borough of Islington, in which communication it is stated: "It is understood that the London County Council propose to apply to Parliament for powers enabling them as the authority dealing with the County of London to secure at their own expense analyses of samples of milk arriving at metropolitan railway stations for distribution in the county, the letter suggests that the London County Council should at the same time obtain powers to prevent the introduction into the Metropolis of milk containing sediment of a dirty character, such as that referred to in the report. The Borough of Islington is communicating with the Local Government Board with a view to the better enforcement outside London of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, and of the regulations made thereunder, but the Islington Borough Council are of opinion 120 that the London County Council might with advantage apply to Parliament for such additional powers as will enable them to inspect dairies, cowsheds and cattle from which milk is supplied to the County of London, or as an alternative for powers to prevent the introduction of milk from such districts as do not enforce the aforesaid Order and regulations. I reported to the Committee the case would be met if the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order and the regulations made thereunder be enforced strictly by local authorities outside the Metropolis, and instead of it being optional for local authorities to make regulations, as per article 13 of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, it should be compulsory, and the Local Government Board and the various County Councils should see that the regulations are enforced. Article 13 mentioned above is as follows:— A Local Authority MAY from time to time make Regulations for the following purposes, or any of them: (a) For the inspection of cattle in dairies. (b) for prescribing and regulating the lighting, ventilation, cleansing, drainage and water supply of dairies and cowsheds in the occupation of persons following the trade of cowkeepers or dairymen. (c) For securing the cleanliness of milk-stores, milk-shops and of milk-vessels used for containing milk for sale by such persons. (d) For prescribing precautions to be taken by purveyors of milk and persons selling milk by retail against infection or contamination. In a circular letter of the Local Government Board to Councils of Boroughs and Urban Districts, dated 11th March, 1889, it is stated:— "If the Council have not already made regulations under the Order of 1885, the Board think that they should do so, and 121 that any such regulations would, with advantage, be based on the Model Clause. If the Council have already made regulations under the Order, the Model Clauses may be usefully considered in connection with any fresh regulations or amendment of the existing code which the Council may propose to make." The Public Health and Housing Committee considered the proposal of the Islington Borough Couilci! that the London County Council should be urged to obtain powers to inspect dairies, cowsheds and cattle outside London and from which London is supplied with milk, with a view to ensuring the cleanliness of such milk. The Committee also considered my report, and concurred in the opinion such powers are inadvisable, but that the making of bye-laws under the Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1885, should be made/ compulsory, instead of being optional as at present, and that the several Authorities should be required to enforce regulations made under that Order. The Committee recommended the Council to endorse such opinion, and the Local Government Board, the London County Council and the Islington Borough Council be so informed. bread acts. 3 George IV., Cap. CVI., 6 and 7, Will. 4, C. 37. The following letter was received from the London County Council onl the subject of the law relating to the sale of bread:— "LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL. " County hall, Spring Gardens, S.W. 10th February, 1904. ''Sir " A Committee of the Council has under consideration the question of the desirableness of the Council seeking fresh legislation for the better protection of the public than is afforded under the existing law as regards the sale of bread; and it has been suggested 122 that the best course to be adopted would be to endeavour to obtain the repeal of the Act of 3 George IV., Chapter cvi., so far as its operation in the Administrative County of London is concerned, and to get re-enacted in modern language such of the provisions of that Act as are still valuable in present circumstances; and also to obtain additional provisions to afford the desired increase of protection to the public. "I am to state that the Committee will be glad if the Metropolitan Borough Council will be good enough to assist in the matter by stating whether, in its opinion, any of the provisions in the above-mentioned Act are of value in connection with the prevention of adulteration, etc., and should, therefore, be re-enacted, or whether in view of the powers bestowed by the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875, the provisions of the former Act as regards adulteration have become obsolete and might, with advantage, be repealed. "I am, Sir, ''Your obedient Servant, "G. L. GOMME, "Clerk of the Council. "The Town Clerk, " Metropolitan Borough of Poplar." I reported on the matter as follows: — Bread is made and sold in the City of London and Liberties thereof and within 10 miles of the Royal Exchange under the Act of 3 Geo. IV., Chap. CVI., which was passed on 22nd July, 1822, and outside the 10 mile radius under the Bread Act of 6 and 7 Will. 4, c. 37, which was passed on the 28th July, 1836. The statutes are almost identical. If the Bread Act of Geo. IV. be repealed and the adulteration sections re-enacted, the Medical Officer would suggest that the adulteration provisions of the Act should be enforced by the Sanitary Authority. The adulteration sections of the Geo. IV. Act 123 being sections II., X., XI., XII., and XIII., and the penalty provisions which follow should be re-enacted in modern language. A section should be inserted to the effect that meal or flour of wheat, barley, rye, oats, buck-wheat, Indian corn, peas, beans, rice or potatoes Should be separately stored in properly marked sacks or bins. The properly appointed officers of the local authority should have the right to enter any premises and without purchasing take any samples of dough or bread, or samples of meal or flour of any grain from any sacks or bins and submit the same to the public analyst, and if found to be adulterated, proceedings should be taken. The taking of samples in this manner, without purchasing, would not be a new procedure, as Inspectors have power, for the purposes of analysis, to take without purchasing samples purporting to be butter and cheese. Butter, under section 10, Margarine Act, 1887, 50 and 51 Vict., c. 29, and cheese under Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 62 and 63 Vict., c. 51, section 5. The baker should be protected by warranty in a like manner as the vendor is protected under the Food and Drugs, and Margarine Acts, and then sections X., XI., XII., of Act 3 Geo. IV., CVI., would if re-enacted be well met. The warranty would also apply to section XII., so as to protect those persons who sell, but do not make bread. So far as section XII. is also concerned, which enacts that bread made of mixed meal or flour is to be marked with a large Roman M, it would be better that when bread is made wholly or partially of the meal or flour of any other sort of corn or grain than wheat, or of the meal or flour of any peas or beans, to have all such bread marked or stamped with the name of its component parts, so as to be intelligible to the public who do not know what a large Roman M means. Potatoes should be added to this section, as these ingredients are included in 6, 7, Will. 4, c. 37, sec. 10, which is similar to 3 124 Geo. IV., chap. CVI., sec. 12, but there is a proviso in section 10 of the Bread Act of Will. IV. which can be added, and is as follows:—"Provided always, that nothing in this Act contained shall extend or be construed to extend to require any bread made of the meal or flour of wheat only, and in the making of which potato yeast shall be used, to be marked as hereinbefore mentioned." The powers of entry should be on the same lines as those proposed in the Bill of the London County Council (General Powers), clause 27:—"The sanitary authority of any sanitary district, or any officer or person duly authorised by them in that behalf, shall have the right to enter at all reasonable times any house, building or premises in that district for the purpose of examining whether there is any contravention of this part of this Act or of any Byelaw made thereunder, or for the purpose of carrying into execution this part of this Act or any Bye-law made thereunder." The Public Health and Housing Committee examined the Bread Act of 1822 and considered the report thereon, and recommended the Council that the suggestions be approved and submitted to the London County Council. SALE OF HORSE FLESH, ETC., REGULATION ACT, 1889, 52 & 53 VICT CH. II. A report was presented to the Committee respecting the necessity for an alteration in the law relating to the sale of horse flesh. Among other matters it was pointed out to the Committee that if horse flesh specially prepared be passed through a mincing machine and mixed with fat, flesh and spice, it cannot be distinguished from that of ox, nor can the nature of the flesh, in which under normal circumstances the products of disease would be readily detected, be always distinguished even by the expert. By section 6 of the 1889 Act, a penalty of a fine only can be inflicted, the maximum being twenty pounds. 125 The report suggested the law should be so altered that a term of imprisonment (six months with or without hard labour) or a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, may be imposed at the discretion of the magistrate. The fine or imprisonment should be applicable in respect of each separate portion of horse flesh as it is in the case of every article of unsound food under section 47 (2) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The other alterations which suggested themselves were, that every knacker and every wholesale dealer in horse flesh shall be registered by the Local Authority, and shall keep a register showing the quantity and destination of each consignment sent out from his premises, and this register shall be open to the inspection of any duly appointed officer of the Local Authority, and no meat shall be sent out from any horse slaughterers unless thoroughly cooked through, and all parcels sent out shall be labelled with the words " horse flesh." The Public Health and Housing Committee recommended the Council to address communications to the President of the Local Government Board, and the London County Council urging legislation on the subject. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. In July I represented as "Unhealthy Areas," to the London County Council under part 1 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, two areas South of the Bow Road known as (1) "Brewery Yard Area" comprising 21 dwelling-houses,—as rated. (2) " Gandy Court Area," comprising 14 dwelling-houses. The London County Coulncil decided not to entertain my representations. Summonses were applied for at the Thames Police Court in respect of Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 13 and 14, Brewery Yard, Bow, under Section 8 (1) of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1903. Under this section the summonses were taken out without notices 126 being served, as it was considered the premises were in such a state that the occupation thereof should be immediately discontinued. It was also very questionable whether the premises were reasonably capable of being made fit for human habitation. The summonses were heard on the 16th December, but on account of the conflicting evidence by the defendant's architect and builder on the one hand, and the Medical Officer of Health on the other, the Magistrate adjourned his decision until the 30th December, in order that he might inspect the houses. The Magistrate had been asked to view both by the defendant's solicitor and myself. The Magistrate (Mr. Dickinson) in giving his decision, said: " Their state is disgraceful, and quite unfit for human habitation." Closing orders were made, and 25s. costs allowed in each case. Allowance was asked for the tenants on account of expenses in removing. The Magistrate authorised 10s. to be paid to each tenant of Nos. 4, 5, 6 and 13, and 15s. to the tenant of No. 14. A total of £10 5s., costs and allowances. Notices were served upon the tenants to cease occupying the houses by the 12th January. After the decision of the Magistrate in the above instances, I presented a report to the Committee as to how the law stands in respect of the demolition of dwelling-houses after closing orders had been made, and certain amendments required to the Acts were also pointed out, and *I suggested that the attention of the London County Council might be called to my remarks, as they might induce the London County Council to reconsider "representationn " which had been made to them. The Committee directed communications to be addressed to the London County Council and the Local Government Board with reference to the matter. At the date of finishing this report, 11th March, 1905, the Housing of the Working Classes Committee of the London County Council are about to lay before the London County Council certain proposals in respect of my " representations." 127 Hurfords's Court, Tucker's Court and Favonia Street Area. These areas are now being cleared by the London County Council. "The scheme, which was confirmed by Act of Parliament passed in July, 1900, comprises three small areas in the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. The Burford's Court and Tucker's Court areas will be sold for commercial purposes, and the Favonia Street area will almost entirely be laid out as a playground. By the clearance of the areas 269 persons will be displaced, and accommodation for them is being provided on a site about half a mile distant in Preston's Road, the greater part of which is being utilised by arrangement with the School Board for London for fulfilling the re-housing obligations of the Board. The gross cost of the scheme is estimated at £16,000, and the net cost, inclusive of that of laying out the playground at £13,300. All interests in the property have been acquired by the Council, 14 out of 19 claims received having been settlod by agreement. During the past year the arbitrator appointed by the Secretary of State to deal with thef disputed claims issued his award, the amount claimed being £7,457 8s. in all, and the total awarded £3,455." Providence Place Area. Certain portions of this area (Union Place and Court) have been boarded up by the London County Council. "The Providence Place scheme provides for the clearance of an area nearly one acre in extent, lying south of the East India Dock Road, and east of Cotton Street, Poplar, and incidentally for the extension of Union Street to Woolmore Street, and the widening of a length of that road on its western side. The houses are for the most part two-storey cottages, situated in Providence Place and adjacent courts, Providence Place itself being a narrow court about 10 feet wide leading out of Woolmore Street. During the past year the scheme has been slightly modified by the exclusion of the site of the out buildings on the southern side of Union Court at the rear of Nos. 24, 25 and 26, Ashton Street. The scheme was 128 undertaken by the Council on 29th October, 1901, and 361 persons of the working class will be displaced, while dwellings to accomodate about 400 persons can be erected on the cleared area. The gross cost of clearance is estimated at £17,000, the cost of works at £1,600, and the value of the cleared area for housing purposes at £1,500, thus leaving the net cost of the scheme at £17,100. All interests in the property have already been acquired by the Council, and the question of re-development of the area is now receiving attention." Bridge Road and Emmett Street. "This area, which was the subject of an official representation, dated 12th July, 1901, by Dr. F. W. Alexander, the Medical Officer of Health of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, is situated between Bridge Road and Emmett Street, and comprises Providence Cottages, four houses in Emmett Street, and two blocks of four and five-storey buildings known as Arnolds Buildings. These buildings which contained aboutl 110 tenements and between 300 and 400 rooms, were erected in 1888, but were closed in 1894, by a magistrate's order. The area did not appear to the Council to be one which should be1 dealt with under Part I. of the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1890, but we were of opinion that Arnold's Buildings should be demolished. In view, however, of a proposal by the owners to convert the premises into a workmen's hotel, no action was taken in that direction for a time, but as the owners had failed to effect any alterations a magistrate's order was obtained on 25th March, 1904, for the demolition of the buildings within a period of six weeks from that date." King Street Area. This is a small area on the north side of King Street, Poplar, opposite the Post Office, and was represented to the London County Council in July, 1900, at the same time as the Providence Place area. The London County Council decided not to entertain the representation. The three houses in Eagle Place and the four houses in Prospect Place were closed in April and May, 1903, respectively. The houses in Eagle Place and Prospect Place still remain closed and the entrances to these cul de sacs are boarded up. 129 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS. The Committee had under consideration judgment of the High Court (King's Bench Division) on appeal from decisions of Police Magistrates in connection with the enforcement of the By-laws of the Boroughs of Stepney and Islington relating to Houses Let in Lodgings. The charge in both cases was that the landlord of a lodging-house did not in the first week in April cause every part of the premises to be cleansed as required by the by-laws, and in one case the summons was dismissed, and in the other the defendant was fined. The Lord Chief Justice, in delivering judgment in both cases, stated that in his opinion the by-laws were bad, because they did not provide that the persons who were made responsible for" seeing that the things were done should receive the necessary notice. In his opinion the by-laws required remodelling, with the point of view not of removing the liability of the landlord but of giving him notice before subjecting him to penalties. The By-laws of the Poplar Borough Council were similar to the by-laws in question in that there was no provision for notice to be given to landlords to cleanse the premises before proceedings were taken for penalties, although in practice such notice was invariably given. A communication was addressed by thei Commitee to the Local Government Board with a view to settling a form of amendment of the existing by-laws to provide for notice to be given. The Council approved the action of the Committee. The Local Government Board submitted amended model bylaws and suggested the Council should consider the desirability of amending their by-laws in a corresponding manner, which was accordingly done by the Council on the 2nd June, and the Local Government Board confirmed the by-laws on tiie 7th September. The clauses lelating to the service of notices and penalties in the new by-laws are as follows: — I 130 "19. Where a duty imposed upon or a prohibition applied to the landlord of a lodging-house is by any by-law expressly imposed or applied subject to the provisions of these by-laws, proceedings shall not be taken against the landlord for an offence against the by-law unless and until the landlord, after service upon him of a notice in writing by the Council requiring him within such reasonable time as is specified in the notice to comply with the by-law, has failed to comply with the by-law within the time so specified. Penalties. "20. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing by-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Council: "Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment, as a penalty, of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this by-law." At the end of the year 1904, there were 768 houses on the register. See the report of the Inspector (Mr. Wm. Johnson) for Houses Let in Lodgings, page 228, as to the work executed under the by-laws. SEWERAGE AND DRAINAGE. In the memorandum issued by the Local Government Board to the Medical Officers of Health respecting their Annual Reports, it is stated that the Local Government Board desire to obtain, through the Annual Reports of the Medical Officers of Health, information of particular changes of condition that occur by the action of the Local Authority, and one of the subject matters which is required to be reported upon is the condition of sewer and house drains; therefore, one cannot do better than report upon the excellent work which has been carried out by the Public Health and Housing Committee at the instigation of the Borough Surveyor. 131 Mr. Heckford, the Borough Surveyor, reported that it was desirable a new sewer be constructed in Carpenters Road to take the sewage from that portion of the Borough between Hackney Cut Navigation and the River Lea. Messrs. Clarke, Nickolls and Coombs had carried out building operations at the place in question and had called upon the Council to arrange for the periodical removal of soil from the cesspit connection with their works. This the Council is required to do under the Public Health (London) Act, and in view of this and the probable erection of other premises requiring similar facilities, it was considered desirable the sewer should be constructed. The Surveyor proposed to construct a 12-inch pipe sewer, with syphon in duplicate, under the Hackney Cut Navigation, and to connect the system with the existing sewer in Hepscott Road. The Woodstock Road sewer, passing under 146, High Street, Poplar, and discharging into the Black Ditch sewer at the rear, having become blocked, the surveyor proposed that the sewer from Woodstock Road should be cut off and taken into the London County Council High School sewer, and that the portion of sewer beneath the house should be demolished and re-laid in 6-inch pipes with fall to High Street. The Borough Surveyor reported that a stoppage having occurred in Athelstan Road sewer an opening was made and the sewer found to be crushed in for a distance of about 140 feet, the Surveyor proposed this portion of the sewer should be reconstructed. The Borough Surveyor reported that on proceeding with the work of constructing Parnell Road sewer it was found the sewer had to be carried farther down Locton Street and Ruston Street than was expected, owing to a discrepancy in the records of the existing sewers. The Lock Cottages at Duckett's Canal drained into cesspools, and the sewer was 125 feet away, therefore, it was necessary for a sewer to be provided within 100 feet before requiring owners of property to drain into it. I 2 132 The Committee recommended the Council's sewer to be extended to take the drainage of Lock Cottages, and the owners to be required to drain the Cottages into the sewer. The extension of the Bridge Road sewer for a distance of about 90 feet to take the drainage of Messrs. Lamb, Beal and Co.'s premises, was approved by the Council. The Borough Surveyor reported that it was desirable the extension be made in 24-inch pipes, instead of 9-inch as originally proposed, in order that the sewer may form an emergency reservoir in case of any temporary difficulty in connection with the sewage lift. The Borough Surveyor reported that the sewers in Ashton Street and Woolmore Street were in a very defective condition, and that Ashton Street sewer is at too high a level to efficiently drain that street. The Surveyor proposed to reconstruct the sewer in Ashton Street with about 430 feet of 12-inch pipes and Woolmore Street 615 feet of 12-inch pipes, with the necessary manholes and a ventilating shaft in each case. The Committee recommended the Council that the sewers in Ashton Street and Woolmore Street be reconstructeH by the Borough Surveyor in accordance with his plans. The Committee had under consideration the requirement of the London and India Docks Co. that the Council should periodically remove the soil from the cesspit of a privy at the Lockkeeper's Cottage at the Limehouse entrance to the South-West India Dock. The premises were too far from the Council's sewer for the Council to require the Company to connect to it, and the Borough Surveyor advised the Committee it would be much less costly for the Council to incur the necessary expenditure on the work than to carry out the removal of the soil. The Committee recommended the Council that a 6-inch pipe be laid from the Lock-keeper's Cottage at the Limehouse entrance to the South-West India Docks. 133 The Borough Surveyor reported that the extensive sewer works which have been in progress on the Isle of Dogs since January, 1903, were completed on 27th August, 1904. In his report the Borough Surveyor stated: — " The construction of new sewers for the Isle of Dogs was necessitated by the frequent flooding of the basement floors of many premises in Cubitt Town on account of the old sewers having been insufficiently deep to allow of an adequate fall being given to the drain from the premises. In addition to this, however, the old sewers were found to be in a very defective condition, and far from watertight. When it is known that the London County Council have to deal with the whole of the sewage of this area by pumping at Abbey Mills, the importance of this in such a water-logged strata as exists in the Isle of Dogs can be readily imagined. "In October, 1902, the Council approved a scheme presented by me for the construction of new 32-inch by 48-inch egg-shaped sewers composed of bricks and concrete, and 18 inch and 24-inch circular stoneware pipe sewers surrounded by concrete. The estimated cost was £16,820, but this was subsequently increased to £18,520 before the commencement of the work to suit the requirements of the L.C.C. " The work was commenced on 26th January, 1903, at the lowest point, viz., the junction with the Manchester and East Ferry Roads, where the connection with the L.C.C. sewer was made. "During the progress of the work either ballast or clay was encountered in the lower strata until a point 100 feet north of Marshfield Street was reached. There, however, and onwards the lower strata proved to be of running sand on which it was impossible to construct a sound sewer. The depth of this sand varied from 3 feet 6 inches to 5 feet to the solid bottom below the level of the foundation of the sewer, and this, consequently, necessitated either sheet piling and excavation or open piling with square piles. 134 The latter method was adopted, the piles being driven through the loose sand and firmly imbedded in a solid foundation. It was found that as the numerous piles were driven down the water was excluded, and what was previously loose wet sand became a compact mass and formed an excellent bottom to build upon. " A departure had to be made from this method of obtaining a firm bottom on proceeding further on account of the sand containing too large a proportion of silt to allow of its compression. It was, therefore, decided to drive piles as usual and place longitudinally on the top thereof 50 lb. steel rails, fish-plated, bolted and brogged on to the piles. On these rails whea fixed in position 3-inch York stone slabs were placed and on the stone the invert blocks were laid the sewer being then built up in the ordinary fashion. In places the strata of silt ran higher and in such cases the sloppy silt was entirely removed and hardcore and cement concrete substituted. " A length of over 1,000 yards was dealt with either in one or other of the methods above described and many other difficulties overcome. Some idea may be formed of these when I mention that throughout the whole length of the works not more than 200 yards proved sufficiently good to build upon without special treatment. "The total cost of the work has been £21,231 8s. 8d., and the estimate, together with a supplementary estimate of £2,000 put forward during the progress of the work, amounted to £20,520. £11,539 14s. 9d. has been paid in wages, and the Establishment charges included in the above cost amounted to £1,154. " The following information as to the length of sewers, and quantities of material used may be of interest: — Length of brick sewer constructed ... 4,590 feet. Length of 18-inch pipe sewer laid ... 3,336 feet. Length of 24-inch pipe sewer laid ... 950 feet." The Committee considered complaints of offensive emanations 135 from a surface ventilating grating over the sewer in Brabazon Street, and directed the Borough Surveyor! to substitute a ventilating shaft. The Committee considered complaints of nuisance from an open ventilating grating on the L.C.C. sewer embankment at Wick Lane, and requested the London County Council to replace the grating with a ventilating shaft. The Public Health and Housing Committee agreed with the Borough Surveyor that it is desirable that means of access to the sewers should be provided other than the costly method of breaking into them when they required attention and recommended to the Council that 227 manholes be constructed to the Council's sewers in the Bow district. It will be remembered that in my last annual report it was mentioned, the Borough Surveyor very wisely pointed out to the Committee the need for the construction of manholes to existing sewers, to enable the sewers to be properly examined and cleansed. A number of the Council's sewers were without manholes and could only be examined by breaking them open, and, consequently, it was only when a blockage occurred that defects were discovered. The suggestion of the Borough Surveyor as to manholes has been largely carried out throughout the Borough. The Royal Institute of British Architects called attention to the by-laws of the London County Council, approved by the Local Government Board on 20th August, 1903, relating to the plans required to be submitted to the local sanitary authority in cases of the provision, reconstruction or alteration of drainage systems. It was urged the details required to be shown are unnecessary and involve additional cost to owners of buildings, and the modification of the by-laws is proposed. The By-laws in question were approved by the Council before adoption by the London County Council and the Public Health and Housing Committee informed the Royal Institute of British 136 Architects they were unable to recommend the revision of the by-laws as suggested. The London County Council also submitted, for an expression of opinion by the Council, a proposal of the Royal Institute of British Architects for the amendment of the by-laws relating to the details insisted upon in plans of drainage work required to be submitted to the Borough Councils as the Council had already disapproved the suggest:ons when made direct by the Institute, and the Committee were of opinion plans in accordance with the by-laws are necessary, and the proposed amendment should be opposed, and the Committee recommended the Council to concur in this opinion and the London County Council to be so informed. The Islington Borough Council received applications from a contractor to drain new postal stores into the Council's sewer. Basement and block plans of the new buildings were submitted under protest, but without sufficient information, and W.C.'s proposed were not in accordance with the London County Council by-laws. H.M. Office of Works claimed that Government buildings are exempt from by-laws and regulations relating to drainage and sanitary arrangements administered by Local Authorities. The Islington Borough Council addressed a communication to the Government with a view to Government buildings being placed under the same by-laws as other buildings in respect of drainage and sanitary arrangements and the inspection thereof, and requested the local Members of Parliament, the London County Council and the Borough Councils to support their action. The Committee recommended the Council to support the Islington Borough Council in this matter. COMBINED DRAINAGE. Drainage reconstruction was carried out by the Council at the undermentioned premises, either on account of there being no plans, or the plans not being in order: — 67 to 73, Kerbev Street; 305-307, Roman Road and stables at rear of 74, Usher Road; 88, Upper North Street, and 73 to 77, Augusta Street; 11, Lindale Street; 3 and 4, Grove Villas; 58 and 137 60, Woolmore Street; 52 to 58, Burcham Street; 6 and 8, Parnell Road; 32 and 34, Woolmore Street; 61 to 63, Brunswick Road; 86 and 87, Cadogan Terrace; and 2 to 5, Grove Villas. The St. Pancras Borough Council called attention to the fact (hat when premises within one curtilage are sub-divided into premises within two or more curtilages, the existing drain takes the drainage of more than one premises and may become a sewer. The London County Council was asked to promote a Bill in Parliament to prevent the creation of sewers by the sub-division of premises, and for the imposition of a substantial penalty for creating a sewer by adding drainage beyond the curtilage of any premises. The Committee recommended the Council to support the action of St. Pancras Borough Council in the matter. The following letter was received from the London County Council on the subject of legislation regarding Combined Drainage: — LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL, County Hall, Spring Gardens, S.W., J,tli August, 190If. Sir, The Council has had under consideration a letter, dated 12th February, 1904, from the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras, and also communications from a number of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, suggesting that the Council should promote a Bill in Parliament for the prevention of the creation of sewers by the subdivision of premises, and to provide for a substantial penalty in case of such action. With reference thereto I am directed to remind you that during five sessions of Parliament the Council endeavoured, without success, to obtain legislation with regard to the question of combined drainage; and in October, 1900, it was deemed inadvisable to take further action on the Metropolitan Sewers and Drains Bill, which the Council had promoted. 138 The Council is advised that the prospect of obtaining the powers sought by the Bill has not improved, as the legislation required would constitute an amendment of the Metropolis Management Acts. I am also directed to draw your attention to the reply of Mr. Walter Long, President of the Local Government Board, to the deputation of representatives of the Association of Municipal Corporations and of a conference held in Glasgow. The deputation waited on Mr. Long on 4th February, 1904, and the reply was to the effect that combined drainage was a very complicated matter and that if he could find a satisfactory and practically non-controversial remedy, he would be glad to deal with the difficulty. In these circumstances, the Council suggested to the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of St. Pancras, in reply to its letter of 12th February, 1904, that a joint representation should be made to the Government with a view to the question of combined drainage being dealt with as a public measure. The Borough Council has expressed itself in favour of the suggestion. I have accordingly been directed to enquire whether the Borough Councils, which have expressed themselves in favour of the proposals in the letter, dated 12th February, 1904, from the St. Pancras Metropolitan Borough Council, are prepared to support the suggestion that a joint representation should be made to the Government. Before any such representation is made, however, it would appear necessary that the particular amendments of the law required should be carefully considered, and I am to suggest that the Metropolitan Borough Councils which are moving in the matter should endeavour to come to some arrangement on this point, and should formulate such amendments as appear to them to be desirable. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) G. L. GOMME, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk, Poplar. 139 The matter was referred to the Borough Surveyor and myself, who suggested an amendment of the Metropolis Local Management Acts on the lines of a provision obtained by the West Ham Corporation in their Act of 1898, Section 42, which enacts:— 42. "In and for the purposes of Section 41 of the Act of ''1893, the word ' drain' shall be deemed to include any sewer "or drain whether constructed before or after the passing of "this Act with which two or more houses or premises (whether "belonging to the same or different owners) are at the date of " the passing of this Act or may at any time thereafter be con"nected or which is used or capable of being or intended to be ''used for the conveyance of the drainage of such houses or " buildings directly or by means of any other sewer or drain to " any public sewer situate under a street repairable by the in" habitants at large but shall not include any sewer which has "been constructed to the satisfaction of the Corporation under "Section 152 of the Public Health Act, 1875, or any sewer ''which has been constructed by the Corporation for the effectual "drainage of the Borough." Section 41 of the West Ham Corporation Act, 1893, is practically the same as Sections 82, 83, 84 and 85 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and Section 64 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862. The effect of this provision is that all sewers and drains, other than public sewers constructed by or taken over by the Corporation are maintainable by the owners. The Public Health and Housing Committee being of opinion the amendment of the Metropolis Local Management Acts on similar lines is desirable, and that a joint representation should be made to the Government with a view to the introduction of a public bill dealing with the matter, the Committee recommended the Council to concur in this opinion, and the London County Council be so informed. 140 BY-LAWS MADE BY THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL UNDER SECTION 39 (I.) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891, WITH RESPECT TO WATER CLOSETS, EARTH CLOSETS, PRIVIES, AND RECEPTACLES FOR DUNG. After the judgment of the High Court (King's Bench Division) on appeal from decisions of Police Magistrates in connection with enforcement of the by-laws relating to Houses Let in Lodgings (see page 129), the London County Council proposed to amend By-law 26, made by the1 Council under Section 39 (I.) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The London County Council after consultation with the Local Government Board submitted the amended by-laws to the Local Sanitary Authorities. The Public Health Committee recommended the Council to approve of the amended by-laws, and the seal of the London County Council was affixed on the 10th November, 1904, to the following by-laws, which were allowed by the Local Government Board on the 31st January, 1905. 1.—The occupier of any premises shall cause every water closet belonging to such premises to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as may be necessary for the purpose of keeping such water closet in a cleanly condition. The occupier of any premises shall once at least in every week cause every receptacle for dung belonging to such premises to be emptied and thoroughly cleansed. Provided that where two or more lodgers in a lodging-house are entitled to the use in common of any water closet or receptacle for dung the landlord shall cause such water closet to be cleansed or receptacle for dung to be emptied and cleansed as aforesaid. The owner of any lodging-house shall, subject to the provision 141 hereinafter specified provide and maintain in connection with such house water closet earth closet or privy accommodation in the proportion of not less than one water closet earth closet or privy for every 12 inmates of such house. Provided that proceedings shall not he taken against the owner of any lodging-house for an offence against the last mentioned requirement of this by-law unless and until the owner after service upon him of a notice in writing by the sanitary authority requiring him within such reasonable time as is specified in the notice to comply with the by-law has failed to comply with the by-law within the time so specified. For the purposes of this by-law a "lodging-house" means a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family. "Landlord" in relation to a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family means the person (whatever may be the nature or extent of his interest) by whom or on' whose behalf such house or part of a house is let in lodgings; or for occupation by members of more thai> one family or who for the time being receives or is entitled to receive the profits arising from such letting. "Lodger," in relation to a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family means a person to whom any room or rooms in such house or part of a house may have been let as a lodging or for his use or occupation. Nothing in this by-law shall extend to any common lodging-house, Penalties. 2.—Every person who shall offend against the foregoing by-law shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the sanitary authority. 142 Provided nevertheless that the court before whom any complaint may be made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may if they think fit adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this by-law. Repeal of By-laws. 3.—From and after the date of the confirmation of these by-laws the by-law numbered 26 (twenty-six) in the by-laws relating to water closets earth closets privies ash pits cesspools and receptacles for dung and the proper accessories thereof in connection with buildings which were made by the London County Council on the twentysecond day of June in the year One thousand eight hundred and ninety-three and were confirmed by the Local Government Board on the twenty-eighth day of June in the year One thousand eight hundred and ninety-three, shall be repealed. OFFENSIVE TRADES. A letter was received from the London County Council stating the Local Government Board had confirmed the Order made by the Council on 29th March, declaring the business of a dresser of fish skins to be an offensive business within the meaning of Section 19 (1) (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. At the present time there is no known dresser of fish skins within the Borough of Poplar. The Public Health and Housing Committee were informed that the Public Health Committee of the London County Council were of opinion that it is desirable the by-laws made by the Council in relation to offensive trades should be amended, and they had accordingly caused draft amended by-laws to be prepared. The most important amendment which it was proposed to make is to require that, in the case of every business, all offensive processes be conducted in a closed chamber, provision being moreover made for the adequate ventilation of such chamber and the destruction of offensive vapours. 143 The amended draft by-laws also differ from the existing by-laws in the following, among other, respects:— For the purpose of receiving and conveying away all scraps, litter, refuse, and residues, there is to be provided in all cases a sufficient number of vessels or receptacles, furnished with tight and close-fitting covers. All material emitting any offensive or noxious effluvium, vapour or gas when delivered on to the premises across a public footway is required to be conveyed in vessels properly constructed and covered. In all cases where a closed chamber is to be provided, the cleansing of the floor of every such chamber and such part of the walls thereof as is covered with hard, smooth, and impervious material is required at the close of each working day; and all vessels, receptacles, etc., are to be kept clean so as to prevent any offensive smell. A copy of the by-laws and a plan of the premises is to be displayed in a conspicuous position. Drains on all premises are to be maintained in good order and efficient action. In some instances a requirement is made that all liquid refuse before being discharged into any drain shall be treated in such manner as to prevent nuisance. In the by-laws relating to the business of a knacker, a provision has been inserted for the prevention of over-crowding of animals, and the cleansing of streets after the slaughter of horses by a licensed knacker. A provision that the parts of walls and ceilings not covered with hard, smooth, and impervious materials shall be lime-washed between the first and tenth days of the months of March, June, September, and December has been inserted in each set of by-laws. 144 It was reported to the Committee that the proposed amended by-laws are necessary to enable nuisances arising from offensive businesses to be adequately dealt with, and the Committee recommended the Council to approve the draft amended by-laws. The premises where offensive trades may be carried on within the Borough of Poplar are:— Yard attached to 39, White Post Lane 277, Roman Road Tripe Boilers. East London Soap Works Soap Boilers. 241, Old Ford Road 37, White Post Lane Fat Melters. 112, White Post Lane 31, White Post Lane Fat and Bone Webbs, Yeo Street Wickens, Pease & Co., Glaucus Street Boilers. Complaints were received respecting the obnoxious smells arising from the Sheppy Glue and Chemical Works, White Post Lane. The Company was communicated with and a very much larger fan was fixed to extract the fumes from the boiling house and drive them through the furnaces. No further complaints were received after this alteration. The Company was also informed that the tubs for collecting fat should be abolished, as the wood had become infiltrated, and properly covered iron receptacles ought to be substituted. Iron receptacles were obtained. REMOVAL OF OFFENSIVE TRADE AND OTHER REFUSE. Suggested Amendment of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In a circular letter dated 27th February, 1903, the London County Council pointed out that no provision exists which suggests that the Sanitary Authority shall systematically collect trade refuse, but they must remove any particular accumulation on the requisition of the owner at his expense. 145 Under date 15th April a letter was received from the London County Council referring to their previous circular letter. The letter stated that this proposal was made on account of resolutions adopted by the Conference of London Sanitary Authorities held at the County Hall on the 29th June and 7th November, 1900. From replies received to the circular letter oh the 27th February, 1903, it appeared that a large number of Sanitary Authorities were bpposed to the proposal that it should be their duty to collect trade refuse, and with a view of meeting their objection, clauses had been re-drafted so as to enable, but not to compel Sanitary Authorities to undertake any such collection. The Public Health and Housing Committee considered it desirable Borough Councils should have power to arrange for the systematic removal of offensive trade refuse, and recommended the Council to approve these suggested clauses of the London County Council, which were as follows:— The Sanitary Authority if they think fit may:— 1. (a) Employ a sufficient number of scavengers, or contract with any scavengers, whether a company or individuals, for collecting and removing at proper periods, of which sufficient notice shall be given, all trade refuse of an offensive or noxious nature from any premises within their district. (b) Where the Sanitary Authority, in pursuance of the power hereby conferred, has undertaken the collection of such refuse and such refuse is not removed from any premises in the district at the period so fixed as aforesaid, and the owner or occupier serves on the Sanitary Authority a written notice requiring removal of such refuse, the Sanitary Authority shall comply with such notice within 48 hours after that service, exclusive of Sundays and public holidays. If a Sanitary Authority fail without reasonable cause to comply with such notice they shall be liable on conviction by a court of summary jurisdiction to a fine not exceeding twenty pounds. k 146 2. Offensive or noxious trade refuse shall mean all trade refuse in such a condition as to be or to be liable to become offensive or noxious. If any dispute or difference of opinion arises between the owner or occupier and the Sanitary Authority as to what is to be considered as offensive or noxious trade refuse, a petty sessional court, on complaint made by either party, may by order determine whether the subject matter of dispute is offensive or noxious trade refuse, and the decision of that court shall be final. 3. The owner or occupier of any premises from which such refuse is removed shall pay to the Sanitary Authority a reasonable sum, either by way of annual payment or in respect of each such removal, and such sum in case of dispute shall be settled by the order of a petty sessional court. Complaint was made respecting the nuisance arising from the removal of fish offal; the communication alleging the complaint was laid before the Committee. It was pointed out to the Committee a nuisance must always arise whilst the offal is being removed in open pails from premises and is being shot into the receptacle or cart. The nuisance can only be prevented by having the offal stored in air-tight covered pails or receptacles, and these pails or receptacles removed from premises and placed on a trolley without their covers Being disturbed. No doubt if the strict letter of the London County Council bylaw be enforced some such mode of removal could be made compulsorily. The by-law states:— "Every person who shall convey any house, trade or street "refuse across or along any footway, pavement or carriageway "shall use a suitable receptacle, cart, carriage or other means of "conveyance properly constructed so as to prevent the escape "of the contents thereof, and in case of offensive refuse so "covered as to prevent any nuisance therefrom. . . '' 147 As the Council had already approved the proposal of the London County Council that legislation should be promoted enabling Borough Councils to undertake by contract or otherwise systematic collection of offensive refuse, the Committee, meanwhile, directed that) such steps should be taken as may be possible to minimise the nuisance. Mr. Boyce, Sanitary Inspector Bow West Division, reported:— "On the 11th July at 5.15 p.m. my attention was drawn by the Medical Officer of Health to a pair-horse van loaded with bags containing stinking fat and bones, at rest outside a coffee-shop in the Bow Road." Summonses were applied for. It was reported to the Committee that there is an increase in the nuisance from the removal of offensive or noxious matter outside the prescribed hours, and in vehicles not properly constructed or covered. The vehicles conveying offensive or noxious matter pass through the district at all hours and are driven at such a pace That the officers of the Sanitary Authority cannot cause the drivers to stop in order to obtain their names and addresses, and those of their employers. The drivers can only be questioned should they happen to pull up on their journey. When the by-laws were first passed in June, 1903, the Police used to communicate with the Local Authority whose duty it is to prosecute, and the Police giving the necessary evidence. A case was heard at the Thames Police Court upon information given by the Police, but the Magistrate dismissed the summons as he did not consider the matter removed was of an offensive nature, and since the dismissal of this case the Police have taken no active steps in assisting the Poplar Sanitary Authority. k 2 148 In dismissing the case mentioned above, the Magistrate stated he did not consider matter could be considered offensive if in order to obtain the effluvia it was necessary to mount the vehicle conveying it. It was suggested to the Committee that the Commissioner of Police be communicated with, asking him to assist the Sanitary Authority by the aid of the mounted patrols in enforcing the bylaws made by the London County Council in respect of the removal by road of offensive or noxious matter through the Poplar District. The Committee directed the Commissioner of Police be communicated with. REMOVAL OF DEAD HORSES. The London County Council proposed to make, under Section 54 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1903, a by-law as follows:— Any person who shall convey the carcase of a dead horse through or along a public street in the County of London shall use for such purpose a vehicle constructed and closed in such manner that such carcase shall be completely concealed from public view, and the body of such vehicle shall be made of or lined with impervious material so as to prevent any liquid or discharge from the said carcase escaping from such vehicle. He shall so convey such carcase along the public streets with all reasonable dispatch, and so as to prevent any nuisance arising therefrom. Any person who shall offend against the foregoing by-law shall be liable for each breach of such by-law to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. This by-law shall not extend to the City of London. 149 The Committee recommended the Council to approve the proposed by-law. The by-law was made by the London County Council on the 11th of October, and confirmed whilst this report is being written, 011 the 31st of January, 1903, and approved by the Local Government Board on the 21st of February. 1905. Section 55 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1903, imposes the duty of enforcing the by-law upon the Metropolitan Borough Councils. CONFERENCE ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. The London County Council were of opinion that it would be an advantage for representatives of the Metropolitan Borough Councils to meet and exchange views as to the results of the experience they had gained in the administration of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891; and to discuss any general principles which such experience showed it was desirable to adopt with a view to the provisions of the Act being equally and uniformly enforced in the several sanitary districts of London. With this object a conference was held at the County Hall, on Thursday, the 7th July, at 11 a.m. Together with Councillors Sambridge and West and the Town Clerk, I attended a conference of representatives of the London Sanitary Authorities at the County Hall, Spring Gardens. The conference was convened on the 7th July by the London County Council, and was adjourned after a lengthy meeting to the 18th July. The following are the resolutions adopted by the conference on 7th July, 1904:— housing. Homes let in Lodgings. (6) That the efficient administration of Section 94 of the Public 150 Health (London) Act, 1891, relating to the registration and regulation of houses let in lodgings is a matter of extreme importance to the public health of London. (7) That it is advisable that in by-laws made in respect of houses let in lodgings there should be no rental limit of exemption, but that they should be so framed as to apply only to such houses as are registered by the sanitary authority. (8) That the efficient enforcement of by-laws relating to houses let in lodgings is the most effective method of dealing with overcrowding, but that inspections should from time to time be made during the early hours of the morning at other houses where overcrowding within the meaning of Section (2), (1), (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is suspected. Underground Rooms. (9) That a single angle of light and air to underground dwelling rooms should be adopted in the enforcing of Section 96 of the Public Health (London) Act.

Two sanitary conveniences where from 15 to 40 females are employed or in attendance. Three sanitary conveniences where from 40 to 75 females are employed or in attendance. II. In factories or workshops where males are employed or in attendance there shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 males; provided that— (a) In factories or workshops where the number of males employed or in attendance does not exceed 50, and sufficient urinal accommodation is also provided there shall be one sanitary convenience where no more than 20 males are employed or in attendance, and two sanitary conveniences where from 20 to 50 males are employed or in attendance. (b) In factories or workshops where the number of males employed or in attendance exceeds 100, and sufficient urinal accommodation is also provided, it shall be sufficient if there is one sanitary convenience for every 25 males up to the first 100, and one for every 40 after. (c) In factories or workshops where the number of males employed or in attendance exceeds 500, and the district inspector of factories certifies in writing that, by means of a check system, or otherwise, proper supervision and control in regard to the use of the conveniences are exercised by officers specially appointed for that purpose, it shall be sufficient if one sanitary convenience is provided for every 60 males, in addition to sufficient urinal accommodation. Any certificate given by an inspector shall be kept attached to the general register, and shall be liable at any time to be revoked by notice in writing from the inspector. (In 152 calculating the number of conveniences required, any odd number of persons less than 15, 20, 25, 40, or 60, as the case may be, shall be reckoned as 15, 20, 25, 40, or 60.) Shops.

(15) That the London County Council be requested to insert their General Powers Bill for the Session of 1905 a clause enabling them to make by-laws for the regulation of the conduct of the business carried on in premises where food is prepared for sale, such by-laws to be conferred by the Borough Councils.

I attended the Parliamentary Committee of the House of Commons, and gave evidence in respect of the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, Part IV. The Act was passed on the 15th August. Section 19.—Enables Sanitary Authorities to require the cleansing or destruction of articles of clothing which are in a filthy, dangerous or unwholesome condition. Section 20.—Enables Sanitary Authorities to require the owners of premises to strip the walls and cleanse any room or rooms infested with vermin, and enables owners to recover the cost of the work from tenants in certain cases. Section 22.—Enables Sanitary Authorities to require the reconstruction or removal of urinals or other conveniences opening on to streets and constructed before the passing of the Public Health 158 (London) Act, 1891, and so placed as to be a nuisance or offensive to public decency. Section 23.—Enables Sanitary Authorities to require the removal of fixed dust receptacles after movable receptacles have been provided. Section 48.—Amends Part VIII. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, so as to make penalties against ice cream manufacturers and vendors payable to the Metropolitan Borough Councils. Shortly after the passing of the Act, the owners of 18 publichouses and beer-houses were called upon to provide doors to the urinals attached to their premises. The owner of the "Wades Arms" Public House, Jeremiah Street, was called upon to remove the existing convenience, which was so situated as to be offensive to public decency. A notice was served upon an owner of a house in Bow under Section 20, as the premises were infested with bugs. The work in all the bove instances was satisfactorily carried out. WATER SUPPLIES TO SCHOOLS, In the annual report for 1903 it was stated the Committee had submitted to the School Board for London ai report on the drinking water arrangements at the Schools in the Borough, suggesting that the water fountains should be placed in or near the class-rooms, under the immediate supervision of the teachers, and that the children should be educated up to the necessity for rinsing the drinking cups before using them. A reply was received early this year that the Works Committee of the School Board of London were of opinion the necessity for rinsing the drinking cups before use is among the matters of detail 159 which should be taught in the Schools, and directed the attention of the School Management Committee to the subject. Apart from this, the School Board Committee did not consider any alterations in the present drinking arrangements were necessary. The public Health and Housing Committee directed that a copy of the report and recommendations on the subject be sent to the London County Council. RAILWAY STATIONS. Inspection of Sanitary Conveniences. The sanitary conveniencesi of the railway stations throughout the Borough were inspected during the year, the sanitary offices for gentlemen by the Sanitary Inspectors, and the sanitary offices in the ladies' waiting rooms by Miss Tattersall. A large amount of sanitary work was executed to remedy the defects revealed. The full reports in detail of these defects were presented to the Public Health and Housing Committee, and need not be again repeated. The railway stations inspected were: — Millwall Docks Station (M.E.R.). Millwall Junction Station (G.E.R.). West India Docks Station (G.E.R.). North Greenwich Station (M.E.R.). Poplar Station (G.E.R.). Poplar Station (N.L.R.). South Bromley Station (N.L.R.). Bromley Station (L.T. and S.R.). Bow Station (N.L.R.). Old Ford (N.L.R.). Bow Road Station (G.E.R.). The Blackwall Railway Station (G.E.R.) is within the jurisdiction of the London Port Sanitary Authority, but the offices for ladies were inspected by Miss Tattersall and found in fair condition. 160 The South Dock Railway Station (M.E.R.) is also within the jurisdiction of the London Port Sanitary Authority and joint inspection was made with a Sanitary Inspector of that Authority. There is a new railway station, namely Bow Road Station (Met. and L.T. and S.R.), recently built, there was no need to inspect this station. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACT, 1890. Cap. 8, Sect 26 (2). REVENUE ACT, 1903. 3 Edw. 7, Cap. 46. At the request of the London County Council certificates were given by me that the following buildings let in tenements or flats were so constructed as to afford suitable accommodation for each of the families or persons inhabiting them, and that due provision is made for their sanitary requirements: — Ottawa and Baffin Buildings. St. Lawrence Cottages. Ontario and Hudson Buildings. Quebec and Winnipeg Buildings. Two hundred and sixty-six tenements in all. SANITARY INSPECTORS' WORK, HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION, OVERCROWDING, &c., AND POLICE COURT PROCEEDINGS. After a short illness, Mr. F. J. Anthony, Sanitary Inspector and Inspector under the Food and Drugs Acts, and Canal Boat Inspector for the Bromley North Division, died on the 24th February. Mr. Anthony had been in the service of the Poplar Sanitary Authority since 1880, a period of 24 years. He first acted as Disinfector, and having qualified himself by passing the 161 tion of the Sanitary Institute, he was appointed Sanitary Inspector to the Bromley North Division in June, 1893. During his 24 years' service, Mr. Anthony had also charge of the Infectious Disease Mortuary belonging to the Council in Wellington Road. Mr. Anthony was a most trustworthy, reliable and fearless officer, and his death was very much regretted by everybody who knew him. Mr. H. J. Langley (Temporary Inspector, Houses Let in Lodgings) was appointed to carry out the duties hitherto carried out by the late Mr. F. J. Anthony, Sanitary Inspector (Bromley North Division), and Mr. Wm. Johnson was appointed to undertake the work which had been carried out by Mr. Langley. The journals of the Sanitary Inspectors were examined from the date of the coming into operation of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and lists were compiled (which involved a large amount of work) of houses not inspected, and also those inspected with the number of inspections made. Lists of houses not inspected were given to the Inspectors with instructions to inspect such premises as soon as possible. Through this proceeding many defective drainage systems have been discovered. See Inspectors' Reports, pages 189, 195, 199 and 213. Where W.C. pans and traps are fixed without notice being given under Clause 14 of the London County Council By-laws, Section 39 (1) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, the builder is written to asking him to open the ground, otherwise the matter will be reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee in order that legal proceedings may be instituted against him for infringing the by-law. This mode of procedure prevents good work being constructed on to defective work. Whenever drainage work has been found to have been done and covered up without inspection, if the builder will not open the ground, the work is exposed by the Sanitary Authority, and such a line of action ensures sound work.

Cruelty to Children (Prevention) Act, 1904. "This statute is, in the main, a consolidating Act. It re-enacts, "almost verbatim, the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to "Children Act, 1894, which was itself a consolidating and amending "statute, and incorporates the amendments introduced by the "Employment of Children Act, 1903. Among the few new pro"visions the following may be mentioned. The offences enumerated "in the schedule, for the commission of which against a child the "provisions of this statute for the detention and disposal of a "child may be brought into operation, are considerably extended, "so as to include assault and battery, attempt to commit an in"famous crime, and manslaughter. Exhibiting a child for profit "is made a special offence. A parent or guardian is no longer "excluded from the clause which renders penal the training of a "child for any dangerous performance or exhibition. Boards of "Guardians are specially empowered to subscribe towards any "association for the prevention of cruelty to children."—(Patersons Practical Statutes.) Shop Hours Act, 1904. "This statute carries one stage further the legislation affecting "shops, which began in 1902. By the Shop Hours Act of that "year (55 and 56 Vict. c. 62) it was enacted that no young "person (under the age of eighteen) should be employed in a "shop for more than seventy-four hours in one week, and county "and borough councils were empowered (but not compelled) to "appoint inspectors for carrying the Act into execution. By an "amending Act of 1893 (56 and 57 Vict. c. 67), power was given "to defray the expenses incurred; and by another amending Act "of 1895 (58 Vict. c. 5), a penalty was imposed upon a shop"keeper who failed to keep a required notice exhibited. By an "Act of 1899 (62 and 63 Vict. c. 21), seats are required to be "provided for female assistants in retail shops. It will be observed "that all these statutes are obligatory, but refer only to young "persons or women. The present statute, which is expressly "required to be read with them, is permissive, and applies to all "shops and all persons in them. It empowers a local authority "(a county or borough council, or the council of an urban district "with a population of more than 20,000), with the sanction of the "central authority (the Home Secretary) to make an order closing "shops for retail trade for certain hours and under certain condi- 168 "tions. The hour for closing may not be earlier than 7 p.m. "except for one day in the week, when it may be as early as "1 p.m. The order may apply to all shops, or to shops of a "specified class, though a list of trades or businesses (in the "schedule) is expressly exempted. It may apply to the whole or "any part of the area under the local authority. But such a "closing order can only be made when the local authority is "satisfied that it has the approval of at least two-thirds in number "of the occupiers of shops affected. When confirmed by the Home "Secretary, the closing order must be laid before Parliament, and "may be annulled by the Crown on an address from either House. "It may also> be cancelled by the Home Secretary on the appli"cation of the local authority, who are required to make such "application if they are satisfied that a majority of occupiers of "shops affected are opposed to the continuance of the order. The "Home Secretary is empowered to make regulations for carrying "the Act into effect, and also to hold local enquiries."—(Patersons Practical Statutes.) Agreeably to my feelings I cannot close this report without thanking Mr. Shillinglaw, the principal Clerk in the Town Clerk's Department for his kind assistance which at all times he has so willingly rendered me, adding efficiency to the working of the Public Health Department. Mr. Shillinglaw acts as Clerk to the Public Health and Housing Committee, and has recorded the resolutions, recommendations and reports of the Committee which have been quoted in this report. I am, Sir and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and Licentiate of the Royal Colleqe of Physicians of Edinburgh ; Diplomate in Public Health, Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, England ; Fellow and Member of the Council of the Royal Institute of Public Health; Member of the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine ; Medical Officer of Health. Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., Corner of Fairfield Road, May, 1905. 169 Public Health Department, -December 31st, 1904To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to lay before you my fifteenth Annual Summary of the Sanitary work carried out in my Division during the year ending 31st December, 1904, as follows: — Inspections on complaints of nuisances 986 Do. on notifications of infectious diseases 296 Do. on house-to-house visitation 232 Do. Canal Boats 25 Re-Inspections 2,720 Making a total of 4,259 visits Details and results of such inspections from time to time have been entered in the book kept for that purpose, as prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Of the total number (1,514 houses and other premises) of primary inspections made, I found that 37.9 per cent of the premises thus inspected various works of sanitary amendment were needed to be carried out—requiring the service of 575 written intimations, 393 statutory, and 63 final notices. In many of these cases on the service of the usual written intimations, which in all cases precedes the service of statutory notices, the required works were executed by the respective persons liable, but in 2 cases it was found necessary to have recourse to legal proceedings, necessitating attendances at the police-court to ensure enforcement. The details and nature of Sanitary Works executed in the Bow West Division during the year are as follows:— Walls and ceilings of houses cleaned throughout 27 partially . 121 Drains opened and cleansed 119 Defective drains repaired 80 Inlets to drains properly trapped 14 170 Sink waste-pipes properly disconnected from drains 2 Rain-water pipes do. do. 3 Water-closets re-constructed 4 Water laid on to soil pans of W.C.'s 43 Ventilation of W.C.'s improved 0 New soil pans provided where broken or unsuitable 18 Foul soil pans cleansed 17 Yards, areas, and forecourts paved 59 Yards and areas drained 2 Nuisances from dampness remedied 50 Roofs made watertight 85 Eaves guttering of roofs and rainwater pipes repaired 59 Water supplies to houses reinstated 23 Water services for domestic purposes altered or improved 3 Water service fittings repaired 6 Public house urinals repaired and cleansed 2 Animals improperly kept (removed) 0 Accumulations of dung ana refuse removed 27 Bye-laws enforced 0 Other nuisances remedied, chiefly dilapidations 114 Overcrowding abated 2 Drains tested* by the application of the smoke drain test, of which 23.6 per cent. were proved defective 279 House-to-House Visitation.

To the Medical Officer of Health. SIR — I beg to submit to you the Annual Summary of the Sanitary work and improvements carried out in the Bow East Division during the year ending 31st December, 1904. Inspections have been made as follows: — On notifications of infectious diseases 235 On complaints of nuisances 992 On house-to-house visitation 306 In 593 instances varied Sanitary improvements were necessary, requiring the services of 525 intimations, 160 authorised statutory. 17 final notices, and the issuing of 15 Police Court summonses supplemented by 2,214 re-inspections to secure proper compliance, resulting in the following detailed works being executed: — Walls and ceilings of houses cleaned [ throughout 21 partially 89 Yards and areas paved 7 Yards and areas drained 37 Inlets to drains properly trapped 11 Defective drains repaired 48 Drains opened and cleansed 142 Sink waste pipes properly disconnected from drains 2 Rain-water do. do. do. 1 Water laid on to soil pans of W.C.'s 38 New soil pans provided where broken or unsuitable 19 Foul soil pans cleansed 52 Roof guttering and rain-water pipes repaired 85 Roofs made watertight 81 Water supplies to houses reinstated 12 177 Water service fittings repaired 4 Water services for domestic purposes altered or repaired 5 Ventilation of W.C.'s improved 4 Nuisances from dampness abated 41 Accumulations of dung and refuse removed 21 Public house urinals cleansed and repaired 15 Bye-laws enforced ... 149 Overcrowding abated 3 Other nuisances remedied, chiefly dilapidations 297 Drains tested by the application of the smoke drain test, of which 14.20 per cent, were proved defective 338 Cisterns cleaned and covered 5 Inundations 1 Nuisances from the improper keeping of animals 2 Dung receptacles provided or repaired 2 Water closets newly constructed 3 Drainage Constructions and Reconstructions. New drainage systems, of which plans and particulars were submitted for approval and duly avthorised, have been laid at the undermentioned premises: — White Post Lane, No. 27 (entire construction). Monier Road, Nos 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 (entire construction). Wick Lane, three new shops, corner of Monier Road (unnumbered, entire construction). Vulcanite Roof Co., Stour Road. Saw Mills (Messrs. Robinsons), Stour Road (entire construction). Safety Tread Syndicate, Dace Road (entire construction). Old Ford Road, No. 499 (new W.C. connection); No. 415 (entire construction); No. 618 (new W.C. connection). Reconstruction on Old Lines. Fairfield Road, No. 37, Fairfield Works (portions); Nos. 38, 1, 3, 5 (throughout). m 178 Atley Road, Nos. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (throughout). Allanmouth Road, Dye Works (W.C. connection). Coborn Street, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (throughout). Cadogan Terrace, No. 87 (throughout). Addington Road, No. 5 (throughout); Nos. 19, 31, 34 (part). Rippoth Road, No. 2 (part).

The following combined systems of drainage or mains have been relaid by the Borough Council as Public Sewers: — 87, Cadogan Terrace. House-to-House Inspection. The house-to-house inspection comprised the whole of the houses in the under-mentioned streets, viz.: — Brewery Yard. Beachy Road. Atley Road. Spring Street. Remus Road. Gandy Court. Walters Court. Smeed Road. Stour Road. And sections of: — Monier Road. Wyke Road. Maverton Road. Bakers Alley. Bow Road. Rippoth Road. Kelday Road. Bream Street. Wansbeck Road. Bakehouses. The bakehouses throughout the district have been periodically visited, and the conditions in some instances necessitating service of intimation for dirty walls and flooring, accumulations of sweepings or ashes beneath the troughs, and the half-yearly cleansing not carried out at the stated periods. With two exceptions the bakehouses of the district are conducted on the ground level. 179 Dairies, Milkshops and Offensive Businesses. The milkshops and offensive businesses in the district have been periodically visited; an intimation in the case of offensive business being sufficient to secure amendment. In one or two instances, milkshops have changed hands without the incoming tenant registering, through ignorance of existence of regulations. On their attention being directed to infringement, they immediately registered. In three instances, attention has been drawn to rusty and broken condition of measures, resulting in the condition being forthwith remedied. The conditions of storage vessels, and utensils generally have been very satisfactory. Two vendors have permanently discontinued sale of milk, and three shops have been newly added to the register. In the case of a fat melters from which odoursi escaped periodically, a larger extracting fan was recommended to be employed. The fan was accordingly provided, and the nuisance apparently abated at once. At the Thames Police Court on the 28th October, a bone boiler was fined 20s. and 23s. costs for allowing offensive matter to be carried through the district, and not contained in proper vessels, during prohibited hours. The carman was at the same time fined 1s. and 2s. costs in respect of the same offence. For a similar offence another firm was summoned, the offenders were fined 20s. and 23s. costs. Canal Boats. Ninety-four boats have been examined; on three of the registered boats an infringement of the Acts or regulations was discovered, as follows: — " Bride," Reg. No. 228, London.—The cabin was very damp M 2 180 and dirty. Cabin top leaking and rotten, and saturated with moisture. No glass in skylight. Name of boat on after combing, and Reg. No. on forward combing. Whole of hull badly worn and in rotten and dilapilated condition. At the Thames Police Court on 25th April, the owner was fined 5s. and 2s. costs for improper marking, and 20s. with 23s. costs for rotton and damp condition of boat. "Northampton," Reg. No. 815, Birmingham.—Fore cabin occupied by extra hand. Cabin badly ventilated, defective stove leaking into cabin. Cabin improperly used for storing sacks of corn for towing horse. Owner and Registration Authority communicated with. "Hart," Reg. No. 143, Uxbridge.—After cabin occupied by man, wife, and sister of wife, aged 13 years, contrary to Act. Owner and Registration Authority communicated with. Factory and Workshop Inspections. Nuisances arising within the several factories and workshops have been satisfactorily dealt with. The whole of the ascertained workshops have been inspected and found, in most cases, to be in a cleanly condition. Where necessary intimations were served for cleansing and the work was immediately carried out. Smoke Nuisances. The smoke nuisances arising within and without the district have received much attention. It has been found necessary to issue four summons. At the West Ham Police Court on 27th January, an abatement order for 14 days and a prohibitive order with a penalty of £5 to include costs was obtained against the Saw Mills Co., Ltd., of Cooks Road, Stratford. 181 At the same Court, abatement and prohibitive orders with £1 8s. 6d. costs was obtained against Messrs. Gould Bros, of Stratford. At the Thames Police Court on 25th April.—The owner, of a traction engine which had emitted dense black smoke in Bow Road, was fined £5 and 23s. costs. On 15th September, the Road Breaking Co., Ltd., of Broadway Chambers, Westminster, was fined £3 and 23s. costs for emitting dense black smoke from a traction engine in Bow Road. Since the hearing of these summonses a notable improvement has been perceptible in the reduction of smoke issuing from traction engines passing through the district. Meat and Food Inspection. The food supplies within the district have been vigilantly watched. On 4th March.—A large box of herrings was found unfit for food and destroyed. On 27th June.—A pad of skate was examined and found unfit for food. It was destroyed by owner, and a certificate given as to its condition. On 11th July.—About half a bushel of whelks was examined and found unfit for food. Destroyed by owner and a certificate of condition given. On 4th August.—Two trunks of haddocks were found unfit for food. Destroyed by owner and certificate of unfitness given. On 5th August.—A trunk of haddocks was examined and found to be unsound. A certificate of its condition was given, and the fish was destroyed by owner. 182 On 6th August.—A pad of plaice was examined and found to be unfit for food. Certificate as to condition was given and the fish was destroyed by owner. On 27th August.—Two barrels of Canadian boned beef were examined and found to be totally unfit for food. The meat was destroyed. On 15th September.—A trunk of fish was examined and found unfit for food. The fish was destroyed, and a certificate of unfitness given. It was said by the owners of the fish that they had brought it direct from Billingsgate Market on the same day, where stale and stinking fish had been substituted for the fish paid for. Attention was drawn to this in the monthly report to the Public Health and Housing Committee, which, through the medium of the press, indirectly drew the attention of the Fishmongers' Company and the Market Authorities, to a possible means by which such occurrences could be effectually dealt with. It is noticeable that a decline in the quantity of bad fish brought for condemnation has resulted. Retention of Body. On 10th August the body of a male child was found retained in a first floor front room used by two females as a living and sleeping room. The child was said to have died about seven days previously, and as extremely hot weather was prevailing at the time, the body was badly decomposed and odoriferous. In the absence of the Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Fearnley visited the premises and signed certificate for removal of body. The certificate was taken to one of His Majesty's Justices, who made an order for immediate removal and burial. The body was at once removed to the mortuary, and subsequently buried by the Guardians. Flooding. No flooding has occurred during the year in the low-lying portion of Hackney Wick, by which several houses and other premises in 183 the district have been formerly rendered temporarily unfit for habitation. Cow and Slaughter Houses. The cow and slaughter houses in the district have received attention throughout the year, and found generally satisfactory. Ice Cream. The shops wherein ice cream is made or sold have been visited periodically. A great improvement has taken place in the conditions under which the cream is made and stored. The itinerant vendors throughout the district have been visited from time to time, and found to comply with the new regulations. with two exceptions. On 19th April a street ice cream vendor (alien) was discovered with a barrow and stall, which did not bear name and address of person from whom ice cream was obtained. A summons was authorised by the Public Health Committee to be taken out. At Worship Street Police Court on 19th May, the said vendor was fined 5s. and 2s. costs. One other vendor (alien) was found to have his own name exhibited, and not that of the person from whom the ice cream was obtained. The proper name and address were affixed to barrow on the vendor's attention being drawn to the irregularity. Eating Houses and Coffee Shops. The whole of the eating houses and coffee shops within the district have been specially inspected and generally were found in a fairly good condition. 184 In one or two instances the kitchen required some lime-whiting, which was immediately done upon the service of intimation. County Council Sewers. The nuisance from open ventilators in roadways has been considerably reduced, but not entirely obviated, since the installation of the shaft ventilators has been completed. Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-three varied samples of food have been obtained and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis, of which five were certified to have been adulterated, in two instances convictions were obtained with costs, and in two instances vendors were cautioned, and one case was dismissed on a warranty. A sample of mustard was found on analysis to be adulterated with 5 per cent. of wheaten flour. The vendor was cautioned by instruction of the Public Health and Housing Committee. A sample of milk was found on analysis to be deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 20 and 13.5 per cent. respectively. At the Thames Police Court the vendor was fined £3 and 23s. costs. A sample of milk proved on analysis to be deficient in fat and solids not fat to the extent of 15 and 5 per cent. respectively. The vendor, a company, relied with success upon the warranty of the farmer who supplied the milk. The magistrate was satisfied, after hearing the evidence, that the warranty was, in this case, an effective defence, and accordingly dismissed the summons, but allowed no costs against the Council. A sample of milk contained a proportion of a foreign ingredient: Formaldehyd, 0.01 per cent. A summons was issued, and at the hearing at Thames Police Court the defendant was fined 1s. and 3 guineas costs. A sample of butter was adulterated with 74.8 per cent. of foreign 185 fat. On the instructions of the Public Health and Housing Committee the vendor was cautioned by a letter from the Medical Officer of Health. Closing Orders. On 16th December, summonses, under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1891, 1893, were heard at the Thames Police Court against the owner of Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, Brewery Yard. After hearing the evidence the magistrate withheld his decision for 14 days, to enable him to visit the premises. At the adjourned hearing on 30th December, the magistrate made a closing order on each of the houses with 25s. costs in each case, and an allowance of 10s. compensation to the tenants of four of the houses and 15s. in respect of one of them. One unoccupied. The whole of the houses were eventually vacated. These were very old worn-out structures; two were entirely wooden, two partly wood and partly brickwork and two entirely brickwork. The exact age does not appear to be known, but they must have been very old, and were strongly marked by evidence of decay, and signs of an early dissolution. These were cottages which were included in a scheme represented to the London County Council under Part I. of the Act, which the County Council refused to entertain as a county scheme. Two of the cottages, Nos. 6 and 7, have been demolished since by the owner on the requisition of the District Surveyor. This is the first representation made with respect of the Bow District, and it is regrettable the County Council should not have passed a resolution that such area was an unhealthy area, and forthwith proceeded to make a scheme for the improvement of such area, particularly as these cottages were very badly designed and fitted, and the accommodation and general ariangement were such as to be a menace to all within their immediate neighbourhood. Had a fire occurred within one of them the whole of them and several others must have been immediately reduced to ashes, owing to the close contiguity which amounted to a continuity of one to the other. The area was also 186 overshadowed and adjoined by a large hall of public resort, the main exit door opening direct into Brewery Yard, on/ the other side was a block of tenement dwellings, the close proximity of which must have added anxiety to the Council Fire Brigade had a conflagration occurred. Houses Let in Lodgings. In this Division, 45 houses have been placed on the register or houses let in lodgings : High street, Nos. 47, 49, 51 53, and Beachy Road, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.

San Inst., Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and Inspector of Canal Boats. 188 Public Health Offices, Bow Road, E., December 31st, 1901/. To the Medical Officer of Health. I beg to submit my first Annual Report of the sanitary work executed in the Bromley North Division for the year ending 1904. The Division was inspected by my late colleague, Mr. F. Anthony, up to the end of January, when he was taken seriously ill, and died on the 24th of February. During his illness and up to the time of my appointment, viz., the 24th of March, the district was inspected by Inspector Boyce. The sanitary work executed is as follows: — 1,440 premises have been inspected. 1,094 in response to complaint of nuisances. 297 on account of notified infectious diseases. 149 house-to-house inspections.

Samples.—Under your instructions 54 samples of different food stuffs have been sampled and submitted to the Public Analyst. Legal proceedings were taken against three vendors and convictions were obtained as below: — No. of Sample. Article. Extent of Adulteration. Result of Legal Proceedings. 238 Pepper Adulterated with 10 £ of Oatmeal Fined 1/- and 23/costs 247 Milk Deficient in fat to the extent of 16.7 % Fined 20/- and 12/6 costs 256 Milk Deficient in solids not fat and fat, to the extent of 27.5 and 17.7 J respectively Fined 20/- and 23/costs Milk Shops. There are 57 milk shops in the district and these were inspected periodically. On a few occasions the shop keeper had to be cautioned about the cleanliness of the milk vessels and utensils. The shop keepers are all duly registered by name. Cowhouses and Dairies. There are three cowhouses in the district and these are thoroughly inspected four times a year, to see that the cleansing is carried out. This is done without any trouble. Frequent inspections are also paid to see that the hands of the milkers are clean during the operation. A caution was necessary in one shed. Slaughter Houses. There are four licensed in the district. These are periodically inspected, and are kept in a satisfactory condition. 192 Eating Houses. These were inspected and found satisfactory. Only in two instances intimations were served respecting the cleansing; and the work was done forthwith. Markets and Stalls. Much attention has been paid to these with a view of preventing the sale of unsound food. Night inspections have also been made, and good results have been obtained. The class of meat sold, has, in my opinion, been sound. Unsound Food. Animal food has been closely inspected in this district, whether the same has come from the Central market or from the out-lying districts. Several pig's heads have been surrendered owing to being diseased, but the carcases belonging to the heads were not upon the premises, as the heads are bought separately. In a sausage factory some diseased lungs were found, seized, and taken before the magistrate to be condemned. A summons was taken out against the butcher and at the Thames Police Court he was fined £10 10s. and £5 5s. costs. Observations have been kept at all hours during the night upon suspected traders in unsound food, with some good results. Bakehouses. These are often inspected, but there has been little cause of complaint. They are now classified as Workshops or Domestic Workshops. 193 Smoke Nuisances. Although there have been several complaints as to the amount of smoke issuing from various shafts, there have been no proceedings taken, except in one case, and that was in respect to the engine " Southend," belonging to the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway Company. The proceedings were taken upon my. report by the London County Council, and the railway company was fined 60s. Offensive Matter. Two summonses were taken out at the Thames Police Court with respect of offensive matter being conveyed through the streets in an improper manner. In each case a fine of 23s. was inflicted with 20s. costs. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, H. J. LANGLEY, Assoc. San. Inst. Cert Sanitary Inspector Exam. Hoard (Lond.) and Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, and Canal Boats Act. Bromley North Division. n 194 Public Health Department, December 31st, 190If. To the Medical Officer of Health,. Sir,— I beg to submit to you my fifteenth Annual Report of the sanitary works, executed for the abatement of nuisances, which had existed in the Central Division of the Parish of Bromley, under the Council of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar, for the year ended 31st December, 1904. I have inspected 1,462 premises, 839 in response to complaints of nuisances, 363 on account of infectious diseases notified, and 260 house-to-house inspections have been made. Of the 1,462 premises so dealt with, 894 were found to be in fair sanitary condition, whilst in the remainder 568 premises nuisances were found to exist, which necessitated the following works of sanitary repairs (see tabulated list, page 162).

Legal Proceedings under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. In pursuance of the different orders of authorisation granted by the Public Health and Housing Committee, it had been necessary to apply for two summonses for disregarding Statutory Notices served. Empson Street, No. 28.—Defective main drain, 21 days' abatement order with 25s. costs allowed the Council. Empson Street, No. 30.—Defective branch main drain, connected with No. 28 summons issued under the 64th Section, Metropolis Local Management Act, 1862. Defendant failed! to appear. Fined £5 and £2 2s. costs, which decision was altered upon the defendant's attendance, and question raised, sewer versus drain, 14 days' abatement order, and £6 6s. costs allowed the Council. Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-three samples of food had been procured and submitted to the Public Analyst (Mr. W. C. Young) for analysis. One was found to be so much adulterated that legal proceedings were taken. The nature of article, extent of adulteration, result of prosecution, being as follows : — Butter.—Adulterated with 75.7 per cent. of foreign fat containing 0.5 per cent. of boric acid; proceedings taken under 197 Margarine Act. Vendor fined for having served same in an unstamped wrapper, and 23s. costs. Eating Homes. I have, as directed by you, inspected the eating houses (coffee shops) in my district, seven in number, where necessary have served " Intimations," and in compliance the work has been carried out. In no case was there cause for complaint so far as food was concerned. Bakehouses. I have, as specially instructed, made the periodical inspections of the 14 bakehouses, and where required served " Intimations." statutory notices, under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, for the necessary work of cleansing, and also in some cases sanitary repairs to be carried out. Dairy and Milk Sellers. The cowshed at the rear of 27, Abbott Road, and all the milk purveyor's premises have been frequently inspected, and the register corrected. In the cases of those found to be non-registered through change of proprietorship the new occupiers had signed forms of application in compliance with your instructions, and their names have been duly inserted in the register. Constant attention had been give to the enforcement of the regulations relating to cleanliness of premises, utensils, etc., but in no case has an infringement been discovered. Smoke Nuisances. I have, where a nuisance had occurred from smoke emitted from any chimney, other than belonging to a private dwelling-house, viz.:—Factories, workshops, and bakehouses, either on complaint or from my own personal observation, served " Intimation " notices, etc., and the nuisances for the time being had been abated in compliance with same. Examination of Food. I have on several occasions, upon different tradesmen s applications, examined articles of food purchased by them at the markets, 198 and when found to be unsound, unwholesome, and unfit for food of man, witnessed the same destroyed, and have given certificates to that effect. In no instance was any article of food exposed for sale, or deposited for the sale of or preparation for sale, at the time of my visit, in such a condition as to justify seizure. Inspection of Canal Boats (Barges). I have, during the year, made 57 inspections of non-registered barges, with the result that no infringement of regulations had been discovered. Schools. By your direction the five public schools in my district have been frequently visited, due care at the beginning of the year having been taken regarding the water supplies. All of which, with two private schools (both since closed) had been found to be kept in fair sanitary condition. Ice Cream Makers and Vendors. As directed by you, all the premises where ice cream was prepared were inspected with the view of detecting any infringement of the London County Councils (General Powers) Act, 1902. The barrows were examined to see that they were legibly marked with the vendors' names, etc., and care taken that the ice cream and utensils were satisfactory. In only one case was an offence detected, which was met by the business being discontinued. Cowshed License. • One notice had been received for renewal of license. The premises, No. 27, Abbott Road, were again duly inspected, found to be in fair sanitary condition, no objection was raised to the application. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, RICHARD E. MINERS, Sanitary Inspector, and Inspector under Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, and Canal Boats Act, Bromley Central Division. 199 Public Health Department, 31st December, 1904. To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir, I beg to lay before you my fourth Annual Report of the sanitary work and other duties carried out under the different Acts in connection therewith, in the West Combined district, during the past 12 months, rendering as far as possible a detailed account of nuisances abated, inspections made, summonses applied for, etc. In investigating complaints and making inspections of all kinds, 1.376 houses or other premises have been visited, 323 of this number being on account of infectious diseases, and 133 being house-to-house visits. The number of re-inspections necessary to follow up the Statutory Notices, and to see the work through totalled 3,787. On account of the L.C.C. making Chicken Pox a notifiable disease, during some portion of the year the number of notifications were considerably swelled, the 323 mentioned also included those from the Poplar Union, and from the Sick Asylum. House-to-Huuse Inspection. The house-to-house visits were confined principally to premises that (according to the list which you had prepared) had escaped attention during the past 11 years, and many defective drains were thereby discovered. During the forthcoming year I hope to finish the list These visits were carried out in the under-mentioned places, viz.: — Alton Street. Barchester Street. Annabel Street. Clifton Street. Broomfield Street. Cruden Place. Brabazon Street. Cording Street. 200 Carmen Street. King Street. Ellesmere Street. Morris Road. Flint Street. Sabbarton Street. P'lint Avenue. Silver Lion Court. Goodliffe Street. South-East Row. Grundy Street. Vulcan Street. Johnson's Buildings. Drains. The drains of 209 premises have been tested with smoke or scent tests, and in 97 cases were found to be defective and allowing free escape of foul gas from same. During the year the drains of the following premises were taken out (where necessary right through to the sewer)1 and reconstructed, and where practicable, in order to comply with the by-laws of the L.C.C. and Borough Council, were intercepted, ventilated, and provided with proper means of access for clearing in times of stoppage in same, the whole being subjected to the hydraulic test, before being passed as satisfactory. In a number of instances, there are combined systems among those dealt with: — Grundy Street, African Tavern (cellar drain). Arcadia Street, Nos. 26, 28, 30. Augusta Street, Nos. 73, 75, 77, 79. Alton Street, No. 21. Barchester Street, Nos. 2, 4, 23. Bowley Street, Hope Foundry. Brabazon Street, Nos. 75, 77, 39, 41. Bath Cottages, Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Bath Street, No. 5.

Latham Street, Nos. 18, 19. Morant Street, Nos. 6, 8, 19, 26, 39. North Street, Nos. 7, 9, 11. Northumberland Street, No. 34. Poplar Railway Station, Departure Platform. Ladies' and Gentlemen's.

Wades Place, No. 35. Woodstock Road, Nos. 11, 25. West India Road, No. 51, Midland Railway Depot (workmen's closets, etc.) The under-mentioned premises were also drained or redrained according to plans submitted for approval to the Borough Council, and in accordance with the London County Councils By-laws, viz. : Stainsby Road, "New River Head," P.H. 202 Randalls Market, No. 21 (for use of Randalls' workmen, two W.C.'s, lavatory basins and urinal). Emmett Street, "United Bros." P.H. Stainsby Road, No. 124a. Wollett Street, " The Chimes," P.H. Latham Street, Wickes and Williams' workshop. Broomfield Street, Royal National Lifeboat Depot. Upper North Street (Lusty's Saw Mills, conveniences for opposite sexes). Upper North Street, stables rear of "Sussex Arms." Cording Street and Morris Road, wheelwrights' workshop and private residence. Grundy Street, "Duke of Edinburgh," P.H. The drainage of many premises has also been repaired and made sound. With regard to Johnson's Buildings in Kerby Street, I had, at times, noticed bad smells when inspecting the premises, and as the smells seemed to be intermittent I resolved to make a thorough examination of the drainage and soil pipes, etc. The first tests gave somewhat unsatisfactory results, so, in company with the owner, I again tested the whole, and succeeded in convincing the owner it was desirable and necessary for a thorough reconstruction of the system to be put in hand. The soil pipes were of earthenware and were fixed internally, and were cracked in three places, allowing bad smells to be blown about the rooms in times of strong down draughts, and the drain had dropped at the foot of soil pipes under the floors, causing serious defects. The small wing of the buildings will be overhauled in the forthcoming year. In accordance with the arrangements made with the Surveyor s Department concerning drainage work on new buildings, I have been present at the different jobs in my district as occasions arose, with the inspector of works, when the drainage was under test. 203 The sanitary fittings and work above ground has been looked after by myself as before, in order that the by-laws should be observed. Railway Stations. In compliance with the Committee's orders, the railway stations in my district have been inspected, and the sanitary conveniences overhauled. West India Docks station had been recently altered, and the sanitary accommodation renewed. At Poplar station, North London Railway departure platform, the drainage and fittings were found to be in a very indifferent condition. The whole was re-arranged, redrained, trapped and ' ventilated, together with the station master's residence. New water closets, etc., were provided, and automatic flushing apparatus provided in the urinal, and at my request a louvre ventilated skylight was fixed in the roof of the public closets, as these were so dark. Coffee and Eating Houses. Some of these have been closed during the year, and new ones opened in the district. There are now 32 on the register and the register is altered and revised as occasion requires. These places are visited at intervals, and at such times attention is paid to the class of food in preparation, as far as possible. They are kept in a tolerably clean condition, and when it is necessary to serve cleansing notices, they are promptly attended to. Food I aspect ion at Wharf, dir. Aberdeen Wharf, where food is landed for transit, has been periodically visited, but nothing found to complain of. As previously stated, all tinned goods are subjected to a 10 per cent. examination on arrival. Any injured or blown tins are put by for removal by contract. The butchers' premises and market stalls are carefully inspected, sometimes during the day and at other times in the evening. 204 Wherever brawn or sausages are made and where ice safes are in use, the premises are now and again, thoroughly examined. Boned beef and bull beef is used in some of the sausage making shops, and the former is very carefully examined for any signs of disease, as in this state the meat requires examining in section. Several lots of meat, fish and fruit have been surrendered during the year. On one occasion I seized a pig's head, one of the glands of which was tuberculous, but as the butcher did not know the disease, having never seen it in his experience, and had not bought the carcase, I allowed him to surrender the head, and a strong letter of caution was, by your directions, sent to him. It was also pointed out that this disease in any part of a pig is sufficient to condemn the whole carcase. On two other occasions I had surrendered on inspection, and had destroyed some large pieces of beef which were unfit for human food. The vendors were also cautioned. At intervals consignments of damaged rice, wheat, etc., are sent into my district from the Docks to be made into poultry food, and these are watched through the process. The following is a summary of food condemned during the year and destroyed: — 2 bushels of cherries Surrendered on inspection. 3 boxes of oranges Ditto. 1 pail of whelks Ditto. 1 bushel of apples Ditto. 2 dozen of oysters Ditto. ^ sack of mussels Ditto. J box of eels Ditto. 1 pig's head Ditto. About 28 lbs. of beef Ditto. 2 sacks of mussels Surrendered voluntarily. 11 sacks of peas Ditto. 5 boxes of tomatoes Ditto. 2 boxes of skate Ditto. 1 box of haddock Ditto. 2 boxes of plaice Ditto. 5 baskets of pears Ditto. 205 Numerous small lots of damaged fruit have been dealt with in a satisfactory manner. Factory and Workshops. In three instances direct aerial communication between workshops and water closets has been altered, proper partitions and ventilated skylights being provided. Additional workshops have been found and placed on the register for regular inspection, and the register altered as required. Limewashing and cleansing have been carried out in many instances by verbal intimation only, no service of notices being required. Outworkers. The various premises where outworkers live have been visited and found in fairly good condition. Underground Bakehouse. The underground bakehouse which was not finished (respecting the alterations required) at the end of 1903, is now completed, and is in occupation by a different tenant. As the former occupier continued to carry on his business without a certificate of fitness from the Council and in defiance of the Council's notices, he was summoned and fined 20s. and 23s. costs, and an order made to discontinue carrying on work till the alterations were completed and approved by the Council. Smoke Nuisance. All observations of black smoke from the factory chimneys and shafts in the district, notified from the L.C.C., and also my own observations have been dealt with. It was not found necessary to take legal proceedings in any instances respecting the above. All notices served in connection with these observations have been attended to and met as far as possible. 206 A summons against the owner of a traction engine was taken out, the result of which is reported further on under the Public Health Act. Bakehouses. These now number 25, and have been regularly inspected during the year. The bi-annual cleansing has been carried out without any difficulty. The troughs in the undergrounds, which are now all on wheels, are frequently moved out, and the surroundings properly cleansed. This could not be done formerly owing to the troughs being a fixture. One new factory bakehouse has been added to the list, and is chiefly used for baking Passover Cakes. On several occasions I had spoken to one master-baker, a German, about letting some 2 dozen fowls run loose in his bakehouse, and causing a great nuisance. As he took little notice a letter was sent by your instructions threatening legal proceedings, and no further cause was given for complaint, the fowls being kept under proper control. The man, about whose dirty habits in his bakehouse I complained of last year, has left the district, moving away in the night, no one knows of his whereabouts, and the shop is closed. Dairies, Cowsheds, Milkshops and Slaughter Houses. These places have received their due amount of attention throughout the year. Particular notice has been paid to the dippers and receptacles for the storage of milk, especially in the small general shops, and nearly every milk pan in the district is now kept covered with a proper dust tight cover. The cowsheds, before the renewal of licenses, have been visited, and thoroughly inspected, special attention being paid to overhead beams and woodwork. The register of milkshops requires frequently altering and amending, owing to so many removals of the persons registered to sell milk. 207 In one case the renewal of a slaughter house license was again opposed by the L.C.C. inspector, because the pigs must be taken through the shop to the slaughter house. The L.C.C. Licensing Committee, however, granted the renewal. The slaughter houses have been visited at night time when killing has been in progress, and the animals examined, but nothing out of the way was discovered. I am glad to say every facility has been given me for these inspections. The number of premises as above now on the registers is: — Milkshops 92 Cowsheds 2 Slaughter Houses 3 (one for swine only) Canal Boats Arts. Canal boats have been boarded and inspected as often as opportunities were presented. These numbered 26 registered boats, and about 12 unregistered sailing barges. On two occasions I endorsed notices served by the Canal Boat Inspectors of rural districts, viz.—Uxbridge and Newport Pagnell, requiring certain work to be done to the boats "Stort" and "Kennet," to stop the tar liquor getting into the cabins. The work was done at times of my inspections in a satisfactory manner, and the counterparts of the notices were returned to the authorities. Overcrowding.—No overcrowding was discovered on any boat, although on a report received, one boat was watched for and boarded, when the report was proved to be unfounded. Utensils.—These were at all times found to be in first-class condition and very clean. The pumps, bulkheads, ventilators, etc., were found invariably in good working order. 208 The amount of water stored is very small, generally about 3 galls., and the vessel holding this is replenished as opportunity offers along the line of route. Boarding.— The masters of the boats always welcome an inspection, and never place any obstacle in the way, although at times much care has to be used in getting aboard. No case of infectious disease has occurred on any of the boats, nor illness of any kind at times of my visits. Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. 58 samples of food of different kinds have been purchased, and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis during the year, 10 of which were proved to be adulterated. By directions of the Committee legal proceedings were taken in each case. Many others proved to contain different preservatives in more or less quantities, but a number was found to be of the very highest quality. The nature of sample and extent of adulteration, with results of legal proceedings are set out below— Milk.— Deficient in cream, 6.6 per cent. Defendant fined £1 and 23s. costs. Butter.— Adulterated with 64.7 per cent. of foreign fat, or of margarine, the fat of which contained 25 per cent. of butter fat. Defendant fined £9 and 20s. costs. Vinegar.— Deficient in acetic acid to the extent of 12 per cent., and containing a large number of vinegar eels. Defendant fined 10s. and 23s. costs. Butter.— Adulterated with 79.4 per cent. of foreign fat, and containing 0.5 per cent. of boric acid. Defendant fined 20s. and 12s. 6d. costs. Cocoa.— Adulterated with 47 per cent. of arrowroot and sugar as a mixture. Defendant fined £2 and 23s. costs. Butter.— Adulterated with 65.5 per cent. of foreign fat, and containing 1.8 per cent. of water in excess. Defendant fined 1s. and 23s. costs. (Nominal penalty asked for.) 209 Butter.— Adulterated with 79.8 per cent. of foreign fat, and containing 0.15 per cent.. of boric acid. Defendant fined 30s. and 23s. costs. Milk.— Deficient in cream to extent of 30 per cent. Defendant fined £3 and 23s. costs. Milk.— Deficient in cream 30 per cent., and solids, not fat, 20 per cent. Defendant fined 40s. and 23s. costs. Malt Vinegar.— Containing not more than 29 per cent. of malt vinegar. Defendant fined 20s. and 23s. costs. A sample of milk was purchased by mistake a few yards within the boundary of the Borough of Hackney. It proved to be adulterated, but no action could be taken in the matter. The Medical officer of Health of the Borough was communicated with by your directions. While out sampling one Sunday morning, I found a milkman, whom I had previously cautioned, selling milk without being registered, and without having his name and address properly inscribed on his hand can, in contravention of the Act of 1899. I reported the matter to the Committee and, by their directions, proceedings were taken against the vendor. The defendant was fined 7s. and 23s. costs, and at once applied for registration. He has since changed his address on two occasions, but has been re-registered at the proper times on each occasion. L. C. C. General Powers Acts. Ice Cream Regulations. All premises where ice cream is made or sold in the district, numbering 38, have now been placed on the register, and have received periodical visits during the year. Where necessary cleansing notices have been served, and have been promptly complied with. Itinerant vendors have been spoken ??? 210 to and made acquainted with the fact, that the name and address of the maker of the ice cream on sale must be legibly displayed on the barrow. The regulation is now fairly well understood, and little trouble is experienced in this respect with the foreigners selling the article. Public House Urinals. Useful work has been accomplished under the Act in so far as compelling brewers to provide proper doors and springs to the urinals opening on to the street, for the furthering of public decency. Public Health (London) Act. An outbreak of small-pox occurred in my district early in the year involving several persons. These were promptly discovered and successfully dealt with, and the spread of the disease prevented. Four cases of enteric fever, which were notified in the district, were thoroughly investigated, and I found that each patient, some 15 days previously had partaken freely of shell fish. The cases were afterwards enquired into by the Fishmongers' Company. Legal proceedings under the above Act had to be taken against the owner of 36, Sabbarton Street, for not complying with the Council's notices to remedy a defective drain. An abatement order (21 days) was made by the magistrate, and 30s. costs allowed the Council. The nuisance was abated in the time allowed. Smoke Nuisance—Traction Engine. Legal proceedings had also to be taken against the owner of a traction engine for allowing black smoke to be emitted all along the East India Dock Road, for some 20 minutes. The smoke was of a most offensively sulphurous nature. Great difficulty was experienced in serving the warrant owing to the owner moving about the country with his engine. The magistrate remarked that 211 this sort of thing could not be tolerated, and imposed a fine of 50s and 23s. costs, mentioning if the defendant were brought up a second time the penalty would be greater. L.C.C By-Laws. Several times I had occasion to caution the owner of a large offal collecting van, for collecting fat and other offensive material in the market during prohibited hours, and for not having his van properly covered, thereby causing offensive smells in the neighbourhood of his collection. As no regard was paid to my cautions, I was compelled to take proceedings in the Police Court upon the authority of the Committee. The defendant was fined £2 and 23s. costs, and his carman 20s., and 23s. costs. This seems to have abated the nuisance. Under the by-laws I have been successful in causing several side and rear passages to dwelling houses to be substantially paved and drained which has proved a boon to the users of such passages. Where work has been executed in contravention of the Council's or L.C.C. By-laws, I have interviewed the offending parties, and an explanation with an alteration of the work has put things straight without legal proceedings being taken.

Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, 20 applications have been made for authority to make complaint and take legal proceedings against owners in default for not complying with the Council's orders, but with the exception of one case the several nuisances were satisfactorily abated before applying for a summons. 241, East India Dock Road.—New ventilation pipe erected or constructed not in accordance with the requirements of the London County Council's By-laws, made under Section 202 of the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855. Defendant fined 20s. and 23s. costs. Under the By-laws of the London County Council, Section 16 (2), there has been no occasion to take legal proceedings, particularly in reference to removal of fish offal and other offensive matter during prohibited hours. Food and Drugs Acts. Fifty-four samples have been purchased and submitted to the Public Analyst for analysis. Two were found to be adulterated, and legal proceedings instituted by order of the Committee. A number of the samples contained various preservatives, some to a larger extent than others. The nature of samples and extent of adulteration with result of proceedings are set out below. Milk.— Deficient in solids not fat to the extent of 14 per cent. Vendor fined 20s., and 23s. costs. 216 Milk, containing a foreign ingredient, viz.:— 0.015 per cent. of formaldeheyde. Summons since withdrawn. Bakehouses. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of the bakehouses throughout my district, 17 in number, three of which are underground; the conditions in some cases have necessitated service of intimations respecting dirty walls, flooring and utensils, also accumulation of sweepings under the troughs, and the biannual limewashing not being carried out at the time specified in the Act. Cowsheds and Slaughter Houses. Five notices were received for the renewal of licenses, the premises were duly inspected, and where any infringements of the regulations were found, intimations and notices were served, and the infringements satisfactorily abated before the licenses were granted. Cowsheds 2 Slaughter Houses 3 Milk Shops and Milk Sellers. I have by your instructions made periodical inspections of the premises where milk is sold throughout the district, with the object of detecting any infringements of the regulations in respect of means of storage, prevention of contamination, registration and cleanliness; in three instances milk sellers were cautioned as to the condition of the measures, and the caution has had the desired effect. Two measures were found to be old and worn out. Intimations were served and new ones supplied. Number of milk sellers, 34. Number of milk sellers discontinued selling milk, 9. Number of milk sellers change of ownership, 10. Number of milk sellers added to register, 6. 217 Factory and Workshops. I have, by your instructions, inspected the workshops and workplaces in the district where male labour only is employed; the number of males employed in each case being checked, and any alteration found duly reported, and entered in the register kept for that purpose. Particular attention has been given to the sanitary accommodation, cleanliness, light and ventilation, in two instances the workpeople were without W. C. accommodation, one has been fixed and the other about to be fixed. Smoke Nuisances. During the past year considerably less complaints have been received with regard to the above-named nuisances, particularly in connection with Orchard Place, where most of the shafts are situated in this division. The shafts throughout the district have been kept under special observation, and when nuisances have occurred the usual notices have been served and the nuisances satisfactorily abated. More often than not the fault has been through bad stoking. On no occasion has there been cause for a summons to be taken out. Coffee Houses, Restaurants, Private Hotels, Sausage Makers, Fried Fish Shops, &c. During the past year special supervision has been given to these premises, all of which have been inspected with regard to the cleanliness, light and ventilation, and general sanitary conditions. Limewashing in nearly every case was found necessary, particulars of which have been duly reported to the Public Health and Housing Committee. The food at each premises has been examined at each visit, and there has been no cause for complaint. Ice Cream Manufacturers and Itinerant Vendors. In accordance with your instructions all the premises where ice cream is prepared have been inspected with a view of 218 detecting any infringement of Part VIII. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, also each itinerant vendor's barrow has been inspected and in each instance the manufacturer's name was found to be legibly fixed on the barrow. At the same time the utensils were examined and found to be, as far as possible, in a clean condition. Unsound Food—Shops and Stalls. The shops and stalls: in my district have been regularly inspected with a view of detecting unsound and unwholesome food, and in a few instances parcels of fish, meat and fruit after inspection were surrendered by the owners, who were in each case severely cautioned. During the year a few cases of fish, fruit and vegetables have been brought to the Public Health Office by tradespeople and costermongers, who have found on arrival home from market, that the articles were not of the same quality as the samples shown to them, and, on examination, were found to be totally unfit for the food of man. The goods were taken to Glaucus Street Depot and destroyed, certificates given, so that the purchasers were in a position to demand the return of their money. Riverside Wharves where Food is Stored, &c. There is only one wharf in the district where food (all tinned food) is shipped and landed, Concordia Wharf, Cold Harbour. These premises have been carefully inspected and kept under strict supervision during the past year, and during that time 697 tins (various sizes) of beef, mutton, salmon, rabbits, chicken and soup were found to be blown or otherwise damaged, and on examination proved to be unfit for human consumption, they were condemned by consent of the manager, who stated they were not intended for sale. Inspection of Schools and Board Schools. In accordance with your instructions, the whole of the schools in the district have been thoroughly inspected, particularly with respect to the drinking and domestic water supplies and the cleansing of cisterns and drinking utensils, and fully reported to the Committee. 219 Poplar Stations, East India Dock Road and Brunswick Street. In accordance with your instructions, the sanitary conveniences of the above stations have been inspected, the drains were tested, and in each case found to be defective. Reconstructions on modern principals, and in accordance with the London County Council's By-laws, have since taken place. Overcrowding. I am pleased to report that only five cases have occurred during the year, all being satisfactorily abated without recourse to Police Court proceedings. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JAMES BULLOCK, Assoc. San. Inst., Sanitary Inspector, Inspector tinder the Sale of Food ami Drugs Acts, and Inspector of Canal Boats. J'Sasl Combined Division. 220 Public Health Department, December 31st, 1904 To the Medical Officer of Health.

The results of these inspections have been duly entered in the Sanitary Inspector's Journal. Of the total premises inspected 746 were found to be in fair 221 condition. 49.5 per cent. required various works of sanitary improvement, which necessitated the service of 668 written intimations, 175 statutory notices, 32 final notices and one summons. 90 drains were proved defective by the smoke or chemical tests, and in 483 instances the application of these tests revealed no defects. Drains. Drain construction and reconstructions, including means of access and ventilation were carried out at the following premises : — Manchester Road, 338, 340, 342, 344, 346, 348, 350, 352, 396, 398, 400, 533, 535, 537, 539, 44, 46, 48, 50.

During the year 20 houses had been newly erected in the Poplar South Division, as under: — 9 Mellish Street. 11 Cahir Street. The sanitary arrangements were tested and examined as the work progressed. The various by-laws in force had been complied with. On your recommendation water certificates were granted by the Council. Factories. Improved and sufficient sanitary accommodation for workmen had been provided at the following factories: — Cumberland Oil Mills, Wharf Road. Messrs. Edwards and Co., Ltd., Ship Builders, West Ferry Road. Smoke. Observations have been kept of the factory chimney shafts in this Division, 28 written intimations and five statutory notices have been served requiring the abatement of smoke nuisances. Patent smoke preventing appliances have been attached to the furnaces at the following works: — Messrs Owen, Parry and Co., Ltd., Oil Mills, Factory place, Wharf Road. Workshops. One infringement of the Workshop's Act has come under my observation, the premises inspected not being in a clean condition. The nuisance was abated on the service of a written intimation. 223 Public Health Prosecution. Improper Drain Repair. On the 17th November last the owner of 30, Marshfield Street, Cubitt Town, was fined £2 and £1 3s. costs for causing the drain at the said premises to be so repaired as to be a nuisance and injurious to health. While inspecting work at the adjoining premises No. 29, Marshfield Street, I noticed the ground appeared to have been recently disturbed above the course of the drain—which was then obstructed. This led to further enquiries being made, when it was ascertained that certain drain repairs had been executed and covered in. With the Public Health Committee's authorisation the drain was re-exposed for your examination, when defective work was revealed. At the Police Court it was proved that the work had been done by an unskilled labourer with the knowledge and by the direction of the owner. Periodical inspections were made of the following premises, and Notices served as under:— Number of ations or Notices served. Bakehouses 10 18 Cowhouses 1 — Slaughterhouses 3 1 Tripe dressers and sausage makers 4 2 Dairies and Milkshops 25 5 Ice cream vendors 35 8 Coffee shops, restaurants, and dining rooms 38 57 Fish shops 9 6 Wharves.

Sir,— I beg to present to you my fifth Annual Report, which deals with the work carried out in factories, workshops, and among outworkers during the year 1904. Overcrowding. Eleven workrooms have been overcrowded, six in Bromley and five in Bow; in each case the nuisance was abated on serving an intimation. Sanitary Accommodation. The five premises reported last year for insufficient closet accommodation have completed the alterations. During the year two workshops have made suggested improvements, and one employer discharged the females. At one factory where the accommodation was very insufficient a large addition has been made. Railway Stations. I have inspected the lavatories in the ladies' wating rooms at the 12 railway stations in the Borough, and in several cases alterations and cleansing were carried out. Outworkers. The outworkers lists have been inspected at the premises from which work is given out, and 63 lists have been received from employers in the Borough. 149 lists have been forwarded from other Boroughs, containing the names of persons who live in Poplar. 124 lists have been sent to other Councils containing the names of persons who work for employers in Poplar. Legal Proceedings. I attended the Police Court in connection with legal proceedings against five employers for not sending in their outworkers' list as 227 required by the Factory and Workshop Act, Section 107, which resulted as follows: — Shirt and blouse maker, fined 20s., costs 23s. Tailor, fined 10s., costs 23s. Tailor, fined 10s., costs 23s. Tailor, summons withdrawn, costs 23s. Underclothing maker, summons withdrawn, costs 23s.

To the Medical Officer of Health. Sir,— I beg to hand you the Annual Report and detailed account of the work carried out in the Borough of Poplar, under the ByLaws for Houses let in Lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, for the year ended 31st December, 1904. During the period January to March, the work was carried out by Mr. H. J. Langley, and from April to December, the work was carried out by myself. Registration. Houses have been registered in several new areas, and there are 768 on the books up to the present. The number of houses registered during the year was 204; and re-registered 87. Constant attention is required in keeping the Journals and Registers up-to-date, owing to tenants moving frequently, and property changing hands. I am pleased to report that the clause added to the new by-laws allowed in September last, enabling a notice to be served for the recovery of declarations of information, proves very useful in the work of registration. Nuisances. At all times when nuisances came under my notice and could not be dealt with under the by-laws, the matter was reported to the inspector for the district to be dealt with under the Act, 229 In three cases notices had to be served on lodgers and tenants for keeping rabbits, pigeons and dogs, in living rooms, causing bad smells, and an insanitary state of affairs. Overcrowding. The major part of the overcrowding in the Borough, is practically confined to certain particular areas, and probably caused by the indifference of landlords, as to the number of people who live in the houses. These areas receive constant attention, and night visits are paid from time to time. In a few of the worst cases notices had to be served, and in others the nuisance was abated by a re-distribution of the beds. Many visits are paid to the Italians, and the dangers of overcrowding are impressed upon the tenants, and their attention drawn to the exact number of lodgers that may be permitted to use each room. Cleansing. The by-laws are becoming more and more known, and much cleansing is carried out, without having to serve notices, and in some areas where the by-laws were enforced for the first time, groups of houses have been cleansed throughout. The number of rooms cleansed during the year being 752, and washhouses, areas, rear walls, W.C.'s, 258, and passages, staircases and landings, 95.

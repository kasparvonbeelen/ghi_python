Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, 1 have the honour to submit my Annual Report for the year 1950. General Standard of Health. The general health of the Borough was satisfactory during the year. A decrease in the total number of notifications of compulsorily notifiable diseases occurred as compared with the previous year, the figures being 710 and 974 respectively. The decrease was most marked in relation to Measles and Scarlet Fever. Whooping Cough, however, did show an increased number of notifications. Population. The estimated population of the Borough for 1950 according to the Registrar General's statistics was 58,730, the figure for the previous year being 59,170. Vital Statistics. The number of live births registered was 983 which gave a birth rate of 16.7 per 1,000 population as compared with 17.5 for the year 1949. The death rate for the Borough was 12.3 as against 12.6 for the previous year, while that for the country as a whole is given as 11.6. The standardised rate was 13.3. The Infant Death Rate of 28.5 per 1,000 live births is considerably lower than the figure of 31.9 for the previous year and compares very favourably with the rate of 29.8 for England and Wales. The rate for the administrative County of London was 26.3. Housing. The position with regard to the provision of housing accommodation in the Borough still remains very difficult. The work of the Department in this connection is set out in detail in Section D. It is anticipated that the broad proposals in relation to the slum clearance programme will be made known in the near future and a start made to deal with the most urgent areas. Inspection and Supervision of Food. The work of the Authorities' officers in this connection is set out in detail in Section E of the report. This occasion affords an opportunity of expressing thanks to the Central Office of Information and the National Screen Service, Ltd., the local Cinema industry and the Managemen of a 6 food factory for their co-operation in the exhibition of a film entitled "Another Case of Food Poisoning" in the local cinemas and a food factory. The recommendations of the Working Party on Food Hygiene in Catering Establishments are receiving the consideration of the appropriate Government Departments. It is gratifying to read that the Working Party support the recommendation for registering all catering establishments with the appropriate local authority. It is again with pleasure that I acknowledge the sympathetic consideration shown by members of the Council in relation to all proposals having as their object the betterment of the public health of the Borough, the co-operation of officers in other Departments and the continued support given by the staff of the Public Health Department. I have the nonour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. T. Donovan, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1951. 7 SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population, estimated mid-year 58,730 Number of inhabited houses (at 31st December, 1950) 15,763 Rateable Value £438,482 General Rate 19s. 4d.

The water supply of the Borough is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory as regards quality and quantity. Bacteriological examinations and chemical analyses are carried out by the Metropolitan Water Board at frequent intervals. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. No complaint of contamination was received during the year. Notice was sent to the Metropolitan Water Board of observed waste in 137 cases. There are 7 wells in the Borough, two of which have not been in use for some years. The position as regards the remaining five wells is as follows:— Attached to Council's Public Baths 2 Attached to a local hospital 1 Supplementary supply for industrial purposes 2 During the year 448 new houses were certified as having a proper and sufficient water supply. (2) Drains and Sewers. A total of 2,614 inspections in connection with supervision of drainage works were carried out during the year. It was not found necessary to take any legal proceedings in respect of infringements of Drainage By-laws. (3) Sanitary Inspection of Area. The following figures set out in Tables 4 and 5 give a bare outline of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors during the year. 16 TABLE 4 Record of Visits Notifiable Infectious Diseases 308 Non-notifiable diseases 93 Complaints as to insanitary conditions 3,717 Food Poisoning 8 Aged and Infirm persons 22 Factories 825 Milkshops 143 Other Food premises 1,819 Outworkers* houses 232 Tenement houses 39 Common Lodging Houses 6 Drainage work 2,614 Smoke observations 3 Enquiries with regard to housing 1,022 Other inspections and special work 5,107 Slum Clearance Survey 56 Re-inspections 13,663 Total 29,677 TABLE 5 Sanitary Defects in Connection with which Notices were Served Dirty rooms 7,429 Defective drains and choked W.Cs. 602 Defective and dirty W.Cs. 1,146 Defective water supply 161 Defective paving 210 Defective gutters and rain water pipes 709 Defective roofs 1,566 Dampness 1,653 Defective dustbins 192 Other defects 7,211 Total 20,879 The work of the outdoor staff is reflected in the volume of clerical work associated with sanitary administration. During the year in addition to recording the above mentioned nuisances and defects, 2,944 Intimation Notices and 1,365 Nuisance Notices requiring the abatement of nuisances were prepared and served. In addition 2,999 letters were sent out by the department in connection with insanitary conditions and 1,226 letters appertaining to housing and various public health matters, 17 (4) Legal Proceedings. It was found necessary on 86 occasions during the year to take legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the requirements of Notices served. In 22 of these cases Abatement Orders were made by the Magistrate with the infliction of fines and costs amounting to £60 8s. Od. and in addition, in three instances, for non-compliance with Abatement Orders the Magistrate imposed fines and costs totalling £55 15s. Od. Closing Orders were made by the Magistrate in 3 cases and Costs amounting to £6 6s. Od. were awarded to the Council. Summonses were withdrawn owing to the nuisances being abated prior to the date of hearing in 57 cases, the defendants paying costs varying from £1 11s. 6d. to £2 2s. Od. The proceedings in one case were adjourned sine die. (5) Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts. During the year the number of certificates of disrepair issued to tenants was 36, and certificates of fitness were granted on application of property owners in 15 cases. (6) Swimming Baths. Samples of water were regularly taken during the year from the Council's Swimming Baths and submitted for bacteriological examination and chemical analysis. The number of samples was 11, all of which were reported to be satisfactory and the water safe for bathing purposes. (7) Factories, Workshops and Workplaces. Factories and workplaces in this Borough carrying on a variety of trades number over 1,500 and a total of 1,314 inspections were made during the year. There still exists a considerable shortage of factory premises, many of the present factories being old and unsuitable for the various types of work carried on, particularly where modern machinery has been introduced. 18 To meet the problem, occupiers of factories have extended their premises either by reconstructing old or disused parts of their premises or by constructing temporary prefabricated structures where approval has been obtained under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. It is interesting to note that where new factories have been built on sites specially zoned for industrial purposes in this Borough, the modern methods of construction have resulted in improved lighting, ventilation, heating arrangements, washing and other facilities, thereby adding to the comfort and welfare of employees. In addition to the ordinary routine inspections, a number of visits were made in regard to drainage and applications under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. The following Tables give details of work carried out under the Factories Acts, 1937 and 1948, during the year:— TABLE 6 Inspections for the Purpose of Provisions as to Health (including inspections made by Sanitary Inspectors) Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written notices Occupiers prosecuted 1.

The furniture of 215 families removing to Borough Council flats was disinfested by means of hydrocyanic acid gas by arrangement with contractors in course of transit from the previous homes, the bedding being treated by steam at the Disinfecting Station at the same time. (10) Personal Cleansing Station. During the year 40 adults and 8 children received baths, simultaneous disinfection of clothing being carried out. In addition 13 adults and 3 children received treatment for Scabies at the Station. (11) Rats and Mice. Active measures were taken during the year to deal with rat and mice infestations. 211 complaints were received during 1950, all of which were investigated and in most cases smoke tests of the drainage of the premises affected were carried out by the drainage staff under supervision of the Sanitary Inspectors. Systematic baiting and poisoning was carried out by the Rodent Operatives on 407 premises with satisfactory results. 22 On two occasions during the'year all the sewers in the Borough were baited, involving a total of 1,340 manholes. Positive results were obtained in 727 instances and it is estimated that at least 2,000 rats were poisoned. (12) Mortuary. The Council's Mortuary at St. Matthew's Row continued to serve both Shoreditch and Bethnal Green Boroughs. During the year 149 bodies were received there and 138 post-mortem examinations were made. (13) Burial of the Dead. Under Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council is required to arrange for the burial of any person who has died or been found dead in the Borough if in such cases it appears to the Council that no suitable funeral arrangement have been or are being made. It was necessary to carry out this duty on 10 occasions during the year. 23 SECTION D HOUSING Slum Clearance. Steady progress has been made with the preliminary work connected with slum clearance procedure. Areas have now been mapped out and agreement reached with the London County Council and it is hoped in the near future it will be possible to report the areas which will be dealt with by the Borough Council and the London County Council respectively. Housing Act, 1949. During the year one application for an improvement grant under the above Act was received and approved. Housing Act, 1936. Section 9. After careful consideration it was decided to apply this Section in relation to a large block of dwellings in the Borough. Appropriate action in this connection is now being taken. Demolition Orders (Housing Act, 1936).

Manufacture and sale of ice-cream 27 Storage and/or distribution 3 Sale of ice-cream (other than pre-packed) 24 Sale of ice-cream (pre-packed) 82 Total 136 In this connection 334 visits to the premises were carried out during 1950 and in 28 instances notices were served with regard to insanitary conditions in some of these premises. 66 samples were submitted to the Methylene Blue test and graded as follows:— Grade 1 6 Grade 2 26 Grade 3 11 Grade 4 23 33 (g) Food Poisoning. There were no major outbreaks of food poisoning during the year. 11 notifications were received, the illness alleged to be due to the consumption of the following foods:— Duck eggs 5 Fish 2 Rabbit 1 Ham 1 Not known 2 (h) Clean Food Campaign. The efforts of the Department in the national campaign for an improved standard of hygiene in all matters relating to the manufacture, handling, storage and distribution of food have continued throughout the year. It was possible through the courtesy of the Central Office of Information and the National Screen Service, Ltd., together with the co-operation of the local cinema managers, for a film entitled "Another case of Food Poisoning" to be shown at the cinemas throughout the Borough. In addition, the film was shown at a large food factory being preceded by a short introductory talk to the employees. During the year practically all the food premises in the Borough were visited and although it was necessary in a few instances to serve a Statutory Notice or to send a warning letter in regard to non-compliance with Section 13 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1938, it was, however, possible through the co-operative relationship between the occupiers and the Department to secure many desirable improvements without recourse to official action. In connection with the routine visiting the opportunity was taken of preparing a revised and up-to-date food premises register and in conjunction therewith a preliminary assessment was made of the hygienic condition of every establishment visited. 34 In relation to food hygiene generally the views of the Working Party on Hygiene in Catering Establishments have been published and are at the present time receiving consideration by the Central Government. Among the many recommendations of the Working Party is one to the effect that catering establishments should be required to register with the appropriate local authority. (f) Milk in Schools. The arrangements for sampling milk at L.C.C. Schools continued without variation. A total of 18 samples were submitted for examination all of which satisfied the prescribed tests. (J) Milk at Nurseries. Ten samples of milk were submitted for examination and with one exception passed the necessary tests. The one failure being in respect of a Methylene Blue test. 35 SECTION F PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS AND OTHER DISEASES The infectious diseases notifiable to the Medical Officer of Health have remained the same as in previous years although at the beginning of the year new Regulations known as the Public Health (Acute Poliomyelitis, Acute Encephalitis and Meningococcal Infection) Regulations, 1949, became operative. The regulations provided for a slightly extended scope of clinical conditions, but otherwise placed no appreciable additional burden upon the Department as the diseases concerned had all been notifiable under previous regulations. The total number of notifications received during 1950 was 710 as compared with 974 in 1949. Most of the diseases showed a decrease when compared with the figures for the previous year, the two notable exceptions being whooping cough and dysentery. There were 6 confirmed cases of Acute Poliomyelitis during the year, this figure being slightly lower than that for 1949. The arrangement whereby any variation in the original diagnosis is notified by the Hospital Authorities continued in operation during the year, and Table 16 which gives details of cases notified has again been prepared with the additional column showing the corrected figures for each disease after taking into consideration the latest information supplied by the Hospital and the elimination of all unconfirmed cases. 36 TABLE 16 Infectious Disease Disease Notifications Total notified Removed to Hospital Deaths Corrected figures 0-1 year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5-15 years 15-25 years 25-45 years 45-65 years 65years Diphtheria — 1 2 2 3 2 — — 10 10 — 1 Scarlet Fever — 3 22 40 1 1 — — 67 24 — 63 Puerperal Pyrexia — — — — 7 8 — — 15 5 — 15 Ophthalmia Neonatorum 8 — — — — — — — 8 — — 8 Erysipelas — — — 1 — 1 6 5 13 5 — 13 Meningococcal Infection — — — — 1 — — — 1 1 — 1 Acute Poliomyelitis 3 — 3 2 — — — 8 7 — 6 Acute Pneumonia 2 — 6 — 3 5 9 4 29 7 — 29 Dysentery 1 4 7 1 1 2 1 1 18 4 — 15 Measles 16 25 107 90 1 — — — 239 12 — 237 Whooping Cough 17 26 83 77 1 1 — — 205 27 „— 202 Scabies — 1 1 2 2 3 1 1 11 — — 11 Pulmonary Tuberculosis 2 1 4 6 32 25 7 2 79 — 18 — Other forms of Tuberculosis — — 3 1 1 2 — — 7 — 2 — Total 49 61 238 222 53 50 24 13 710 102 20 601 37 Diphtheria. Ten cases of Diphtheria were notified during the year as compared with 38 in the previous year. In one case only was the diagnosis confirmed, this being a child who had not been immunised. Cancer. The number of deaths certified as being due to cancer was 130 (69 male and 61 female), as compared with a total of 150 cases (81 male and 69 female) in 1949. Tuberculosis. During the year formal notifications under the Regulations were received in respect of 79 cases of respiratory tuberculosis and 7 non-respiratory cases. The following table gives details of the age and sex incidence of these cases.

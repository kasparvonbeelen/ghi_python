May, 1958. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Madam, Ladles and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1957. Statistics. The Registrar General's estimate of the population at mid-year was 50,940 as compared with the previous year's figure of 52,280. The death rate was 11.3 as compared with 10.7 for 1956. The birth rate was 15.7 as compared with 17.3 for 1956. The infant mortality rate was 12.5 as compared with 24.0 for 1956. Sanitary Circumstances. 17,344 visits were made to premises in the Borough and the 4,582 sanitary defects found resulted in the service of 1,162 intimation notices and 44.3 nuisance notices. Legal proceedings were necessary in 39 instances. Staff. Since February, 1957. the Public Health Department was three short of its establishment of nine Public Health Inspectors. This had its repercussions on the work of the Department in that it was not possible to maintain adequately the sanitary supervision of the Borough. Details of the work of the Public Health Department is given in the report which follows and the Divisional Medical Officer, Dr. G.O. Mitchell, has again kindly supplied me with some particulars of the personal health services which are administered by the London County Council. I am pleased to have this opportunity of thanking Councillor Mr. A. Stocks, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and the Members of the Committee for their help and encouragement during the year, I am also most grateful to my colleagues in other -6- departments for their willing assistance at all times and my particular thanks are due to Mr. F.C. Sharpe, Senior Public Health Inspector, Mr. J.E. Pestell, Chief Clerk, and all the other members of the staff of the Public Health Department for their loyal assistance and support. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, S.A. BOYD, Medical Officer of Health -7- SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population, estimated mid-year 50,940 Number of Dwellings 15,165 Rateable Value £647,872 General Rate 19s. 8d. Sum represented by a penny rate £2,554 EXTRACTS FROM VITAL STATISTICS FOR THE YEAR Males Females Total Live Births: Legitimate 397 357 754 Illegitimate 23 25 48 Rate per 1,000 estimated population 15.7 Stillbirths: Legitimate 7 11 18 Illegitimate - - - Rate per 1,000 total (live and still) births 16.1 Deaths Death Rate per 1,000 estimated population 11.3 Deaths of Infants under one year of age - Legitimate 4 5 9 Illegitimate 1 - 1 Death Rate of Infants under one year of age - All infants per 1,000 live births 12.5 Legitimate infants per 1,000 legitimate live births 23.9 Illegitimate infants per 1,000 illegitimate live births 20.8 During 1957, the population showed a natural increase of 225, that is there were 225 more births than deaths, but in spite of this the Registrar General estimated that the number of persons resident in the Borough was 1,340 less than in the previous year, showing that some fifteen hundred persons had been rehoused outside the Borough or left for other reasons. -8- The death rate was 11.3 per 1,000 persons as compared with a rate of 10,7 for 1956. Both births and deaths depend to some extent on the proportions of young and old people and of males and females in the area, and in order to make comparisons between one area and another the Registrar General gives Area Comparability Factors which take into account these variations in age and sex. Using this factor the adjusted death rate for Bethnal Green would be 11.5 which is the same as for England and Wales. The birth rate during 1957 was 15.7 as compared with 17.3 during the previous year. The adjusted rate for comparison with other areas is 14.5 as compared with 16.1 for England and Wales. The infant mortality rate was 12.5 as compared with the rate of 23.1 for England and Wales. It is, in Bethnal Green, however, calculated on a very small number of infant deaths and is consequently subject to large variations from year to year and as an indication of child care the figure should be used with some caution. The causes of death are shown in Table 1, which follows. Notification of Births Arrangements continued in operation during the year whereby the London County Council furnished to the Borough Council a weekly return of births (including stillbirths) notified to them as the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. During the year 825 live births (423 male and 402 female) were notified and in addition there were 17 stillbirths (8 male and 9 female). These figures represent corrected totals after the addition of inward transfers and the deduction of outward transfers and the difference between these figures and those set out previously is due to the fact that births must be registered within 6 weeks and it is not uncommon for a child to be born and notified in one calendar year but not actually registered until the following year. -9- -10- TABLE 1 CAUSES OF DEATHS Causes of Death Under 1 1 to 5 5 to 15 15 to 25 25 to 45 45 to 65 65 to 75 75 and upwards Totals M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F All causes 5 5 3 - - - 4 - 12 13 92 55 88 78 90 132 294 283 1 Tuberculosis, respiratory - - - - - - - - 1 - 2 - - - 1 - 4 - 2 Tuberculosis, other - - - - - - 1 - - - - - - - - - 1 - 3 Syphilitic disease - - - - - - - - - - - - l - - 1 1 1 4 Diphtheria - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 5 Whooping Cough - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 6 Meningococcal infections - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 7 Acute Poliomyelitis - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 8 Measles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 9 Other infective and parasitic diseases - 1 - - - - 1 - - - - 1 - - - - 1 2 10 Malignant neoplasm, stomach - - - - - - - - 1 - 4 1 4 3 7 1 16 5 11 Malignant neoplasm, lung, bronchus - - - - - - - - 1 - 11 2 7 1 4 2 23 5 12 Malignant neoplasm, breast - - - - - - - - - 2 - 5 - 1 - 5 - 13 13 Malignant neoplasm, uterus - - - - - - - - - 1 - - - 2 - - - 3 14 Other malignant and lymphatic neoplasms - - - - - - 1 - - 2 13 11 8 4 9 7 31 24 15 Leukaemia, aleukaemia - - 1 - - - - - - 2 - - - - - - 1 2 16 Diabetes - - - - - - - - - - 1 1 - 2 - 2 1 5 17 Vascular lesions of nervous system - - - - - - - - 1 - 7 5 7 7 9 18 24 30 18 Coronary disease, angina - - - - - - - - 1 - 18 10 18 17 18 23 55 50 19 Hypertension with heart disease - - - - - - - - - - 1 - 1 - - 5 2 5 20 Other heart disease - - - - - - - - 1 3 1 5 1 12 6 18 9 38 21 Other circulatory disease - - - - - - - - - 1 4 1 4 5 2 8 10 15 22 Influenza - - - - - - - - - - _ 2 - - - 2 - 4 23 Pneumonia - - 1 - - - - - 2 1 5 2 6 4 3 14 17 21 24 Bronchitis - - - - - - 1 - - - 12 4 11 6 12 15 36 25 25 Other diseases of respiratory system - - - - - - - - - - - - 4 - 3 - 7 - 26 Ulcer of stomach and duodenum - - - - - - - - - - - - 6 2 2 1 8 3 27 Gastritis, enteritis and diarrhoea 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 1 28 Nephritis and nephrosis - - - - - - - - - - 1 - 1 3 2 1 4 4 29 Hyperplasia of prostate - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 3 - 3 - 30 Pregnancy, childbirth, abortion - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 31 Congenital malformations 2 - - - - - - - 1 1 - 1 1 - - - 4 2 32 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 2 4 - - - - - - - - 9 2 5 8 6 7 22 21 33 Motor vehicle accidents - - - - - - - - - - l 1 l - - 2 2 3 34 All other accidents - - 1 - - - - — 3 _ 1 _ l - 3 - 9 - 35 Suicide - - - - - - - - - - l 1 l - - - 2 1 36 Homicide and operations of war - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -11- SECTION B SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply Water for domestic purposes in the Borough is obtained in all cases from the Metropolitan Water Board.

The furniture and bedding of 259 families removing to Borough Council flats were disinfested. Personal Cleansing Station During the year, 14 adults and 1 child had baths for verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, simultaneous disinfection of clothing being carried out. In addition, 6 adults and 4 children received treatment for Scabies at the Station. Public Health Inspectors visit and advise in all cases of Scabies and in those cases where verminous conditions persistently recur. During the year the mobile bathing equipment for the cleansing, by consent, of aged persons in their own homes where the persons concerned are so enfeebled as not to be able to attend at the Personal Cleansing Station was used on thirty three occasions. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 During the year, 140 complaints of infestation by rats or mice were received and in most cases smoke tests of the drainage of the premises affected were carried out by the rodent operatives under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Four notices under section 4(1) of the Act were served. Systematic baiting and poisoning was carried out by the Rodent Operatives at 232 domestic premises and at 184 business premises, with satisfactory results. -22- In accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, all sewers under the control of the Council were baited twice during the year, involving a total of 1,310 manholes. Positive results were obtained in 713 instances. National Assistance Act, 1948 Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951,provision is made whereby a court of summary jurisdiction may make an order for the removal of ill, infirm or incapacitated persons who are not receiving proper care and attention. It was necessary to use the powers under the Act In the case of a Miss S.,aged about 82 years who was found to be aged, infirm and physically incapacitated and living in insanitary conditions. She was unable to devote to herself, and was not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. In her own interests there was no alternative but to apply for a removal order, which was granted by the Magistrate. During the year, 37 other cases were brought to the notice of the Department where aged persons were in need of attention. It was possible In a number of these to provide necessary care for these old people In their own homes and the Home Help service provided by the London County Council was again helpful in this connection. In other cases where it was not possible to make satisfactory provision in their own homes the old people were persuaded to enter a hospital or an institution. The Old People's Welfare Committee, comprising representatives of the Council and the various local organisations and social settlements, continued to provide all possible assistance to old people In the Borough by the provision of clubs, home visitation, meals-on-wheels service, chiropody service, holidays and outings, etc. Offensive Trades There are four premises in the Borough registered for the purpose of carrying on offensive trades.

Pet Animals Act, 1951 The operation of this Act is probably of more Importance in Bethnal Green than in any other London Borough on account of the Sunday morning dog market which has been held in Bethnal Green for many years and which serves both vendors and purchasers throughout the whole of the County of London and even beyond. The conditions under which all pet animals are sold have improved very much indeed since the Act was introduced. During the year 17 licences were granted in respect of shops and 50 licences in respect of stalls. 5 warning letters were sent in connection with various infringements of the Act. Clean Air Act, 1956 The appointed day for the operation of certain provisions of this Act was the 31st December, 1956. These related to the installation of furnaces, the height of chimneys, smoke control areas, research and publicity, and the making of building bye-laws. The following is a synopsis of some of these provisions:- Section 3 (Requirement that new furnaces shall be so far as practicable smokeless) requires all new furnaces to be capable of being operated continuously without emitting smoke when burning fuel of a type for which they were designed. The installation of a new furnace must be notified to the local authority. Plans and specifications for a new furnace may be submitted to the local authority for approval. 24 Section 11 (Smoke Control areas) provides that any local authority may make an order, which must be confirmed by the Minister, declaring the whole or any part of its district "a smoke control area". Subject to any stated exceptions and limitations, the emission of smoke in such an area, on any day, is an offence unless the emission was caused by the burning of an authorised fuel. Section 12 (Adaptation of fireplaces in private dwellings). If the owner or occupier of a private dwelling not being a new dwelling which is in, or will be in, a smoke control area has to incur expenditure In adapting his heating arrangements, the local authority shall repay to him at least seven-tenths of the expenditure. If it thinks fit it may in any case pay the whole or any further part of the remainder. Section 25 (Powers of local authorities as to research and publicity) gives local authorities power to undertake or contribute towards the cost of relevant investigations and research. It further empowers them to conduct publicity and educational work by lectures, exhibitions, films, displays and the like, and to prepare or contribute towards the cost of preparation of the material required for this work. Atmospheric Pollution A station for the monthly measurement of deposited matter and of sulphur dioxide is installed on the roof of a building at one of the Council's Depots. The apparatus used is in two parts, one instrument being a deposit gauge for the measurement of ash and grit, etc., In the atmosphere and the other a lead peroxide instrument by which the amount of sulphur dioxide is measured. In addition, a second station for recording the daily measurement of pollution by sulphur dioxide and of smoke is Installed at the Town Hall. The results obtained from the instruments at the two stations are communicated to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Hairdressers and Barbers Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, requires the registration of premises and the persons carrying on the business of hairdressers or barbers thereat.

Preservatives in Food The routine practice under which all samples of milk, butter, margarine and cheese submitted to the Public Analyst, are examined for the presence of a preservative was continued throughout the year and in no instance was a preservative found to be present. Ice Cream During the year, 4 applications for registration for the sale of ice cream were approved and 9 premises were removed from the register upon ceasing the sale of ice cream. Two applications were refused on the grounds that potatoes and other dusty root crops were sold at the premises concerned. One of these was later registered upon ceasing the sale of root crops. 37 At the end of the year there were 157 registered premises in the Borough, 151 inspections of these premises were made during the year and in 26 instances notices were served concerning insanitary conditions. 8 samples of ice cream were submitted to the Methylene Blue test and graded as follows:- Grade 1 2 Grade 2 3 Grade 3 2 Grade 4 1 The samples of ice cream Graded 3 and 4 were from the same manufacturer in the Borough whose premises and equipment were of a good standard.

Milk in Schools The arrangements for sampling milk at London County Council Schools continued without variation. A total of 19 samples were submitted for examination, all of which satisfied the prescribed tests. 38 SECTION E PREVALENCE OF, AND CONTROL OVER, INFECTIOUS DISEASE The total number of notifications of infectious disease, excluding Food Poisoning, during 1957 was 1,077. as compared with 514 in 1956. The increase was again due to the greater number of cases of measles. Measles accounted for nearly 73% of all notifications. Eight notifications of poliomyelitis were received during the year and in five cases the diagnosis was confirmed, all of these being non-paralytic. An outbreak of Dysentery occurred at a Primary School during the year. This appeared to have started explosively during the week in which children returned to school after the Easter holidays. In the first two days there were fifty cases and by the end of the first week the total had reached 101. In view of the very quick spread of infection it was decided to exclude from school all cases showing definite symptoms until a negative faeces specimen had been received following a symptom-free period of one week. Of 150 cases with symptoms, 108 proved positive and of this total 21 were negative on cessation of the symptoms; 44 were clear of the organism within two weeks of the cessation of the symptoms and a further 12 within three weeks. Of the 23 cases where the organism persisted beyond three weeks, twelve were clear in four weeks, a further nine in five weeks, and the remaining two produced their last positive specimens in the sixth week after symptoms had ceased. Four children were admitted to hospital but generally the illness was mild. A detailed examination of the School was carried out and it was found that some of the w.c.'s were in an unsatisfactory condition and that there was a lack of proper handwashing facilities for the children. During the year 19 visits were made to 10 indirect contacts of two cases of Smallpox which occurred in other Boroughs. Eight of these contacts and seven other members of their families were vaccinated by the Medical Officer of Health. Two of the contacts being vaccinated at the hospital where they were employed. Information concerning these cases of Smallpox was transmitted to all local medical practitioners. 39 The number of cases of other diseases notified is shown in Table 10 which follows, and requires no special comment. The arrangement whereby any variation in the original diagnosis is notified by the Hospital Authorities continued in operation during the year, and Table 10, which gives details of cases notified, has again been prepared with a column showing the corrected figures for each disease after taking into consideration the latest information supplied by hospitals. 40 TABLE 10 INFECTIOUS DISEASE DISEASE NOTIFICATIONS Total Notified Corrected Figure Removed to Hospital Under 1 year 1-2 years 3 - 4 years 5-14 years 15-24 years 25-44 years 45-64 years 65 and upwards Diphtheria - . - - 1 1 - - 1 - 1 Scarlet Fever 1 4 4 17 - - - _ 26 25 5 Puerperal Pyrexia - - — - - - - - - - Ophthalmia Neonatorum — - - - - - - - - - - Erysipelas - - - 1 1 1 - — 3 3 1 Meningococcal Infection 2 - - - - - - - 2 2 2 Acute Encephalitis - - - - - - - - - - - Acute Poliomyelitis - - 2 5 - 1 - - 8 5 8 Acute Pneumonia 1 - - 2 1 3 6 2 15 15 5 Paratyphoid "B" _ - — - - — - - - - - Dysentery 5 15 15 57 3 9 3 1 108 106 13 Measles 33 193 264 293 1 - 1 - 785 784 93 Whooping Cough 7 20 18 24 1 - 1 - 71 71 21 Scabies - - 1 2 5 5 2 - 15 15 - Pulmonary Tuberculosis - - - 3 3 18 12 5 41 41 - Meninges and C.N.S. - - - - - - - - - - - Other forms - - - - 1 1 - - 2 2 TOTALS 49 232 304 404 16 39 25 8 1077 1069 149 There was one case of Malaria contracted abroad. 41 Tuberculosis During the year formal notifications (corrected) under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1952, were received in respect of 41 cases of respiratory tuberculosis and 7 non-respiratory eases, as compared with 60 and 4 cases respective for the previous year.

BET 78 REPORT THE HEALTH OF B E T H N A L GREEN, BY THOMAS SAEYIS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. YEAR 1864. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY, BV J. S. FORSAITH, 118, BETENAL GREEN ROAD, N.E 1865. REPORT ON THE HEALTH OF BETHNAL GREEN, BY THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., Medical Office Of Health. YEAR 1864. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY, BY J. S. FORSAITH, 118, BETHNAL GREEN ROAD, N.E. 1865. REPORT. July, 1865. In consequence of the death of the Medical Officer of Health, no Annual Report was made in Bethnal Green for the year 1863; and as it is usual to compare the Sanitary Statistics of one year with those of another, I am under the necessity of doing so with the year for which the last Report was made, viz., 1862. During the past year, there was an increase in the Deaths registered in this District, the numbers being as follows:— 1864, 3050; 1862, 2537; increase 513. Although the Deaths, from all causes, were in excess of former years, I am happy to inform you that those from Zymotic Disease did not increase in the same ratio, as will appear by the table below:— Fever 1864—137 1862—156 Small Pox „ 16 „ 16 Measles „ 174 „ 167 Scarlatina „ 138 „ 173 Diptheria „ 12 „ 10 Diarrhœa „ 131 „ 71 Whooping Cough „ 117 „ 88 725 690 It will be seen that the Deaths from Zymotic Disease in 1864 were 23.8 per cent on the total number of Deaths, 3050; and in 1862, were 27.2 per cent. on the total of 2537. These figures show that our efforts to improve the 4 Health of the District have been successful, and give us reason to hope that, by continuing our exertions, we may decrease our Death rate, and eventually bring it to a much more healthy standard than the present. The population of Bethnal Green has greatly increased during the last two years, and may be estimated as follows: As per Census of 1861 105,101 Natural increase 5,139 Immigration over Emigration 3,000 113,240 which I believe to be below rather than above the actual number, as, owing to the demolition of houses in neighbouring parishes to make room for railways, a large influx of persons has taken place into our own, and has aggravated the greatest evil with which we have to contend, and that is overcrowding. The parish—always full—is now filled to excess, although a large number of dwellings have been recently erected. Houses, even if in a bad condition, are sure to find occupants; and as there is great difficulty in procuring house-room, the tenants endeavour to conceal their sanitary wants, fearing that they will be compelled to remove while the needful improvements are being made. The extensive Railway Works now in progress in this Parish will necessarily lead to the destruction of a great number of houses, and will, I fear, aggravate the existing evils of over-crowding, and materially increase our Death rate, unless some steps be taken to provide habitations for those who will be expelled from their homes; otherwise, we may have such an increased rate of mortality as will counterbalance the benefits of the improvement in our sanitary condition. 5 The Deaths for the whole of London in 1862 were 23.5 per 1000; for Bethnal Green, they were 23.8 per 1000, that is, 1 person died of every 42 living, 1 death in 3.6 being from Zymotic Disease. In 1864, the Deaths for the whole of London were 26.45 per 1000; and for Bethnal Green, 27 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 37 living, 1 death in 4.2 being from Zymotic Disease. This shows our Death rate to be above that of the average for the whole of London. It was not only in Bethnal Green that an excess of mortality prevailed in 1864, as the following table, issued by the Registrar General, shows:— Kensington 1862—4097 1864—4905 Increase—808 Westminster „ 1704 „ 2127 „ 423 Pancras „ 4536 „ 5419 „ 883 Islington „ 3496 „ 4560 „ 1064 Hackney „ 1753 „ 2143 „ 390 Shoreditch „ 3327 „ 3620 „ 293 Whitechapel „ 2574 „ 2785 „ 211 Poplar „ 2053 „ 2791 „ 738 Lambeth „ 3773 „ 4241 „ 468 Greenwich „ 3129 „ 4032 „ 903 Lewisham „ 1126 „ 1418 „ 292 Thus we see that other Districts suffered in a greater degree than our own, and that a less healthy condition existed during this period than heretofore. The Births registered during the year 1864 were—Boys, 2308; Girls, 2189; total 4497, being one birth to every 25 persons living in 1864, against one in 26 persons living in 1862. For the whole of London, the rate was, 1864,—1 in 23, and in 1862,—1 in 29. 6 This shows our Birth rate to be above the average of the whole of London for both years, and is one of the proofs that the estimate of 113,000 is not too high for our population in 1864. PAUPER ILLNESS. The return for the Workhouse comprises all the new cases that have occurred in that establishment during the year; but, with respect to the Districts, I have prepared a return for the last quarter of the year only, as additional Medical Officers have been appointed, and various alterations have been made in the Districts assigned to them. As it was at Michaelmas that the appointments referred to were made, I thought it desirable to furnish a return for the last quarter only, to avoid the risk of confusion between the old and new Districts. QUEEN ADELAIDE'S DISPENSARY.

In company with the Sanitary Inspector, I have visited 54 Slaughter Houses and 49 Cow Houses. They were generally in a satisfactory condition, and in the few cases where improvements were needed, my suggestions were willingly carried out. SANITARY MISCELLANIA. The return under the above heading is in all Districts made by the Chief Sanitary Inspector; but it has not been made in this parish for the past year, owing to the change of Officers. Since Mr. Christie's appointment, however, the work done has been much greater than formerly. In the first quarter of the year 1865, there were in this parish 1271 Births and 766 Deaths, particulars of which will be given in our next Annual Report. 9 TABLE 1. DISTRICTS.

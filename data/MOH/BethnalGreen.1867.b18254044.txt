THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, by forsaith and son, bethnal green road, n.e. 1868. - REPORT. July, 1868. Gentlemen,— It is with infinite pleasure I have to report that there has been a great diminution in the rate of Mortality in this District during the past year. The Deaths from all causes were—3823 in 1866, against 2776 in 1867: shewing a decrease of no less than 1047. This decrease is chiefly noticeable among the Zymotic Diseases, which were registered as follows:— 1866. 1867. Fever 125 88 Small Pox 155 65 Measles 91 46 Scarlatina 99 40 Diphtheria 12 10 Diarrhœa 182 129 Cholera 612 7 Whooping Cough 169 123 1445 508 Decrease 937 Thus we see that the Deaths were fewer in all Diseases of the Zymotic class. This was specially marked in our dire enemy "Cholera," where the fatal cases fell from 612 in 1866, to 7 in 1867, and even these were not of the Asiatic type, but such as ordinarily occur in the summer months, and should in reality have been registered "Severe Diarrhœa," as the term "Choleraic Diarrhœa," though often used, has a different signification given to it by different members of the medical profession, and no distinct and acknowledged train of symptoms is accepted by the profession at large. The next greatest decrease was shown in Small Pox, which fell from 155 to 65; Fever also fell from 125 to 88; Scarlatina fell from 99 to 40; Measles fell from 91 to 46; Diphtheria from 12 to 10; Diarrhœa from 182 to 129; and Whooping Cough from 169 to 4 123—making in all a total decrease of 937 cases. Looking at these facts, we cannot but feel that the measures taken to improve the sanitary condition of the District have been successful, and have resulted in a most marked and satisfactory improvement in the health of the inhabitants. POPULATION. The population of Bethnal Green has now reached nearly 120,000, and we have no more house-room than heretofore. The consequence is, that overcrowding is as great as ever; and although the Public Health Act of 1866 was framed to obviate this great evil, it is practically unworkable, owing mainly to high rents (which in some cases have increased as much as 50 per cent.)—dearness of provisions—scarcity of employment—and the imposition of taxes for the first time upon the tenant; and many families who could ordinarily afford to occupy a whole house, have been obliged to let lodgings; others, who have occupied two rooms, have been obliged to put up with one; and where overcrowding has existed, and the law enforced, the people have merely removed to other houses, and thus perpetuated the evil which it was the intention of the Legislature to obviate. The average Deaths for the whole of London in 1866 was 26.4 per 1000, or one person died of every 37.9 living. For Bethnal Green there were 32.9 per 1000, or one person died of every 30.4 living, one death in 2.8 being from Zymotic Diseases. In 1867 the average deaths for the whole of London was 23 per 1000, or one person died of every 43 living. For Bethnal Green they were exactly the same, one death in 5.4 being from Zymotic Disease. This is only reiterating what I have said before, that there is a great improvement in the general health of the District, as evidenced by the smallness of the number of deaths from Zymotic Diseases. The Births registered in Bethnal Green in 1867 were—Boys, 2631; Girls, 2478: total, 5109—being 1 birth to every 23 persons living in 1867, against 1 birth to every 24.1 persons living in 1866. For the whole of London the rate was in 1867, 1 birth to every 27 persons living. For 1866 it was 1 to every 28.1 persons living; so that our birth-rate was a little above the average for the whole of London. 5 PAUPER ILLNESS. The following is the number of new cases attended during the year by the District Medical Officers:— District No. 1 Mr. Massingham 1623 Cases. ,, 2 Mr. Defriez 987 „ „ 3 Dr. Burgess 953 „ „ 4 Dr. Richards 2103 „ „ 5 Dr. Welch 1861 „ „ 6 Dr. Lyel 718 „ „ 7 Dr. Brotherton 1084 „ Total 9329 Cases. The very able Report of Mr. Smart, which I give herewith, supersedes the necessity of my giving any statistics in relation to the Workhouse:— In presenting my Annual Infirmary Report in connection with this House, I am happy to state that we have been, and are at the present time, free from any Epidemic. The number of admissions to the Sick Wards has been less than in 1866, but their character has been of a more Chronic type, hence we have an increased number on the list at the present time; it is to the gradual augmentation of these cases (e.g., the Aged and Infirm), that I attribute the necessity for so large a provision for the sick in our Parish; and from careful observation of some years, I fear we must look forward to a still further increase. To take the last three years as bearing out this view, I find on January 1st, 1866, the number in the Medical Relief Book was 425; 1st January, 1867, 478; and 1st January, 1868, 524. Of the 478 cases on the 1st January, 1867, 269 have been discharged cured, or materially relieved; 73 have died; and 136 still remain, many of whom have been for a long period patients, the length of time varying from 1 to 14 years. The number of New Cases admitted to the Infirmary since the 1st January, 1867, has been 1966, the Diseases for which they were admitted being as follows:— Infirm 186 Phthisis 128 Chronic Rheumatism 96 Acute ditto 21 Bronchitis 46 Chronic Ulcers 92 Asthma 67 Skin Diseases 320 Abscess 53 Paralysis 30 Pertussis 21 Erysipelas 20 Contusions 25 Syphilis 40 Diseased Heart 15 Varicella 15 Anasarca 20 Catarrh 79 Carbuncle 5 Cynanche 19 Diarrhœa 72 Dropsy (Ascites) 9 Puerperal-Peritonitis 4 Diseased Hip 2 Debility 213 Pneumonia 12 Apoplexy 5 Seirrhus 4 Hernia 5 Convulsions 9 Marasmus 26 Chorea 2 Ophthalmia 90 Epilepsy 17 Febricula 24 Serofula 4 Variola 3 Rubeola 8 Delirium Tremens 2 Febris 10 Ague 2 Senile Gangrene 2 Diseased Kidneys 5 Jaundice 2 Intussusception of the Bowels 2 Urticaria 2 Fractured Arm 2 Do.

The age, length of time in the Infirmary, and cause of death, will be seen in the appended Tables:— Infirmities of Age 62 Scirrhus 4 Sloughing Ulcers 1 Asthma 21 Senile Gangrene 2 Convulsions 5 Bronchitis 10 Abscess, Hip 1 Marasmus 10 Phthisis 72 Do., Chronic 1 Premature Birth 6 Pneumonia 8 Diseased Kidneys 5 Childbirth 1 Disease of the Heart 6 Jaundice 3 Pertussis 8 Do. of Liver 9 Pleurisy 1 Cancer of Mouth 1 Paralysis 12 Puerperal Peritonitis 1 Intussusception of the Bowels 2 Apoplexy, Serous 3 Low Fever 3 Do., Sanguineous 8 Epilepsy 1 Dying on Admission 6 Acute Rheumatism 2 Diarrhœa 4 —- Chronic do. 2 Softening of Brain 1 286 Erysipelas 3 Delirium Tremens 1 Ages at Death.

Births.—During the year 123 births have taken place, viz.:—64 Males, and 58 Females; of these 52 were legitimate, while 71 were illegitimate. Comparing these figures with those of former years, it will be observed what a gradual and steady increase has taken place: thus, in 1853, the total number of births was 30; 1856, 53; 1859, 56; 1862, 68; 1865, 100; and in 1867, 123; shewing an advance in the past 14 years from 30 to 123. Vaccination.—Only 30 children, born in the House, have been rendered safe from the ravages of Small Pox by Vaccination, a number very small when compared with the number of births. This is to be accounted for, however, in the fact of so many mothers taking their discharge before the children are one month old. 8 Ten cases of Fever have been sent to the Fever Hospital, 5 Males and 5 Females; two cases of Small Pox to the Small Pox Hospital, 1 Male and 1 Female; one has been treated at the Workhouse, the Hospital being full. About 9 Tramps from the Casual Wards have been admitted by my orders to the Infirmary, being unable from illness to proceed on their journey. One died; the others, after a short stay, recovered and took their discharge. Not one, as far as I could gather, became located as permanent paupers. Inquests.— Eight inquests have been held upon Aged Inmates of the House, and one upon a New-born Infant found in Victoria Park. The case of Rosomond was the only one that called for any special remark. Insane and Imbecile.— During the year 168 cases have been under Medical Superintendence. Of that number, 42 Males and 49 Females were admitted under orders from the Relieving Officers; 18 Males and 20 Females were sent from the House, several of them only for a short time, suffering from Epilepsy; 17 Males and 25 Females have been sent to Asylums, 33 have been discharged cured or greatly relieved, 21 have died (most of them old Paralytic cases), leaving 90 of a harmless character under medical care. Total Cases. Sent to Asylums. Cured, or Relieved. Died. Remaining. Summary 186 42 *33 21 90 * It should be observed that many of these cases were sent in as Insane, and on examination no disease could be detected; but as a matter of precaution, they were kept a few days. The paid Attendants on the Insane have been found to have a very beneficial effect, and the various means found so useful for the alleviation of this class of our fellowsufferers have been taken advantage of. Periodicals are regularly supplied; in-door amusements enliven the wards; regular out-door exercise, and the introduction of a more liberal dietary, &c., have all tended to improve the general appearance of the patients, and stamps it as the wisest and most humane treatment. In concluding, I would strongly urge the careful consideration of the large increase in the admissions as bearing strongly on the subject that must soon occupy the attention of the Guardians, viz., the new Infirmary, as authorized under the recent Act. It must be borne in mind that this increase is not by any means solely among the aged and infirm, but the Lying-in Department requires a special arrangement, as being that from which, by bad construction, a vast amount of mischief may easily arise. Speculation is always rife as to when the limit of extension has arrived; this is a subject that statistics do not appear to give us any conclusive idea of, as from the foregoing tables it would appear to have gone on steadily, and is still going on. I would, therefore, again urge that provision be made, so that, if necessary, an easy extension might be available. January, 1868.

With regard to this subject, I cannot do better than insert my Report, presented to you prior to Licensing Day:— The notices of intended applications for Cow-house Licences are 40, and for Slaughterhouses 49. All the premises have been visited by myself (T. S.) and the Sanitary Inspector. I may say, that most of them are too near dwelling-houses; but having due regard to vested interests, I shall not (with one exception) advise any opposition to the renewal of their licences; and as to any sanitary defects, they will be attended to in the ordinary manner. The case to which I beg to call your attention is that of a Cow-house attached to a chandler's shop, situated at the corner of Hinton Street and Somerford Streets, and formerly licensed to William Tame, who has fallen into misfortune through ill health, has left his business, and has been succeeded by John Bailey, a neighbouring cow-keeper. The locality is over crowded, the Cow-house is very small, has a dwelling room above it, and there is no drain or dung pit. I bring these defects to your notice, knowing that you will give them your consideration, and determine as to the best course to be pursued. I also wish to draw your attention to two Slaughter-houses that have been licensed for many years, and to three new applications. One, licensed to Samuel Downs, is situated at 4, Essex Street, Three Colt Lane, and is ostensibly used for killing; but of late has been converted into an extensive piggery, and there are always a number of pigs on the premises. Upon my last visit (on the 1st inst.) there were nearly forty. I wish also to mention the Slaughter-house in Essex street, licensed to Mr. John Long, who resides at Bow, and sub-lets it to Charles Geary, who is now suffering three months' imprisonment at the suit of the Vestry. It is not now, however, used as a Slaughter-house, but for a still more objectionable business—that of preparing skins for sausages. Mr. Charles Stevenson, of 14, Patriot Eow, applies for a licence. He is an old inhabitant, has been licensed as a cow-keeper for many years, and the premises are large and some distance from dwelling-houses. I see no objection to granting the licence; but as Mr. Stevenson persists in keeping pigs, I fear it will be as is the case with Samuel Downs, and that it will be made a piggery instead of a killing-place only. Mr. Elves, of Nelson Street, Boundary Street, applies for a licence for premises at the side of his dwelling house. This is a densely populated locality, inhabitated by the poorest classes, and the premises sought to be licensed are of small size, 17 ft. long, 7 ft. wide, and 9 ft. high, and lie between two houses. This is very objectionable. Mr. John Turner applies for a licence; he obtained one last year without due notice, He kills in an uncovered yard, has a small supply of water, and the drainage is not fit for the purpose ; besides which, it is very near dwelling-houses. Upon the consideration, by the Sanitary Committee, of the foregoing Report, it was resolved to oppose the applications of Mr. John Bailey for a renewal of the licence for a Cow-house in Somerford Street, and of 11 Mr. John Long, of Essex Street, Cambridge Road, for a renewal of his Slaughter-house licence; Charles Stevenson's application for a licence for a Slaughter-house; Mr. Elves' application for a licence for a Slaughterhouse in Nelson Street, Boundary Street; and Mr. Turner's application for a Slaughter-house licence for 6, Barnet Street. The result was that the licences were refused in all the cases, with the exception of Mr. Stevenson's. The number of Licensed Cow-houses is 39, viz.:— Boakes, William 12, Barnet Street. Brace, Edmund Oval, Hackney Road. Brown, Joshua 3, Birdcage Walk. Brown, John 35, Lisbon Street. Busby, John 17, Coventry Street. Castell, George 276, Bethnal Green Road.

There is great neglect in both of these Departments, especially in the Dusting, as is evidenced by the Complaint Book; and I am sorry to say that it is a common thing for the Contractors to report that they have removed dust, when in fact they have done nothing of the kind, as is shewn by the overflowing dust-bins. Of course such conduct is highly reprehensible, and some alteration should be made to remedy this evil. 14 SANITARY MISCELLANEA. The Reports of the three Sanitary Inspectors, Mr. Christie, Mr. J. W.

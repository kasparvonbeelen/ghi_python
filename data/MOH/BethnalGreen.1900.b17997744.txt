BET 6 METROPOLITAN Borough of Bethnal Green. the CHIEF INSPECTORS ANNUAL REPORT on the work of the SANITARY DEPARTMENT for The Year ending December, 1900. Ordered by the Sanitary Committee to be Printed and Circulated, February, 1901. JOSEPH NORRIS, Esq., Chairman. LONDON: J. S. Forsaith & Son, 329, Bethnal Green Road, N.E. 1901. THE CHIEF INSPECTORS ANNUAL REPORT on the work of the Public Health & Sanitary Department For the Year ending December 31st, 1900. To the Chairman and Gentlemen of the Public Health and Sanitary Committee of the Metropolitan Borough Council of Bethnal Green. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I respectfully beg leave to present my fifth Annual Report on the work of your staff, and the proceedings taken in your department for the year 1900. HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTIONS. It will be within your recollection, that about a year ago I was instructed to test all drains in carrying out house to house work, and since that instruction was given the following streets have been visited, and the drains of each house tested. List of Streets visited " House-to-House" and the Drains tested from the 20th November, 1899 to 31st December, 1900. District A. Bandon Road, 18 to 26 and Quinn's Square 17 to 45 Robinson Road Cyprus Street Sewardstone Road Ellesmere Road. 32 to 82 Vyner Street, 2 to 26 Lark Row 1Wadeson Street, 7 to 33 4 District B.

Carlisle Street Pereira Street, 2 to 48 Eastman Street Buildings Pereira Street Buildings Eckersley Street Sale Street Foster Street Sclater Street, 63 to 83 Gt. Eastern Buildings, Winchester Selby Street Street Southampton Gardens Hereford Street Tavistock Street Little Collingwood Street White's Court London Street, 1 to 16 Winchester Place Mape Street Winchester Street Menotti Street York Place District D. Albert Buildings Princes Court Clarkson Street, 1 to 28 Princes Place Co-operative Buildings Queen's Buildings, Gossett Gascoigne Place Street Gibraltar Walk Queen's Buildings, Chambord Hollybush Gardens Street Linden Buildings Rook's Place Margarets Place Shacklewell Street Old Bethnal Green Road Squirries Street, 51 to 65 (South side) Virginia Road Orange Street, 3 to 65 and 501064 District E. Arline Street Queen Caroline Place Chapel Street Ravenscroft Street Diss Street Seabright Gardens Hassard Street Smith's Place Ion Square, 1 to 17 Wharf Road Old Bethnal Green Road Willow Walk (North side) It will be readily understood that this drain testing has led to an increased amount of drainage works generally, and it is satisfactory to be able to report that an enormous number of house drains have been either entirely re-constructed or amended, and that this portion of the work is progressing favourably, and on the whole as rapidly 5 as can reasonably be expected. I think there can be no two opinions that your Committee took a very practical step when they passed the resolution referred to, although at that time many members of the Vestry thought that it was a somewhat large order to test the drains of every house visited. Upwards of a year's application has, however, shown that the measure was fully justified, and that the bad results then prognosticated have not yet happened. TOTAL NUMBER OF INSPECTIONS AND CASES IN HAND. The total number of inspections made in the five districts during the year is as follows :—920 cases of infectious disease, 1,719 complaints, 2,371 house to house inspections, 366 inspections of trade premises, and 18,561 re-inspections of old cases in connection with necessary repairs and the like, which makes the total number of these inspections 23,937. The nuisances abated amounted to 3,334. The cases under notice at the end of the year amounted to 725. As a result of these visits, the following improvements were effected : — SANITARY IMPROVEMENTS, 1900.

GENERAL TOTALS, 1900. In addition to the ordinary inspections above mentioned, the following totals, which represent an enormous amount of detail work, may be of some interest:— 790 Rooms fumigated after Infectious Disease. 9836 Articles of clothing, bedding, &c., were disinfected. 165 Articles were destroyed at the Depot at the request of Owners in cases of Infectious Disease. 1282 Notices in respect of Dust receptacles were served. 1187 Dust pails were sold and delivered to various premises in the district; and the sum of £148 7s. 6d. in respect of the same paid into the Vestry's and Council's Account. 1680 Letters were written. 1939 Persons called at the Office respecting Notices, repairs and enquiries of various kinds. 89 Notices were served in respect of combined drains. 317 Notices were served on the different occupiers and the premises entered and the drains opened up for examinations, &c. 66 Notices and Letters were sent to the District Surveyors respecting dangerous structures, bulged walls, &c. 8 Dead Bodies were on Sanitary grounds removed to the Mortuary. 69 Complaints were received from H.M. Inspectors of Factories. 70 Complaints were received from the Mansion House Council. THE MORTUARY. The particulars of cases received at the Mortuary for the year are as follows : — MORTUARY RETURN from 1st January to 31st December, 1900. Number of Bodies removed by Order of Coroner 233 ,, „ ,, by Police 9 „ by Order of Sanitary Inspector 8 „ „ „ at request of Relatives 152 Total number of Bodies removed to Mortuary 402 Number of Inquests held during the year 246 Post Mortem Examinations made 114 8 COMBINED DRAINS OR SEWER WORK. The number of drain-layers and labourers employed by the department has varied during the year. The following return shows the total expenditure in both labour and material, the premises drained, and the cost of each job. The total expenditure for the year amounts to £1,504 17s. 2d. From this gross total must, however, be deducted the sum of £2 105., recovered from owners of property for removing stoppages from drains, for which this Authority was not liable, and the sum of £102 9s. 7d. for re-laying and repairing the branch and other parts of drainage works, for which the owners were rightly liable. Deducting these two sums, which together amount to £ 104 19s. 7d., it will be seen that the total cost to the ratepayers has been £ 1,399 17s. 7d.

The chimney shafts of the various factories have been kept under observation throughout the year, and although there has been no occasion for legal proceedings to be taken, it has been found necessary to serve 40 Intimation and 29 Statutory Notices. Generally there is a great improvement in this respect, but I regret to add that in order to maintain this improvement it is necessary to employ an officer almost entirely at keeping observation. At certain of the factories they appear to watch the inspector almost as closely as he watches their chimneys, for almost as soon as he is out of sight the emission of black smoke recommences from time to time. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. During the year five houses were certified by Dr. Bate, under Part II. of this Act, as unfit for human habitation. These were Nos. 37, 39, 41, 43 and 45, Bacon Street. Immediately on the service of the notices the owner of No. 45 proceeded to repair, with the result that no Closing Order was applied for in respect of that 12 house. As regards the other four, summonses were issued and Orders made to close on the 31st of May. It was, however, some considerable time after this that the premises were finally closed, and not until several of the tenants had been summoned to Worship Street. Twelve summonses were issued, and several fines imposed before the Orders to close were completely enforced. These cases serve to further illustrate the difficulty experienced by Sanitary Authorities in getting insanitary property actually vacated, even when magistrates' Orders have been made, as well as the hardships that have to be inflicted on the poor wretched tenants, who are forced by circumstances to occupy such miserable places, and to which they cling with the desperation of despair, simply because there is nothing else provided within their means. No one apparently cares to house the poorest class of workers, and it is most remarkable that whilst all classes of opinion have for months, aye for years, been holding Meetings, Conferences, and passing endless resolutions, and have all apparently agreed on the point that something must be done, yet the hard solid fact remains that for the thousands of casual workers, dock-labourers and others, of what may be termed the class of worker earning the lowest and most precarious wage, the housing accommodation is becoming year by year more restricted, and ever farther beyond their miserable means. Factory and Trade Premises, Street Improvements, Housing Schemes (as yet carried out), and other similar undertakings all tend to further press the slum dweller farther under foot, and to place anything in the shape of decent accommodation further beyond his means, by curtailing existing accommodation of the class he requires, and so enhancing the already famine prices he has too long been compelled to pay. Probably Sanitary Officers see more of the evils caused by overcrowding, and what is termed the Housing Question, than any other body of men, and to them, at all events, it passes comprehension that in a question of this importance, and where every shade of opinion appears to be as one, the Legislature has not yet provided some efficient, speedy and simple machinery for dealing with the matter. 13 MARKETS AND UNSOUND FOOD. The legal proceedings taken under Section 47 of the Public Health (London) Act against persons depositing and offering for sale articles of unsound Food were as follows :— January 12th.—G. G. was sentenced to two months for exposing for sale a quantity of meat unfit for food. This was a very bad case ; between 2 and 3 cwt. of meat was seized, and it was the second conviction for a like offence in a few weeks. January 25th.—T. E. was fined £10 respecting unsound meat exposed for sale in Green Street. Money paid. February 8th.—S. C. and his brother S. C., both shopkeepers, were fined £10 each in respect of a number of tins of unsound salmon, sardines, and condensed milk, seized on their premises. The money was paid. May 15th.—H. C. was fined £5 in respect of a number of tins of unsound salmon and sardines, seized on his premises. The money was paid. This case was somewhat remarkable, in consequence of the magistrate refusing to make an Order to destroy all the articles seized, as in his judgment they were not sufficiently bad. The matter was reported in the Press in a manner that was far from correct, and wholly unflattering to this Authority. On this we were threatened with proceedings for illegal seizure, and I expected litigation in consequence of the entirely unforeseen action of the magistrate. The matter was all the more unsatisfactory, as there could be no reasonable doubt that all the tins of fish were decomposing to a greater or less extent, and the tins of pine-apple seized with them were in a state of fermentation, being blown up with gas. It will be readily understood that I felt in a somewhat difficult position; and whilst I was fully prepared to accept the learned magistrate's decisions on all points of law, I desired, with all proper respect and deference, to differ very considerably as to the fitness of these articles for human food. Moreover, I did not feel disposed to sit down and wait for an action for damages, and I 14 therefore submitted the articles which his worship refused to condemn to Dr. Stevenson, the Home Office expert and well known public analyst, who, after examination, certified that the sardines and salmon were quite unfit for food, and that, although the danger of eating the pine-apples was not so great, they could only have been eaten at the risk of diarrhoea or other intestinal trouble. This explanation was forwarded to the firm, who, apparently on incorrect reports in the papers, was anxious for a lawsuit; and, with the above-mentioned fine, the matter ended. June 7th.—J. S. was fined £5 and £1. costs, in respect of a number of unsound tins of salmon and sardines seized on his premises. In this case I requested Inspectors Bridel and Henley to go to West Ham and lay certain information before the officers of that Sanitary Authority. I further, for purposes of information, caused observation to be kept on certain premises in their districts ; and having ascertained that unsound goods of this character were sent out and sold by a certain firm in that district, I again corresponded with the Authority, and suggested certain action. I am unable to say with what result, as I have heard nothing further ; but I do know, that at least two consignments of unsound tinned goods, fish, &c., were sent into this district from there, and which consisted of old blown tins, pierced, re-soldered, and newly-labelled after the old ones had been removed. August 10th.—P. J. was fined £10, and £3 3s. costs, in respect of a number of stinking eggs, which were found by Inspector Richards on his premises, under circumstances which left very little doubt that they were being used for confectionery purposes. This was a bad case, aggravated by deliberate lying at the Police Court, which was completely exposed under cross-examination. Money paid. October 9th.—J. S. fined £10 and £3 3s. costs, in respect of a quantity of unsound pears exposed for sale in Brick Lane. This was another bad case, there being a previous conviction for the same offence last year in respect of cherries. Money paid. 15 October 30th.—H. G., fined £5 and £2 2S. costs, respecting unsound rabbits, some whole and some cut in pieces on dishes, marked at so much per pound, exposed for sale in Bethnal Green Road. Money paid. December 11th.—J. S. was again charged in respect of a large quantity of unsound pears, exposed for sale in Brick Lane on Sunday, November 25th. Inspector Ainley experienced great trouble in the case, and Dr. Bate and myself were sent for. In J. S.'s presence we sorted out all the unsound fruit, which we seized, and he admitted that the pears were bad, and hoped we would be very lenient with him. With the innocence of his race however, he saw before the summons was returnable that two previous convictions within a few months for a like offence was somewhat awkward, and at the hearing a defence was put in on his behalf that the fruit seized was not his, and that, in fact, he had sold it to the man whom Inspector Ainley first saw with the barrow in Brick Lane before he (J. S.) was sent for. The case was extraordinary, for amongst other things at the Court three or four witnesses all swore, in Yiddish, to this sale having taken place, though not one of them said a word about it in Brick Lane or at the Town Hall later. Moreover, at the Court they could neither of them speak or understand a word of English, although on other occasions, before and since, we have got on with business fairly well without an interpreter. The summons was dismissed ; but I did not let the matter rest there, and after a great deal of trouble I found out where the first man lived, and got a summons against him, with the result that he was fined £1 and £1 2s. costs. Money paid. In addition to these cases of Police Court proceedings there has been a large quantity of unsound food removed from stalls and places, under circumstances which did not perhaps justify summonses, but a number of vendors were cautioned that in the event of any unsound articles being again found in their possession, or deposited for sale, they would be prosecuted, and no further excuse or explanation accepted. 16 FOOD REMOVED FROM STALLS.

This quantity has been removed since the appointment of a Food and Market Inspector, and I suggest is ample justification for your making this additional appointment. I was convinced that an enormous quantity of rough stuff was being dealt in from time to time, and whilst I leave you to imagine how much of the above would have been sold to unsuspecting purchasers, I submit that making this new appointment was a step in the right direction, and one likely to have a deterrent effect on traders in food stuffs of this character. CAT AND DOG'S MEAT SUPPLIED TO MAKERS OF SAUSAGES AND THE LIKE. With the assistance and permission of your Committee I have been enabled to again get on the track of some of those persons who were prosecuted and very heavily fined about a year ago for selling and using for human food stuff that was purchased from a cat and dog's meat dealer having premises (a railway arch) in an adjacent parish. Although two fines of ^"50 each were then imposed I had reason some time since to suspect that this filthy trade had only been diverted, not in any way stopped, so far, at least, as the prime movers were concerned. After weeks of inquiry and a considerable amount of difficulty I ascertained that railway and other waggons were again delivering consignments of exactly similar parcels to those reported a year ago. Careful observation kept on the premises above-mentioned, which are situate in the district of a neighbouring authority over our southern boundary, showed that a more extensive trade than ever was being carried on. 18 For a time I was unable to get clear evidence of what was done with the stuff so delivered. Sausage manufacturers, and makers of various seductive if unwholesome relishes, seemed one and all to have deserted the place—not one of them came near, but what was more suspicious to me not a single barrow of cat's meat left the place, neither was a genuine cat's meat man seen to enter. I was about to give the matter up for a time when a lucky accident solved the mystery, and we ascertained that the stuff was removed in a most roundabout and surreptitious manner to a small private house, then in a parish over our northern boundary but now in our own district, from whence it was fetched, not by cat's meat men but by makers of sausages and other mysterious things who came from the adjoining districts. I communicated with the officers of the several authorities concerned, and placed an agent and my information at their disposal, with the result that one butcher in the Hackney district was followed home with a consignment, and as soon as it was at his shop it was seized by the sanitary officers and subsequently condemned at the North London Police Court. Legal proceedings are being taken in this case, and I hope that others whoare engaged in this horrible trade may yet be captured. What is wanted for this offence is imprisonment for all engaged in it, without the option of a fine ; and until this becomes the invariable rule the trade will not be stopped. At present I have absolutely no doubt that there is an enormous amount of filthy poisonous food (of course deeply masked with condiments) dealt in, and that regular wellestablished markets and agents exist for this purpose, and are as well known in certain circles as are the bona-fidt recognised markets. In one case the market is open, in the other it is carried on in underground channels, but just as regularly and just as well known to those who deal in it as is the other. Apathy and neglect by some authorities, under-staffing and mean parsimony in others, as well as a general want of co-operation between authorities as a whole has long since permitted this evil to become a scandal and a disgrace to London administration. Apart from all other considerations, there can be no doubt that some central authority should have charge of this matter. Take our experiences of the last three years. The 19 main depot to which this meat is consigned is within the jurisdiction of authority A. It is removed through the district of authority B, and from thence distributed into the districts of C, D, E and A. Not one single authority, or its officers, have as yet jurisdiction to deal with the matter right out from end to end. They must each stop at their respective boundaries. A, for reasons probably satisfactory to itself, is unable to act. B is desirous to act, but the depot is over their boundary, so they can only watch and inform C, D, E, and A when opportunity offers. Some act promptly, others appear huffed at the idea of anyone outside attempting to advise them, others make a muddle of what they attempt, while others, politely, perhaps, but plainly, say " go to"; the result is that this trade goes merrily on, and will continue to do so until some one authority has full power to follow it up right through. PROCEEDINGS UNDER PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT FOR THE ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES. For the removal of nuisances and insanitary conditions the following proceedings were taken :—3,257 Intimations, 1,975 Statutory Notices, and 555 Final Notices were served. Including 14 summonses, issued but not returnable last year, there has been a total of 123 summonses. These were disposed of as follows : — Withdrawn (works completed before date of hearing) 76 Orders of Abatement 10 Orders to Close 2 Orders to Pay Costs 5 Unsound Food (mentioned above) 9 Dismissed 4 Disobedience of Order 2 Returnable in 1901 15 The penalties for disobedience of the Nuisance Orders were on the owners of 42, Church Street, and 7, Type Street, and amounted respectively to—£1 is. fine and £1 2s. costs, and £1 fine and £1 3s. costs. Of the four summonses dismissed, two were in respect of 39 and 41, Old Bethnal Green Road, which were as a matter of convenience served at the owner's address instead of on the premises. A 20 technical objection was made that this was not good service. The objection was upheld, and the summonses dismissed. Under subsequent proceedings the nuisances were abated. The third was the case of J. S. (unsound pears) referred to above, and the fourth was against an occupier of 24, Summerford Street, who was summoned for not vacating the premises on an Order to Close. No owner appeared to the proceedings, and there being no person in possession to give the tenant notice the Magistrate ruled that the tenant must be served with a notice under the Public Health Act and proceedings taken against him just as in the case of " the owner" before the order could apply. These proceedings were taken and the premises subsequently closed. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS AND SAMPLES TAKEN DURING THE YEAR. Return of Samples procured during the year 1900. Article of Food.

With the exception of two samples of pepper and one of golden syrup all the adulterated samples consisted of dairy produce, milk and butter. Year after year it has to be reported that the dairy trade stands first in dishonest dealing. Margarine fraudulently sold to the working people of this district at butter prices, and milk—the food of invalids and children—diluted. A remarkable thing is that a large majority of the regular defaulters profess to be persons of Welsh extraction, and in some instances they have carried the imitation so far as to profess a difficulty in speaking our language. Whatever the reason for this may be, they most persistently carry on one of the meanest forms of cheating, and have backed it up more than once with gross perjury at the Police Court. For purposes of information, I have on various occasions (with the assistance of Inspector Mills) caused a large number of purchases beyond above samples to be made at certain of their shops, with the result that it has been ascertained beyond all doubt that it is quite immaterial what price the customer pays; he is served with a "dollop" of margarine mixture from behind the marble slab whether he asks for "a quarter of one-and-two," "two ounces of shilling," or "six ounces of eightpenny," indeed, during one Saturday afternoon and evening we obtained by means of different agents at one shop every price from "sixpenny" to "sixteen-penny salt," and each and every agent was served from the self-same place, apparently from the same tub. The same applies to the extra weight, or "dollops" as they are termed. It has often been said by the apologists of these traders, that although they sold a mixture containing no butter fat at butter prices they give extra weight, apparently implying that four ounces of stones may be a fair trading substitute for two of bread. But here, again, the whole thing is an unmitigated fraud, four ounces of is. 2d. butter being nothing more nor less than six ounces of margarine, which could have been sold honestly, and with fair profit, at about 6d. or 8d. per pound. All this being so, it may fairly be asked by persons not conversant with the tricks of the trade, Why does not the local authority stop it ? Like a great many other things, this is easier said than done, for these pseudo Welsh dairymen have very ingeniously learnt the technicalities of the Food and Drugs Act, and know by wide experience that a fairly large volume of fraudulent dealing can be carried on inside the four corners of an 22 Act of Parliament. As an illustration of the difficulties, I may mention that one Saturday afternoon a gentleman well known locally went out to purchase some butter for his tea. He called at a certain "dairy" and asked for a stated quantity of "best butter." To his great surprise he was closely scrutinised, and after an embarrassing period he was informed in a very confused sort of manner, "Very sorry, sir, but we have no butter; we have some very nice margarine." He left the shop, and on calling at several others a similar thing occurred. The truth is that he was suspected of being the agent of an inspector, and each of these purveyors of "best dairy goods" were "off" as far as butter was concerned. Another thing which has covered an enormous amount of this fraudulent trading, as well as rendered nugatory some of the very wholesome provisions of the Margarine Act regulating the exposure of this article as butter, is a judgment given in the High Court in the case of "Crane v. Lawrence," and where it was, in effect, held that an article exposed for sale in the legal sense must be exposed to the view of the customer standing in the ordinary position of the customers frequenting the shop. The result of this has been that the " Margarine " or mixture, when on sale, is placed inside a large marble slab on the counter, the back of which is towards the public who enter the shop, and as the customers cannot see through the slab (even with the strongest glasses) there never is any exposure for sale within the meaning of the above judgment, and consequently no need to label the mixture "Margarine." Having got this legal protection for what ordinary people would consider a direct negative to the provisions of the Margarine Acts, they proceed further with this misapplied ingenuity and sell margarine mixture at butter prices in a paper or wrapper with the word "Margarine" printed on it. This word is so cunningly placed on the paper as to permit the mixture being wrapped up in such a manner as to make it invisible to the ordinary customer, and when the inspector's agent (for whose benefit all these tricks are invented) makes a purchase, the vendor, with innocence worthy of a better cause, proceeds to inform the officer taking the sample that the wrapper has the word ''Margarine" on it, and that it is a "Notice" as required by the "Sale of Food and Drugs Act." These are samples of the difficulties to be met with, amongst others, and afford an illustration of how these Acts can be evaded and the public cheated from day to day. In spite of all this we can claim that for another year a fair proportion have found that with all their 23 crafty dealing and hard swearing at the Police Court some of their fraudulent earnings have had to be returned to the ratepayers in the shape of penalties and costs, as the following particulars show :— Summonses issued, 44; penalties ordered to be paid, £230 14s. 6d.; costs allowed, £26 19s. 6d. Total, £257 Of this amount one fine of £,12 was not recovered, and another defendant went to prison for some part of the time ordered, and paid a fine for the remainder, thus rendering the actual amount recovered to £236 10s. 4d.

Ditto Exposing Margarine for sale without being properly labelled. Penalty £50. There were previous convictions and the learned Magistrate made some very strong remarks on the nature of the defence put in, which was palpably untrue. Before leaving this subject of the Food and Drugs Act, I should like to refer to a question recently raised on Mr. Stokes' annual report, which compares the large number of adulterated samples taken in this district with that of London as a whole, and implies some neglect in enforcing these Acts in this district. Anything more ridiculously fallacious than this camparison is hard to imagine. To attempt to compare results without any knowledge of how these results are obtained is an absolute waste of time. Further, one would suppose that when the amount of detection is found year after year in one district to be above the average it might possibly occur to those who seem ever on the alert to discourage an authority anxious to do its duty that there is something being done on different lines to get at the dishonest trader. Certainly no one with any real knowledge of how sampling has been done generally would for one moment agree that because one has a number of prosecutions in any particular district it necessarily follows there is a larger amount of adulteration in that district than in others where the work is differently carried out. If the standard of efficiency is 26 to be that the majority of your food samples shall be found genuine, then we can easily win the approbation of those authorities by adopting any or all of the following methods:— (a) Let all your samples be taken during the regular official hours of duty. (b) Take samples at the shops in strict systematic rotation, i.e., begin at one end of the street or district and go straight through. Do not dodge about from place to place. (c) Employ as your agent or purchaser one of the male employes in the Sanitary Department, such as the messenger or disinfector, or any other of the men equally well known in the district. (d) Let one officer, preferably well-known, take all the samples regularly and without variation or any interference. Our critics will, no doubt, be surprised to hear that each and every one of these schemes are actually in force in some or other of the districts which make up London as a whole, and with which they compare us; and I would respectfully suggest for consideration what might be a still better arrangement for procuring unadulterated samples—Provide the above-mentioned officer with a most conspicuous uniform or livery, and let him carry a fairly large sampling bag, and there can be no possible doubt that the amount of adulteration detected would be reduced to very small proportions. Whether there would be less adulterated food or fraudulent trading carried on is, of course, a matter of opinion; but I make bold to say that our rate of detection is above the average simply because the methods adopted for taking samples in this district are superior to those usually in force, and calculated to get at the very class of trader that the Acts are intended to deter. The conclusion I arrive at on the point is that you should strenuously continue, and in fact extend, your operations in this direction. DISBURSEMENT ACCOUNT.

Beyond the variation of boundaries and increased powers under Part III. of the Housing Act, 1890, and duties taken over from the London County Council, the London Government Act does not materially affect the position or procedure of your Committee as the Sanitary Authority of the district, now a Borough. As to the Housing Act, the Borough Council has decided to appoint a Special Committee to deal with this question. There is a splendid field for its operations in the district. With regard to the alterations of the boundaries of the parish, this, of course, varied the areas of the Sanitary Inspectors' districts, and it will, therefore, be desirable for the information of the Council as a whole to describe how the Borough is divided into sanitary districts:— District A.—Inspector Richards. The portion of the Borough east of Cambridge Road from St. John's Church to the Canal boundary line and north of Green Street and Roman Road to the boundary line in Driffield Road. District B.—Inspector Bridel. The portion south of Bethnal Green Road from Wilmot Street along Green Street and Roman Road to the boundary at Lyall Road and east of Wilmot Street, Finnis Street along Collingwood Street to the boundary at Whitechapel Road. District C.—Inspector Weston. The portion south of Bethnal Green Road from Shoreditch boundary to Wilmot Street and west of Wilmot Street, Finnis Street along Collingwood Street to Whitechapel boundary. District D.—Inspector Henley. The portion north of Bethnal Green Road and west of Cambridge Road from Paradise Row to Old Bethnal Green Road, and south of Old Bethnal Green Road along Wellington Row and Columbia Road from the "Birdcage" P.H. to Hackney Road. 30 District E.—Vacant by Mr. Lapworth's decease. The portion west of Cambridge Road from Old Bethnal Green Road to the Canal, Hackney boundary and North of Old Bethnal Green Road, Wellington Row, and Columbia Road from the " Birdcage" P.H. to Hackney Road. In each the dividing line is along the centre of the streets named to the boundary of the adjoining boroughs. The gain or loss in the number of premises in each district is as follows :— District A.—Increase 55 ,, B.—Decrease 81 11 c. ,, 40 ,, D. ,, 7 ,, E.—No change in number, 109 given up and same number taken over. Total number of houses given up 629 „ ,, ,, taken over 556 Decrease on balance 73 CHANGES IN THE STAFF AND DEPARTMENT DURING THE YEAR. Tenement Houses.—Among the important changes now taking effect, and one likely to have perhaps most far reaching results, is the decision of the Council to appoint, on your recommendation, an officer to devote his whole time to the enforcement of Tenement House registration, and duties in connection with overcrowding and housing accommodation. I trust that good results will soon be shown, when the new Housing Committee recently decided upon, and this officer, can get to work. NEW DUTIES UNDER THE ABOVE ACT. After consideration by a Special Sub-Committee, your Committee decided that as you took over 7 Slaughter-houses 350 Milk-shops 19 Cow-houses 2 Noxious Trades all of which require frequent inspection, and indeed constant supervision, it was desirable not to interfere with the District Inspectors' areas, and the Council was recommended to appoint an officer for this work, and in turn to take Samples under the Food and Drugs 31 Act. This recommendation, which was also adopted, means an addition of two Inspectors, and when they are appointed the staff available for inspection will be five District Inspectors, one Food and Market Inspector, one Dairy and Cowshed Inspector, one Tenement and Housing Inspector, and one Inspector specially for Drainage works and the sanitary arrangements of New Buildings. With Mr. Meadway, who also ranks as an Inspector in charge of Indoor and Clerical Work, this makes a staff of ten Inspectors, and is somewhat above the average for London as a whole. I have heard it suggested this will be a large Staff. Our population is 129,000, and the rated premises about 17,000. This works out at 12,900 inhabitants and 1,700 premises to each Inspector. Another change was the appointment of Inspector Ainley to inspect Food in the markets, and to enforce the Smoke Nuisance provisions of the Act. I have referred above to useful work done in the markets since he commenced duty here in July. He appears to be sincerely desirous of doing all in his power to give satisfaction, and to loyally carry out the duties entrusted to him. I considered that he was likely to be of more service on a district, and I therefore recommended that he should be transferred to District E, when it became vacant by the death of Mr. Lapworth. I trust that on the appointment of an officer to take over his present duties, he will make every effort to justify my recommending him for a District Inspectorship. Inspector Mills, after two and a half years' service, resigned, having been elected to a post under the Hornsey Urban District Council. Mr. Mills was appointed to specially superintend drainage works, and the sanitary arrangements of new buildings, but very soon proved himself capable of as good work in the other branches of the Department as in this. He unquestionably became the most efficient officer under the Food and Drugs Acts, and generally proved himself as efficient as he was courteous and obliging. In every sense of the word he was far above the average in his methods of carrying out his duties. I was sorry to lose such a reliable officer and loyal colleague, and trust his successor will endeavour to follow in his footsteps. 32 Inspector Lapworth, the oldest officer in the Department, passed away in January, 1901, at an advanced age, after having been absent on sick leave for many weeks. I desire to place on record my appreciation of the fact that when some few years ago the change in the working of the Department took place, he loyally accepted the new order of things, and faithfully endeavoured, so far as advancing age and failing health permitted, to render all the assistance that lay in his power. That he represented a bygone system is true beyond doubt, but for all that I have pleasure in testifying to his unswerving loyalty and anxiety to forward the work of the Department. Before closing this Report, I would beg to be allowed to express my deep sense of the loss sustained by the Sanitary Department specially, and the district generally, by the death of Mr. Jame Parnell. He was a member of the Committee for some years, and for three years filled the position of Chairman. During this period I had constantly to consult him on various matters, and on every occasion found him desirous that the work should be done in the most efficient manner possible. To me he was far more than a Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, important as that position is. He was ever ready to advise and encourage one to persevere with any difficulty that arose, and the officer who tried to do his duty whilst he was Chairman always found in him a helper and a friend. I beg to be allowed to tender my sincere thanks for the courtesy and continued support rendered to me by the Chairman and members of the Committee throughout the year, and to assure you that such support is deeply appreciated. In concluding, I beg to solicit your most favourable consideration of the work of the Officers and Start of your Department for another year, and am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, JOHN FOOT, Assoc. Mini. Royal Inst. Public Health.

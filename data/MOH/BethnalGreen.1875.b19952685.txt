SCAVENGING. Tenders were received in April for the execution of the work for a year from the 10th of August. The form of tender provided, as mentioned in the last Report, for the prices of Dusting separate from the prices for Scavenging and Watering. Seven tenders were sent in, which were referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report. The Committee recommended that advertisements should issue, inviting fresh tenders, and that such tenders should include in one sum all the work for each district, and that if the tenders sent in in pursuance of the fresh advertisements were not lower than those already received, the Vestry should take steps for executing the works themselves. Fresh tenders were received at the monthly meeting in May, when the tender for Mr. William Lansbury, for No. 3 district, at £1,650, and the tender of Mr. Devon, for Districts Nos. 1 and 2, at £3,145, were accepted. The Contracts were executed by both Contractors, but Mr. Devon was unable to perform his contract. At the monthly meeting in September it was referred to a Committee of the wliQle Vestry to consider and report what steps should be taken for executing the Scavenging Works in Districts Nos. 1 and 2. Notice was given to Mr. Devon to determine the contract entered into by him. The Vestry directed the Clerk to apply to Mr. Devon for £591 13s. 11d., the damages sustained by non-performance of his contract, but no 14 notice was taken by Mr. Devon of the application. The Vestry did not consider it prudent to incur the expense of legal proceedings. The Committee of the whole Vestry directed the Surveyor to invite tenders for the execution of the works for the two districts from Messrs. Parsons, Mansfield, Lansbury, Crane, Irons, Abbott, and Rollinson. Tenders were received from those Contractors (with the exception of Messrs. Abbott and Rollinson). Before opening the tenders the Committee considered fully the advisability of executing the work otherwise than by contract, but ultimately resolved to recommend the acceptance of the tender of Mr. Crane for District No. 1 at £1,520, and of Mr. Parsons for District No. 2 at £1,650. This recommendation was adopted by the Vestry, and Contracts were entered into with Mr. Crane and Mr. Parsons accordingly. Mr. Holloway, one of the Contractors for the last year, appealed to the Vestry to return the fines, amounting to £29 10s., and to remit the fines of £144, respectively mentioned in the last Report. The Vestry refused to return the fines paid, but remitted the fines of £144, which had been imposed in February, the deduction of which from the instalments payable to Mr. Holloway had been deferred, with a view of considering whether such fines should be remitted if the remainder of the work under the Contract was well done. Complaints are frequently made of refusal by the Contractors to remove ashes and rubbish, on the ground that it contains "Trade Refuse." The Metropolis Local Management Act specifically provides that such disputes shall be determined by a police magistrate. The decisions of the magistrates as to what is or is not Trade Refuse are conflicting. Messrs. Hanbury & Co. having determined to obtain the judgment of a superior court on the question, whether the ashes or "clinkers" from their furnaces are "Trade Refuse," suggested that the Vestry should bear part of the costs of the proceedings, on the ground that it would be a public benefit to obtain such a decision. The Vestry did not accede to the application, because it was felt the decision could not be one of general application, but would only be a guide in cases like or nearly like that of Messrs. Hanbury. The Contractor of No. 3 District has been fined £2 for neglecting to remove dust from houses in Chester Street, after being required to do so by the Sanitary Inspector. 15 FOURNIER'S CHARITY.

Mary Alice Palmer, 7, Gloucester Street. Benjamin Savage, 21, Hope Street. Mary Ann Sumner, 27, White Street. Subsequently to the Annual Election, Mrs. Spratt having become disqualified as a recipient by removal from the parish, the Vestry elected in her place as a recipient for the year— John Touchfield, 13, Pollard Street. PUBLIC LIBRARIES ACT. The Rule nisi mentioned in the last Annual Report was argued and discharged, the Court deciding that the right to demand a poll was clear. At a meeting of the Vestry held on the 2nd December another requisition to call a meeting of ratepayers, in accordance with a provision of the Act, was presented. In compliance with the requisition, a meeting of the ratepayers was convened, and held on 15th December, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon, at the National School of St. John, in Peel Grove. 16 The Report, signed by the Chairman of the Meeting, was as follows:— 15th December, 1876. At a meeting of the ratepayers of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, in the County of Middlesex, convened by the Vestry of the said Parish, pursuant to a requisition under the Publio Libraries Act, 1855, and held at the National Schools of St. John, in Peel Grove, in the said Parish, The Rev. Septimus Hansard in the Chair, Mr. Hales moved, "That the Public Libraries Act, 1855, and the Amending Act, ] 866, be and are hereby adopted for the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green." The motion was seconded by Mr. Milbourn. On the motion being put, the Chairman thought the Ayes had it, and decided accordingly. A poll was then demanded in writing, and granted. Mr. Collins moved, "That this Meeting be adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning, to take the poll, and that the poll be kept open until 9 o'clock in the evening, and that the declaration of the result of the poll be made so soon after 9 o'clock as the same can be ascertained." The motion was put and carried, and it was resolved accordingly. On the motion of Mr. Hales, seconded by Mr. Collins, it was resolved : " That a Committee of six gentlemen—three from each side—be appointed, in conjunction with the Yestry Clerk, to assist the Chairman in making arrangements for and superintending the taking of the Poll." Resolved also, "That Messrs. Hales, Walker, and Payne, with Cook, Bellingham, and Collins, be appointed the Committee, in conjunction with the Yestry Clerk, to assist the Chairman in making arrangements for and superintending the taking of the poll." The Chairman then declared the Meeting adjourned until 10 o'clock to-morrow morning to take the poll, and that the poll would be kept open until 9 o'clock in the evening. 16th day of December, 1S75. The poll having been taken, the Chairman declared the results as follows:— For the motion 727 votes. Against the motion 1,258 „ The Chairman declared the motion lost. (Signed) Septimus Hansard, Chairman. METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS PRECEPT. The amount required of the Board for the curreut year is £0,115 14s. 0d., being £109 11s. 2d. less than the amount required last year. 17 SCHOOL BOARD PRECEPT. The precept for the current year is £5,427 3s. 5d., being an increase on the amount required last year, of £1,853 18s. 10d. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. Dr. Sarvis, the late Medical Officer of Health, having died suddenly on the 4th of November, it was referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry to consider and report as to the duties and emoluments of the Medical Officer of Health. The Committee recommended that the salary in future should be £200 per annum, and that any fees received by the Medical Officer for attending the Police Court on proceedings by or on behalf of the Vestry be paid by him to the Vestry. Also that the Medical Officer be required to reside in the Parish, and that it be a condition of the appointment that the Medical Officer shall not hold at any time any appointment under the Board of Guardians for the Parish. The recommendations of the Committee were, after a long discussion, adopted. Advertisements inviting candidates were inserted in the Medical Times and four local papers. There were ten candidates for the office. Their testimonials were considered, and each candidate was seen by a Committee of the whole Vestry. The election took place at a meeting held on the 13th January, when George Paddock Bate, Esq., M.D., of 412, Bethmal Green Road, was elected. RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING STREETS. During the year orders by the Metropolitan Board of Works have been received, as follows:— Ashwell Road Re-numbering. Wennington Road ditto Gardner's Road ditto Wellington Row ditto Baker's Row & Charles Street ditto Re-named "Baker's Row" throughout. Bluff (late Nelson) Street ditto "Fournier" Street. North Street & Upper North Street ditto ditto "Brady" Street. Kenilworth Road ditto Durham Street ditto ditto "Teesdale' Street. Nelson Street,HackneyRoad ditto ditto "Horatio" Street. Caroline Street ditto ditto "Cadell Street. Old Ford Road ditto Grove Road ditto B 18 Objections having been made to the abolition of the name of "Durham Street," the Vestry suggested to the Metropolitan Board to allow the name to remain, but the Board deemed it inexpedient to accede to the application. GODDARD'S RENTS. Messrs. Hanbury & Co. wrote, offering to take Goddard's Rents on lease at the expiration, at Lady Day, of the then existing tenancy. The application was referred to the Works Committee, on whose recommendation the Vestry asked the annual rent of £100, which Messrs. Hanbury declined to give. MORTUARY. The Guardians, feeling compelled to decline to receive in future dead bodies into the dead-house at the workhouse, the Vestry decided in September to use the old engine-house as a temporary Mortuary, and empowered the Surveyor to do what was necessary to fit the engine-house for the purpose. In October the Sanitary Committee in conjunction with Messrs. Paterson, Ward, and Forrest, were deputed to wait on the Vicar of St. John to ascertain whether he was then in a position to consent to the vault under the porch of St. John's Church being used as a Mortuary, and adapted for the purpose in accordance with plans prepared by the Surveyor. At the interview with the Vicar he stated he had submitted the plans to the Bishop on the preceding day, that the Bishop had approved of the plans subject to a certificate by the medical officer, that the proposed use of the vault would involve no risk to health, and, subject to a faculty being obtained. The consideration of the matter was delayed in consequence of the death of the late Medical Officer of Health; and ultimately after much consideration, and having regard to strong objections expressed by some members of the congregation of St. John's, the Vestry on the 23rd of March passed a resolution referring to a Special Committee, consisting of the Members of the Sanitary and Works' Committees, to consider and report what steps should be taken, and what arrangements made, with a view of carrying out the resolution passed in 1872, to convert the old Watch-house into a Mortuary. 19 BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. A Bill introduced by the Great Eastern Railway Company, proposed to enable the Company to widen their line from Betlmal Green Junction Station up to the old Station in Bishopsgate Street, and to widen their main line from the Junction to and beyond the Eastern boundary of the Parish. Also to authorise the construction of a Tramway to cross Wheeler Street under the railway arch at a level. A Bill introduced by the East London Railway Company proposed to enable the Company to construct a line from their underground Railway at Whitechapel to a spot near the Bethnal Green Junction Station of the Great Eastern Railway. Petitions were presented against both Bills, and the Bills were referred to the Works' Committee, with power to communicate with the respective promoters. With regard to the first-mentioned Bill the Vestry felt the proposal ' to have a Tramway crossing Wheeler Street was objectionable. They also objected to the proposal that the widening of the line at Essex Street and Grove Road should be effected by bridges joining the existing very objectionable arches crossing those thoroughfares without converting the arches into girder bridges, and making throughout bridges of uniform span. The East London Railway Bill proposed permanently to stop up without providing any substitute, Temple Terrace, Somerford Street, and Trafalgar Place, and to cross Essex, Suffolk, Cudworth, and Collingwood Streets by arches, varying from 10 ft. to 12 ft. 6 in. It also proposed to stop up Thomas Passage, on the boundary of this parish and Whitechapel; also to stop up Bath Street in Whitechapel. The proposals of the Company, if carried out, would have effected almost a severance of the parts of the Parish lying east and west of the proposed line, causing great damage to property, and most serious inconvenience not only to persons carrying on large businesses but to the great number of small tradesmen and manufacturers, and the dense population of the district. The Bill appeared so highly objectionable that it was determined to oppose the preamble. Large posters, drawing the attention of the inhabitants and owners of property to the nature and effect of the proposals, were put up through the neighbourhood. By the posters persons were invited to sign the ; petition against the Bill, which the Vestry had prepared, and were in B 2 20 formed that copies of the Petition were lying for signature at the Town Hall, and certain places in Cambridge Road and Whitechapel Road. The persons who signed the petition were few compared with the numbers of those to whom the proposals of the Company would have been productive of great inconvenience. The Clerk and Surveyor had interviews with the Chairman, Solicitor, and Engineer of the Company, which resulted in the Company offering to modify their plans by giving girder bridges over Essex Street and Suffolk Street, with the same headway as the bridges of the Great Eastern Railway, over Cudworth Street and Collingwood Street, with a headway of 12 ft. 6 in. over Temple Terrace; with a headway of 10 ft. over Somerford Street; with a headway of 10 ft. 9 in., and by giving at Trafalgar Place a footway 7 ft. high; and at Thomas Passage a bridge approached by steps. These were all the modifications of the plans which it was in the power of the Company to offer, but were felt by the Vestry to bo so insufficient as to make it necessary to persevere with the opposition to the Bill. Counsel was accordingly instructed by the Parliamentary agents to oppose. The Bill was also opposed on the preamble by the Metropolitan Board of Works. It was understood that Board opposed as the Vestry did, because the Bill was in itself objectionable; but unfortunately the officers of the Metropolitan Board of Works, without any communication with the Vestry (and it seems without the sanction of their Board), withdrew the opposition of the Board on having certain unimportant clauses inserted. The Vestry were thus left alone, and the effect of the withdrawal of the opposition of the Metropolitan Board was to render the opposition of the Vestry futile. Counsel for the promoters urged strongly and with effect on the Committee of the House, that the Metropolitan Board of Works being satisfied showed that the opposition of the Vestry, a minor body, was groundless, that the proposed interference with the street was not such an injury as should weigh against the alleged convenience to the public of the intended line, and that the Metropolitan Board being satisfied the Vestry should be. The member of the Metropolitan Board for this Parish submitted the matter to that Board, with the view of getting that Board to oppose the Bill, if possible, in the House of Lords. The Great Eastern Railway Company consented to insert the Clauses as to Lighting, Paving, &c., asked by the Vestry, 21 but refused to give up the proposed tramway across Wheeler Street, or to make the desired alterations of the arches crossing Grove Road and Essex Street. The Clauses as to the Tramway was opposed by the Whitecliapel Board of Works as well as by the Vestry, and the Committee of the House of Commons decided against the Clause. The Vestry of Mile End co-operated with the Vestry of this Parish in pressing to have a clause requiring the Railway Company to alter the arch at Grove Road. It was necessary to have scientific evidence by an engineer, to show the practicability of effecting the alteration without stoppage of the traffic, and the probable cost of it. Mr. Baker, of Messrs. Barlow & Baker, was employed for that purpose, and it was arranged that a moiety of his fees should be paid by each Vestry. Mr. Baker showed clearly that the alteration could be effected without stopping the traffic, and at a very much less cost than estimated by the Railway Company. The Company offered to convert the present arch crossing Grove Road into a girder-bridge, but refused to incur the cost and alleged risk of putting back the abutment so as to make the existing and intended new bridge of uniform span throughout. The Committee of the House of Commons after deliberation decided not to require the Company to put back the abutments unless the two Vestries contributed towards the cost. It was ultimately arranged that the amount of the contribution should be £1,000, to be paid in moieties by the two Vestries ; and it is provided that the Vestries are to signify their option as to making the contribution within six months after notice by the Company of their intention to commence the work. In the improbable event of the contribution not being made the existing arch will be converted into a girder-bridge without the abutment being altered. The Committee were of opinion that the traffic through Essex Street was not of sufficient importance to justify requiring the Company to convert the bridge into a girderbridge, but required the Company when constructing the proposed new bridge to leave an open space of 3 feet between it and the existing arch. . MEMBER OF THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. Mr. Beven was, in June, unanimously re-elected the member for this Parish of the Metropolitan Board of Works. 22 VALUATION LIST. Mr. Arthur Harston, of No. 31, East India Dock Road, Surveyor, was appointed to assist in determining the assessments to be made on the Railway, Gas, Water, and Tramway Companies. At the date of this Report the East London Railway has not been assessed, but the Company pay, as provided by their Act on the property taken by them under the Act. When the line is completely finished it will have to be assessed, but at present it is not clear the Parish will gain by it. The assessment of the Great Eastern Railway is still in dispute. The following table shows the gross and rateable values of the parish in the Valuation List, which came into force in 1871, and the alteration of those values by the Supplemental Lists in each successive year up to the present year. 187 1 Gross 337,500 Rateable 270,524 187 2 „ 341 626 273,933 187 3 „ 345,814 277,349 187 4 „ 352,768 283,160 187 5 „ 361,150 289,940 New Valuation List] which comes into I „ 391,916 316,946 force in April, 1876,' It is estimated that on the new assessment a penny rate will produce about £1,130, being an increase of £80 over the produce of a penny rate on the old assessment. MISCELLANEOUS. After consideration, the Vestry agreed to accept the offer of Mr. Griffiths, the Paving Coutractor, to continue his subsisting contract on the price for re-laying Carriageway, Paving being raised 6d. per yard super. The price now paid under this arrangement is Is. 9d. for re-laying Carriageway Paving, and the price paid for new 3-inch York laid is (as mentioned in the last Report) 10½d. per foot. In consequence of the small number of Analyses which the analyst had been called on to make, it has been thought desirable to vary the arrangement made with him, and with his consent, instead of the 23 salary of 50 guineas per annum hitherto paid to him, he is to have an annual retaining fee of 10 guineas, and to be paid for analyses as follows — For the first 100 Analyses in any year £110 each „ second 100 „ „ 0 10 6 „ All above 200 „ „ 0 6 0 „ The Lord President of the Council having agreed to receive a deputation from Vestries and District Boards on the subject of the expenditure of the School Board for London, Mr. Pereira and Mr. Bellingham were appointed as the deputies from the Vestry. On the Report of the interview being made to the Vestry, it was moved, "That the Vestry is of opinion that the points laid before the Lord President of the Council on the alleged extravagant expenditure of the School Board for London are not borne out by the facts of the case."The motion was lost. On the passing of the Artizans' Dwellings Act, the Act was referred for consideration and report to a special Committee, consisting of the Works and Sanitary Committees. At the Meeting of the Vestry, before the death of the late Medical Officer, on the recommendation of the special Committee, a resolution was passed requesting the Medical Officer to report whether there are any and what areas in the Parish in respect of which an official representation should be made* to the Metropolitan Board of Works as the Local authority for carrying the Act into effect. The Surveyor having reported that the passage known as Devil's Alley, leading from Elizabeth Place to Lisbon Street, had been closed, the matter was investigated by the Works Committee, and it appeared that after pulling down the houses in Elizabeth Place, Mr. Rawlins had stopped up the passage, and leased the site of Elizabeth Place, including the passage to Messrs. Mann, Crossman, & Co., for building. Elizabeth Place and the passage, especially the latter, had been for years the subject of constant complaint, and after visiting the place the Works Committee recommended that no steps should be taken in relation to the closing of the passage at present. Their recommendation was adopted. Subsequently the Vestry resolved " to take no action in the matter of closing Devil's Alley." The inhabitants of the narrow part of Cambridge Road, between 24 the Green and Patriot Square, being inconvenienced in carrying on their business by the passing of the tram cars preventing the loading and unloading of vehicles, complained to the Vestry, and suggested the remedy was to substitute a single line of rails in the centre of the road for the existing double line of rails. After consideration and communications and interviews with the Engineer of the Tramway Company, it seemed that the proposed remedy would increase the evil; but to mitigate it the Company undertook to issue orders that only one tram at a time should be on the lines of rails between Patriot Square and the Green. The experiment (which the Vestry consented last year should be made) of using salt on the roads in case of frost or snow, has shown that the use of salt is injurious to unpaved roads. Notice has, therefore, been given to the General Omnibus Company to desist from using salt on any unpaved roads, and to the Tramway Company to desist from using salt on all roads, the parts of which beyond the Company's paving are not paved. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk. SURVEYOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED. FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1876. Gentlemen, During the year the East London Railway Company have constructed their new line which enters the Parish at the Whitechapel Coal Depot, passing through the south portion of the Parish, and connects with the Great Eastern Railway at Brick Lane. This work has necessitated the alteration and diversion of the various sewers with which they have come in contact, and has been carried out under my personal supervision at the expense of the Company by their contractor. Several of the side streets through which the traffic had to pass, in consequence of the railway works stopping up leading thoroughfares, required continual watching and repair, which was carried out by the contractor to the Vestry at the Company's cost. It will be seen from the annexed statements of works executed that the greater portion has again been carried out by the men in the employ of the Vestry. I have again to draw your attention to the condition of the smaller sewers, the cleansing, reparation, and reconstruction of which has formed a considerable portion of work done during the past year, and which still requires a larger amount of attention than with the present staff can be devoted to it. 26 During the year 302 loads of sewer deposit have been cleared from the various sewers and carted away. Fifty-two connections have been made with the Parish sewers to drain private property. The sum of £274 15s. 3d. has been paid to the East London Water Works Company for water used for watering roads, including the sum of £27 6s. for the use of meters fixed in the various stand posts throughout the Parish. The cost of water for flushing sewers amounts to £77 2s. Complaints have been made that during heavy floods of rain the houses in streets abutting upon Old Bethnal Green Eoad on the north side have been inundated with water. This is caused by the main line sewer, which runs through the Old Bethnal Green Road, and is under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Board of Works, being laid at an insufficient depth to allow the smaller sewers, which find an outlet into the main sewer, to be laid at a proper level to effectually drain the adjacent property. Communications have been made to the Engineer to the Board to the effect that property cannot be efficiently drained until the main line sewer is lowered, and he has promised that the matter shall have the attention of the Board. I enumerate the principal places where the Parish pipe sewers have been cleansed and repaired where found necessary :— Alma Eoad Meed Street Brady's Buildings Marian Square Bath Grove Martha Street Busby Street Mount Street Cooper's Gardena Nelson Street, St. Peter Street Club Court Nelson Street Collingwood Street New Tyssen Street Caroline Street New Turville Street Columbia Road New Castle Street Clare Street Nicholl's Bow Chilton Street Old Nichol Street Durham Street Peter Street Derby Street Pollard Bow Faith Street St. Ann Street Gardner's Boad South Street Hare Street Sclater Street Half Nichol Street Satchwell Street Hepworth Place Scott Street James Street Yincent Street Little Collingwood Street Wellington Street 27 The following brick sewers have also been cleansed and repaired where found necessary :— Approach Road Hassard Street Albert Road Lisbon Street Bishop Road Morpeth Road Brady Street Northampton Street Boundary Street Old Ford Road Blythe Street Prospect Place Cambridge Road Prichard's Road Collingwood Street Roman Road Columbia Road Robinson Road Coleharbour Street Turin Street Darling Row Warley Street Grove Road Wellington Street Globe Street Warner Place Hackney Road .

During the year, plans, specifications and estimates have been preparedfor converting a portion of the vaults under the Church of St. John into a Mortuary. A plan and copy of the specification was submitted to the Vicar for him to obtain the consent of the Bishop of the diocese. Plans of the old Watch-house, situate at the corner of Wood Street and Church Row, have also been prepared and submitted to the joint-members of Works and Sanitary Committees, and the old Engine-house adjoining Watch-house has been temporarily fitted and adapted for that purpose ; but in the case of an epidemic breaking out it would not be sufficiently commodious. Plans have therefore been prepared for re-constructing and partially re-building the old Watchhouse, which await the sanction of the Vestry. THE PARISH PLAN. The Vestry having resolved that a Plan of the Parish should be prepared, a considerable amount of time has been devoted to this work, it being necessary to make several surveys of different portions of the Parish where alterations have been made and new streets formed. A plan drawn to a small scale is now being prepared, and as soon as ready copies will be struck off in numbers sufficient to supply the members. I am, Gentlemen, Yours most obediently, WILLIAM MUNDY. Saint matthe, bethnal green VITAL STATISTICS and SANITARY PROCEEDINGS, FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1876. BY GEORGE PADDOCK BATE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: FORSAITH BROTHERS, PRINTERS, 329, BETHNAL GREEN ROAD. 1876. REPORT. Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you the Annual Report for this parish. I need scarcely remind you that my appointment as Medical Officer of Health dates from January last; and that consequently my personal supervision extends only to the three months ending March 25th, 1876. It was my wish, and the Sanitary Committee were willing, that this report should be for the year ending December, 1876; but, upon inquiry, I found that, by the 25th and 26th Victoria, cap. 102, sec. 43, Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health are required to present the Annual Report in the month of June. I must, therefore, at the commencement of my task, crave your kind indulgence for the meagre dimensions and many short-comings of this, my first report. The Vital Statistics, which are appended, are based upon the quarterly printed returns of the Registrar General; those for the months of January, February, and March, which are somewhat more detailed, have for their foundation the weekly returns from the same authority. They are not so full as I could wish, the returns alluded to extending only to the principal zymotic diseases, and one or two others. In former years, each Metropolitan Medical Officer of Health was supplied, weekly, by the Registrar General with the particulars of all births and deaths occurring in his district. Last year, however, notice was given that, for the future, the weekly returns would not be forwarded, and that, if the various local authorities still required those returns, they could have them by paying the District Registrars at the 4 rate of twopence for each entry. The matter was brought before the Vestry, and they, considering such charge unreasonable, declined to pay. Most of the Metropolitan Vestries have, however, now made arrangements with the Local Registrars, and their Medical Officers are supplied with those particulars, which are so necessary for the carrying on of their duties. Mr. Cross's Act, indeed, must remain almost a dead letter, so far as this parish is concerned, as there is no possibility of ascertaining the locality of unhealthy areas, unless systematic returns of sickness or deaths are supplied to the Medical Officer. Since this Report was commenced, I am happy to state, the Vestry have so far relaxed the previous resolution, that immediate information is, for the future, to be given by the registrars to the sanitary authority, of all deaths from Infectious Fever, Small Pox, and Diarrhcea. This will be of immense assistance to us, as sanitary defects will be detected, and disinfection and cleansing carried out without loss of time. POPULATION. t As census enumerations are only held in this country once in ten years, there is considerable difficulty in forming correct estimates of population; this unquestionably detracts from the value of death rates. The most approved method for estimating population is the one pursued by the Registrar General, which, however, gives an approximate result only. This method is to add to the population, as enumerated at the last census, a tenth of the difference between that number and the number obtained at the previous census, for each year that has elapsed since the last census, and a fortieth of that difference for each odd quarter. It is now exactly five years since the last census was taken, in April, 1871. The population of Bethnal Green was then 120,200. In 1861 it amounted only to 105,101 ; this is an increase in the ten years of 15,099, and is nearly the same as that which took place in the ten years 1851-61—so that we may safely assume that the rate of increase has been maintained since the last enumeration in 1871. I therefore 5 estimate the population of Bethnal Green in round numbers at 128,000. Bethnal Green contains an area of 755 acres, and 17,94.5 houses : this gives a population of 169*5 persons to the acre, and an average of 7*i persons to each house. The number of persons to an acre for the whole of London being 46'3. By the New Registration Act, which came into operation on the 1st of January, 1875, some alterations were made in the system of registering both births and deaths. All parents are now required, under penalty, to attend at the office of the Local Registrar and give personal information respecting the births of their children, within forty-two days, or else to send a notice to the Registrar to attend at the house of the informant. In former years people have neglected to register their children's births, for the purpose of evading the Vaccination Act; this they can no longer do without subjecting themselves to a penalty. With respect to deaths, medical men are now compelled, under a heavy penalty, to furnish certificates of death in all cases attended by them. It is probable that, by the operation of this Act, additional accuracy will be obtained in statistics of births and deaths. The total number of deaths during the year from all causes was 3020, against 3142 in 1874-5; the number of births during the same period being 5255, against 5152 in the previous year. This is shown in a tabular form below:— 1874-5. 1875.6. Total Births 5152 5255 Total Deaths 3H2 3020 Excess of Births over Deaths 2010 2235 It will thus be seen that, although the population is greater, the deaths have diminished, and the births have increased. The difference between this year and last, of the excess of births over deaths, being 225 in favour of the current year. 6 ZYMOTIC DISEASE. The deaths from the seven principal zymotic diseases during the year have been 598, against 573 for last year—the increase will be seen, from the subjoined table, to be owing to the deaths from Whooping Cough and Measles; the deaths from Fever of all kinds, however, shewing a marked diminution, and there being only one death in the year from Small Pox, as was also the case in the previous year. This is a most satisfactory proof that our indefatigable Vaccination Officer, Mr. Winter, performs his duties in a most praiseworthy manner. 1874-5. 1875-6. Small Pox 1 1 Measles 25 90 Scarlet Fever 193 127 Diphtheria 5 14 Whooping Cough 151 184 Fever 68 51 Diarrhoea 124 119 Cholera 6 12 573 598 It will be seen from the tables at the end of this Report that the number of deaths in the March quarter exceeds that of any other, both in Bethnal Green and also for the whole of London: this, however, is in accordance with the usual experience. Of the zymotic class, Whooping Cough caused the greatest number of deaths, 72 having occurred in Bethnal Green from this disease alone; most of these were in the "Hackney Road" and "Green" districts, the numbers being respectively 23 and 26, against 12 and 11 in the " Church " and " Town." Of this disease it may be remarked that it is most peculiar as to contagion. It cannot be isolated; the precise mode in which it spreads is quite unknown ; no precautions seem practically efficient to ward it off; the disease spreads, not by contact or absolute propinquity, 7 but to the children about and within hearing. The disease is clearly zj'motic, and happens but once in a lifetime ; still, the peculiar cough is very apt to recur just as one hopes it has disappeared. The predisposition to Whooping Cough, however, seems to be augmented by Catarrh ; it is therefore advisable at such times as the present, when this disease is epidemic, to protect children with the utmost care from taking cold, and to treat the most simple Catarrh with the same solicitude and precaution with which, in Cholera times, ^ we treat ordinary Diarrhoea, and look upon it as dangerous. ANNUAL DEATH RATE. The deaths during the year from all causes were 3020, being at the rate of 23.4 per thousand persons living, or one death in every 42.6 of the population; while the mortality for the whole of London for the same period was 23.1. I have calculated the mortality for the Whole of London and for Bethnal Green for each quarter, and show them in contrast below. London. Bethnal Green. June Quarter, 1875 21.9 22.0 September do 21.5 23.5 December do 24.3 23.4 March Quarter, 1876 24.7 25.2 The number of deaths from zymotic diseases has been 598, or at the rate of 4.6 per thousand, one person in every 213.3 having succumbed to one of this class of diseases—the corresponding rate for London being 4.1. The following table shows the percentage of each one on the total number of deaths from the different zymotic diseases :— Small Pox 0.16 per cent., or 1 in 598 deaths. Measles 15.00 „ „ 6.66 „ Scarlatina 21.16 ,, „ 4.72 „ Diphtheria 2.33 ,, „ 42.85 „ Whooping Cough 30.66 ,, „ 3.26 ,, Fever 8.05 „ „ 11.76 j, Cholera 2.00 ,, „ 50.00 „ Diarrhoea 19.83 „ „ 5.04 „ 3 These tables show that the death rate for the district is slightly in excess, both for zymotic and other diseases, over the average rate for the whole of London. I trust we shall see this reversed at some future period. ANNUAL BIRTH RATE. The births during the year were 5255, being at the rate of 41.0 per thousand living, or one to every 24.3 of the population— the rate for the whole of London in the corresponding period being 35.8, a difference of 5.0 per thousand. It cannot be said that Bethnal Green is not a prolific neighbourhood. Of these 5255 children born in the parish, 878 died before attaining the age of one year; that is, at the rate of 167.07 per thousand children born, or one child out of every 5.9 brought into the world dies before attaining the age of twelve months— the corresponding rate for the whole of the metropolis being 158.8. This mortality, both for London and Bethnal Green, is very much in excess of what it should be, and is, I believe, in a great measure, attributable to the extreme ignorance prevalent amongst mothers of the proper diet for young children. Dr. West, in his " Lectures on the Diseases of Infancy and Childhood," says :— "The infant whose mother refuses to perform towards it a mother's part, or who by accident, disease, or death, is deprived of the food that nature destined for it, too often languishes and dies. Such children you may see with no fat to give plumpness to their limbs; no red particles in their blood to impart a healthy hue to their skin ; their face wearing in infancy the lineaments of age ; their voice a constant wail; their whole aspect an embodiment of woe. But give to such children the food that nature destined for them, the mournful cry will cease; the facc will assume a look of content; by degrees, the features of infancy will disclose themselves; the limbs will grow round; the skin, pure red and white ; and when at length we hear the merry laugh of babyhood, it seems almost as if the little sufferer of some weeks before must have been a changeling;—and this the real child brought back from fairyland." Nature has provided a special food which contains in itself every element necessary for the development and growth of the new-born infant—milk, and more especially mothers'milk; the food to which I allude also contains these elements in such a form as to be most readily digested and assimilated by the delicate organs of the infant. Assuredly, then, we cannot improve upon nature, and if we attempt to 9 substitute farinaceous food for milk, we shall certainly do wrong. Indeed, until the eighth month, the child is absolutely incapable of digesting anything but milk; and though a child fed upon a mess of boiled bread, rusks, corn flour, or any other "patent" rubbish of a like nature, will appear satisfied, yet it is simply from the fact of its stomach being mechanically distended by what, for purposes of nutrition, might just as well be so much sawdust and water. A great many deaths are registered as owing to "dentition." Now, it must not be forgotten that this is a perfectly natural process, and in a healthy, properly-fed child should cause little or no constitutional disturbance. But whatever be the character of the illness from which the poor child is suffering— especially if it should happen that at the same time a tooth be about to pierce the gum—it is at once assumed by the parents that the cause of the disease is dentition. A messenger is immediately despatched to the nearest druggist for " teething" powders, and the poor little child's intestinal tube is raked out with calomel. Now, I am firmly persuaded that what is put down to teething is really (in many instances) owing to farinaceous food ; convulsions, and other derangements of the system, being more frequently due to the presence of undigested food in the stomach and intestines, than any other cause. r COW HOUSES. A considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the milk supply of the parish. The whole of the cow houses have been carefully inspected, defects pointed out, and improvements suggested. Annexed to this report is a list of the cow sheds of the parish, with short notes of the condition in which each was found at the period of my visit. Unfortunately our powers extend to the licensed cow keepers only. We have no control whatever over the milk sellers who obtain their milk from the country. Milk is brought up in cans by the night trains, and carried by the retailers to their own premises, where it often remains for many hours. These premises are frequently dirty little shops, or back kitchens (probably having an untrapped drain in some corner), and close to the rooms in which the families 10 live, members of which may possibly be suffering from some contagious disease. Thus there is no security whatever that the milk may not be the vehicle by which disease may spread. Now, milk is a highly complex organic fluid, the constituents of which are closely analogous to those of the human body: thus it may serve for the development and multiplication of disease germs. We know from sad experience that water will carry the germs of cholera and enteric fever; and so certainly will milk. Indeed, so absorbent is this fluid that it is customary in some places when game is hung to acquire its peculiar flavour, to place a pan of milk upon the floor of the larder. This takes up the effluvium, and becomes itself so foul in one night that cats and dogs will not touch it. Recent experiences at Eagley, Bath, and Burnley, seem to prove that when epidemics are spread through the agency of milk, they are particularly virulent. In short, milk can be the vehicle of contagion in three ways: ist, by direct communication of the contagion, either by the water used for purposes of adulteration, or by the vessels in which it is stored being cleansed with impure water; 2nd, by the absorption of the contagion by the exposure of the milk to deleterious gases; 3rd, the milk itself may be bad as the secretion of diseased cows. In a late number of the Lancet, the following article occurs referring to this subject:— " The ease with which milk receives and carries infection is illustrated by the absolute and well-known necessity for purity of air and perfect cleanliness in dairy operations. With this knowledge before us, it is impossible to help asking why dairies are not placed under inspection ? Public houses, slaughter houses, common lodging houses, and alkali works, are all under inspection, with manifest advantage to the public, and with no real injury to the owners. The respectable dairyman would have nothing to fear, and would suffer no inconvenience from the occasional visits of an inspector, and his customers would be saved from a terrible risk. In large towns, special officers must, of course, be appointed, while in rural districts the work could be done by the sanitary inspector. We believe the result of such a reform would be an important diminution in zymotic diseases, for it is becoming evident that milk is responsible for a great deal more of this kind Of mischief than is commonly supposed. For one epidemic traced to milk, there are probably many which attract less attention, but to which, if closely studied, a similar origin might be assigned." 11 The whole subject has recently been under discussion by the Society of Medical Officers of Health. The subjoined rules embody the sanitary principles which this Society would desire to see enforced. Dr. Vinen and Professor Corfield, in their circular, remark:— There is at present no power to make bye-laws on the subject; but, in the expectation of early legislation conferring such power, the principles desirable to be observed are here drawn up in the form of bye-laws. Meanwhile, until the power of framing bye-laws is given, the subjoined regulations will serve to indicate the conditions the society considers should be taken into account by sanitary authorities and magistrates, who are concerned in the licensing of cow houses in London and other towns. "The proposed rules are divided into two classes; the one class comprising those regulations which in the Society's opinion are proper to be insisted on in all cases ; the other class comprising those regulations which the Society regards as desirable to be enforced in all new cow sheds and dairies, but on which it would not be expe-. dient to insist in the case of all cow sheds and dairies at present established," CLASS I.

I find that in the parish of Bethnal Green there are 47 licensed cow sheds, containing, at the period of my visit, 534 cows, and managed by 46 persons. Very few indeed were in such condition as to be reported "good," irregularities as to paving and drainage prevailing in most. In many, the water-supply arrangements were of the worst description, two being supplied by surface wells, one by an underground tank, and several from cisterns over closets, having direct communication with the sewer by means of waste pipes. With respect to the two wells, one is on the premises of Mr. Richards, of Cambridge Heath road. The barrel of the pump, in this case, is only nine feet from the dung pit, and though the latter is 15 well constructed and lined with cement throughout, there is no certainty that percolation of excrementitious matter should not take place into the well. This might easily be an unsuspected source of danger to the customers of the dairy, which is one of the largest and best conducted in the parish. The other well is in Sclater street, on the premises of Mr. Jones. In this case the pump is fifteen feet from the dung pit, which is of very ordinary construction, and the liquid portion of the manure may easily (and very probably does) find its way into the well. The water from both of these wells has been frequently submitted to a careful microscopical examination. Each specimen, after standing for twenty-four hours in a tall glass jar, gave a considerable deposit, which, upon examination, was found to consist of the debris of animal and vegetable life, with numerous ciliated infusorial forms, the presence of which (in the opinion of most authorities) is proof conclusive of sewage contamination. I should strongly advise that specimens be submitted to Dr. Tidy for chemical analysis, and should his opinion confirm mine, proceedings could be taken to cause both these wells to be closed, as being injurious to health. The next dairy to which I have specially to refer is that of Mr. Mansfield, of 7½, Digby street. I will here simply transcribe my report upon the matter to the sanitary committee:— "The cow house is a shed at the end of a large yard, the said yard being used as a shoot for dust and vegetable refuse from Mile End parish. This had not (at the time of my visit) been removed for the past two months, and its condition may be more readily imagined than described. The cow shed is sufficiently large and lofty, but has no windows, only some small gratings. The temperature (though it was a very cold day) was extremely high, and the ventilation simply nil. The paving of the shed is uneven, and the drain choked. There is no dung pit, the dust heap in the yard being used for the purpose. The paving of the outside yard is very uneven. The water is on the constant supply, a large iron tank being used for storage, the sides of which are covered with confervoid growth. This water, however, is not used for the cows: they are supplied with distiller's wash instead. Mr. Mansfield keeps one pig." My recommendation to the committee was to the effect, that Mr. Mansfield should be allowed the option of giving up either his dust business or his dairy, as the conjunction of the two upon the same premises is most dangerous to the public health.

The East London Water Works Company are gradually extending the constant supply over the whole of the parish. When this is 19 pleted, a great source of danger will be removed, as an intermittent water supply most certainly conduces to the spread of zymotic disease. In all houses inspected the water supply arrangements are invariably noted, and in many instances found to be defective— foul cisterns and water butts being the rule. In many cases the butt (without any cover) is placed alongside an overflowing dust bin; in others, the cisterns are placed over closets, and when this is the case the waste pipes usually communicate with the sewer. In one house in Hill street, where there have been a number of cases of scarlet fever, we found the water stored in a very dirty butt, which, at the time of my visit, contained cabbage stalks, tobacco pipes, mussel shells, and one live fish. MORTUARY. The question of providing a mortuary has been repeatedly under consideration by the sanitary committee. There are two sites proposed—one the old watch house in Church row (now used as a temporary mortuary), and the other the crypt under St. John's Church. I subjoin my report on the latter to the Vestry "On the 1st of March, i carefully examined the crypt of St. John's Church, Bethnal Green. I have also seen the plans and specifications of the intended mortuary, and am of opinion that they could be earned out without in any way endangering the health of the congregation, or inhabitants of the neighbourhood. The situation and nature of the vaults are, in my opinion, eminently adapted to the purpose in view, the solidity of the building being such as to entirely preclude the possibility of any noxious emanations ascending to the superstructure." Signed, &c. The sanitary committee visited the Shoreditch mortuary, which has been recently erected in the churchyard, and were very pleased with the arrangements, which are of the very best description, and which we cannot do better than take for our modeL Unfortunately, however, the site for our future mortuary remains unsettled, no progress having been made. The matter should, however, not be allowed to rest. We may at any time have an epidemic upon us, which would find us utterly unprepared with any adequate provision. 20 Mr. J. W. Burrows informs me that during the year 1875-6, eighteen bodies have been removed and placed in our temporary mortuary in Church row. [Since the printing of this report was "commenced, a joint meeting of the Sanitary and Works Committees has been held. The matter was carefully discussed, and it was resolved that the rector should be invited to confer with the committee upon the subject, with a view to the conversion of the old watch house in Church Row into a mortuary. Mr. Hansard met us in the most kindly and courteous spirit, withdrew his former objections, and entered heartily into the subject with us. Accompanied by Mr. Hansard, the committee visited the watch house, and after completing the inspection, resolved that Mr. Mundy be requested to prepare amended plans and specifications for the conversion of the building into a mortuary. There is, then, a prospect of this much vexed question being speedily settled, and that Bethnal Green will be as well provided with mortuary accommodation as any of the neighbouring parishes.] INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Early in the year, feeling that we did not receive sufficient information as to cases of infectious disease occurring in the district, I obtained permission from the Sanitary Committee to send round a circular to the medical men of the neighbourhood, of which the following is a copy :— "Dear Sir,— As it is of vital importance that cases of fever, &c., occurring in the parish should be known to the sanitary authorities, may I request, as a personal favour, that you would furnish me with the particulars of any cases amongst your own patients; more especially where, either from neglect or want of means, proper sanitary measures, such aS you would yourself recommend, are not likely to be carried out. In order to save you as much trouble as possible, I enclose some stamped and directed forms, and remain, &c." I am sorry to say, I have not received much information from this source at present. By the recent resolution of the Vestry, previously referred to, we shall receive immediate notice of all deaths from infectious disease from the registrars. The following paragraph appeared in a recent number of the Lancet:— "We understand that the corporation of a large provincial town are about to memorialise the Local Government Board for an amendment of the Public Health Act, 1875, which shall provide for the communication without delay to the medical officer of health of every case of small pox, scarlet fever, typhus, or typhoid, occurring within his district; the duty of malting such communication to be made compulsory 21 upon the occupier of the house in which the infected person lies ; the medical man in attendance, if any, being further bound to report the case, through the occupier, to the medical officer of health ; provision to be made for remunerating the practitioner for preparing such a return. An amendment of the Act to a somewhat similar effect has been before suggested." SHOOTING RUBBISH. Mr. Lapworth reports that several carmen have been summoned at Worship street Police Court, and fined forty shillings each, for unlawfully shooting rubbish upon the public carriageway, to the great danger of the public, and contrary to the Act of Parliament. This has had the effect, for the time being, of putting a stop to the dangerous practices which had, in several instances, been attended with accident. UNSOUND MEAT. A quantity of unsound meat was seized by Inspector Lapworth at the shop of a tradesman in Brick lane. It was taken to the Police Court, condemned by the presiding magistrate, and ordered to be destroyed. It was not exposed for sale at the time of the seizure, and the tradesman in question stated, he did not know the meat to be unsound at the time of purchase. The Sanitary Committee decided rlthat, under the circumstances, no further action should be taken. Unsound articles of food are frequently brought to me, in which cases (following the practice of my predecessor), I give a certificate as to the condition in which the article is, and usually hear no more of the matter, the parties arranging the affair amongst themselves. SANITARY INSPECTORS. The reports of the three Sanitary Inspectors— Mr. J. W. Burrows, Mr. W. W. Burrows, and Mr. J. Lapworth— give the following results:— Houses inspected 5,357 Notices served 1,957 Summonses issued 82 22 Work executed in compliance with Notices served Houses and premises cleansed and purified 1,090 Cases in which defective drainage has been remedied 906 Closets cleansed and purified 1,072 Urinals cleansed and flushed 96 Closet accommodation provided 6 Removals of accumulations of dust, manure, and other offensive matter 7,363 Animals removed in consequence of being a nuisance, or kept in a condition injurious to public health 55 Fever cases attended to 93 I have much pleasure in reporting most favourably upon the manner in which the inspectors perform their duties, which are of a sufficiently disagreeable and multifarious nature. Every help and assistance in their power has been freely given me, for which I take this opportunity of thanking them. PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.

Return made to the Local Government Board on the 7th February, 1876, by the Vaccination Officer of the Parish, respecting the Vaccination of Children whose births were registered in his District from July 1, 1874, to June 30, 1875, inclusive :— Registration Sub-Districts comprised in the Vaccination Officer's District. Number of Births returned from xst July, 1874, to June 30th, 1875. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible of Vaccination. Had Small Pox before the period of Vaccination. Died before the period of Vaccination. Postponed by Medical Certificate. Removed to Districts, the Vaccination Officer of which has been duly apprised. Not known, and removed to places which cannot be rcachcd. Default.—The majority of of these cases, from various causes, are unfit for vaccination at present. Although they are not under medical treatment, the Officer deems it unadvisable to press the operation for a short period.

I am sorry to say there seems to be great neglect in this department. In nearly all houses visited by us, in the course of our duties, we find overflowing dust bins, the occupiers complaining that they have repeatedly asked the dustmen to remove the accumulation, but wilhout avail. In conclusion, allow me to offer my sincere thanks to the members of the Sanitary Committee for their cordial support and valuable assistance in the performance of my duties.

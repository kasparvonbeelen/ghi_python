June, 1963 To the Mayor , Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen , I have the honour to report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1962. The year has been one of considerable housing progress in which I am proud to report my Department has played a full part. With the completion of housing schemes and areas previously represented , it is gratifying to see the re-housing of families from very unsatisfactory tenement blocks such as Columbia Square. The Council's decision to proceed with the clearance of 351 unsatisfactory tenements in addition to premises previously included in the 1961/65 slum clearance programme, will bring to many families now Jiving in unwholesome premises providing facilities of an era long since past, long awaited improvements in health and well being. After much effort to persuade the London County Council to take action regarding nuisances arising from the misuse of sites it gives great pleasure now to see temporary homes erected on some of them and when visiting to find families, many previously homeless, settling down again to family life. The powers in respect of houses in multiple occupation contained in the Housing Act, 1961, will enable conditions to be improved in many houses in the Borough which had not previously come within the scope of the Department. The awaited legislation for improving conditions in offices has not yet come into operation but consideration has been given to the staff required and to a survey of the Borough where there are many slum offices for which no formal powers at present exist to deal with unsatisfactory conditions. - 5 - I am pleased to have this opportunity of thanking Councillor Mr. W. Hilliard, Chairman of the Public Health Committee, and the Members of the Committee for their help and encouragement during the year. I would also like to acknowledge the co-operation of the other Chief Officers and their staffs and my particular thanks to my own staff for their loyal and efficient support at all times. I have the honour to be Your obedient Servant, S.A. BOYD, Medical Officer of Health - 6 - SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population, estimated mid-year 46,230 Number of Dwellings 14 ,590 Rateable Value £733 ,863 General Rate 23s. 8d. Sum represented by a penny rate £2,858 VITAL STATISTICS Live Births Number 830 Rate per 1,000 population 17.9 Illegitimate Live Births (per cent of total live births) 10.8 Stillbirths: Number 17 Rate per 1,000 total live and stillbirths .37 Total live and stillbirths 18.3 Infant Deaths (deaths under 1 year) 12 Infant Mortality Rates: Total infant deaths per 1,000 total live births 14.4 Legitimate infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 10.8 Illegitimate infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 44.4 Neo-natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 4 weeks per 1,000 total live births) 13.2 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 total live births) 10.8 Perinatal Mortality Rate (stillbirth and deaths under 1 week combined per 1,000 total live and stillbirths) 30.7 Maternal Mortality (including abortion) Number of deaths Nil Rate per 1,000 total live and stillbirths - Death Rate per 1,000 estimated population 12.2 During 1962 the Registrar General estimated the population as 46 ,230 which is 260 less than in the previous year. The death rate was 12,2 per 1,000 persons as compared with a rate of 12.1 for 1961. Both births and deaths depend to some extent on the proportions - 7 - of young and old people and of males and females in the area , and in order to make comparisons between one area and another the Registrar General gives Area Comparability Factors which take into account these variations in age and sex. Using this factor the adjusted death rate for Bethnal Green would be 11.3. The birth rate during 1962 was 17 .9 as compared with 17.5 during the previous year. The adjusted rate for comparison with other areas is 17 .4. The infant mortality rate was 14.4 which is , in Bethnal Green , however, calculated on a very small number of infant deaths and is consequently subject to large variations from year to year and as an indication of child care the figure should be used with some caution. The causes of death are shown in Table 1, which follows: Notification of Births Arrangements continued in operation during the year whereby the London County Council furnished to the Borough Council a weekly return of births (including stillbirths) notified to them as the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. During the year 952 live births (428 male and 424 female) were notified and in addition there were 17 stillbirths (9 male and 8 female). - 8 - - 9 - TABLE 1 CAUSES OF DEATH Causes of Death under 1 year 1 to 4 5 to 14 15 to 24 25 to 44 45 to 64 65 to 74 75 and over Totals M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F All causes 5 7 3 - 3 1 3 - 12 8 88 58 96 63 93 126 303 263 1 Tuberculosis, respiratory 2 1 2 1 2 Tuberculosis, other 1 1 3 Syphilitic disease 1 1 4 Diphtheria - - 5 Whooping Cough - - 6 Meningococcal infections - - 7 Acute Poliomyelitis - - 8 Measles - - 9 Other infective and parasitic diseases 1 - 1 10 Malignant neoplasm , stomach 6 3 2 4 9 6 11 Malignant neoplasm , lung , bronchus 1 17 3 9 1 4 1 31 5 12 Malignant neoplasm , breast 2 7 2 4 15 13 Malignant neoplasm , uterus 1 1 2 14 Other malignant and lymphatic neoplasms 1 2 13 7 6 8 9 10 31 25 15 Leukaemia, aleukaemia 1 1 16 Diabetes 1 1 1 1 17 Vascular lesions of nervous system 1 2 6 2 6 11 12 16 24 18 Coronary disease, angina 3 1 18 15 30 12 21 30 72 58 19 Hypertension with heart disease 1 2 3 2 1 7 20 Other heart disease 1 2 4 4 3 6 14 12 22 21 Other circulatory disease 1 2 3 1 5 10 4 18 22 Influenza 1 1 23 Pneumonia 1 1 5 2 7 5 17 15 30 23 24 Bronchitis 5 25 8 18 11 48 19 25 Other diseases of respiratory system 1 1 1 2 1 26 Ulcer of stomach and duodenum 1 1 1 2 2 3 27 Gastritis , enteritis and diarrhoea 1 2 1 2 1 5 28 Nephritis and Nephrosis 1 2 1 1 1 3 3 29 Hyperplasia of prostate 1 1 30 Pregnancy, childbirth, abortion - - 31 Congenital malformations 1 2 1 3 1 32 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 4 5 1 1 1 6 3 4 2 5 6 21 17 33 Motor vehicle accidents 1 1 1 2 2 3 34 All other accidents 2 1 1 2 1 6 1 35 Suicide 1 2 3 - 36 Homicide and operations of war - - - 10 - SECTION B SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply Water for domestic purposes in the Borough is obtained in all cases from the Metropolitan Water Board. Bacteriological and chemical examination of the water is carried out at frequent intervals by the Metropolitan Water Board , but following complaints five samples from domestic premises were submitted for chemical analysis and reported upon as satisfactory. Notices were sent to the Board in 49 cases where wastage of water due to defective pipes or fittings was observed. During the year 162 new premises were certified as having a proper and sufficient water supply in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act,1936. In addition to the supply from the Metropolitan Water Board. there are four wells in use in the Borough. These are as follows:- Attached to Council's Public Baths 1 (not used for domestic purposes) Attached to a hospital 1 (used for all purposes) Supplementary supply for industrial purposes 2 (used for refrigeration purposes only) Jhese wells are sampled at regular intervals. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the Borough are adequate. Considerable nuisance throughout the Borough is caused however by the ventilation of sewers at surface level. During the past eight years additional ventilation to sewers has been effected by the omission of intercepting traps to drainage systems, thereby allowing ventilation of sewers through ventilating pipes of new buildings. -11 - Sanitary Inspection of the Borough Following the 1,934 complaints of insanitary conditions , defects were found requiring the service of Intimation Notices in 1,124 cases, in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Of these , Statutory Notices were required in 318 instances and legal proceedings were instituted in 28 cases. In addition, 4 notices in accordance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955 , one under Section 26 and three under Section 27 , were served. In connection with the supervision of drainage works a total of 1,601 inspections were made during the year and an ever increasing amount of time is spent by the Inspectors' in the examination of drawings submitted for proposed new buildings or amendments to existing buildings. Fifty notices in accordance with Section 25 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955 , were served and in 13 instances the necessary work was carried out by the Council and the expenses incurred recovered from the owners of the properties. - 12 - TABLE 2 RECORD OF VISITS Bakehouses 64 Baker Shops 92 Butchers 220 Canteens 88 Confectioners 157 Eel & Pie Shops 5 Fish Curers 12 Fried Fish Shops 37 Fruit and Greengrocery 144 Grocers 356 Ice Cream 323 Licensed Premises 228 Milkshops 281 Restaurants 383 Slaughterhouses (Poultry) 12 Street Stalls 326 Miscellaneous Food Premises 197 Infectious Disease 183 Food Poisoning 8 Complaints Investigated 1,934 Aged and/or Infirm persons 177 Factories 2,039 Outworkers 244 Housing Enquiries 1,477 Houses let in Lodgings 257 Drainage Works 1,601 Rent Act 22 Smoke Observations 138 Shops Act 587 Miscellaneous 2,556 Re-inspections 4,867 Clean Air Act 157 Total 19 ,172 - 13 - TABLE 3 SANITARY DEFECTS IN CONNECTION WITH WHICH NOTICES WERE SERVED Dirty and/or dilapidated rooms 1,029 Defective drains and choked w.c.'s 140 Defective and dirty w.c.'s 1,300 Defective water supply 58 Defective paving 58 Defective gutters and rain water pipes 367 Defective roofs 440 Dampness 241 Defective dustbins 121 Smoke Nuisances 18 Accumulations of refuse 247 Other defects 1,526 Total 5,545 Supply of Dustbins In 22 cases during the year notices were served on Owners of properties in accordance with Section ,,12 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954. Legal Proceedings It was found necessary on 28 occasions during the year to take legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the requirements of Notices served. In 5 of these cases Abatement Orders were made by the Justices with the infliction of costs amounting to £15. Os. Od.

Factories, Workshops and Workplaces The provisions of the Factories Act, 1961 are administered by H.M. Inspector of Factories of the Ministry of Labour and National Service , in conjunction with the local sanitary authority. Close co-operation is maintained between the two, and defaults found in the course of visits to factories are notified between one and the other according to the body responsible for remedial measures. The principal duties of the sanitary authority are the enforcement of Sections 1,2 ,3 ,4 , 6 and 7 of the Factories Act, 1961, insofar as non-power factories are concerned , and Section 7 only in respect of power factories. Factories and Workplaced in this Borough carrying on a variety of trades number 1 ,270 and a total of 2 ,091 inspections and re-inspections were made during the year. 151 investigations were made in regard to drainage and applications under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947 . The following Tables give details of work carried out under the Factories Act, 1961 during the year:- - 15 - TABLE 4 INSPECTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROVISIONS AS TO HEALTH Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written Notices Occupiers Prosecuted 1.

Of the 409 names of outworkers which appeared on the employers lists received in August, 113 were given as residing within the Borough; in addition 121 names of outworkers residing in Bethnal Green were forwarded from other Councils. The following information of classes of work and numbers of outworkers employed thereon , being Bethnal Green residents , is in respect of the August lists , received from employers in the Borough and from other Authorities:- Number of Outworkers in August lists required by Section 110(l)(c) Wearing apparel (making, etc.) 149 Curtains and Furniture hangings 18 Brushes 2 Boxes 52 Lamp Shades 4 Christmas Crackers, etc. 7 Stuffed Toys 2 234 Section 110. There was no case of default in sending lists to the Council. Section 111. There was no instance of work being carried on in unwholesome premises. Shops Acts The Borough Council has power to require, in any shop in which persons are employed , suitable and sufficient lighting, washing facilities and facilities for the taking of meals and is responsible for ventilation and temperature of shops and sanitary conveniences attached thereto. During the year, 423 visits were made to shops and 52 notices were served in respect of unsatisfactory conditions found to exist. - 18 - Disinfection and Disinfestation The following is a summary of the routine work carried out by the disinfecting staff during the year:- Number of rooms disinfested 806 Articles of clothing, bedding, etc. submitted to steam disinfection 271 Articles disinfected by formalin 543 Hospital mattresses, pillows, etc. disinfected 8,583 Number of articles destroyed by request 2,106 The tipping of demolition material and spoil, reliably thought to emanate from the London Transport Executive Victoria line tube extension , has increased the difficulty of collecting articles which have been dumped on open sites , a practice which has sharply increased during the year when many visits were made for the purpose of disinfestation before the removal of such articles. The rooms f furniture and bedding of 123 families being rehoused by the Borough Council were disinfested. Personal Cleansing Station During the year, 26 adults had baths for verminous conditions it the Personal Cleansing Station , simultaneous disinfection of clothing being . carried out. In addition , 3 persons received treatment for Scabies at the Station. Public Health Inspectors visit and advise in all cases of Scabies and in those cases where verminous conditions persistently recur. During the year the mobile bathing equipment for the cleansing, by consent, of aged persons in their own homes where the persons concerned are so enfeebled as not to be able to attend at the Personal Cleansing Station was used on 312 occasions, as compared with 201 during 1961. This is a complicated and difficult service but one which is most worth while and for which the homebound and often disabled persons concerned are very thankful. Laundry Service for Incontinent Persons The arrangement with Hackney Borough Council for the laurtdering of articles of bed linen and personal clothing from incontinent persons continued during the year. - 19 - 1,046 articles belonging to 16 persons were collected , laundered and returned. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act. 1949 During the year, 271 complaints of infestation by rats or mice were received and in most cases of rat infestation smoke tests of the drainage of the premises affected were carried out by the rodent operatives under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Six notices under section 4 (1) of the Act were served. Systematic baiting and poisoning was carried out by the Rodent Operatives, with satisfactory results. In accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, all sewers under the control of the Council were baited twice during the year. National Assistance Act, 1948 Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951, provision is made whereby a court of summary jurisdiction may make an order for the removal of ill, infirm or incapacitated persons who are not receiving proper care and attention. During the year under review it was found necessary in one instance to use the powers of the Act:- This case was in respect of a woman aged 77 years, who was infirm , physically incapacitated, being completely incontinent, and who was in need of hospital treatment. She refused to enter hospital voluntarily and, in her own interests , there was no alternative but to apply for a removal order which was granted by the Magistrate. During the year 42 other cases of aged persons in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Department. It was possible in a number of these to provide necessary care for these old people in their own homes. In other cases the old people were persuaded to enter a hospital or a home. - 20 - The Old People's Welfare Committee, comprising representatives of the Council and the various local organisations and social settlements, continued to provide all possible assistance to old people in the Borough by the provision of clubs, home visitation, meals-on-wheels service, chiropody service, holidays and outings, etc. During the year the Medical Officer of Health was appointed Honorary Medical Adviser to the Old People's Welfare Committee and the Public Health Committee of the Council approved the appointment of a suitably qualified Woman Health Officer to carry out the statutory duties of the Council with regard to aged and infirm persons. Offensive Trades There are two premises in the Borough carrying on offensive trades, one being the business of a fur skin dresser and the other a poultry slaughterhouse. Twentythree inspections were made in 1962 , one notice being served. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act provides for the licensing by the local authority of all premises used for the manufacture and/or storage of filling materials to which the Act applies, and for the registration of certain premises where such materials are used in upholstering stuffing or lining of bedding, toys, baby carriages, etc. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock or other filling materials are manufactured but 24 premises are registered for the use of such materials in the trades conducted therein. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The operation of this Act is very important in Bethnal Green on account of the well known Sunday morning dog market which has been held in Bethnal Green for many years and which serves both vendors and purchasers throughout the whole of the County of London and even beyond. During the year 10 licences for the sale of pet animals were granted in respect of shops and 49 licences in respect of stalls. No warning letters were sent in connection with various infringements of the Act. Common Lodging Houses There are no Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. - 21 - Clean Air The year 1962 saw the final steps towards the completion of the Councils policy of covering the whole of Bethnal Green with Smoke Control Orders. Early in the year the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed Order No.3 and following six months of intensive fireplace conversions, the Order became operative in November. In the same month two further Smoke Control Orders covering the remainder of the Borough were made and at the end of the year were awaiting confirmation by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. These last two Orders should be operative in November, 1963 and Bethnal Green will become one of the first Metropolitan Boroughs to complete its Smoke Control programme. The Council's policy has been to allow occupiers of premises as far as possible to have a free choice of the type of heating they wish and up to the end of 1962 , grants amounting to £5 ,400 have been paid by the Council towards the cost of fireplace conversions. Bethnal Green residents have shown great awareness of the benefit to health of a pollution-free atmosphere. This has been evidenced by a variety of enquiries made during the year. These have ranged from the wish of tenants to make fireplace conversions even before their premises were included in a Smoke Control Order to the relative merits of different types of heating. Once complete control of the whole of the Borough is established the Public Health Department will continue its efforts to make sure no smoke-producing appliances remain in use. The number of visits made by Public Health Inspectors in connection with the application of the Clean Air Act are recorded elsewhere in this report. A further 1,228 visits were made by other staff in connection with area surveys and completed conversions. - 22 - The maintenance of the daily smoke filter and hydrogen peroxide apparatus for measuring sulphur dioxide continued during the year and the results obtained therefrom were communicated to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, who undertakes the co-ordination of the observations made by local authorities and investigates the nature, measurement and prevention of atmospheric pollution. Proposals were considered during the year to set up further measuring stations and at the close of 1962, plans had been completed for the installation of two more sets of apparatus. Readings from these will be available in 1963. Hairdressers and Barbers Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act ,1954 , requires the registration of premises and the persons carrying on the business of hairdressers or barbers thereat. At the end of the year , 53 premises were registered and 118 inspections were made to them during the year. 17 notices were served in respect of unsatisfactory conditions. -23- SECTION C HOUSING Clearance Areas Representation of properties included in the Council's slum clearance programme for the current period 1961 - 1965 continued throughout the year. 361 unfit houses were represented; these houses in 3 clearance areas are in the agreed programme. 321 additional dwellings as a result of agreement with the London Cour Council are to be represented during the current period as unfit for habitation. Closing of Unfit Houses 5 closing orders were made during the year under Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957 . 11 closing orders were made under Section 18 of the Act in respect of parts of buildings found to be unfit for habitation. Housing Act, 1957 , Section 9 Inspection of dwellings capable of being made fit at a reasonable cost continued throughout the year, it is anticipated that all dwellings with a life of at least 15 years will eventually be dealt with. Owners are informed of grants available for improvement so that repair of dwellings may proceed at the same time as improvement. No owner has accepted this opportunity. Housing Act, 1961 During the year , the Public Health Committee gave consideration to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government Circular No. 16/62 dealing with Part II of the Housing Act, 1961 , which gave Local Authorities new and stronger powers to deal with unsatisfactory living conditions in houses in multiple occupation. These powers fall into four main groups:- - 24 - (i) An entirely new power to apply a code of management to individual houses in which proper standards had not been observed. The requirements for this Code are prescribed in the Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962, which came into operation on 22nd May , 1962. (ii) Stronger powers to require the provision of additional facilities and amenities essential to decent living conditions, and the provision of adequate means of escape from fire. (iii) A new power for local authorities to carry out work themselves in default and recover the cost. (iv) A power, also new , to make a direction limiting the number of persons who may live in a house , or part of a house , which is in multiple occupation. The Circular stated that these strong powers were designed to deal primarily with the worst type of multi-occupied house. Unsatisfactory standards in such dwellings may be alleviated by the use by local authorities of the following provisions either separately or collectively:- I. The application of a code of management (Sec. 12) II. The provision of additional services and facilities (Sections 15 , 16 and 17) III. The carrying out of works by local authorities (Sec. 18) IV. The prevention or reduction of overcrowding (Sec. 19) V. Miscellaneous powers and provisions (Sec.21) At the end of the year a survey of houses in multiple occupation in the Borough proceeding, and in nine instances notices of intention to make Management Orders (Section 12) had been served. Overcrowding (Housing Act, 1957) Details of overcrowding in the Borough , and of cases where overcrowding was abated, are as follows:- -25-  No.of cases On register at end of 1961 160 New cases reported during 1962 1 Total 161 Overcrowding abated during 1962 38 On register at end of 1962 123 Families Equiv.

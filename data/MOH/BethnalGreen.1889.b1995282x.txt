POPULATION. I estimate the population of the Parish at 131,000, an increase of 500 over the year 1888. The area of Bethnal Green is 755½ acres, the number of inhabited houses is 18,454, a ratio of 7.1 persons to each house, and 173½ to each acre.

Eagles 5,735 Total 18,454 2 DEATHS. The number of deaths registered in the Parish during the year was 2591, against 2857 in the previous year. This gives a decrease of 266; moreover, it includes 141 non-parishioners who have died in Bethnal Green Hospitals, but whose deaths must bo excluded from the enumeration. On the other hand I have received information from the General Register Office of the deaths of 258 inhabitants of Bethnal Green in extra-parochial Hospitals; these deaths must bo added, and they raise the net total to 2708. BIRTHS. The births during the year were 4939, against 4936 in 1888, an increase of three. The excess of the births over the deaths was 2231; this is 253 more than last year. TABLE B. 1889. 1888.

Upon the basis of the estimated population, we shew a rate of mortality of 20.67 for the year 1889. This is nearly two per theusand below that of the year 1888; but it exceeds that of the whole Metropolis, which was 17.1, and is also above that of the Eastern districts of London, which was 19.6. The rate in the West districts was 15.5, in the North 15.3, in the South 16.7, and in the Central 26.5. In the following table are compared the mortality rates for Bethnal Green and for London by quarters. 3 TABLE C. London. Bethnal Green. March Quarter 19.3 21.6 June Quarter 16.0 174 September Quarter 16.3 19.7 December Quarter 17.9 23.4 BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. The number of births registered during the year was 4939, ft rate of 37.7 per theusand of the population. This is a rate (0.12) lower than that of last year, but still very considerably greater than the General Metropolitan Rate, which was 30.3. The Registrar General remarks that this is the lowest birth-rate as yet recorded in London, the rate having fallen continuously year after year since 1876. I am indebted to the British Medical Journal for the following extract:— "The True Death-rates of London Sanitary "Districts During 1889. "In the accompanying table will bo found summarised the vital and mortal statistics of the forty-one sanitary districts of the metropolis, based upon the Registrar-General's returns for the year 1889. Quarterly summaries of these statistics have already appeared in the Journal. The mortality figures in the table relate to the deaths of persons actually belonging to the respective sanitary districts, and are the result of a complete system of distribution of deaths occurring in the public institutions of London among the various sanitary districts in which the patients had previously resided. Thus the precise number of deaths of persons actually belonging to the respective sanitary districts is known; by this moans alone can trustworthy data be secured upon which to calculate reliable rates of mortality. "The 131,487 births registered in London during the year 1889 were equal to an annual rate of 30.3 per 1000 of the population, estimated at 4,351,738 persons, which showed a further decline from the 4 rates in recent years, and was lower than that recorded in any year since 1840. In the various sanitary districts the birth-rates showed the usual wide variations, owing to the differences in the sex and ago distribution of their population. In Kensington, St. George Hanover Square, St. James Westminstor, 8t. Martin-in-the-Fields, and London City, the birth-rates were considerably below the average; while in Woolwich, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, St. George-in-the-Last, and Fulham, where the population contains a largo proportion of young married persons, the birth-rate showed an excess. "The deaths of persons belonging to London registered during the year under notice were 74,362, equal to an annual rate of 17.1 por 1000 of the estimated population, which was considerably lower than in any year since civil registration was established in 1837. During the past nine years of the current decade the rate of mortality in London has averaged only 19.8 per 1000, while it was equal to 24.4 in the ten years 1861-70, and to 22.5 in 1871-80. This marked decline in the London death-rate since 1880 implies that upwards of 132,000 persons in London have survived whose deaths would have been recorded, had the rate of mortality since 1880 equalled that which prevailed in the twenty' years 1861-80. The lowest death-rates in the forty-one sanitary districts during 1889 were 12.4 in Kensington, 13.1 in Hampstead, 13.3 in Lewisham (excluding pengo). 13.7 in Hackney; 14.0 in Battersea, 14.1 in St. George Hanover Square, and 14.3 in Wandsworth. In the other districts the rates ranged upwards to 23.1 in Stepney and in St. Giles, 23.3 in Fulham and in St. Saviour Southwark, 23.6 in St. George Southwark, 25.5 in holborn, and 26.5 in St. George-in-the-East. During the year under notice 9635 deaths resulted from the principal zymotic diseases in London; of these 2670 were referred to diarrhœa 2309 to measles, 1747 to whooping-cough, 1552 to diphtheria, 778 to scarlet fever, 578 to different forms of "fever" (including 520 to enteric fever, 13 to simple and ill-defined forms of continued fever, and 15 to typhus), and 1 to small-pox. Those 9635 deaths were equal to an annual rate of 2.2 per 1000, which was below the rate in any year on record. The zymotic deathrate during last year in the various sanitary districts ranged from 1.2 in hampstead, 1.4 in Kensington, in London City, and in Lewisham, 1.5 in Paddington, and 1.6 in Marylobone, in Hackney, in Poplar, and in Woolwich to 3.3 in Westminster, 8.4 in Bethnal Green, in St. George-in-the-East, in Stepney, and in St. George Southwark, 3.7 in Fulham, and 4.5 in St. Olave Southwark. Compared with the preceding year the mortality from diphtheria and from diarrhœa showed an increase, while that from each of the other zymotic diseases showed a decline. Only one death from small-pox was recorded in London 5 during the year under notice, the nearest approach to so low a number having boon in 1887 and 1888, in each of which years 9 fatal cases of this disease were registered; the single small-pox death during last year belonged to Lambeth sanitary district. Only 4 small-pox patients wore admitted to the Metropolitan Asylum Hospitals during the year under notice, and BO patients remained under treatment at the end of December. Measles showed the highest proportional fatality in Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, Bermondsey, St. Giles, St. James Westminster, St. George Southwark, Westminster, and St. Olave Southwark; diphtheria in Lambeth, Kensington, Holborn, Bethnal Green, Stepney, and St. George-in-the-East; whooping-cough in Chelsea, Camberwell, Greenwhich, Newington, bermondsey. St. olave Southwark, and Fulham; and diarrhœa in St. Saviour Southwark, St. Olave Southwark, Stepney, Whitechapel, Fulham, and St. George-in-the-East. The rate of mortality from scarlet fever was not excessive in any of the sanitary districts, but the number of scarlet fever patients under treatment in the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals, which had been 738 at the beginning of 1889. steadily increased almost throughout the year, and was as many 1541 at the end of december. The admissions were 4574, the number in each quarter being 614, 625, 1449, and 1886 respectively. "Infant mortality in London during 1889, measured by the proportion of deaths under 1 year of age to births registered, was equal to 141 per 1000, against an average rate of 152 in the ten preceding years, 1879-88. While the rate of infant mortality last year did not exceed 106 in Wandsworth, 112 in Plumstead, 111 in Hackney, 122 in Hampstead, and 126 in St. Luke's, it ranged up wards in the other sanitary districts to 166 in Newiugton, 167 in St. Saviour Southwark, 175 in St. George Southwark. 181 in St. George-in-the-East, 183 in St. James Westminster, 199 in Strand, and 212 in St. Martin-in-theFields."

In this Parish there are 14 churches, 15 chapels, and one registry office licensed for marriages: of these there wore in the First Quarter 412 Second Quarter 621 Third Quarter 571 fourth Quarter 710 Total 2314 This total indicates a marriage rate of 17.66 to every thousand persons; or, as in each marriage there are two contracting parties, 35.32 per 1,000 of our population entered the bonds of nmtrimony. Sixty of these weddings were purely civil contracts, inasmuch as they required the presence of the Registrar to legalise them; 29 of them took place in chapels, and 81 at the Superintendent Registrar's office. Members of this Vestry who are Nonconformists have expressed to me their dissatisfaction with the present state of the marriage law; they consider that it is a slur upon their particular denomination, that clergymen of the Established Church should alone be able to solemnize a legal marriage, while their own ministers are unable to do so, except in the presence of the Registrar. This disability applies equally to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Westminster and to "General" Booth; for it is a legal obligation that all persons married in chapels shall make the two declarations in the 20th section of Act 6 and 7, William IV., c. 85, in the presence of the Registrar of Marriages; it is also the duty of this official to ascertain that the proper certificate or licence is produced, and to record the particulars in the Marriage Register Book. DEATHS OF INFANTS. Twenty-six and a half per cent. of the deaths from all causes were those of infants aged less than twelve months, for out of 4939 children born alive, 718 died before reaching the ago of one year, leaving only 4221 who attained that age. This gives a death rate, calculated upon the births, of 145.3 per thousand, the corresponding rate for the whole of London being 141. The diseases most fatal to infants were Chest diseases 145, Convulsions 86, Premature 9 Birth 62, Tabes Mesenterica 40, Diarrhœa 54, Suffocation 39, Inflammation of Brain 30, Whooping Cough 28, Measles 22. DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. As usual, nearly half the deaths (1311, equal that is to 48.4 per cent.), were those of young children aged less than five years. Assuming that the proportion of young children to adults has been maintained since the last census, the number of young children in 1889 would be 20,000; upon this estimated population we shew a death rate of 65.5.

The total number of deaths referred to this group of diseases was 480; of which 398 were amongst young children under five years of age, of whom 129 did not complete the first year of life; 132 of the deaths were from Measles; 102 from Diphtheria ; 93 from Diarrhœa; 62 from Whooping Cough ; and 10 from Scarlet Fever. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES ACT. This Act came into operation on the 30th of October. It requires every medical practitioner attending cases of certain named infectious diseases to notify particulars of such cases to the Medical Officer of Health. The obligation to notify also extends to the head of the family or person having charge of the sick person. As a rule the head of the family neglects to notify, and leaves it to the doctor to do so. The Act has largely increased tho work of the Sanitary Staff, and has entailed a good deal of correspondence, but it must be distinctly understood that it confers no new powers upon Sanitary Authorities, its object being merely to enable them to obtain early and accurate information of the outbreak of infectious diseases. A large number of medical certificates have been received, some of them of rather doubtful value; for the Inspectors report that upon visiting cases they sometimes find that the person certified to be suffering from Diphtheria or other infectious disease is either playing about the streets or gone back to work. I have also received by one post certificates that certain persons are suffering from Diphtheria, and by the next post other certificates signed by other medical men that they have examined the sick person and could find no evidenoe of infectious disease about him. 11 These doubtful certificates were considered by the Sanitary Committee; I advised that the persons who had charge of the children, stated to bo suffering from infectious disease, should be prosecuted for unlawfully exposing them while so suffering (Sanitary Act, 1866, 8ection 88); and that tho certifying doctors should be called to give evidence in support of their certificates. It was however not considered expedient to do this, but the medical men who had signed the certificates wore written to and their attention drawn to the facts; in a few instances the certificates were withdrawn. Now I consider that it is no part of my duty to examine sick persons with a view to verify tho medical attendant's diagnosis, and I havo in every instanco refused to do so ; moreover I oonsider that it is very mueh better that a few doubtful cases should be notified, rather than that one true case should escape; still it is a little hard upon the landlord that he should be put to unnecessary expense, for I invariably order the usual cleansing and disinfection of premises upon convalescence when I receive notification of infectious disease. All cases notified are. a- a rule, visited the day the certificate is received, and a careful report of each is prepared; a book is kept for each disease, and particulars of source of infection, place of employment or school, milk supply, and sanitary condition of premises, entered in their proper columns. A mass of information is thus obtained, which, when tabulated at the end of the year will be of the utmost value. THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths from the diseases grouped under the orders Miasmatic and Diarrhœal, were 416 against 552 last year, a decrease of 36. The decennial average of Zymotic deaths for the ten years 1879 to 1888, was 526.1 (see Table V). 12 TABLE D. 1889 1888.

The death rate from Zymotic diseases was 3.45 against 4.22 last year; the corresponding rates for London were 2.55 in 1888 and 2.24 in 1889. The Zymotic diseases showing increase over the preceding year were Measles, Diphtheria, Simple Fever, and Diarrhœa. In the following table is shown the per-centage of each as compared with the total number of Zymotie deaths. 1* TABLE F. Measles 29.30 percent., or,l in 3.43 deaths.

(Decennial average 30.7). Only one death was ascribed to Small Pox in the whole of the Metropolis and no case of this disease was known to have occurred in Bethnal Green during the year 1889. SCARLET FEVER. (Decennial average 96.2). The number of cases of Scarlet Fever reported to us during the year was 203 against 282 last year, a decrease of 79. The disease caused 40 deaths, exactly one-third of the mortality of 1888. The 203 reported cases occurred in 169 houses; in 41 the premises were in a fairly satisfactory condition, in an equal number they were in a more or less unsatisfactory state, and in the remaining 87 grave sanitary defects were discovered ; in order to get these remedied it was necessary to take legal proceedings in fifteen cases. FEVERS. (Decennial average 36.9). Enteric Fever caused seventeen deaths, and Typhus one; six nonfatal cases of simple Fever, and one of relapsing Fever were also reported. The total number of Fever cases known to us during the year was 73 in 61 houses; in fourteen cases the premises were in a fairly satisfactory condition, in 23 sanitary defects were found, and in 24 others the premises were in a very bad sanitary condition; it was necessary in four cases to get Magistrates' orders to have the unsanitary conditions rectified.

(Decennial average 19.1). 102 persons are stated to have died from Diphtheria, and 38 others from Croup and Laryngitis. For the last three years the mortality from Diphtheria has doubled that of the preceding year; in 1887 the deaths were 27, in 1888 they were 52, and in 1889 they were 102; this is a most formidable increase, hut it is to he hoped that it may be checked. in the future by arrangements which have recently been made for the admission of cases of this nature into the Asylums Board Hospitals. 194 cases of Diphtheria were reported to us, and 156 houses were visited; in 11 instances the premises were found to be in a fairly satisfactory condition, the remaining 115 were in a more or less unsatisfactory state, about half of them were very bad indeed. Legal proceedings were necessary in two cases in order to get these remedied. WHOOPING COUGH. (Decennial average 131). Whooping cough caused 02 deaths, most of them in the last quarter of the year. MEASLES. (Decennial average 101.6). Measles caused 132 deaths, all except eight being amongst young children aged less than five years, the outbreak, which had commenced in the autumn of 1888, continued till the beginning of May, 1889, but during the remainder of the year the mortality was below the average. 16 DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.

The deaths from this group of diseases, exclusive of Phthisis, were 625, nearly one-fourth of the total mortality from all causes, and corresponded to a rate of 4.77 per thousand population. The mortality from pulmonary diseases has been decreasing for the last three years. 18 TABLE 11. Quarter ending. Children under 5 years. Persons from 5 to 50. Persons above 55. Total.

ARTIZANS' AND LABOURERS' DWELLINGS' IMPROVEMENT ACT, 1868. (Torrens's Act). No premises have been reported to the Vestry under this Act during the past year. Its working has been found to bo so cumbersome and so full of difficulties, that, in deference to the opinion of my colleagues, I have refrained from putting the law in motion. The Clerk to the Vestry and the Surveyor both argue that it is much easier to close premises under the Nuisances Removal Act than it is under Torrens's Act, and of this there can be no doubt. 19 They also say that, as the meaning of the words describing unhealthy houses is identical in both Acts, it cannot matter to me whether I swear before a Magistrate that certain premises are unfit for habitation and should bo closed, or write a report under Torrens's Act to the same effect; but to my mind the two things are somewhat different. The Nuisances Removal Act contemplates a present condition of nuisance such as renders the premises utterly uninhabitable, but, under Torrens's Act, other conditions may bo and commonly are taken into consideration. Here the unfitness for human habitation may be caused by defective light, damp walls, etc., which it might be difficult to prove had caused actual injury to health, though the danger to the same is obvious. These considerations are to a great extent put on one side by the "Housing of the Working Classes Act," which has just become law. It abrogates much that is cumbersome under the old Act, and proceedings are simplified; but to my mind the new Act abolishes much that is good, for instance, tho reference to the Surveyor and his roport and specification of work to be done, in order to put tho unhealthy premises into habitable condition, are swept completely away. There will not even bo any obligation on the owner to submit a specification for acceptance before the repairs are oommenced. This omission will undoubtedly promote the patching up, instead of tho substantial reconstruction of dilapidated property, and will in many instances simply perpetuate the existing evils; moreover, premises which would have been reported by a Surveyor as incapable of repair, and fit only for demolition, may bo patched up and put in such a condition that the closing order must be determined and re-occupation permitted, though there can bo no manner of doubt that tho repair's will be only of temporary avail, and that the premises, aftor a few months' occupation, will revert to their previous condition of dilapidation. The following is a list of premises closed under tho Nuisances Removal Act during tho past year. It includes a total of nearly one hundred houses.

Magistrates' orders for the abatement of the nuisance were obtained in each case with costs. In addition to these, 43 summonses were issued for the recovery of penalties for disobedience to the orders of the Magistrates. UNSOUND FOOD. On July 19th, at six o'clock in the evening, two hind quarters of beef in a putrid condition, and weighing 34st. 7lbs. were seized by Mr. Lapworth in a cart-shed in Norton Street. They were in the possession of a butcher who sells meat from a street stall. The owner stated that ho had purchased the meat from a salesman in the Central Meat Market, and had paid 1s. 4d. per stone for it. The meat was convoyed to the Police Court on the following morning, and was ordered by Mr. Bushby to be destroyed. A summons was also granted against the owner, returnable on the 22 7th of August. The case was heard by Mr. Saunders, who inflicted a fine of 40s. and £1 3s. 6d. costs. Parcels of fruit, meat, and vegetables in a putrid condition are frequently submitted to me by persons who have purchased them at the wholesale markets from sample. My custom is to give a certificate of the condition in which I find the article, and to leave the purchaser and the seller to fight the matter out between them ; usually I hear no more about the matter.

The majority are in a fairly good condition. The licences of two of the Cowkeepers were opposed at the first meeting of the London County Council; but as the necessary work had been completed beforo the adjourned meeting our opposition was withdrawn. Mr. Sykes again applied for a licence to keep cows in premises in rear of Cambridge Circus, but the application was refused. SANITARY STAFF. Although not occurring within the year to which this report specially relates, I cannot conclude without referring to certain changes which have been made in the Sanitary Staff. An additional Inspector has been appointed, who commenced duty in January, 1800. By resolution of the Vestry, the Sanitary Staff is now placed under the control of the Medical Officer of Health for one year as an experiment. I attend at the Vestry Hall at nine o'clock every morning, and receive from each Inspeotor a 23 report upon every case attended to by him; certain rules for the guidance of the Inspectors have been prepared, a copy of which will be found in the appendix. So far the new arrangement works without friction, and a very large amount of work has been got through, particulars of which will be detailed in my next Annual Report. I take this opportunity of thanking the Inspectors for the cheerful way in which they have accepted the new order of things, and for their hearty co-operation and assistance to me in the performance of my responsible and somewhat onerous duties, which are of course considerably increased by the new arrangement. I havo the honour to be, gentlemen, Your very obedient servant, GEORGE PADDOCK BATE, M.D. 24 BETHNAL GREEN SANITARY DISTRICT. TABLE I.

DUTIES OF SANITARY INSPECTORS. 42 MEMORANDUM on Duties of Sanitary Inspectors. The duties of Sanitary Inspectors are of two kinds:- 1st—Routine Duties. These have for their object the prevention of the spread of disease, and the maintenance of the sanitary condition of the Parish. They are:— (a) To secure the isolation at homo, or the removal to hospital in suitable cases, of persons suffering from various infectious diseases, and at the removal of the patient, or termination of the illness, by convalescence, or death, to supervise the disinfection of the premises and bedding, and the subsequent cleansing and lime-whiting of the walls, etc. (b) To periodically inspect Lodging Houses, Cow Houses, Slaughter Houses, Bakehouses, Offensive Trades, Factories where motive power is not employed, and Schools. (c) Duties under tho Food and Drugs' Acts. Market inspection, and tho seizuro of unwholesome articlos of food. (d) To attend to notices of complaint from inhabitants of the Parish, in respect of the existence of nuisances of various kinds, such as choked drains, overcrowded tenements, dirty promises, offensive accumulations, animals improperly kept, trade nuisances, etc. (e) Duties under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act (should this clause bo put in operation). (f) Duties in connection with the dust collecting and scavenging. 43 2nd—Action taken with regard to insanitary Structures.—The Sanitary condition of the district is permanently benefited by the discharge of these duties, which call for the exhibition of skill, knowledge, and tact, on the part of the well-trained Inspector. To this head is to be referred the supervision of the rebuilding or the thorough repair of dilapidated houses, the proper paving and drainage of yards, and tike disconnection of inside drains. The removal of improperly placed closets, the abolition of cesspools, brick-drains, and improperly laid pipe drains, inefficient forms of closet apparatus and sink traps, and their replacement by improved pipe drains, closet pans, and syphon gullies; the provision of pure water supply uncontaminated by Sewer gas; the better lighting and ventilation of staircases, rooms, and workshops. The duties included in the Second Schedule are incidentally performed as part of the routine work, but the systematic amelioration of the dwellings of the district can only be secured by house to house inspection, and by the skilled supervision of improvements ordered to be carried out. Owners of small property are very apt to employ "botchers," instead of proper workmen, and unless the operations are carefully supervised during progress, the cement gets omitted in mixing the concrete for paving the yards, the drain pipes are badly jointed, and the gradients are insufficient, or even laid the wrong way; as a result of bad work the soil gets soaked with sewage, the walls remain damp, the air of the living rooms is contaminated with sower gas, the badly mixed concrete washes into holes, and the condition of the premises is worse than ever in a very Short time; on the other hand, when the roofs are made sound, and the drains properly laid, and trapped with stoneware gullies, and the yards are paved with a thick layer of smooth concrete on a firm foundation, the house will remain in a good sanitary condition, so long as the materials of which it is constructed hold together; but to ensure this the work must be well done, and nothing scamped. Important as this supervision is, it has frequently to bo neglected. The Inspector's district is probably so large that his hands are too full; the daily complaints must bo attended to; he cannot shelve his periodical inspections, or disinfecting duties; samples of food must bo obtained and submitted to the analyst; notices must be drafted for the clerk, and afterwards served; many hours must be wasted at the Police Court; until all these duties are performed, the Inspector has no time for house to house visitation, or for the equally important supervision of works in progress. Improvements of the 44 kind I have indicated, develop cleanly habits amongst the people. Impervious paving, substituted for mud, encourages the use of the scrubbing brush, cleanliness takes the place of dirt and squalor, purer air is breathed, the health and strength of the inhabitants improves, better wages are earned, the landlord's rent is more regularly paid, pauperism is warded off, and the rates are thus economized by money paid for Sanitary Inspection.

REPORT OF The Proceedings of the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, from the 25th March, 1889, to the 25th March, 1890. SCAVENGING, REMOVAL OF DUST, AND WATERING ROADS. The Special Committee (Consisting of the Members of the Works and Sanitary Committees), to whom it had been referred to consider and report as to the execution of the work after the expiration in August, 1889, of the then current contracts, recommended that tenders for one, two, or three years should be advertised for, that the Vestry should provide one man for each 3,200 pails, instead of for each 2,000 pails, which would have reduced the number of men from eight to five, and that alternative tenders, viz., for scavenging, watering, and the removal of dust, for scavenging and watering, and separately for the removal of dust, should bo invited. The Vestry received the report, but directed that the advertisements should invite tenders for only one year, and that the specifications and conditions of the contract should not provide with reference to men with the pails, but state that the Vestry will take such stops as they may think necessary to supervise the removal of dust. Tenders from nine persons wore received. The tenders it was proposed to accept were referred to the Works Committee to consider, and enquire what rate of wages were paid by these persons who sent up these tenders. The Committee reported that the contractors had stated when before the Committee that they paid the men employed by them the rate of wages usual for work of the kind performed by the men. The Committee recommended the 18 acceptance of Mr. Crane's tender for No. 1 district at £1,760, and the tender of Mr. Stevens for Nos. 2 and 3 districts at £3,400, and the recommendation was adopted, and Mr. Crane and Mr. Stovens entered into contracts accordingly. In January, the Sanitary Committee reported the non-removal of dust from Nos. 2 and 3 districts, and submitted a list of the various cases of neglect, and recommended that fines of 10s. in respect of each street from which on any day mentioned in the list there had been neglect to remove the dust be imposed. The recommendation of the Committee was adopted, and fines amounting to £66 10s. were imposed, and deducted from the money payable under the contract. NEW STREETS. The Vestry have made orders for paving at the cost of the owners of the houses in and of the land abutting on the following places, viz.:— Havelock Place Margaret Place Godfrey's Place Gale's Gardens 8weet Apple Square Skinner's Court Victoria Mews Prospect Terrace North Place STREETS REGULATIONS. The Streets Regulations Committee sent up to the meeting of the Vestry on the 4th April, 1889, a Report which was considered on the 9th May following. The Report, after giving some particulars of the progress of the work of giving effect to the regulations, stated that the Committee, being desirous of knowing the views of shopkeepers and costermongers, invitod to a conference a number of tradesmen in Brick Lane, Sclater Street, and other parts of the Parish and some costermongers, to ascertain their views as to the existing Sunday Morning Regulations. Nineteen shopkeepers attended, but no costermongers. The latter, it appeared, were satisfied with and conformed to the regulation requiring them to remove and clear away by 11 o'clock on Sunday mornings. The Report further stated that the greneral feeling of 19 the shopkeepers was that the tradesmen should not be interfered with until one or two o'clock, but that two or three shopkeepers were willing the time should be twelve. The Committee recommended that the first paragraph of regulation thirteen should bo altered to read thus:—"All shopkeepers are required to remove at or before 11 o'clock on Sunday mornings all things put or deposited by them on any footway or carriageway. After 11 o'clock they will be allowed to have projections not exceeding 18 inches from the fronts of the houses, provided such projections arc not lower than three feet from the footway." On the motion to adopt the Report, an amendment that the Report bo referred back to the Committee for a further Report, and for the Committee to have a conference with costermoigers and shopkeepers, on Wednesday, the 22nd May instant, was moved and carried. On the 25th of July a further Report of the Committee was presented, recommending— 1. That the first paragraph of regulation No. 13 be altered by adding to it "but that shopkeepers be allowed after 11 o'clock on Sunday mornings to have projections not exceeding 18 inches, but not lower than three feet from the pavement." 2. Your Committeo have given opportunity (by formal notice) to the dilFerent shopkeepers infringing the regulation to come beforo the Committee and make any statement with regard to their infringement of the regulation. Many of the shopkeepers attended; most of them agreed to conform, but others objected to conform until a member of the Vostry who infringes the regulation is made to conform. The Committee feel it dosirable to report this fact to the Vestry before taking proceedings against the member referred to. To the question to adopt the first paragraph of the Report there was an amendment that 12 o'clock should be substituted for 11 o'clock in regulation No. 13. The amendment was carried, but on being put as a substantive motion, a further amendment "That regulation No. 13 be no longer enforced, and be deemed to be omitted from the regulations,'' was moved and carried. No action was taken as to paragraph two of the Report. 20 In August a letter from a tradesman in Brick Lane was read and referred to the Streets Regulation Committee. The letter was as follows:— "I wish to offer my protect in the strongest terms against the disgraceful obstruction in Brick Lane yesterday morning. Surely you will not let the middle of the road bo blocked up with barrows as well as the side, so that wither people nor carts can pass through. With no Police, no Inspector, no protection whatever, you will ruin the shops by blocking the customers out. The Parish Autherities are doing their best to injure the ratepayers of the Parish by encouraging costers from other Parishes, "who manage their affairs better than wo do,' to compete with us, and cause obstruction witheut contributing one farthing towards the expenses. Moreover, they leave an extra moss of garbage behind, which we have to pay to he cleared away. Trusting this letter will have some influence on these who are responsible for the disgraceful state of things, I beg to remain, "Yours, &c. "P.S.—Are we not erntitled to a little peace on Sundays? Is this shocking turmoil to go on all day long? If so, I for one will not stand it. But surely there is a law to stop this dreadful, horrible hell-upon-earth state of affairs. If you have not the courage to stop it, well, then, you had better put it in the hands of the Police." In November, a Report was presented as follows:— Tho Committee have considered the letter roferred to them on the 4th of August, and also a copy of a statement addressed to the County Council by the Superintendent of Victoria Park, as to the congregating of stalls and barrows at the entrances to the Park on Sundays and holiday times. Tho Committee find that since the enforcement of the Sunday Morning Regulation, No. 13, has been abandoned, the condition of the streets has become very bad. It has beoomo impossible to sweep the streets on Sundays as was done, on account of the streets being occupied by stalls, barrows, carts, and other things, so that, altheugh the streets are swept early every Sunday morning, the refuse left by the Sunday traders remains practically until Monday. Hie amount of refuse left is very largo, and the vegetable 21 substance, of which it chiefly consists, causes the streets to be in an offensive condition. Tho Committee consider that steps should be taken to prevent the existing state of things, which can only be done by enforcing a regulation requiring the removal of barrows, carts, stalls, &c., by a specified time on Sunday mornings. And recommend that the resolution of the Vestry that regulation No. 13 bo no longer enforced bo rescinded, and that the first clause of the regulation be altered thus: "All shopkeepers are required to remove at or beforo twelve o'clock on Sunday mornings all things put or deposited by them on any carriageway, and all things put or deposited by them on any footway, and extending beyond 18 inches from any house or premisesand that the second clause of the regulation bo altered by inserting twelve o'clock, instead of eleven o'clock. On the motion that the recommendations contained in the Report be adopted, debate arose, and the further consideration was adjourned. On the debate being resumed, an amendment that the subject stand over for six mouths was moved and carried; but that resolution was subsequently rescinded, and in February the recommendations of the Committee were approved and adopted. Regulation No. 13, as altered, is— Sunday Morninga.—All shopkeepers are required to remove, at or beforo twelve o'clock at noon on Sundays, all things put or deposited by them on any carriageway, and all things put or deposited by them on any footway, and extending beyond 18 inches from any house or premises. And all barrows, carts, stalk, and things of every sort belonging to costermongers, street hawkers, or itinerant traders, must be removed and cleared away from the foot and carriage ways at or beforo twelve o'clock at noon on Sundays. SANITARY. The Report of the Special Committee appointed to consider the Report made on the inquiry by Messrs. Cubitt Nichols and 22 Shirley F. Murphy, embodied in the last Annual Report, came on for consideration in September, when the further consideration was adjourned to October 17th, and at the mooting that day the consideration of the report had to bo further adjourned. Afterwards special meetings of the Vestry to consider the Report were held, the result of which was the decision that there should bo an exporienced and responsible head of the Sanitary Department, that an additional Sanitary Officer be appointed, and a District, as recommended by the Report, assigned to each of the three Inspectors, and it was referred to the Special Committee to prepare Draft Regulations, under the 35th section of the Sanitary Act, 1866, as to houses lot in lodgings. The Government Bill, for the consolidation of the Public Health (Metropolis) Act, and for the Housing of the Working Classes, so affects the subject of the regulations that it has been deemed advisable to postpone the preparation of the Draft Regulations. On the 2nd January, the offer of Dr. Rate, the Medical Officer of Health, to control the work of the Sanitary Inspectors for twelve months, without extra remuneration, was accepted, and these officers directed to act generally under his instructions. In December, Mr. Gerald Watts, who had been employed in the Sanitary Department of Mary lebone Vestry, was elected the third Sanitary Inspector, at a salary of £120 per annum. Ho entered upon his duties in January last. His conduct not having been satisfactory, he resigned in the first week of March. Mr. John Foot, of 6, Cheyne Row, Chelsea, has since been selected to succeed Mr. Watts as Sanitary Inspector. There appeared in November, in the Daily Telegraph, a letter dated the 16th November, to the Editor by a member of the Vestry, as follows:— "to the editor of the 'daily telegraph' "Sir,—Permit me, as leader of the opposition, and the mover of the amendment, to point out that which was omitted in your roport of yesterday's proceedings at the Bethnal Green Vestry. 23 "Wo are not, as the vote proved, desirous as a body to shelve this important question; but the ruling members of the old Sanitary Committee—who love power and position rather than Parish purity—oppose by every possible moans any alteration in the sanitary autherity. "This committee for many years has been presided over by two comparatively rich men, who were practically the sanitary autherities of the parish. Some good work has been done through prossure of public opinion; but whom they would they condemned, and whom they would they condoned. They had the entire control of the two inspectors; they seldom reported to the Vestry, and only then when work beyond their powersuch as Torrens's Act, &o.—made it absolutely necessary. "As for back as 1885 the medical officer wished the inspectors to roport to him daily, that ho might direct their actions. The senior inspector (who had been a stationer) objected, to use his own exprostion, 'to work in loading strings,' and preferred to be responsible to the committee only. The committee virtually supported him by adjourning the subject for six months, and it has never been revived, notwithstanding the fact that twentyseven out of thirty-eight Metropolitan parishes have seen the wisdom of the medical officer directing this important department. "The reformers finding it impossible to curry this recommendation in committee, I was obliged to move the following amendment in opposition to my own colleagues: "That, in the opinion of the Vestry, the important work of the Sanitary Department should be placed under the control and guidance of a practical and responsible officer as head of the staff. This, I am glad to say, was carried by 16 against 3. "I am, 8ir, yours faithfully, "Oval House, Flacknoy Road, "John B. Kyffiw. "November lGth." The letter was referred to the Sanitary Committee, who reported as follows:— 1. That the statements made in the second paragraph of the letter are found not to be based on facts. 2. That the statements in the third paragraph of the letter are also found not to be based on facts. The Sanitary Inspectors have always been directly responsible to the Sanitary Committee as a Committee, and not to any two Members of the Committee, as practically the Sanitary Autherities of the Parish. 21 3. Sanitary Inspector Lapworth has for eight years hold a certifirate of the Sanitary Institute. He has boon for nineteen yoars Sanitary Inspector, and immediately previous to his appointment as Sanitary Inspector he had been for eight yoars a clerk in the Surveyor's Department. 4. Although the writer of the letter was for twelve months a ber of the Sanitary Committee, ho did not attend ono of the Committee meetings. His suggestion as to partiality of administration by the Committee is not therefore based on personal knowledge of the working of the Committee, and the Committee report the suggestion is without foundation. The Report was approved and adopted by the Vestry. MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. The Local Government Board issued, under the Local Government Act, 1888, a General Order (Metropolis) Regulations as to Medical Officers of Health, with reference to the appointment of Medical Officers under the Act of 1888. By that Act it is provided that when a Medical Officer is appointed under that Act half of his salary shall be paid by the County Council. To obtain the benefit offered it was necessary the Medical Offioer should be re-appointed, with the sanction of the Local Government Board, and when so re-appointed would become subject to the control in several respects of the Local Government Board. On the order being received from the Local Government Board, it was referred for consideration and Report to a Special Committee, consisting of the Works and Sanitary Committees. A Conference on the Local Government Board Regulations was convened by the Vestry of Camber well. The Vestry appointed three delegates to attend the Conference. The resolutions passed at the Conference were referred to the Sanitary Committee, who recommended the adoption by the Vestry of the resolution passed at the Conference :—"That pending further legislation upon the subject, it is not desirable at present to alter in any way the relationship between the Medical Officer of Health and the Local Autherity, and that therefore no action be taken upon the order of the Local Government Board ;" and the recommendation was adopted. 25 RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING STREETS, LIGHTING, SEWERS WORK, AND ROAD WORK.

POORS' LAND CHARITY. No scheme has, during the period of this Report, been established, the matter being still in progress. In December, 1889, the Vestry appointed a deputation of ten members to attend the London County Council and oxplain the viows of the Vestry with regard to the future dealing with the Poors' Land. The printing and issue of an amended account of the Parochial Charities, founded on Mr. Boase's Report of 1859, stands over till the Poors' Land Schomo is established. PARMITER'S FOUNDATION.

Tho rate was in October made accordingly. In January, 1890, Mr. Hay was appointed a member of the Special Committee, in place of Mr. Smither. 27 PAYING BONDS. In April, 1889, Paving Bond No. 27 for £500, granted to Miss M. M. Wood, was by ballot selected for redemption. In October the Bond was paid off. COLLECTION OF RATES. In April, 1889, the Vestry ordered the Report of the Committee to bo printed, which was done, and a copy sent to each member of the Vestry. On the Report being presented, the Vestry resolved— 1. That the Collectors bo paid by salary, instead of commission. 2. That for the purposes of collection, the North Ward bo one area. The two divisions of the West Ward bo consolidated, and the West Ward bo another aroa. The South Ward bo another area. The East Ward be dividod into two areas. That one such area consist of that part of the East Ward lying West of a lino drawn along the centres of Bonner Road and Warley Streot, and North of a lino drawn along the centre of Old Ford Road, from the corner of Bonner Road to the Canal Bridge, and that the other of such two areas consist of that part of the East Ward lying East and South of the said linos respectively, and of the part lying East of the Canal between the said Canal Bridge and the Northern boundary of the Parish. 3. That the old Collectors bo paid a salary of £180, and the now Collectors a salary of £ 150 per annum, with a yearly increase of £5, up to £180. That the Vestry pay for each Collector the premium on a Policy by a Guarantee Society, approved by the Vestry, on such sum, not loss than £500, nor above £1000, as the Vestry may from time to time determino in respect of each of the Collectors. 4. That the existing Collectors bo allowod to carry on any business at present carried on by them for three years, but not longer, but that no new person appointod a Collector shall engage in any business or occupation other than the collection of rates of this Parish witheut the express sanction of the Vestry. 5. That no Collector shall employ any assistance in collecting rates witheut the consent of the Vestry. 6. That each of the present Collectors have the option, according to seniority, to select one of the proposed areas for collection. 28 It was referred to the Finance Committee, with Mossrs. J. V. Jones, Messrs. Abbott, Kyffin, Francis, Bedford, Shrimpton, Smither, Rtainos, Pickard, to define the duties of the Collectors and to give effect to the Resolutions above sot forth. The Special Committee reported to the Vestry on the reference made to them, and the Report was on the 20th Juno, 1889, approved by the Vestry. Mr. Eagles elected to take the collection of the South Ward, Mr. Smith that of the North, Mr. Shenton that of the West Division of the East Ward, and Mr. Liobrecht that of the West Ward, but Mr. Liebrecht asked to bo allowed to employ assistance. The Vestry consented to the request of Mr. Liebrecht, subject to his assistant giving security to the satisfaction of the Vestry. Tho Vestry appointed the Collectors to collect the poor and parochial rates in the Wards selected by the Collectors during the ploasuro of the Vestry and subject to the existing resolutions and bye-laws relating to the duties, salaries, and allowances to the Collectors of rates. It was referrod to the Special Committeo to select candidates for the election by the Vostry of a Collector for the East Division of the East Ward. Advertisements were issued and the Special Committee selected six candidates. On the 4th July the Vestry elected Mr. Arthur William Shonton as Collector for the East Division of the East Ward. COAL AND WINE DUES. In April, 1889, the Vostry considered a Resolution of the Vostry of St. George, Hanover Square, that in view of the non-renewal of the Coal and Wine Dues it would be inequitable to place the burden for Metropolitan improvements solely on ratepayers and thereby increase their charges about 3d. in the £. The Vestry resolved "That the cost of all public improvements should be charged on the ground landlords who derive the main 29 benefit from them, and who have hitherto escaped their quota of the cost of effecting such improvements." Copies of the Resolution were sent to the County Council and to the Members of Parliament for the Borough. ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE. In April, 1889, the Vestry appointed the following members as the Assessment Committee:— Abbott. Francis. Pickard. Bedford. Hilditch. Shrimpton. Bishop. J. V. Jones. Smither. Ewin. Norris. Staines. In July, 1889, Messrs. Ewin, Norris, and Staines were reelected, and Mr. Gould was elected in place of Mr. Smither, as members of the Assessment Committee. QUINQUENNIAL VALUATION. In January, 1890, a Special Committee of 20 members of the Vestry was appointed to prepare the Overseers' Valuation List under the Valuation (Metropolitan) Act, 1869. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notices of intention to apply to the Board of Trade for provisional orders for the supply of Electric Lighting over areas including the Parish were received from the Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, the London Electric Supply Association, Mr. Sydney Morse on behalf of the promoters of a Company intended to bo formed, the North London Electric Supply Corporation, the North London Electric Lighting Company, and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Only the last named Company proceeded actively as regards this Parish. The Vestry, on the recommendation of the Parliamentary Committee, refused to consent to the Parish being included within the limits of the area proposed to bo dealt with by the Company. It appeared that it was not suggested that the order should impose an obligation on the Company to supply Electric Lighting within the Parish. 30 CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION. A claim was made on the Vestry in consequence of the death of William Hicks by a fall from a vehicle he was driving in Old Ford Road. At the inquest a verdict was found that "the Parochial Authorities were to blame for the state of the road." No request was made that the Vestry should be represented at the inquest held, though it was alleged notice had been given to the vestry. The subject was referred to the Works Committee, who reported to the Vestry in May, 1890. From the Report it appeared that from inquiries made and evidence obtained by the Committee the accident was not attributable to any defect in the road, nor that there was evidence at the inquest to justify the verdict given, imputing blame to the Vestry. The Vestry repudiated liability, and no proceedings have been taken against the Vestry in the matter. A claim was made in respect of an injury sustained by a fall alleged to have been consequent on defective paving in Boundary Street. The Vestry refused to entertain the claim. MEMBERS OF THE VESTRY. Mr. Haslop resigned his office as a member in May, 1889. At the Annual Election of Guardians for the Parish a member of the Vestry was returned as elected. Objection was made as to his qualification, in being rated in respect of Club promises, for which his name appeared in the rate book in the North Ward as "occupier." The Local Government Board communicated their opinion to the Vestry (held on the 18th July, 1889), that the member was not entitled to be rated and not qualified for election as a guardian. The Vestry in October, 1889, resolved to insert the names of the persons registered as Trustees under the Friendly Societies' Acts as occupiers in respect of the Club premises in the rates then to be made, and to amend the previous quarter's rates by inserting as occupiers the names of the persons registered as Trustees of the Club. 31 MAIN ROADS. Id June, 1880, the Works Committee reported recommending that the County Council ho informed that it is undesirable to alter the present arrangements for maintenance of Main Roads, as the taking over of such roads by the County Council would inflict hardship on the poorer parishes and on these not centrally situated. The Vestry adopted the recommendation. Tho County Council having intimated that it would be their duty to consider any application to declare theroughfares to be "Main Roads," the Works Committeo reported recommending that application be made to the Council to declare certain roads in the Parish, specified in the Report, to be Main Roads. The approximate lengths in yards were, of Macadam Road, 4170; fully-paved roads, 39,300; roads paved for half-widths only, 3905. Tho Report was approved, and application mado to the Council. URINAL AND CHALET ACCOMMODATION. A Memorial was presented to the Vestry asking that some public Urinal accommodation bo provided near Bethnal Green Junction Railway Station. The Works Committee reported that they considered such accommodation was needed. The Surveyor, by request of the Committoe, sought a site. He provisionally arranged terms for permission by the Railway Company to erect a Urinal on vacant land in Tapp Street, the Vostry paying 5b. per annum to the Railway Company, and erecting and keeping the Urinal in proper condition. The Committeo recommended the aceeptance of the terms offered by the Railway Company, and that a six-stall Urinal be erected. The Vestry approved of the terms arranged with the Railway Company, and referred the subject to the Works Committee to report further as to the Urinal proposed to be erected. The Committee reported that no Urinal in stock would satisfy the requirements of the Railway Company, and recommended that a Urinal similar to that in Austin Street 32 should bo constructed, the foundation and drainage to be executed by the Vestry's workmen, and the fittings supplied by Messrs. Jennings, of Lambeth. In Juno, 1889, the Vestry resolved that the Chalet in Whitechapel Road, having for several months been closed and disused, and causing complaints, should be removed, and directed notice to bo given to the Liquidator of the Chalet Company accordingly. The County Council wrote to the Vestry suggesting the provision of Chalet accommodation for each sex. The letter was referred to the Works Committee. The Report of the Committee, suggesting that the Vestry tako no action, was approved. LOCAL PETTY SESSIONS. On the suggestion of the Vestry of Hackney, this Vestry appointed twelve delegates to join a deputation to the Home Secretary with a view to the provision of sittings by Local Justices to deal with complaints arising out of Sanitary, School Board, and other local summonses. ROYAL ACADEMY. ! j A reply was received from the Council of the Academy to the [< request of the Vestry, that the Academy should bo opened at a i reduced charge for admission 011 Saturday evenings, stating that I after careful consideration thero were practical difficulties which 1 made it impossible to comply with the Vestry's request. CANROBERT STREET PASSAGE. ] Tho Vostry, in consequence of complaints made, applied to the ' Justices to stop up the Passage under a house in Canrobort Streot. L The application was successful, and the passago has beon stopped 1 up. PROJECTIONS ON FOOTWAYS. In September, 1889, the Works Committee reported that in 1 Ureen Stroet and Choster Place pilasters had been orected by Mr. .' 33 Fortescue projecting nine inches on the public footways. The Vestry determined to require the removal of the pilasters, the restoration to the full width of the footway paving, and that in default of the requirements being complied with, legal proceedings, under direction of the Works Committee, should bo taken. The Vestry subsequently passed a resolution requiring, in accordance with 57 Geo. III., o. 29, that Mr. Fortescue should remove the projections complained of, and that notices bo served upon him accordingly. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. The Great Eastern Railway Company introduced a Bill (since enacted) which as regards this Parish provided for the widening of the Company's Lino from Bethnal Green Junction Station to Hackney Downs on the Eastern side of the route. As the result of negotiations with the Company, provisions protecting the interests of the Vestry were secured. The material particulars appear in the Surveyor's Report. The Regent's Canal City and Docks Railway Company gave notice of intention to apply for an Act for the partial abandonment of their autherised works and for an extension of time for the completion of the undertaking. Tho promoters of the Columbia Market Railway gave notice of intention to apply for leave to abandon the proposed railway. STREET REGULATIONS. The Street Inspector applied for an increase of his salary. The Streot Regulations Committee, on the subject being referred to them, reported recommending that the salary be increased by 5s. per week, making 35s. per week. The Report came before the Vestry on the 20th March, 1890, and the consideration was adjourned till the next Vestry. 34 METROPOLITAN WATER COMPANIES' CHARGES. A letter was addressed to this Vestry from the Vestry of Westminster objecting to the existing right of the Water Companies to increase their charges in acoordance with the increased rateable value of premises on each quinquennial period of valuation. By direction of the Vestry a letter expressing the views to the like effect of this Vestry was sent to the Local Government Board. IMPROVEMENTS. A considerable area of land toward the eastern end of and on the south side of Columbia Road having been cleared with a view to rebuilding, the Vestry, in March, 1890, on the recommendation of the Works Committee, referred it to the Committee to ascertain and report on what conditions a portion of the land might be devoted to the widening of the road. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk. 35 Analgtical laboratory Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, w. July 8th, 1889. To the vestry of tie Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green: Chairman and Gkntlkmen,—Your Inspectors have submitted to me during the quarter ending Juno 24th, 1889, a total of 23 samples of food. These were: milk, 17 samples; coffee 2; pepper, 2; and mustard, 2. Of these, 2 milks and 2 ooffee samples were adulterated, the rest being gonuine. Each of the adulterated samplos of milk contained 20 por oont. of added water: the vendors of theso woro prosecuted, and fines of £1 each woro imposed. In purchasing the two samples of ooffoo, the word "coffee " only was used ; but on examining the packets in which the samples were contained they wero found to oontain the notioe, " This is sold as a mixturo of oofloo and chicory." Analysis showed that ono contained 50 and the other GO por oont. of chicory. Now, chioory can bo bought for loss than a quarter of the price of coffee. Tho Sanitary Committoe, desiring to test whether by the uso of such a label a vendor could supply, at an additional profit to himself, an article not asked for, directed a summons to bo issued against ono of the vendors. The case was heard by Mr. Bushby, and was ably presented on behalf of the 36 Vestry by Inspector Lapworth. The magistrate, however, ruled that the label was sufficient protection in the case of coffee. This is an unfortunate decision, since it allows coffee vendors in this parish to sell as coffee a mixture containing any amount of chicory if only somewhere on the packot are the words "Sold as a mixture." Such packets are frequently covered with advertisements of the other goods of the establishment, so that, without carefully reading through the whole of it, the notice of adulteration may bo missed. In the case of children, blind people, and those unable to road, it is absurd to call this a notice. Coffee is the only article in which such a loop-hole for adulteration is tolerated. A prosecution for the adulteration of a sample of milk. No. 1/14, commenced last quarter, was concluded in this. The vendor disputed the correctness of my analysis; but on reforence to Somerset House, the chemists there upheld my conclusions. Tho vendor was accordingly fined £5 and costs. A total of £7 for fines has been paid into the Vestry's account this quarter. I remain Your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, F.C.S., F.I.C., Public Analyst. _ SALE Of Food and ?

Chairman and Gentlemen, During the quarter ending September 29th. 1889, your Inspectors have submitted to me for analysis 55 samples of food. These consisted of the following articles:- Milk. 33; Pepper, 8; Mustard, 8; Butter, 4; and Coffee 2 samples. Of all these only six samples of Milk were adulterated. In one case, where only 5 percent. of water had been added, the vendor was merely Cautioned not to repeat the offence. In all the other cases of adulteration proceedings were taken, and fines were imposed. In two cases, tin Mill: wast taken by Mr. Weston from a country firmer when delivered at the railway station, where it was bought by a large retailer in the Parish to be distributed. On analysis, both samples were found to contain. 20 percent of water added. When summoned, the vendor, through his solicitor, raised various legal and other objections; these were, however, very ably met by Inspector Weston, and fines of £2 in each case were imposed. It is always highly satisfactory to secure the conviction of these who adulterate in this wholesale manner, and who, if not stopped, cause innocent retailors to suffer. In past quarters many samples of Pepper, bought in this district, have been found to contain olive stones, rice, and ginger; but this quarter not a solitary sample was adulterated. So, too, all the samples of Mustard were free from admixture with flour, or other foreign ingredients. The samples of Coffee contained no chicory, and wore of good quality. This quarter shows a decided improvement in the quantity of articles adulterated. Last quarter about 20 percent. of the samples were adulterated, while this quarter only about 11 percent. are adulterated. The milk supply is far bettor than it used to ho; still there is room for much improvement, for though only six samples were so adulterated as to merit prosecution, eleven others were so poor as only just to come above the standard. In two other cases the purpose of the purchase was evidently suspected, and extra cream was added by the vendors to make them safe. The sum of £6 10s. for fines has been allotted to the Vestry this quarter. I remain your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, F.C.S., F.I.O., Public Analyst. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875.

STOKES, F.C.S., F.I.C., Public Analyst. 41 Analytical Laboratory Vestry Hali, Harrow Road, W., January 9th, 1890. To the Vestry of the Parish of St Matthew, Bethnal Green. Chairman and Gentlemen, During tho last quarter of tho yoar 1889, I have received from your Inspectors 13 samples of food for analysis. Those wore all of them samples of Milk and they wore all genuine, none of them having been either watered or skimmed. Though the number of samples taken was too small for one to conclude that the mass of Milk sold in the Parish was equally pure, yet it is very satisfactory to find that so many samples of Milk can be purchased in an unadulterated condition. There was a time when it would not have been equally possible. This result is mainly due to the persistent efforts of the Sanitary Committee, in following up known offenders, and in taking samples from the wholesale dealers at the railway stations. Reviewing the Analytical work of the whole year, wo find that in 1889 a total of 133 samples were examined, consisting of Milk 105, Pepper 10, Mustard 10, Coffee 4. and Butter 1 samples. Of these. 23 samples of Milk and 2 of Coffee proved to be adulterated; so that of all the samples purchased. 19 percent. wore adulterated; that is rather higher than last year, when the percentage was 14 only. The general average for all London, is 11 percent. Of separate articles, 22 percent. of the Milk samples proved to be adulterated, against 13 percent. in the previous year; hence Milk, on the whole, has deteriorated this year. Of the samples of Coffee, 50 percent. contained chicory. It might bo well in future to procure a more varied supply of articles, since only 5 different articles wore purchased during the year for analysis, so that many trades were exempt from the working of the Adulteration Act. As affecting the goneral population of Bethnal Green, wo find that for every 970 persons in the Parish, one sample in the whole year was anulyzed. The sum of £38 10s. for fines was ordered to bo paid into tho Vestry's account. Appending a tabulated list of the articles examined during the past quarter, I remain your obedient Servant, ALF. W.

Chairman and Gentlemen, During the quarter ending March 2.5th, 1890, I have received from your Inspectors 41 samples of food. These consisted of—Milk, 34 samples, Butter, 4, and Coffee 3. Of these, 13 samples of Milk and 1 sample of Butter wore adulterated All the samples of Coffee were genuine and of good quality. The adulterated sample of Butter was made up entirely of beef-fat, curds, water, and salt. . Unluckily the vendor could not be prosecuted, owing to the Inspector who purchased the sample having to leave the service of the Vestry; this applies also to a sample of adulterated Milk purchased by him. In two other cases the Officers of the Court omitted to give seven days' clear notice of date of hearing to the vendor, hence the summonses had to be dismissed. In all the other cases prosecutions were successfully undertaken, and fines for the dilution of Milk with water, varying from 10 to 30 percent., were imposed. These lines ranged from 10s. to £15, and were certainly more adapted to the gravities of tho offence than they used to be. A notable instance of the penalty of adulteration was given in the case of tho "Farmers' Direct Supply Association." From outside the Parish they flood the district with milk-trollies containing skim milk. This is sold as genuine whole milk at a low price, thus underselling those who reside in the Parish and who sell a genuine article. Two samples of this were taken, and were found in the one case to have been deprived of 60 percent. of the cream; and in the other case to have been deprived of 33 percent. of its croam, as well as watered to tho extent of 10 porcent. In tho first case a fino of £15 was imposed. In the second case, Mr. Weston took out two summonses, one for the watering, and one for the skimming of the sample. The case was strenuously fought by tho solicitor of tho defendant, but by the able conduct of the case by Mr. Weston, both summonses were uphold, and a tine of £5 for abstracting cream and £2 for watering the same sample were imposed; so that tho total of fines for that vendor amounted to £22. No less than 38 percent. of the samples of Milk prove to be adulterated this quarter. The fines ordered to be paid into the Vestry's account amount to £59 10s. Od.

SURVEYOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED From Lady-day, 1889, to lady-day, 1890. LONDON: j. s. foitsaitii, steam printer, 329, betiinal green road. 1890. 1 Sunuenor's Department, Vestry Hall, Church Row, Bethnal Green. July, 1890. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit to you my Report for the year ending Lady-day, 1890. GREAT EASTERN RAILWAY. During the year great progress has been made with the widening of the main lino of the Great Eastern Railway, the streets in this Parish principally affected being Arundel Street Cambridge Road Brick Lane Collingwood Street Brady Street Coventry Street Buckhurst Street Nottingham Street With the exception of Buckhurst Street, the widoning of the bridges crossing the above streets is completed, and the footways and carriageways have been restored and the necessary lamps provided and lighted at the expense of the Railway Company. Application has been made this session to Parliament by the Company for powers to double the width of the existing Railway from Bethnal Green Junction to 4 Hackney Downs. As soon as the Parliamentary plans were deposited, the subject was referred to the Parliamentary Committee of the Vestry. After consideration, both by the Parliamentary Committee and the Works Committee, your Clerk and Surveyor had several interviews with the Solicitor and Engineer of the Company, with the result that clauses for the protection of the Vestry were agreed to by the Railway Company and accepted by the Vestry. These clauses secure :— 1—The construction (as far as practicable) of watertight bridges. 2—The lighting of the public highways under the bridges at the expense of the Company. 3—Provision against loss of rates during construction of Railway. 4—Provision requiring the Railway Company (subject to conditions) to give up to the Vestry laud under the arches at Hare Place, Poyser Street and Peacock Street, for tho purpose of widening the highways. 5—For widening West Street throughout, from Clare Street to Cambridge Road. 6—For giving up strips of land next the Railway on the East side of Poyser Street, for the purpose of widening the street. 7—For removing the urinal at Hackney Road (if the widening passes over it) if and when the Vestry may think it necessary, and for re-erecting it at some other site. If the urinal is not removed, the Company are to pay the cost of lighting it day and night. 8—For the extension of the down nlatform at Cambridge Heath Station. 9—For paving, &c., under the bridges. 5 PAVING WORKS. The carriageways of Weaver Street and Bratley Street were paved with 4-inch pitchings on concrete at a cost of £283 2s. 4d. The pebble carriageway at Eckersley Street was taken up and the whole surface of the street paved with York paving, the work being done by the Vestry's workmen. The footway of the North side of Derbyshire Street, from Abbey Street to Mape Street, was paved with Victoria paving at a cost of £266 2s. 10d. The "Rest" round the urinal in Hackney Road, opposite Cambridge Heath Station, has been considerably enlarged and paved with York paving, the work being done by the Vestry's workmen. The footway on the South side of Florida Street, between Mansford Street and Bly the Street, has been paved with old York paving by tho Vestry's workmen. Tho footway on the West side of Mape Street, from Bethnal Green Road to Derbyshire Street, has boon paved with Victoria paving. The footway on the West side of Globe Road, from Green Street, southwards to the Parish boundary, has been paved with Victoria paving at a cost of £143 7s. 7d. The carriageway of Sclater Street was taken up and redressed and relaid on nine inches of concrete, the cost, including the necessary new stone required to make up deficiency, being £418 10s. Id. The carriageways of Christopher Street and Sherwood Place have been paved with 4-inch pitchings on six inches of concreto at a cost of £201 2s. 8d., the paving of the footways being done by the Vestry's workmen. The centre of the carriageway of Betlmal Green Road, between White Street and Hague Street, was taken up and redressed and relaid at a cost of £229 18s, Veaver Street Bratley Street Eckersley Street Derbyshire Street Hackney Road Florida Street Mape Street Globe Road Sclater Street Christopher Street Sherwood Place Bethnal Green Road 6 The footways in Anglesea Street, Clarence Street, and on the South side of Selby Street were paved with Victoria paving at a cost of £250 l6s., the footway on tho North side of Selby Street being paved by the Vestry's workmen with old York paving removed from tho other streets. The wood paving in Bishop's Road in front of the workhouse, which was laid in 1883, beginning to shew signs of decay and some dangerous holes appearing, some repairs were earned out at a cost of £13 13s. 7d. The paving of the carriageway at Prince's Court has been carried out with 4-inch pi tellings on six inches of concrete, at a cost of £244 10s. 2d., the repaving of the footways being done by the Vestry's workmen. Part of the carriageway paving under the railway arch crossing Nottingham Street was relaid at a cost of £31 5s. 9d. The whole surface of the Eastern portion of Cooper's Gardens has been paved with concrete paving at a cost of £95 13s. 2d. The yard surrounding the disinfecting house at Digby Street Yard has been paved with conerete paving at a cost of £36 14s. The carriageway of Boundary Street, which is divided longitudinally between Shoreditch and Bethnal Green, being in very bad condition, a communication was received from the Shoreditch Vestry, calling attention to the matter, and asking that some arrangement should be made for re-paving it. On the recommendation of the Works Committee, the Vestry resolved "that the carriageway of Boundary Street bo "re-paved with 3-inch by 7-inch pitchings on nine inches "of concrete, the Bethnal Green Vestry to pay the "contractor for so much of the work as is in Bethnal Anglesea Street Selby Street Clarence Street Bishop's Road Prince's Court Nottingham Street Cooper's Gardens Digby Street Yard Boundary Street 7 "Green Parish, and tho Shoreditch Vestry to pay for "the remainder." On communicating this resolution to the Shoreditch Vestry, they refused to agree to re-paving the road, although it was at their request the matter was considered. Under those circumstances the Bethnal Green side of tho road is being repaired temporarily. The footway on the North side of Cudworth Street, abutting on the railway, has been paved with York paving and a gateway crossing formed and paved to each of the railway arches, the work being carried out by the Vestry's Contractor at the expense of the Great Eastern Railway Company. ROADS, &c. In the month of November it became necessary to provide a now pair of driving wheels for the steam roller. These were supplied by Messrs. Aveling & Porter, at a cost of £40. By the use of the steam roller, damage was done to some of the Water Company's mains, and the sum of £5 1s. l0d. has been paid to the Water Company for repairs. A new rubbish cart was purchased of Mr. Brooks, of Bethnal Green Road, at a cost of £20. On June 3rd, one of the horses belonging to the Vestry died, and another horse was subsequently purchased at a cost of £60. The practice of the contractors' men of sweeping slop into the gullies instead of loading it into the carts has been the subject of occasional complaint, but it is difficult of detection. In two instances the offence was clearly proved, and the contractor fined £5 in each case. The National Pure Drinking Water Automatioc Supply Association, Limited, placed several of their Cudworth Street Steam Roller Carts & Horses cavenging Obstructions 8 automatic machines on the footways in various parts of the Parish, and no notice being taken of several requests for their removal, instructions were given that they should be impounded, when the Company removed them themselves. Macadam Roads The following roads have been made up with broken granite and steam-rolled:— Anglesea Street Artillery Street Bonner Road (Bishop's Road to Approach Road) Coventry Street Cranbrook Street Collins Place Collingwood Street Cudworth Street Daniel Street Gloucester Street Havelock Place Menotti Street (between Cheshire Street and London Street) Morpeth Street Mount Street Now Tyssen Street Newport Street Oval (part) Oxford Street Old Ford Road (part) Palm Street Preston Street (part) Ravenscroft Street Selby Street Tagg Street (part) Turin Street Virginia Road (Austin Street to Boundary Street) Small repairs have also been executed in the following Streets, and the patches rolled with the steam roller:— Antill Road Arundel Street Baxendale Street Durant Street Hague Street Mace Street Minerva Street Middleton Street Quilter Street St. Jude Street Wimbolt Street Great destruction is caused to macadam roads by children digging up the stones, especially on the roads which have just been made up and rolled. 9 When Turin Street was repaired, numbers of the boys on leaving the Board School set to work to dig up the road, and it became necessary to keep a watchman in the street on several evenings to prevent further damage. The channels in the following roads have been paved, the work being done by the Vestry's workmen:— Channelling Anglesea Street Bonner Road (Bishop's Road to Approach Road) Collins Place Cudworth Street Gloucester Street Havelock Place (one side) Newport Street Palm Street Preston Street (part) Selby Street Tagg Street The subject of the maintenance of the main roads under the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1888, has involved the preparation of a list of main roads, which was forwarded to the London County Council, with a request that they should be declared main roads under the Act. Main roads. Whitechapel Road Bethnal Green Road Green Street Roman Road Nottingham Street White Street Squirries Street Warner Place Cambridge Road Cleveland Street Three Colt Lane London Street Winchester Street Hare Street Sclater Street Hackney Road Prospect Place, Bishops Road Sewardstone Road (from Approach Road to Old Ford Road) The following is the list referred to:— 10 Bonner Road Grove Road Warley Street Bonner Road Pedley Street Buxton Street Brick Lane Brady Street Pritchards Road Old Ford Road Code Street Being a total length of roadway of about eight and three quarter miles. Considerable attention was given to the subject by the "Works Committee, and on their recommendation it was resolved to inform the London County Council: "That in the opinion of this Vestry it is very undesir"able that any alteration should be made in the present "arrangements for the maintenance of main roads, as the "taking over of these roads by the Council would inflict "hardship on the poorer parishes, and on those not "centrally situate, who would be called upon to contribute "towards the maintenance of the expensive roads in "the Centre and West of London, and such contribution "would in all probability largely exceed the sum they "might receive from any common fund raised for the "purpose of maintaining the main roads." The Council appear eventually to have adopted this view, as when they had received the applications from the whole of the local authorities, they refused to entertain any of them, and resolved to take some steps with a view to the amendment of that portion of the Act relating to main roads, as being inapplicable to London. Ion Square In connection with the improvement and paving of Ion Square, by arrangement with the Freeholder the 11 wall separating Ion Square and Durant Street was removed, and a thoroughfare made for foot traffic. This is a great convenience to the public generally, and has been accomplished without cost to the Vestry. The following Tenders were accepted for tools, materials, &c.:— Tool, Material, &c. Lime, Pipes, &c Mr. T. Blythe. Scavengers' Brooms Mr. Tyrie. Broken Guernsey Granite Mr. W. Griffiths. Fodder Mr. T. Cook. Mr. Whitmore. Jobbing Cartage Mr. Wells. Plumber's Work Mr. Paine. Thames Ballast & Hoggin Mr. Stevens. Lamps Mr. Nathan. Coals Messrs. James & Co. The tramway in Hackney Road between Great Cambridge Street and Weymouth Terrace, and in Grove Road between the Canal Bridge and South Hackney, has been reconstructed by the Tramway Company, steel girder rails have been substituted for the old iron rails and wooden sleepers. Tramways The Gas and Water Companies have paid to the Vestry for trenches opened during the year the following amounts:— Trenches £ s. d. Gas-Light and Coke Co 190 3 10 Commercial Gas Co 21 5 4 East London Water Works Co 264 8 0 £475 17 2 12 Street Watering The quantity of water used for street watering was 5,695,000 gallons, anil its cost £203 3s., the sum of £37 4s. was paid for rents of meters and repairs. These are the smallest amounts which have been paid for this purpose for some years. NEW STREETS. Plans, Estimates, and Apportionments have been prepared and adopted by the Vestry for paving the following new streets, viz.:— and the work has been carried out in the following:— Digby Walk Eastman Street Grauby Row Gales Gardens Havelock Place Ion Square North Place Margarot Place Sweet Apple Square Thomas Passage Victoria Mews It has been necessary to take Police Court proceedings in several cases to recover the amounts due, and in the case of Thomas Passage, where the owner refused to pay, an action was commenced in the High Court of Justice, but after some months' delay and considerable trouble in obtaining evidence in support of the case of the Vestry, the money was paid without the case going for trial. During the year the sum of £1,351 1s. 2d. has been collected and paid in to the credit of the "New Streets' Account." Name of Street. Galea Gardens.. Havelock Place Margaret Place North Place Prospect Terrace Skinner's Court Victoria Mews Amount of Estimate and Apportionment. £501 13 8 72 1 0 125 3 1 57 9 2 124 2 10 67 7 7 118 11 6 13 GENERALLY. Nine claims for compensation were made against the Vestry, some of them of a very frivolous character, for instance, the sum of £10 was claimed for compensation for injuries to a woman, who stated that she trod on some potato peelings on the footway in Columbia Road in front of the Market. All the claims were investigated and havo been abandoned. Claims for Compensation The sum of £3 13s. 3d. was paid to the owner of some houses in Mead Street, for expenses incurred by reason of the stoppage of the public sewer. The Chalet in Whitechapel Road having been closed for some time, and being a nuisance, and the Chalet Company, Limited, being in liquidation, the Vestry resolved to call upon the liquidator to remove the building. As some considerable time elapsed, and nothing was done by the liquidator, notice was given that, in accordance with the terms of the agreement under which it was erected, the Vestry would remove it. The building was taken down by the Vestry's workmen, and the materials sold; the amount realised being about sufficient to pay the cost of pulling down and making good the site. Calet A quantity of old iron at Digby Street yard was old Iron sold for 27s. 6d. per ton. An estimate and apportionment for paving Brady's Buildings as a new street was prepared, but as your Surveyor reported to the "Works' Committee that the houses were unfit for habitation; the attention of the Sanitary Committee was called to the matter. Proceedings were taken by the Committee to close the houses, mid they have since been demolished. Brady's Buildings The Store-Keeper (Mr. Rutty) was taken seriously ill in the early part of the year, and on June 25th was Digby Street Depot 14 quite unfit for duty. The Street-Keeper (Mr. Dowling) was put in charge of the yard, and Mr. Rutty resumed duty on August 12th. Temporary arrangements had also to bo made from 28th January to February 4th last, when Mr. Rutty was again laid up. Vacant Land In consequence of the complaints of nuisance caused by the vacant land at the West end of Mead Street and in Usk Street at the corner of Dullard's Place being unenclosed, notices were served upon the owners, calling upon them to fence it in with proper and sufficient hoardings, and this has been done. Insanitary Areas A letter having been received from the London County Council, asking that the Medical Officer and Surveyor to the Vestry might report upon any unhealthy area within the Parish, in company with the Medical Officer and Sanitary Inspector (Mr. Weston), I made an inspection of the whole of the houses in the area bounded on the North by Virginia Road, on the South by Church Street, on the East by Mount Street, and on the West by Boundary Street As a result of the inspection, I believe the Medical Officer has made a representation to the Council under the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings' Acts, particulars of which will be found in his report. Buildings Notices have been given under sec. 76 of the Metropolis Local Management Acts of intention to erect, and applications have been made for permission to drain:— 107 Houses. 8 Blocks of Model Dwellings. 3 Stables. 2 Schools. 29 Workshops. 1 Swimming and Public Baths. 1 Common Lodging House. 3 Warehouses. 1 Block Tramway Company's Stables, 15 But the proposal to erect 39 of the Houses and 25 Workshops has been abandoned. Applications have also been made for permission to drain:— 42 Old Houses. 2 Stables. 2 Yards. 1 Board School. The Vestry granted permission on the usual conditions for the construction of areas and coal shoots under the highways in front of 56 and 57, Old Nichol Street, 462 and 464,Bethnal Green Road,and at the "Old Crown "public house, in Brick Lane and Hare Street. In three cases the builders who neglected to give notice of intention to build, were summoned, and penalties, amounting in the total to £12 and costs, were imposed. These penalties are paid in to the credit of the Vestry. The builder of the shops in Green Street, between Chester Street and Chester Place, erected upon the footway stone pilasters projecting nine inches, and was proceeding to enclose some six inches of the site of the footway with the stall-board of the shop fronts; contending that he had the right to do so under sec. 26 of the Metropolitan Building Act of 1855. Formal notice having been given to him to remove the encroachment, ho declined to do so, and proceedings were taken against him at the Worship Street Police Court, resulting in the Magistrate deciding in favour of the Vestry. The defendant, however, is appealing to the Court of Queen's Bench against the judgment, and the question is now waiting the decision of that Court. On the now Fire Station in Green Street being opened, the old one in Bethnal Green Road was closed. The Protection from Fire 16 London County Council applied for and the Vestry granted permission to the Council to place a fere escape and watch-box in Bethnal Green Road, at the corner of Pollard Row, and also in St. Peter Street, at the corner of Hackney Road. Canrobert Passage Numerous complaints having been made as to the passage leading under one of the houses in Canrobert Street into some mows off Claremont Street, it was visited both by the Sanitary and Works Committee on several occasions, and the Vestry ultimately came to the conclusion that it was desirable that it should be closed. Proceedings were taken under Michæl Angelo Taylor's Act, with a view of obtaining a Magistrate's order to close it; and the Magistrates, after inspecting it, made the order. Brick walls were then built across each entrance by the Vestry's workmen, but were partially demolished a few days after by some of the public. The passage was then filled up (so that if the walls were pulled down it could not be used), and the walls rebuilt, and they have not been again interfered with. Shooting Rubbish It has been found necessary to take proceedings in a number of cases against tradesmen and others for throwing vegetable and other refuse upon the highways, and in every case a conviction has been obtained. In those cases where the defendant had not before been summoned small penalties have been imposed, but for second or subsequent offences the Magistrates have inflicted substantial penalties. In one case a man was in the habit of bringing a quantity of refuse at midnight on Saturdays, and shooting it in the road, and when detected gave a false address, he was 17 Arrested on a warrant and ordered to pay a fine of 10s. and 4s. costs. SEWERS, &c. The necessity for some accommodation near Bethnal Green Junction has long been apparent, but there did not appear to be any site on the public highways suitable for the purpose. Negotiations were commenced with the Engineer of the Great Eastern Railway Company with a view of acquiring a site on the vacant land adjoining the Railway in Tapp Street opposite the entrance to the Railway Station, with the result that the Company agreed to let to the Vestry sufficient land for the purpose at an annual rent of 5s. (as mentioned in the last year's report). The Vestry then authorised the erection of a urinal to accommodate six persons, and this was done; the drainage, brickwork, &c., being carried out by the Vestry's workmen, and the fittings by Messrs. Jennings, of Lambeth; the total cost being under £100. This accommodation has proved of great benefit to the neighbourhood, the Railway arches being much cleaner than hitherto. Urinals The cost of water (including meter ronts) supplied to the urinals during tho year, was £134 8s. Tho sum of £18 lCJs. was paid for wator for flushing Flushing sewers. ewers Tho cost of tho water supplied to tho Vestry Hall for tho year, was £3 ; at Digby Street Dopot, £4 8s. 3d.; and at tho mortuary, £1 10s. Water Supply Permission was granted to tho owner of some houses which wero being rebuilt at the South AVest corner of Weaver Street, to ereot tho W.C's. over tho sito of the old boundary sewer, which passed through the gardens of the old houses, Weaver Street 18 LIGHTING.

The Lamp Columns in Green Street, Bothnal Green Road, Cambridgo Road, &o., which wore erected about eight years ago, were fitted with double cast iron ladder irons. The east iron occasionally contained Haws, and as the lamplighters oomplained about the risk, the whole of the cast ladder irons were removed, and plain wrought iron substituted. Cost of Lighting. The cost of public lighting during the year was as follows:— Gas Light and Coke Co., for lighting public Lamps £2959 0 11 Gas Light and Coke Co., for Vestry Hall, Mortuary, Digby Street yard, and St. John's Church Clock 68 9 6 Gas Light and Coke Co., for alterations and now services 26 16 2 Commercial Gas Co., for lighting public Lamps 312 8 3 £3366 14 10 Amount repaid to Vestry for private Lighting 18 4 8 Net Total £3348 10 2 21 The following amounts were paid for labour during Labour. the year:— Foreman (Mr. Stone) £130 0 0 Storekeeper (Mr. Rutty) 93 0 0 Yardman 116 7 3 Paviors 178 11 0 Masons 187 1 5 Bricklayer and Labourer (additional for building Urinal, &c.) 10 8 3 Sower men 541 3 6 Carmen 173 15 3 Road men and Labourers 789 5 4 Stone-breaking 80 0 0 Tying trees, &c. 4 9 2 Scavengers (including SundayScavenging 1454 5 3 Watchmen 88 16 0 Sanitary Department—pailmen and infecting 685 3 6 Allowances to men during illness 12 10 0 Contributions to Sick, Burial and Benefit Fund 61 17 0 £4609 12 11 being £37 less than last year. During the strike of Dock Labourers, the men employed by the contractors for scavenging and removing dust, struck work. Although the Vestry was in vacation, a meeting of the Works' Committee was hastily summoned, and the Committee met daily until the difficulty was over. Shortly afterwards the scavengers employed by the Vestry sent in a memorial asking for higher wages; the whole question of the labour employed by the Vestry was then carefully considered by the Committee and the Committee reported to the Vestry recommending that the wages of each of the road sweepers then receiving 20s. weekly, should be increased to 21s. weekly, also that a Sick, Burial and Benefit Fund for 22 the whole of the workmen employed by the Vestry should be established on the following principle:- Copy of the Scheme adopted by the Vestry. St. Matthew's, Bethnal Green, Vestry. SCHEME FOR EMPLOYES' SICK, BURIAL, AND BENEFIT FUND.

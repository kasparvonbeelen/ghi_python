BET 79 St Matthew, Bethnal Green. SANITARY STATISTICS AND PROCEEDINGS for THE YEAR 1865. THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON : PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, by j. s. forsaith, bethnal green road, n.e. 1866. REPORT. July, 1866. Gentlemen,— I am happy to inform you that there was a considerable improvement in the health of the inhabitants of this District during the past year, and that the number of Deaths fell from 3050 in 1864 to 2770 in 1865—shewing a decrease of 280 This decrease was specially marked in those diseases which are influenced by sanitary measures, and the deaths fell from 725 in 1864 to 603 in 1865 in this the Zymotic class. Those were registered as follows:— 1864. 1865. Fever 137 122 Small Pox 16 39 Measles 174 27 Scarlatina 138 145 Diphtheria 12 11 Diarrhœa 131 132 Cholera .. 10 Whooping Cough 117 117 725 603 Decrease 122 It will be seen that 10 Deaths from Cholera were registered in this 4 District during the year; but on investigation I find them attributable to severe Diarrhoea, or Summer Cholera, and not to the epidemic form of that dreadful disease. The great decrease of Deaths from Zymotic diseases must be satisfactory to all, but especially so to those who have the sanitary supervision of the Parish; for with a population of One hundred and fifteen thousand, chiefly composed of the poorer classes, and in many cases densely crowded, Fever and other contagious diseases are likely to arise and spread unless their existence is early discovered, and such sanitary measures taken as may be necessary to prevent their extension. During the last few months there has been a system adopted of making me acquainted, through the Relieving Officers, with any cases of Fever, Small Pox, &c., among the pauper population. If this information is given early it will prove invaluable. The population of Bethnal Green Btill continues to increase, without a corresponding addition in house room; in fact, there has been a decrease of accommodation, in consequence of the shutting up of a number of houses required by the Great Eastern Railway for one of their new lines. This intensifies that which has always been our greatest evil —overcrowding. What can be done to prevent it I know not, except to pull down the small and unhealthy homes, and to erect upon their sites larger and more commodious dwellings. How to provide homes for the working classes at a rental which will not press too heavily upon them is a matter for serious and earnest consideration, not only to the Vestry, but to every one who has the well-being of his fellow-creatures at heart. The average Deaths for the whole of London in 1864 were 26.45 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 37.9 living. For Bethnal Green they were 27 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 37 living, 1 death in 4.2 being from Zymotic disease. In 1865 the average for the whole of London was 24.5 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 40.7 living. For Bethnal Green they were 24 per 1000, or 1 person died of 41.5 living, 1 death in 4.5 being from Zymotic disease. This refutes the statement so generally made, that our death-rate is always higher than that of other Districts, 5 and shews that for 1865 it was lower than the average for the whole of London. The Births registered for 1865 were—Boys, 2481; Girls, 2349— total, 4830; being 1 birth to every 23.8 person living in 1865, against 1 in 25 persons living in 1864. For the whole of London the rate was in 1865, 1 birth to 28 persons living, and the same for 1864. This shows our birth-rate to be far above the average for the whole of London. pauper illness. Table 5 contains a statement of all the new cases attended by the District Medical Officers. I have made no comparison with the past, as it is the first whole year for which a Table has been submitted to you since the alterations in the Districts were made. deaths in public institutions DURING THE YEAR 1865.

These have been subject to constant supervision since the outbreak of the cattle plague, and all have been cleansed and disinfected—many have been improved in ventilation and drainage; yet, notwithstanding, there has been a large number of Cows die or slaughtered through the disease, reducing many of the owners from affluence to indigence. Many of the Cows in an advanced stage of that disease were slaughtered and dressed for human food. The knowledge of this fact caused great exer- 7 tions on the part of the Sanitary Staff to trace and put down such practices. This resulted in the seizure, on the 15th of August, of 46 quarters of beef and 4 calves at the slaughterhouse of Mr. Charles Geary, Essex Street, Cambridge Road. The meat was destroyed, and the defendant fined £10 and costs. On the 31st August a further seizure was made, at the same premises, of a cow that had died, and was in process of being dressed for market. This was also destroyed, and the defendant fined £2 and costs. slaughter -houses. These have been visited, and where required cleansed and otherwise placed in a satisfactory condition. sanitary miscellanea. Mr. Christie, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, reports for the year to the following effect:— "2,018 Houses have been inspected, and 649 Notices served upon owners, requiring them to make Sanitary Improvements. "7,933 Visits have been made for the purpose of seeing that the work required was done in a proper manner. In 71 cases owners have been summoned before the Magistrate at Worship Street Police Court, for neglect to comply with the requirements of the Notices served on them. The Inspectors have attended at the Police Court, with the Medical Officer of Health, 95 times, on the hearing of Summonses. In each case the Magistrate ordered the requirements of the Notice to be complied with within a given time. "955 Houses have been cleansed and purified; 448 Cesspools filled up and done away with; the defective Drainage of 731 Houses remedied; in 125 cases dirty Closets have been cleansed, and defects of Privy accommodation sullied; 12 Underground Dwellings have been cleared and closed; the Overcrowding in 23 dwellings abated; 18 Animals (horses) kept in dwellings have been removed; 22 foul Urinals cleansed or removed; 274 Pigs removed; and in 12 cases accumulations of muck and dung in yards have been carried away. "Tripe Boiling.—The nuisance in Green Street, complained of by several inhabitants, has been abated by having a shaft erected above the houses adjoining, and by having coppers with close-covered lids, so that the effluvia should pass through the furnace. "Blood Boiling.—A person resident at 72, Gosset Street was summoned before a Magistrate at Worship Street, and ordered to abate the nuisance in 14 days, and to pay costs. "Unwholesome Food.—About 12 lbs. of Pork, part of a diseased pig, which were in preparation for sausages for the food of man, have been seized on the premises of a Mr. Turner, sausage maker, and condemned by the Police Magistrate, and ordered to be destroyed. Mr. Turner was summoned, and ordered to pay a penalty of £5 and costs. 8 "Forty-six quarters of Reef from diseased Cows, in course of preparation for sale, and 4 Calves, were found and seized on the premises of Charles Geary, Slaughterer, Essex Street, Cambridge Road, and after being examined by the Medical Officer of Health, were condemned by the Magistrate, and ordered to be destroyed. Geary was summoned, and ordered to pay a penalty of £10 and costs. "Four quarters of a diseased Cow, in course of preparation for sale, have been seized on the premises of Charles Geary, as above, and after being examined by the Medical Officer of Health, were condemned by the Police Magistrate and ordered to be destroyed. Geary was summoned, and ordered to pay a penalty of £2 and costs. "Upwards of 25 live Cows were seized by Mr. Farrow, the Government Cattle Inspector, as being diseased, and sent to be slaughtered." scavenging and dusting. The great inattention on the part of the Contractors in both these departments greatly impedes sanitary improvements, for how can people be expected to keep their homes clean and healthy, when the yards and streets are left in a dirty and neglected state! In the first quarter of the year 1866 there were in this Parish 1341 Births, and 805 Deaths, particulars of which will be given in our next Annual Report. In conclusion, I have to thank the Sanitary Committee for their co-operation and support in carrying out the various sanitary measures. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, THOMAS SARVIS, M.D. 135, Bethnal Green Road. TABLE 1. districts. BIRTHS For each District and Quarter. districts.

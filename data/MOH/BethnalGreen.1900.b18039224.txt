REPORT. TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF BETHNAL GREEN. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honor to place before you my twenty-fifth Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green. This Report deals with the vital and mortal statistics of the year 1900. It has been arranged that, during the currency of the registration year, which terminated on the 31st day of December last, the weekly records of the local registrars and also those of institution deaths, supplied by the Somerset House Authorities, should be continued on the old parochial basis. It must therefore be understood, that though for the future we shall have no concern with the old Ecclesiastical Parish of Saint Matthew, Bethnal Green, yet this Report, for the last time, deals with its statistics.* *EXTRACT FROM SCHEME UNDER THE LONDON GOVERNMENT ACT, 1900. 4. The Registrar-General may at any time after the confirmation of this Scheme, in accordance with the provisions of section twenty-one of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1874, make such alterations of the districts of registrars as he thinks expedient in consequence of the alteration of the areas of existing parishes and poor law unions by or under the Act, but the alterations so made by the Registrar-General shall not take effect until the twenty-sixth day of March, one thousand nine hundred and one. 6 POPULATION. The Registrar-General many years ago remarked that "The growth of a population is determined by two factors, firstly by the balance between the births and the deaths, and secondly by the balance between emigration and immigration." Now it is sufficiently easy to determine the first of these factors from the returns of the local registrars, but to ascertain the value of the second is impossible as no records are available, and we are reduced to mere guess work. The London Census, which is now taken once in five years, ascertains actual numbers of population, but any estimate formed as to the increase or decrease of these numbers in the last year of the five which have elapsed since 1896 cannot be accepted as more than a mere approximation. The Registrar-General bases his published estimates of population in each instance on the ascertained rate of increase or decrease which took place between the two previous census enumerations in the years 1891 and 1896. On referring to the reports for those two years it will be observed that the population of North Bethnal Green was actually decreasing in 1896, whilst the other two registration sub-districts shewed an increase, the net result being that the population of the entire district of Bethnal Green had been almost stationary since 1891. The decrease in North Bethnal Green is accounted for by the fact that just prior to the taking of the 1896 census the Boundary Street Area, which is contained in this district, had been cleared of its inhabitants by the London County Council, and that the five thousand inhabitants had distributed themselves throughout East London, a portion only finding accommodation in Bethnal Green. At the present time the newly-built houses on the reconstructed area are fully occupied, but by an entirely new set of tenants, drawn not only from Bethnal Green but from other districts. The same observations apply to the Ravenscroft Estate, a rebuilding scheme carried through by private enterprise. The depopulation and slow re-occupation of these areas, together with the action of the London School Board, in clearing sites for the erection of school buildings (Daniel Street in the North and 7 Wood's Close in the South) have exercised a most disturbing influence upon my calculations. For these and other reasons I have felt in past years that any figures calculated upon rates of increase or decrease could be of little worth ; I have, therefore, preferred to base my estimates of population on the numbers of children born in the district during the year under consideration, as birth rates are known to vary within very narrow limits. An inspection of the birth rates calculated upon past decennial enumerations shews such slight variations from decade to decade in Bethnal Green that I have felt quite justified in adhering to this plan. This year, however, I am confronted with a fresh difficulty, for the births in Bethnal Green during the year 1900 were 156 fewer than in the previous year. This falling off is, however, almost entirely confined to the southern portion of the district. Did this sudden drop indicate that the population had decreased in proportion and was 4,000 fewer than in the preceding year? Or could it be explained on the supposition that a large number of potential parents were absent from the district serving their Queen and country in the ranks of the regular and auxiliary forces? This last hypothesis is supported by the fact that the birth rate has fallen throughout the country. The rate for England and Wales for 1900 was only 28.9 per 1,000, and is lower than that of any other year on record. Compared with the average of the 10 years 1890 to 1899, the birth rate in 1900 shews a decrease of 1.2 per 1,000. The Metropolitan rate also has fallen from 29.4 in 1899 to 28.6 in 1900. The fall is most marked in the last quarter of the year, when it dropped to 28.6; notwithstanding this, there can be no doubt that the population of Great Britain and especially that of the large towns is increasing. The Registrar General estimates the population of Bethnal Green in the middle of the year 1900 at 128,831. I did not think our numbers had fallen so low, but I was utterly unable to form a better estimate, and was informed that the results of the census would not be available for many months. Under these circumstances, I felt that I had no alternative but to accept the official figures. I had completed my statistics on this basis when I received some 8 welcome information as to the numbers actually ascertained on the first of April last. I considered this information of such value that I had no hesitation in re-writing this report and calculating a fresh set of statistics based on a population for the middle of the year 1900, proportionate to the numbers actually ascertained in April, 1901. This figure is 129,600, distributed as under: — Population in Registration Sub-districts. Sub-District. Estimated in 1900. Enumerated in 1891. Inhabited houses. North 51,500 51,520 6,607 South 33,450 33,489 4,579 East 44,650 44,123 5,356 Total 129,600 129,132 16,542 BIRTHS. The total number of births registered in Bethnal Green during the year is 4,588 against 4,753 in 1899. This indicates a decrease of 165. The excess of the births over the deaths is I772. Table B shews this and compares the two years. TABLE B. 1899. 1900. Estimated population in the middle of the year 129,200 129,600 Total Births 4,753 4,588 Total Deaths 2,936 2,816 Excess of Births over Deaths, shewing the natural increase of the Population 1,817 1,772 9 The numbers of births registered in the three sub-districts into which Bethnal Green is divided are shewn in the following table:— District. Estimated Population. Registered Births. North 51,500 1,935 South 33,450 1,218 East 44,650 1,435 Total 129,600 4,588 DEATHS. During the year a total of 2,535 deaths was registered in Bethnal Green. This is equal to an uncorrected death rate of 19.56. Amongst the deaths registered were those of 150 non-residents, who died in Bethnal Green hospitals, and whose deaths must be excluded. On the other hand, I have received information from Somerset House of the deaths of 431 persons, ordinarily resident in Bethnal Green, but registered as dying in public institutions outside our boundaries. After adding these deaths and subtracting those of non-residents there is a nett total of 2,816. The deaths in each sub-district, corrected by distribution of institution deaths both within and without our boundaries, were as under:— North 1,120 South 761 East 880 Not stated 55 Total 2,816 BET 7 10 A large proportion of the deaths returned by the Somerset House authorities occurred in county asylums amongst persons removed from the workhouse on magistrates' orders. The exact previous residence of these persons is not stated, and could not be ascertained without considerable difficulty. It would be manifestly unfair to allocate these asylum deaths to the East sub-district in which the workhouse is situated. They are, therefore, distributed for purposes of death-rate calculation amongst the three sub-districts in proportion to the deaths known to have occurred among residents of those districts. DEATH RATE. We show a mortality rate, upon the basis of the estimated population for the year 1900, of 21.73. This is a decrease of 1.0 per thousand below the rate of the previous year; but the proportion to the general Metropolitan rate is unaltered. This last has also decreased, and stands at three and a half per thousand below the mortality rate for Bethnal Green. The rate for the whole of London was 18.3, against 19.3 for the previous year. The mortality rates in the group of West Metropolitan districts was 16.6; in the North, 16.7; in the Central, 22.3; in the South, 18.0; and in the East, which includes Bethnal Green, it was 21.9; a difference of 0.2 in our favour. The mortality in the registration sub-districts of Bethnal Green was as under:— District. 1899. 1900. North 23.6 22.1 South 23.8 23. 2 East 21.1 20.1 11 In the following table the mortality rates for London and for Bethnal Green are compared by quarters; the rainfall and the mean temperature are also shown for each period of three months:— Quarter ending.

The births registered daring the year were 4,588, and are equal to a rate of 35.4 per thousand population at all ages. This rate is 1.4 lower than that of the preceding year, which I calculated at 36.8. The general Metropolitan rate has also decreased, and stands at 28.6 per thousand. This is the lowest London birth rate on record, and is, as usual, nearly seven per thousand below our own. In the registration sub-districts of Bethnal Green the birth rates were as under; the death rate for each district is shewn for purposes of comparison:— Sub-District. Birth Rate. Death Rate. North 37.5 22.1 South 36.4 23.2 East 32.1 20.1 12 The following table compares the birth rates for Bethnal Green and for London by quarters:— Quarter ending. London. Bethnal Green.

DEATHS OF INFANTS. Twenty-seven per cent. of the deaths from all causes were those of infants aged less than 12 months: for out of 4,588 infants born alive 771 died before reaching the age of one year; thus giving a 13 death rate, calculated upon the births, of 168.0. The corresponding rate for the whole of London is 158.0. DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. Forty per cent. of the deaths from all causes, that is to say 1,140, were those of children aged less than five years, giving a proportion equivalent to a rate of 59.4 calculated upon the estimated population of young children. ELDERLY PERSONS DEATH RATE. The deaths of elderly persons, that is to say people over 65 years of age, numbered 504. This gives a death rate of 66.4, calculated upon the estimated population of persons over that age. WEEKLY MORTALITY CHARTS. The charts shew the numbers of deaths week by week, corrected by the inclusion of hospital deaths and the exclusion of nonresidents. SPECIAL CAUSES OF DEATH. Table IV., in the appendix, takes the place of the old Table III. It is prepared according to the instructions of the Local Government Board from the weekly returns of the Local Registrars, and from the monthly returns of institution deaths received from Somerset House. The table on the next page shews mortality rates for some of the principal diseases included in Table IV., and is calculated to show these rates for each period of three months in addition to the annual rate.

The total number of deaths from this class of disease is 349; of these 238 were those of young children aged less than five years. In Table D the number of deaths from each of these diseases is shewn and compared with those of the preceding year. TABLE D. 1900. 1899. Measles 63 90 Scarlet Fever 12 9 Diphtheria 60 64 Whooping Cough 93 44 Enteric Fever 18 38 Diarrhœa 103 156 349 401 Nearly twelve-and-a-half per cent. of the total deaths from all causes were referred to the diseases included in Table D, against thirteen-and-a-half per cent. in 1899. The actual decrease in number is 53. The 349 zymotic deaths were 125 below the decennial average for the 10 years 1890 to 1899. Table V. in the appendix shows this figure to be 474. An inspection of Table D will show that the decrease in the number of deaths was chiefly amongst those from measles, diarrhoea, and enteric fever; on the other hand, the deaths from whooping cough and scarlet fever were in excess. The death rate from these seven zymotic diseases is 2.7, against 3.1 in 1899; while the corresponding rates for London are 2.4 in 1899 and 2.2 in 1900. 16 Table F shews the percentage of deaths from each disease ascompared with the total number of zymotic deaths.

During the year 1,263 notification certificates have been received, and copies have been duly forwarded to the Metropolitan Asylums Board; 98 of these certificates were duplicate notifications. These latter form about seven-and-a-half per cent. of the whole. Table III. in the appendix indicates the sub-district in which the residence of the sick person was situated. It also shews the numbers removed from each sub-district. In four instances there was unnecessary delay in forwarding the certificate, and the fees for the same were disallowed by the Sanitary Committee. In three instances the certificates were returned to the medical practitioners, as the address of the sick person was either incorrectly stated or was outside the district. One medical practitioner withdrew his certificate. SMALL POX. (No deaths. Decemial average, 2.) Four cases of small pox were reported during the year. A. H., an unvaccinated female aged one year and six months, was removed 17 to hospital from 52, Cranbrook Street on January 9th. She had been taken by her mother to stay for Christmas with some relatives in Bentham Road, South Hackney. Amongst the guests at the Christmas party was a little boy from Churchill Road, Hackney, who was said to be convalescent from chicken pox. Seven other members of the family at Churchill Road were subsequently attacked with small pox. A. C., a female aged 14 years, vaccinated in infancy, was removed from Chisenhale Road on February 15th. She had visited the family in Churchill Road a few days after Christmas. The Public Vaccinator was immediately communicated with. He visited the two houses and vaccinated most of the inmates. The premises were carefully disinfected, cleansed, and the walls stripped, under the personal supervision of Mr. Foot, and no fresh case arose. In July a Russian Pole was reported to be suffering from small pox. The family occupied the two basement rooms of a house in Bethnal Green Road. The man had recently arrived from Poland, and was said to have been very ill on board the steamer. This I suppose was put down to sea sickness ; anyway he had been in bed a week before he was seen by a medical man. The case was correctly diagnosed and removed to hospital without delay. The same measures as to vaccination and disinfection were adopted as in the previous cases. The fourth case was that of a girl, aged 18, in Northampton Street. She was removed on July 18th on the certificate of one of the London Hospital medical officers. We fortunately heard of her removal, and the necessary steps as to disinfection, etc., were taken without loss of time. The notification certificate was not received until the 20th, and no history could be obtained. I regret to say that we have frequent cause of complaint against the resident medical officers of the London Hospital in respect to the tardy notification of infectious cases. Occasionally one of these gentlemen forgets altogether to send the certificate, and when written to says he thought someone else had notified. Remonstrance appears to be useless. The Committee are loath to prosecute, but their patience is nearly exhausted. I am of opinion that the prompt and efficient action of your Chief Inspector 18 averted an epidemic in each of the four cases above noticed; but without early information such as the notification clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, are designed to afford, the most energetic sanitary precautions are likely to be futile. Two of the patients were vaccinated, one was unvaccinated, and in the other case no information could be obtained. One of the families in which small pox occurred occupied one room only. The premises were in each instance in a more or less insanitary condition. SCARLET FEVER. (Twelve deaths. Decennial average, 32.) The number of cases notified during the year was 369, the deaths numbered 12—a rate on the notifications of 3.25 per cent. The scarlet fever death rate is equal to 0.09 per thousand population at all ages, whilst that of London is o.o8. In the North sub-district 134 cases were reported, in the South 139, and in the East 96. Amongst these last were 13 cases at the Children's Home in Bonner Road. The Inspectors' reports on the sanitary condition of the residences give the following particulars:—In 152 instances the premises were in a fairly good condition; in 63 the closets were out of order; in 4 the drains inside the house were leaky ; and in 7 the external drains were defective. In two instances the premises were overcrowded, and minor insanitary conditions were noted in 96. Twentyfour of the cases occurred amongst families inhabiting one room only; 229 cases were removed to hospital. ENTERIC FEVER. (Eighteen deaths. Decennial average, 23.) The total number of cases reported during the year was 153, with 18 deaths :— 55 from the North sub-district. 50 from the South ,, 48 from the East „ 19 The case mortality on the number notified was 11.7 per cent. The mortality rate on population was 0.13 for Bethnal Green, against 0.16 for the whole of London. The Inspectors report that in 50 instances the premises were in a fairly satisfactory condition ; in 52 the water-closets were defective; in two the external drainage arrangements were faulty; in seven instances the internal drainage arrangements were in an unsatisfactory condition ; in one instance the premises were overcrowded; and other insanitary conditions were found in 55 cases. Eleven cases occurred in families inhabiting one room only; 133 of the patients were removed to hospital. DIPHTHERIA (Including MEMBRANOUS CROUP). (Total deaths, 60. Decennial average, 98.) The total number of cases reported under the two heads was 399. This indicates a mortality rate of 15 per cent. on the notifications. On the estimated population at all ages the mortality is 0.46 per thousand living, whilst the general Metropolitan rate is 0.34. Of the cases, 174 of diphtheria and six of membranous croup were notified from the North sub-district, 101 and three from the South, and 110 and five from the East. In 151 instances the residence of the patient was found to be in a satisfactory sanitary condition, but in 82 the closets were faulty; in 20 the external drainage required amendment; and in seven the internal drainage was defective. In only one instance was the domestic water supply found to be drawn from the cistern supplying the w.c. Time was when it was exceptional to find any other arrangement in better class houses. In three cases the premises were overcrowded, whilst various other insanitary conditions were found in 139 instances; 38 cases occurred in families occupying one room only. PLAGUE. No case reported. In the Autumn of 1900 considerable apprehension arose lest this disease should be imported into this country, and the Local Government Board issued an order making it compulsorily notifiable. 20 Arrangements were made in London, by the County Council, for the prompt identification and isolation of any cases, but fortunately none occurred. NOTIFICATION OF CASES OF PLAGUE. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 20th September, 1900. Sir,—I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that in consequence of the appearance of Plague at Glasgow, and in view of the possible occurrence of cases of the disease in England and Wales, they have decided to issue an Order requiring the immediate notification to the Sanitary Authorities and to themselves of all cases of Plague. The Order, in its application to sanitary districts outside London, extends the provisions of the Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, to the notification of every case of Plague occurring in the district of a Sanitary Authority. As regards the district of any Sanitary Authority in the Administrative County of London, and the district of the Port Sanitary Authority of London, the Order similarly extends the provisions of section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Order also requires the Sanitary Authority forthwith to send circular letters to all legally qualified medical practitioners in the district, informing them of their duties under the regulations, and it imposes upon every Medical Officer of Health the duty of reporting forthwith to the Board any case of Plague which may be notified to him, or which may otherwise come or be brought to his knowledge, and which may occur in the district or area assigned to his charge. Attention is drawn to the definitions of "Sanitary Authority" and " Medical Officer of Health " in Article I. of the Order. Copies of the Order are enclosed, and the Board request that you will deliver a copy to the Medical Officer of Health, as defined by the Order. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, JOHN LITHIBY, Assistant Secretary. 21 London County Council. Public Health Department, 8, St. Martin's Place, W.C., 9th October, 1900. PLAGUE. Dear Sir,— When London was threatened with invasion by cholera, the Public Health Committee of the London County Council instructed me to ask you to be good enough to inform me of any suspected cases of that disease, and authorised me to send to Dr. Klein, for bacteriological examination, material from any such cases. The Committee has now decided to give the same facilities for diagnosis in respect of any suspected case of plague, and has, moreover, authorised me to employ, for clinical diagnosis, the services of Mr. James Cantlie, M.B., F.R.C.S., formerly medical officer in one of the Plague Hospitals in Hong Kong. I shall, therefore, be obliged if you will be good enough to inform me of any persons in your district who may be suspected to be suffering from Plague. With respect to the provision of refuges for the accommodation of persons who have been in contact or living with persons attacked by plague, the London County Council has, in reply to a letter from the Local Government Board, informed the Board that the Council is prepared to provide such accommodation as is necessary. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, SHIRLEY F. MURPHY, Dr. G. P. Bate. Madical Officer of Health. DISEASES OF PARTURITION. Eight women were reported to be suffering from puerperal fever— six of whom died. Of the other two cases one was pyrexia, due to 22 milk, and the other was a bad case of difficult labour followed by metritis. I very much doubt if the case was septic, though it was quite properly reported to me. I considered it necessary to suspend one midwife. I directed her to take a long holiday in the country, to which she agreed. Six Women died from diseases (other than puerperal fever) due to child-birth. As we have no record of still births it is impossible to calculate a mortality rate. WHOOPING COUGH. (Deaths 93. Deceunial average 98). The deaths from whooping cough were slightly above the average; 85 of them were amongst young children aged less than five years—a death rate of 4.72 per 1,000 on the estimated population of young children. MEASLES. (Deaths 63. Decennial average 116). Measles caused 63 deaths, all except two amongst young children. The mortality from measles is in the proportion of 3.3 per 1,000 on the estimated population of young children. Measles is an infectious fever characterised by catarrh of the respiratory passages and a rapidly spreading blotchy eruption. It is almost entirely a disease of children, very few of whom escape the infection, though the liability during the first six months of life is not so marked. The sexes are equally affected. One attack confers considerable protection, but not to the same extent as in cases of scarlet fever or small pox; so that second and even third attacks are not uncommon. The period of incubation varies from 7 to 18 days; it is usually about 14. The preliminary febrile condition lasts about four days, during which there is sneezing, running from the eyes and nose, hoarseness and cough: in short the symptoms of an ordinary cold. On the second or third day there is often a distinct remission of these 23 symptoms, so that suspicion of the true nature of the disease may be lulled, but about the third or fourth day the distinguishing rash appears, at first on the face but afterwards spreading to the whole body. The rash remains out for two or three days but gradually fades, and the skin desquamates. Frequently the rash leaves a brownish stain, which persists for two or three weeks. The poison of measles is given off by the breath and by the secretions, particularly those of the nose. It may be conveyed by a third person, or by clothing, carpets, &c. Usually the infective matter is passed direct from child to child, but it is sometimes airborne, especially in badly ventilated school rooms or hospital outpatient rooms. There is no evidence of its having been conveyed by water, milk or food, but the disease has been frequently inoculated, and in such cases the incubation period is less than 10 days. The actual contagium, or materies morbi, has never been isolated, and its nature remains unknown. No distinguishing bacillus has been found which complies with Koch's law. The infection is freely given off during the preliminary febrile stage, the patient meanwhile appearing to be suffering from an ordinary cold; many authorities are of opinion that this stage of the disease is the most infectious period, and if so, a sneezing child sickening for measles is capable of distributing the infection within a fairly large radius. The infective period continues so long as the rash and bronchial symptoms persist, and to a less extent during desquamation ; about three weeks is the average period. The case mortality of this disease is stated by authorities to be about five per cent., but as measles is not a notifiable disease, I have no precise knowledge as to the number of children yearly attacked in Bethnal Green. During the past 10 years the mortality has averaged 116 per annum, a rate on the estimated population of young children under five years of age of about seven per thousand living. Early in December the following circular-letter was received from the London County Council and was referred to the Sanitary Committee for discussion and report. 24 London County Council. Spring Gardens, S.W. 1st December, 1900. MEASLES. Sir—I am directed to inform you that the Public Health Committee of the Council have under consideration the question whether it is advisable that the Council should include "Measles" in the term "Dangerous and Infectious Disease," for the purposes set out in the following sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891:— Section 68, which prohibits, under a penalty, the exposure of infected persons and things. Section 60, which gives power to sanitary authorities to require the cleansing and disinfection of infected premises, and the disinfection or destruction of infected articles, and contains other provisions as to compensation and shelter during disinfection. Section 61, under which sanitary authorities can require bedding, clothing, &c., to be delivered up to them for disinfection, and must pay compensation for any unnecessary damage. Section 62, which prohibits, under a penalty, the casting of infectious rubbish into ash-pits without previous disinfection. Section 63, which prohibits, under a penalty, persons from knowingly letting houses in which infected persons have been lodging, until such premises have been disinfected. Section 64, which provides for a penalty on persons letting houses who make false statements as to infectious disease. Section 65, which provides for a penalty on persons ceasing to occupy houses without disinfection or notice to owner, or making false answer. Section 66, which provides for the removal to hospital of infected persons without proper lodging. 25 Section 69, which prohibits infected persons from carrying on any occupation in such a manner as to be likely to spread disease. Section 70, which prohibits the conveyance of infected persons in public conveyances. Section 72, which prohibits, in certain cases, the retention of the body of a person who has died of any dangerous infectious disease. Section 73, as to the body of a person who has died in hospital of any dangerous infectious disease being removed only for burial. Section 74, as to the disinfection of a public conveyance if used for carrying the body of a person who has died of any infectious disease. In 1898 a letter was received from the School Board for London on the subject, and in accordance with a resolution of the Committee I addressed a circular letter to the various vestries and district boards asking for their views on the question. The replies received showed a considerable divergence of opinion, and in these circumstances the Committee think it desirable to consult the Councils of the Metropolitan Boroughs with reference to the proposal. I am accordingly to ask that your Council will be so good as to state whether they are in favour of the extension to measles of the provisions contained in any or all of the sections abovementioned. You will observe that these sections do not relate to the question of "notification," which is dealt with in sections 55 and 56. I shall be glad to be favoured with a reply by the end of January, 1901. I am, Sir, your obedient Servant, G. GOMME, Clerk of the Council. The Town Clerk, Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. 26 It must be noted that the circular letter of the London County Council restricts its enquiry to the question whether it he advisable that the Council should include "Measles" in the term "Dangerous and Infectious Disease" for the purposes set out in certain named sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The Council desire to obtain the opinion of the Council of this Borough as to whether they are in favour of the extension to measles of any or all of the sections quoted. Mr. Gomme, the Clerk to the Council, expressly draws attention to the exclusion from the reference of Sections 55 and 56 of the Act which relate to the question of notification. I am of opinion that without compulsory notification by the medical attendant in some form, any action under the sections named would be extremely limited, as we could only deal with the fatal cases. I am furnished weekly with particulars of these by the local registrars, but by the time the lists are to hand the period for useful action has usually passed. Sections 72 and 74 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which deal with the retention in unsuitable places of the dead bodies of persons who have died from infectious disease, would occasionally be found useful if the information of the death from the registrars were to hand sufficiently early. Disinfection, as required by sections 60, 61, 62 and 74, could be enforced in fatal cases, and sections 63, 64 and 65 which relate to the letting of infected rooms and houses could occasionally be usefully applied. Sections 69 and 70 deal with the isolation of infected persons so as to check the spread of disease, but they could not be enforced with respect to measles, as penalties can only be inflicted where the offenders knowingly break the law. It s already sufficiently difficult to prove "knowledge" to the satisfaction of a police court Magistrate before whom cases of infraction of the law as to notifiable disease are taken, but the attempt would be hopeless in the case of a non-notifiable disease upon such vague information as we are likely to get from school officials and others. As there is no hospital for measles, sections 66 and 73, which relate to removal, would be useless unless the London County Council agreed to provide hospital accommodation for cases of this disease. 27 Upon mature consideration, I am of opinion that although there can be no objection to the inclusion of measles in the term "Dangerous and Infectious Disease" for the purpose of all the sections quoted by the Clerk to the London County Council, yet these sections could not be usefully applied without compulsory notification by the medical attendant. Without this there are no means of verifying information received from lay sources other than by a visit by your medical officer of health, who would require to make a medical examination in each case so as to ascertain the true nature of the illness reported before any isolation or disinfection could be enforced. This examination would certainly bring your Medical Officer into collision with the other practitioners of the district, who would vehemently resent such interference with their patients; moreover, such examination would not only be outside the ordinary duties of the Health Officer but would be absolutely illegal (unless with the consent of the person inspected). Compulsory notification under the present law by the medical attendant would be very expensive, and would mean an addition of some 2,400 half-crowns yearly to the notification account of the borough. In addition, it would involve nearly that number of extra visits on the part of your inspectors. In 1898 a proposal for the compulsory notification of measles was mooted by the School Board for London. I then reported upon the subject, and suggested a modified form of compulsory notification which I considered would be nearly as useful as that required by section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and not nearly so costly. I would suggest a compulsory medical certificate limited to the first case in each household, and enforce the reporting of subsequent cases by the parent or guardian. If we knew of the first case in each house or family we could notify the schools so that all children from such houses could be excluded and the premises kept under observation. This would, of course, necessitate an amendment of the Public Health (London) Act of 1891, and action in this direction might be recommended to the London County Council. The matter was discussed by the Public Health Committee on this report, but it was decided to take no action. 28 DIARRHŒAL DISEASES. (Deaths 103. Decennial average 113.) I have always exercised care in the classification of diarrhœa deaths for the purposes of these reports, but it must be borne in mind that diarrhœa is merely a symptom and may be due to various causes. Where, from the wording of the death certificate, it was clear that one of these causes contributed, the word diarrhœa has been disregarded and the death classified under the proper heading. As the practice amongst medical officers has not been sufficiently uniform to admit of comparison of diarrhœa mortalities, distinct instructions have recently been received from the Local Government Board. They are as follows:— Under the heading of "Diarrhœa" are to be included deaths certified as from diarrhoea alone or in combination with some other cause of ill-defined nature, and also deaths certified as from— Epidemic enteritis. Zymotic enteritis. Epidemic diarrhœa (summer diarrhœa). Dysentery and dysenteric diarrhœa. Choleraic diarrhoea and English cholera. Under the heading of "Enteritis" are to be included those certified as from gastro-enteritis, muco-enteritis, and gastric catarrh, unless from information obtained by enquiry from the certifying practitioner, or otherwise, the Medical Officer of Health should have reason for including such deaths, especially those of infants, under the specific term "Diarrhœa" Deaths from diarrhœa secondary to some other well-defined disease should be included under the latter. The deaths from diarrhœal disease, classified in accordance with these instructions, numbered 103, and were slightly below the average. All except eight were amongst young children, and formed a mortality of 5.27 on the estimated population of young children under five. 29 TUBERCULAR DISEASE. (Total deaths, 388.) Two hundred and seventy-five deaths were recorded as due to phthisis, and 113 to other forms of tubercular disease. The death rate from tubercular disease forms over 131/2 per cent. of the total mortality from all causes, and is equal to a rate of 2.3 per thousand at all ages. The tubercular diseases of young children caused 95 deaths, a mortality on the estimated population of young children of 5.2 per thousand. PHTHISIS. (275 deaths.) The death rate from phthisis alone is equal to 2.1 per thousand in Bethnal Green, whilst that for the whole of London is 1.7. RESPIRATORY DEATHS. (717 deaths.) The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs, exclusive of phthisis, numbered 717, and formed over one quarter of the total mortality from all causes. This is equal to a rate of 5.5 per thousand population at all ages. A large proportion (269) of the respiratory deaths were amongst young children, a mortality of 16.4 per thousand on the estimated population under five. MALIGNANT DISEASE. Cancers of various organs and parts of the body caused 103 deaths. This disease rarely affects young people, and all the deaths from it recorded last year (with the exception of two) were amongst persons aged at least 25 years. At the census in 1891 there was found in Bethnal Green 55,058 people aged 25 years and upwards. Assuming that this number has not varied materially, we show a cancer mortality of 1.87 on it. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890 and 1891. Application was made under these Acts for my certificate with reference to 339 premises. 30 Certificates were granted as under: Number of Tenements. Abingdon Buildings 85 Benson ,, 40 Laleham ,, 75 Hedsor ,, 85 The following premises were also inspected, but as I was not satisfied with the sanitary condition the certificates were refused: 1 to 25, Chambord Street. 2 to 30, „ „ 5 to 15, Ducal Street. 24 and 26, Gosset Street. 2 to 24a, Newling Street. 46, 48 and 50, Mount Street. INSPECTION OF MARKETS AND FOOD SUPPLIES. Early in the year a special officer (Mr. Ainley), with charge of the inspection of markets and food supplies and also with certain duties in connection with the abatement of smoke nuisances, was appointed. A reference to Mr. Foot's report will show that this officer's appointment was amply justified. He did excellent work, but Mr. Foot was of opinion that Mr. Ainley would be more useful on a district, and, accordingly, he is about to be transferred to the one rendered vacant by the death of Mr. Lapworth. FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACTS AMENDMENT BILL.—OUTWORKERS.—SANITATION.—BAKEHOUSES. Under the law at present in force, manufacturers and contractors, in certain specified trades, must keep lists, in the prescribed form, shewing the names of all persons employed either as workmen or contractors outside the factory or workshop, and the places where they are so employed. These lists must be open to the inspection of the Sanitary Authorities and their officers, who may extract from them such particulars as they may require. The Government have introduced a Bill into Parliament which proposes, amongst other things, to require the manufacturers to— Sec. 9. (1.)—(b) send on or before the first day of March and the first day of September in each year, copies of those lists to the 31 district council of the district in which the factory or workshop is situate. (2.) Every district council shall cause the lists received in pursuance of this section to be examined, and shall furnish the name and place of employment of every outworker included in any such list whose place of employment is outside its district to the council of the district in which his place of employment is. (3.) The lists kept by the occupier or contractor shall be open to inspection by any inspector under the Factory Acts, and by any officer of the district council, and the copies sent to the council and the particulars furnished by one council to another shall be open to inspection by any inspector under the Factory Acts. (4.) This section shall apply to any place from which any work is given out, and to the occupier of that place, and to every contractor employed by any such occupier in connection with the said work, as if that place were a workshop. (5.) In the event of a contravention of this section by the occupier of a factory, workshop, or place, or by a contractor, the occupier or contractor shall be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings. Sec. 10.—(1.) If any inmate of a house is suffering from an infectious disease to which this section applies, the district council of the district in which the house is situate may make an order forbidding any work to which this section applies to be given out to any person living or working in that house, or such part thereof as may be specified in the order, and any order so made may be served on the occupier of any factory, or workshop or any other place from which work is given out, or on the contractor employed by any such occupier, in the manner provided by section seventynine of the principal Act. (2.) The order may be made notwithstanding that the person suffering from an infectious disease may have been removed from the house, and the order shall be made either for a specified time or subject to the condition that the house or part thereof liable to be infected shall be disinfected to the satisfaction of the medical 32 officer of health, or that other reasonable precautions shall be adopted. (3.) In any case of urgency the powers conferred on the district council by this section may be exercised by any two or more members of the council acting on the advice of the medical officer of health. (4.) If any occupier or contractor on whom an order under this section has been served contravenes the provisions of the order, he shall be liable to a fine not exceeding ten pounds. (5.) The infectious diseases to which this section applies are the infectious diseases required to be notified under the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Acts, 1889 and 1899, and the work to which this section applies is the making, cleaning, and repairing of wearing apparel, and such other classes of work as may be specified by the Secretary of State by order made in accordance with section sixty-five of the principal Act. Sec. 11.—(1.) The notice in writing mentioned in section five of the Act of 1895 (relating to the employment of persons in places injurious to health) shall not be given by an inspector, but may be given by the district council within whose district the place in which the work is carried on is situate. Sec. 13.—The district council shall give notice of the provisions of the Factory Acts relating to domestic factories and workshops by the publication of the prescribed abstract or otherwise as the Secretary of State may direct. Sec. 14.—The power of entry conferred by subsection two of section three of the Act of 1891 with respect to workshops shall extend to every workplace within the meaning of section ninetyone of the Public Health Act, 1875. Sec. 15.—(1.) In every room in any factory or workshop sufficient means of ventilation shall be provided and sufficient ventilation shall be maintained. (2.) In any room in a factory or workshop in which any process is carried on which renders the floor liable to be wet, adequate means shall be provided for draining off the wet. 33 (3.) A factory in which there is a contravention of the provisions of this section shall be deemed not to be kept in conformity with the principal Act, and a workshop in which there is a contravention of the provisions of this section shall be deemed to be a nuisance liable to be dealt with summarily under the law relating to public health. Sec. 16.—Every district council shall keep a register of all workshops situate within their district. Sec. 17.—The medical officer of health of every district council shall, in his annual report to them, report specifically on the administration of the Factoty Acts in workshops and workplaces, and he shall send a copy of his annual report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State. Sec. 28.—(1.) After the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and four, an underground bakehouse shall not be used unless certified by the district council to be suitable for that purpose, and for the purpose of this section an underground bakehouse shall mean a bakehouse, any room of which is so situate that the surface of the floor is more than three feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. (2.) An underground bakehouse shall not be certified as suitable unless the district council is satisfied that it is suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects. (3.) This section shall have effect as if it were included among the provisions of the Factory Acts relating to bakehouses which are referred to in section seventeen of the Act of 1883 and in section twenty-six of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. 34 TRANSFER OF POWERS. The following communication was received from Mr. Shirley Murphy, the Medical Officer to the London County Council:— London County Council. Public Health Department, 8, St. Martin's Place, W.C., 10th October, 1900. Dear Sir,— In November the following powers hitherto exercised by the London County Council will be exercised by the Metropolitan Borough Councils— (1.) Power under Section 28 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, of registering dairymen. (2.) Power of enforcing the bye-laws and regulations for the time being in force with respect to dairies and milk, and with respect to slaughterhouses, knackers' yards and offensive businesses. The lists of registered persons and premises subject to these powers will, at the end of the present month, be ready to be communicated to the several Sanitary Authorities, and I have thought it would be convenient to medical officers of health, who will be concerned in the exercise of these powers, if they were to meet at Spring Gardens for the purpose of discussing them. I have, therefore, the pleasure to invite you to attend for this purpose a meeting of medical officers of health to be held at the Offices of the London County Council, Spring Gardens, on Wednesday, the 17th inst, at 3 p.m. I am, dear Sir, Yours faithfully, Shirley F. Murphy. The conference was accordingly held, and much useful information was afforded. Eventually lists of names and addresses of persons on the register were supplied. The number taken ove is:— 7 Slaughter-houses. 19 Cow-houses. 350 Dairies. 2 Noxious trades. 35 A total of 378. The Slaughter-houses and Cow-sheds have always been to a certain extent under our inspection and control, but the remainder only so far as the nuisance clauses of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, applied. It was obvious that the existing staff was quite unable to cope with this additional work, as all the premises taken over require constant supervision. The whole subject received anxious consideration at the hands of the Public Health Committee. The necessary increase in the staff afforded an opportunity to rearrange the duties and to make some attempt to deal with Tenement House Regulations, and also to do something under the outworkers' clauses of the Factory Act of 1895, which, so far as Bethnal Green is concerned, have been a dead letter. Eventually recommendations were sent up to the Council and agreed to, and it was determined to rearrange the duties of the Food and Markets' Inspector, to appoint a new officer to this position (vice Mr. Ainley, promoted to a district), and to appoint two additional inspectors—one to control the Dairies and Cowsheds, and the other to work the Tenement House regulations and to inspect the residences of the outworkers under the Factory Act, 1895. I congratulate the Council upon their resolution to put these Tenement House Regulations into force. We shall at least know if they be worth the paper upon which they are printed, and a fruitful source of friction between Spring Gardens and Bethnal Green will be removed. I have the honour to be, Sir and Gentlemen, Your very obedient servant, Medical Officer of Health fur Bethnal Green. BETHNAL GREEN.—TABLE I.—For Whole District. Year.

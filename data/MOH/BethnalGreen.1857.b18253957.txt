3 BET 73 REPORT of the MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, on the SANITARY HISTORY of BETHNAL GREEN, DURING 1857. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY. 1858. THIS REPORT on the SANITARY HISTORY OF BETIINAL GREEN DURING. 1857, IS RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED by the OFFICER OF HEALTH TO THE GREAT PIONEER OF HYGIENIC REFORM DR. THOMAS S0UTHW00D SMITH, BY WHOSE AID THE AUTHOR WAS RESCUED FROM TETANIC CONVULSIONS,* AND RESTORED TO HEALTH. * Strychnine prescribed by a medical friend was the cause, and Camphor the antidotal means. 135, Bethnal Green Road, February, 2bth, 1858. " Hygiene substitutes men for children." Gentlemen, I have the honor to present my Report on our Sanitary History, during 1857. In my First Annual, I had the pleasure of recording, that in 1856 the health of Bethnal Green, as of all London, was unusually good. It is now my less pleasing task to report that the year 1857 proved less genial and more destructive to life. The mortality of London rose from 56,786 to 60,150; that of Bethnal Green from 1905 to 2291.* As the meteorological conditions of years vary, so, more or less, they affect and tell on life. Hence, health must be measured by the average mortality of several yearsf—not by the returns of a single twelvemonth. In the year just gone by, " the 5th and 6th weeks were very cold ; " the spring was warm, and the heat in June intense ; the summer throughout was hot, and the average temperature of the autumn high. This hot weather Mons. Babinet, the French astronomer, attributes to changes in the currents of the ocean; and expresses his belief, that 1857 was the first of a series of many hot years to come.‡ " The slowness of the wind's movements " was another peculiar feature of the year. The meteorology and mortality of each month are exhibited in * These numbers exactly correspond with the Registrar-General's "Weekly Returns," but arc 2 in exccss of his Yearly Summary, in which, at page vi. it is said, "the totals differ slightly from those that are obtained from the "Weekly Returns." So also, the Sub-District Epidemic Table, in Appendix, though a fac simile of the Registrar's Sheets, differs slightly from the Registrar-General's Yearly Return. † " The average of 7 years will give the prevailing law of mortality."—ItetjistrarGeneral's 4th Annual Report, page 17. ‡ Lancet, September 5th, 1857, page 252. 4 the Appendix, by Table 1. The present Report consists of Five Sections:— 1. VITAL STATISTICS. Having furnished in preceding Reports the statistics of each month in detail, I now submit them in a set of Tables for the year. Their analysis is briefly this :—that 2004 boys and 1850 girls were born, whilst 1175 males and 1116 females died; that the Births amounted to 37.5 to each 1000 living, and to 1563 beyond the Deaths ; that the mortality was higher by 148 and 386 than in 1855-56, but lower by 82 than the average of the last 10 years ; that 543 persons succumbed to Epidemics, 258 to Consumption, 806 to Diseases of the Brain, Heart, Lungs and Stomach, 116 to those of Age, and 103 to Violence and other casualties; that 624 deaths occurred under the age of 1, 640 at 1—5, 95 at 5— 10, 70 at 10—20; or 1429 in the 1st, 215 in the 2nd, 278 in the 3rd, 303 in the 4th, and 66 in the 5th vicenniads of life ; that the mean lifetime was 37.10, and the mean age at death 21 66 years; or in social position—of the Gentry 35*44, of the Tradesmen 20.57, and of the Artisans 21.20 years;* and, that after the age of 20, the life averages were respectively 53 39, 54 27, and 54 31.

In this operation there is no source of error. As the other results (those of the Class and Sub-District means) differ one from the other, it is plain both cannot be right: in fact, both are wrong. This mode of proceeding, viz.,—the dividing by the number of groups (whether constructed according to occupations, localities, or any other ground of classification) can never be depended on as giving a true result; except where the groups are numerically equal, i. c contain the same number of individuals." Hence, the mean ages of the three Classes and four Sub-Districts must be regarded merely as approximations. 5 The percentage proportions of the several classes of Disease were to the total deaths as follow :—of the Zymotic 27.8, of the Tubercular 19.6, of the Brain 9, of the Heart 1.3, of the Respiratory 18, of the Digestive 6.7, of the Violent class 4.4, and of the remaining groups, including Dropsy, Diseases of the Kidney, of Childbirth, the Joints, Skin, &c. 12.8. Tested by the average mortality of the antecedent 10 years—adding thereto 1/10 for the people's increase—the health of London, Hackney, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel and Poplar ranked thus in the retrogressive scale :—London 1, Whitechapel 2, Shoreditch 3, Bethnal Green 4, Hackney 5, and Poplar 6. Expressed otherwise, the mortality was in excess during 6 weeks in London, 14 in Whitechapel, 21 in Shoreditch, 24 in Bethnal Green, 36 in Hackney, and 44 in Poplar. The open spaces that existed, and have in the interim been built over, must, of course, be taken into account in the contrast of the Districts enumerated above. For the year, the death-rate of Bethnal Green was 2.231 per cent., or 1 death out of every 44'82 living. This—though slightly (.011) in excess of all London—is less by .204 per cent., or 20 in every 10,000 deaths, than the death-rate of the East Districts, of which Bethnal Green is a constituent part Comparing the decennial periods of 1837, 1847 and 1857, our mortality has fallen from 1 death in 32 and 37 living to 1 in 45. On glancing over the Nosological Register, (Table 2,) you will see that the long catalogue of infantile diseases with the Typhus and Consumption of adult life, constituted the chief causes of the low average age at death. Thus, out of 1264 deaths of children under the age of 5, Small Pox cut off 5, Measles 80, Scarlatina 68, Hooping Cough 126, Croup 28, Diarrhoea 116, Cholera 12, Fever 34, Tabes mesenterica, or " Scrofulous degeneration of the mesenteric glands " 133, Water on the Brain 44, Convulsions and other brain affections 110, Respiratory diseases 216, Teething 69, Debility from Birth and Atrophy 67, Violent deaths 49, and 6 various other affections 107, while Typhus and Consumption destroyed 134 adults at 20—40 years of age. The latter two diseases diminish especially our " productive hands, and increase the proportion of the helpless and dependent." They strike down the fathers in their years of usefulness, when they have " become essential to the life of others," and leave behind children who, too often, " inherit and propagate their shattered constitutions." Against both the grand prophylactic is the free ventilation of every room. By Consumption, from 20 to 40 years, the deaths were 110, or more than half of all who died at the second age. At all ages this disease was fatal in London and Bethnal Green to 1 in each 359 and 398 persons. Among the Gentry or 1st class, it caused one out of every 4.43* deaths; among the Tradesmen or 2nd class, 1 out of every 10.89; and among the Artisans or 3rd class, 1 out of every 8.80. Together, Consumption and Diseases of the Respiratory organs cut off 65.3 in each 10,000 of our population, or 2.9 per myriad† less than the London rates in the years 1846—55. In the epidemic class our deaths increased from 385 in 1856 to 543 in the 53 weeks of 1857 : their percentage from 20.2 to 23.7. Similarly the epidemics of London advanced from 10,736 to 10,998; but their percentage decreased .6. Contrary to what happened in 1856, the epidemics relatively to population were also higher,— our ratios of the epidemics and population of London being A and A during 1856, but 1/20 and A during 1857. In the years 1837 and 1847‡ Bethnal Green suffered 672 and 452 epidemic deaths. In the former period, Small Pox numbered 108, and in the latter 42 fatal cases, while in the year just elapsed it destroyed 5 only. Diminutions so grand show what preventive medicine can do, and testify to the * This heavy percentage was in part owing to deaths in the Consumption Hospital and Lunatic Asylum, and to the largo proportion in the families of professional clerks and singers. † Given by Dr. Greenhow, in his Paper on the Death Rates of London, as 68.2. ‡ More correctly, the 3rd & 4th Quarters of 1837, and 1st & 2nd of 1838, the 4th of 1846, and 1st, 2nd & 3rd Quarters of 1847. 7 efficient working of Vaccination. That ours has been effective is borne out by Mr. Simon, who states in his great Work* of last year, that in the triennial period 1854—56 there were in Bethnal Green 81 vaccinations to each 100 births, or more by 6.6 than in any other metropolitan district. Tables 3 and 4 illustrate the epidemic deaths; the former showing their Sub-District distribution, the latter contrasting them—firstly, with London—and secondly, with the East Districts in which we are placed. Proportionally we lost less than all London by Small Pox, but more by Measles, Scarlatina, Hooping Cough, Diarrhoea, and Typhus. Compared with the East Districts, the proportions corresponded by Typhus, but were higher by the other five epidemics. Small Pox was most fatal in the 4th Quarter, Measles in the 2nd and 3rd,—reaching its acme of intensity in the month of May; Hooping Cough predominated in the 1st and 2nd Quarters; Diarrhœa enormously (90 out of 132) in the 3rd; and Fever, in its duplex form of Scarlatina* and Typhus, in the 4th. The influences of the seasons on these and other diseases are shown collaterally with the names and ages, in Table 2. One person in every 778 was carried off by Diarrhoea, 1 in 977 by Fever, and 1 in 189 by the entire group of epidemics. Out of 63 epidemic deaths, 1 or 156 per cent. fell on the Gentry,—1 in 4, or 24.8 per cent. on the Tradesmen,—and 1 in 4.2, or 23.7 per cent. on the Artisans. "In London the proportion of deaths from epidemic diseases among the Gentry is 9.3,— among Tradesmen 18.6,—and. among Artisans 215 per cent." The following were the numbers of each epidemic, and of the Choleraic cases, in the 3 years 1855—57 ;—Small Pox, 31, 21, 5 ; Measles, 79, 38, 81 ; Scarlatina, 96, 58, 91; Hooping Cough, 101, 85, 126 ; Diarrhoea, 70, 76, 132; Cholera and Choleraic Diarrhœa, —, 1, 15; Typhus, 98, 107, 105 Of the choleraic deaths, 1 by Malignant Cholera of 24 hours duration, occurred in Bridge Road, opposite a long open ditch, to the danger of which I * "Papers relating to the History and Practice of Vaccination." 8 took leave to direct your attention in my August Report. Among the more remarkable deaths, 2 were referred to Traumatic Tetanus, 1 to Pneumonia followed by Delirium Tremens, 1 to Rupture of the Abdominal Aorta, 2 to Intussusception, 1 to Cancer of the Stomach, 1 to Rupture of the Uterus during parturition, and 1 to Elephantiasis, or "Arabian Leprosy of the lower extremity." Inquests were held on 115 persons (67 males and 48 females,) on whom the Verdicts returned were—" Found dead " 56, viz. : in bed, in rooms, and by mother's side, 38 ; in the Canals, 13 ; in the Park and Streets, 3; and in Water-closets, 2; " Natural Death" and "By the Visitation of God," 21; " Sudden," 6; By "Burns," 6; by " Falls, 5; " Run over by a Railway Engine," 1—" by a Cart," 1; " Accidently suffocated by a fall of earth " in a sewer, 1; by other Violence, 5; by "Poison," 1; "Hanging," 4; " Excessive Drinking," 3 ; " Eating unwholesome Cucumbers " and Food not nutritious," 2; "Natural Death from overcrowding, causing Choleraic Diarrhœa," 2 ; "Natural Death from Fever and insufficient drainage," 1. Of the above numbers, 9 were suicides and 9 unknown—5 of the latter being Infants "Newly Born." The total returns "Not Specified" were 49; and 50 were either "Not Certified," or had "No Medical Attendant." In our Public Institutions there died 255 individuals, or 1 in every 9 of the deaths, namely : 201 in the "Workhouse, 19 in the Consumption Hospital, and 35 in Bethnal House Asylum. Measured by population, our proportion of such deaths would be 387, or 132 beyond the numbers given above. With respect to the ages at which the 2291 deaths occurred, our records show that 27'2 per cent. perished under 1, and 55T under 5, years of age.* In all England the percentage at the former age is 20, at the latter, 40 ; and in 61 Rural Districts, only 27 5. * It does not, however, follow because 55 out of 100 deaths happened under the nge of 5, that the same proportion holds on every 100 born ; for it is shown in the Registrar-General's 2nd Report, that although 38 out of every 100 deaths were under 5 years of age, " the deaths under 5 were only 26 per cent. of the registered births." 9 They alone, therefore, constituted 551.7 out of every 1000 deaths, and 83.5 of each 1000 living at those years of life. Throughout England and Wales, in the years 1838—47, such deaths formed only 394 out of every 1000, while the proportion to every 1000 living during 1845—54, was less than 69. If on the other hand, we estimate our sanitary condition by the Births and Deaths below the age of 1, our life and death accounts stood thus in 1857:—3854 Births, and 624 Deaths, or as 6 to 1. In England the mortality of the like period is to the births "as 2 to 8, and in healthy country districts as about 2 to 10" Sixty-two per cent. of the total deaths happened under the age of 20, 493 adults died at 20—60, or prematurely, and 216 or 94 per 1000 lived beyond threescore years and ten. The numbers who passed over 80 years were 66, or 1 in every 34.7 deaths,—and of those who exceeded 90, 5, or 1 in 458. Two nonagenarian females died at 93 and 94 years: the one in the Workhouse, the other in Grigg's Almshouses, near Whitechapel Road. Table 5 exhibits " the law of mortality " of our population, or " the numbers dying out of a given number living." It illustrates—notwithstanding our high death rate under the age of 5—that the numbers of the dying to the living were lower generally than the London ratios in 1855. In the Registrar General's Weekly Return of January 2nd, of that year, it is stated that, " the annual mortality of London, except in periods of great epidemics, is at the rate of 31 in 1000 among the children and young persons under 20 years of age ; 10 in 1000 among men and women of the second age (20—40); 23 in 1000 among persons of the third age (40—60); 72 in 1000 among persons of the fourth age (60—80) ; and 224 in 1000 among persons of the age 80 and upwards." With us the proportions were— at the 1st age, 29—at the 2nd, barely 7—at the 3rd, 16—at the 4th, 57—and at the 5th age, 177. Hence, by this " unimpeachable test of the relative duration of life," Bethnal Green stood well in 4 out of the 5 vicenniads at every age above 5 10 years, that is, after " the weakly children had been weeded out." Now, the enigma is—How to prevent such appalling waste? Hygienic measures, by correcting sanitary shortcomings, will doubtless accomplish much; but, until the wretched hovels—where poverty and destitution ever herd— are razed to the ground,—until new thoroughfares are opened out, and healthy houses built,—until its dwellings rate above £9 per house,—it will be impossible to approximate the infantile death rate of Bethnal Green to Glendale or Country rates, or, in fact, to those of the more wealthy and favoured parts of town. Poverty and its accompanying evils, insuffificient clothing, food and fuel, inability to provide the requirements of infant life, conjointly with overcrowding, want of cleanliness, and an atmosphere charged with organic poison, must, inevitably, generate and intensify disease, and so augment the amount of deaths. Whence, as infancy is peculiarly susceptible of all such mal-influences, there occurs an enormous sacrifice of infant life. " For, as— A pebble in the streamlet scant, Hath turn'd the course of many a river, A dew-drop on the baby plant, Has warped the giant oak for ever! so a very little want of care in the training of a child will suffice to shorten the span of its brief existence, or injuriously influence the whole of its future life." There is, however, good ground to hope—when preventive agencies are fully brought to bear on the physical evils, which tell so fearfully on infant life—that there will be less generation of, and predisposition to, disease, and that the mortality under the age of 5 will correspondingly be reduced. In Table 6 (framed on the Registrar General's form) I have arranged the deaths of the males aged 20 years and upwards according to occupations. Of course, deductions from 1 year's returns must be viewed as approximations only. It is there seen that the Weavers far outnumbered any other occupation, and that many reached to a ripe old age. If we add the 11 Weaveresses who also died, their united deaths were 164, or 12 in Sub-District Hackney Road, 79 in the Green, 47 in the Church, and 26 in the Town.—Of these, 8 or nearly 5 per cent. were cut off by Epidemics—31 or just upon 19 per cent. by Consumption—and 125 by other causes. Among the latter, 2 perished by Fire, in Anchor Street, 2 committed Suicide, and 2 were "Found Dead" in bed. Their mean age at death was 54:—58 of them lived beyond 70, 17 above 80, and 1 over 90 years of age. The next Table, No. 7, shows the life-differences in our 4 Sub-Districts, namely, the numbers, male and female, of those who died in each; the causes of death; and the ages at which the deaths occurred. Supposing our population to have increased since the Census at the preceding decennial rate, it amounted in the middle of 1857 to 102,673; or 26,685 in Hackney Road, 29,276 in the Green, 25181 in the Church, and 21531 in the Town. And according to the ratios of 1851, our "vital forces," or ages of the living, comprised 15124 under 5 years ; 12831 between 5—10; 20491 between 10—20; 31655 at 20—40; 16902 at 40—60; 5297 at 60—80; 372 at 80—100; and beyond the age of 100, 1. On the above populations the death percentages would be respectively :—in Hackney Road, 1978 ; in the Green, 2 906; in the Church, 1.949; and in the Town, T950 : and the densities of the people to each acre, 189, 75, 191, and 224. If, however, the population be " approximatively represented by the excess of births over deaths," it would amount only to 99,433 ; but as ours is not a stationary population, (some hundreds of houses having been built since the Census,) the increase has, probably, quite equalled the antecedent decennial rate. Testing the health of each SubDivision by the fatality of the Zymotic, Tubercular, and Respiratory classes of Disease, the Hackney Road suffered 358 deaths, or 134 in every 10,000 persons ; the Green 521, or 178; the Church 330, or 132; and the Town 291, or 135 deaths in each myriad of populatiou. Taking, too, the death 12 proportions under the age of 5, 321 persons, or 120 per 10,000 died in the Hackney Road; 388, or 132 in the Green ; 289, or 115 in the Church; and 266 persons, or 123 in each myriad, in the Town. The number of the Births was, in SubDistrict No. 1, Males 479, Females 483 ; in Sub-District 2, Males 593, Females 521; in Sub-District 3, Males 471, Females 396; and in Sub-District 4, Males, 461, Females 450. Their ratios of deaths to births were, 1 to T82, 1 to 1.32 ; 1 to 1.77 ; and 1 to 2.17: their mean ages at death*— highest in the Green, next in the Church, then in the Town, and lowest in Hackney Road; whilst, after the age of 20, life was longest in the Town, next in the Green, then in the Church, and shortest in Hackney Road. The Green SubDistrict differs in two respects from the other 3—in its larger death rate, and higher mean age at death. Both depend on the mortality in its three Institutions, and on the great proportion of adults therein. Table 8 is devoted to the Workhouse deaths. By that you will perceive that 26 of the deaths—14 of which were males—occurred between the ages of 20—40, or at the most useful and productive years of life. If—disregarding all higher views—we look upon the death of each such adult as the loss of a mere " productive machine, reared to last a certain time and to return so much more than lie costs," even in £ s. d. value alone, every such death is a serious loss : for by the estimate of Mr. Maculloch, a fullgrown workman arrived at maturity will have £300 worth of capita] invested in him. If, therefore, he dies prematurely, not only his productive labour is lost, but there comes the Sub-Districts. Nos. of Deahs. Years of Life. Mean Ages At Death. Years. Months. Weeks. Days. Years.

How many such were cut off in the out-door divisions I do not know; but in 1839 the number who died at 20—40 was 76, and that of the orphans left behind 248, not one of whom had previously received relief. The following deaths out of every 100 persons in the under-mentioned places evidence " the depopulating influence " exercised thereby. Without decimals they read thus :—In Elizabeth Place 4, Ely Place 5, Butler's Buildings 5, Sherwood Place 5, Sweet Apple Square 5, Crescent Place 6, Helen's Place 6, Miring's Place 6, Prospect Terrace 8, John's Court 8, and in Providence Place Russia Lane, 9 per cent.; while the death-rate of the whole Parish was but 2'23 ! These warn us like " the handwriting on the wall " that we have yet much sanitary work to do ! Finally, the Statistics of 1857 show— 1. That the mortality of Bethnal Green reached 22 per 1000, or 5 beyond the normal rate. 2. That the epidemic mortality was in excess of London, both in percentage on total deaths, and in its ratio by population. 3. That the deaths out of each 1000 living, under 5 years of age, were 14 above the average English rate. 4. That the mean lifetime was 37, and the mean age at death 211 years. 5. That life was longer by 9 months, and that of adults by 5 years, than when reported by Mr. Chadwick and Dr. Arnott. 2. Pauper Sickness. In comparison with the year 1856, the health of Bethnal Green—whether tested by Deaths or Pauper Sickness—was at a discount in 1857. The determining causes were doubtless atmospheric, which intensified the prevalence of the Zymotic and Respiratory classes of disease. The number of New Cases attended by the 6 Poor Law Medical Officers was 14 6772, i. e. in the Workhouse, 1354; in District No. 1, 746; in No 2, 1044; in No. 3, 1137; in No. 4, 1412; and in No. 5, 1079. Amongst these there occurrcd 448 deaths, or rather more than 1 in 15 cases. In the latter half of the year there was an excess of 1004 cases over the corresponding 6 months of 1856. In the Workhouse the Epidemics constituted 14'4 per cent. of the total attacks, and in the Oat-door Divisions 30'7. Small Pox prevailed most in Districts 5 and 3—Measles in 4 and 5—Scarlatina in 3 and 4—Hooping Cough in 4 and 5—Diarrhœa in 3 and 4 : and Fever most in the Workhouse, next in District 2, then in District 5, and least in No. 4. The total number of Fever cases under treatment in the year was 594; whilst 20 years since, they amounted to 2084.* Of 488 Acute Pulmonary Affections, 171 occurred in District 4 ; 119 in No. 5 ; 83 in No. 1; 79 in No. 2 ; and 36 in No. 3. Rheumatic Fever was most prevalent in No. 3, and Ague in No. 5. Several cases of Diarrhoea assumed a choleraic type, and passed into severe collapse. The numerical proportions of the several classes of disease constitute Table 9. The following were some of the chief epidemic sites, and the numbers of the attacks therein :—Hare Street, 45 ; Temple Street, 31; Thorold Square, 29; Princes Courts, 29; Collingwood Street West, 28; Hope Street, 24; Wolverly Street, Hackney Road, 22 ; Thomas Street, Brick Lane, 19 ; Cambridge Street, 18 ; Old Castle Street, 15; New Castle Street, 14; Wolverly Street, Bethnal Green Road, 12; New Nichol Street, 12; Old Nichol Street, 10; Half Nichol Street, 9; and New York Street, 8. By way of contrast, I may just remark that Temple and Hope Streets run parallel, and are of equal length ; that Old, New, and Half Nichol Streets, with Wolverly and New York Streets, likewise correspond; and that Cambridge Street, wedged in between the latter two—though of less extent, and with houses only on one side—is narrow, confined, and at its southern end a cul de sac. As to the 22 * Fever was then the reigning epidemic. 15 houses of Thorold Square, their site is undrained, unpaved, aud low. In addition to the Pauper Sickness, there were 1118 New Cases of Illness attended by the Surgeons of Queen Adelaide's Dispensary, and 18 by the Medical Officer of the Guardian Society's Asylum, from April 1st, to December 31st, 1857. 3. Sanitary Progress. Glancing retrospectively over the physical history of Bethnal Green, it is interesting to note how much of its malarious area has been reclaimed, and how pari passu its death rate has decreased. Twenty years ago Dr. Southwood Smith said of the Parish—"A large portion of Bethnal Green is a swamp, hardly any part of which is drained.* In rainy weather some entire streets are under water; and large collections of stagnant water cover, summer and winter, considerable spaces of ground in every part of the district." Happily, most of the low swampy spots—as the sites of Waterloo Town and Lamb Fields, and of Bunker's and Wellington Ponds— have been filled up and drained; and cotemporaneously our mortality has fallen from 1 death in every 32 living to 1 in 45. Doubtless, other circumstances—as the demolition of certain unhealthy streets for the Eastern Counties Railway, and the removal of the Workhouse to a more salubrious place—have contributed their quota to this happy result; but the main element is, the amelioration of the marshy malarious air. Much physical hazard is, therefore, removed; and theWorks since executed under your auspices will, henceforth, enhance the duration and value of life. In addition to the 5 Blocks of Sewer6 completed in 1856, whereby 36 Highways and Byways were drained, another Grand Block, providing for 18 other streets, was constructed in 1857. In the process of excavation the rotten and dangerous state of the ground— * The houses in Belvidere Place were built on the site of a swamp ; and, according to Mr Welch, when the sewer was constructed there in 1853, it took the whole strength of the workmen three days to bale out the water before they could proceed with their work. 16 heightened, originally, by refuse and rubbish—was fully disclosed. This raised superstratum was so charged in Abbey Street with foul stagnant fluid, that on running it off, it was found necessary to shore up the houses on either side of the way. Probably, the first effect of disturbing such ground— as of turning up prairie land—is hurtful to health; but, hereafter, the advantage of its drainage and purification will be immense. I have next, Gentlemen, to congratulate you on the enclosure of Nova Scotia Gardens, and on the proposed appropriation of its ground to " healthy homes " for our Artisans. I have also to allude with much satisfaction to your success in stopping the Baking of Manure, in the larger of the yards in Digby Street, and in preventing its manufacture under No. 87 Railway Arch. And, further, I may advert with pleasure to the regeneration of Prospect Terrace, which has been supplied throughout with closet apparatus, trapped drains, new dust-bins and water-butts. Its returns already show a marked diminution in disease. In Table 10, I lay before you a synopsis of the Sanitary transactions of the year. For the data I am indebted to your Surveyor and Inspector—to whom I take this opportunity of expressing my best acknowledgments and thanks. The Table shows that 2081 Houses have been inspected, and 749 connected with Sewers;—that 696 New Drains were constructed and 119 of the old improved ;—that 880 Cesspools have been abolished, and 320 emptied, in places where sewer-communications could not be made ;—that 915 Privies were supplied with closet apparatus, and 50 N ew Closets built; that 1128 Drains and Gullies have been trapped and 3 Sewer Ventilators introduced;—that 320 Dust Bins were put up, 14 miles of Sewers Flushed, and 9981 Dust Removals made ;—and, lastly, that 1 large Block of Sewers has been constructed, whilst 6 more are about to be commenced. Several cases of the following nuisances have come under notice, and effective remedies have been applied:— 17 1. Smoking and Curing of Fish. 2. Baking of Dirty Rags. 3. Dyeing and Baking of Pig Hair. 4. Making and Baking of Manure. In two or three instances, the parties complained of have discontinued the annoyance, and moved away. Numerous pigs have been removed; and 19 Summonses taken out. In most of these cases orders to complete the necessary works were obtained; in some—the works being done—were withdrawn; and in two instances dismissed. 4. Measures that promote Health and prevent Disease. The grand aim—the sine qua non of sanitary reform—is to purify the soil and air, and so prevent "the generation of the elements of disease." To do so, requires every possible perfection of the physical circumstances under which we live. It comprehends, in fact, "the economy of health," in so far as health depends on the conditions of our dwellings, drains, supply of water, paving, scavenging, and ventilation. Hence, these several matters demand our constant and unceasing care. For certain insanitary houses, in narrow, dark, cul de sac-courts,* that have not an exit or window behind,— where, from foulness without, ventilation, unless by roof outlets, cannot be made,—houses so small, so decrepit, so old that no renovation can convert their apartments into healthy, decent-sized rooms;—for such, I fear, there is no remedy other than demolition and re-construction on better hygienic plans. Ascending higher in the scale, to dwellings with "adaptability for healthy human habitation," sundry preventible evils are brought to view. Among these I may mention certain dark, unventilated passages and staircases in the streets of Lamb Fields, into which neither light nor air have ingress—where, consequently, filth and all sorts of smells abound. Here, obviously, the remedies are—windows, fan- *Some of these were noticed in my First Annual Report. 18 lights, air-bricks, and louvre boards. A second evil is, their fearful overcrowding, by which an "atmosphere of organic particles," a deadly "zymotic atmosphere" is produced. By the Census returns, the number of our inhabitants was 6 to each house; but such a distribution conveys no idea how closely life is packed in particular streets. Take, for instance, the return made by your Inspector of the 48 houses in Barnsley Street and Carlton Place, the one having 5, the other 5 and 6 rooms, in each; where the ratio is 14 inmates per house, and the breathing area, without deduction for furniture, little more than 200 cubic feet a-piece! Contrast this with the prison allowance of 1000 feet, and reflect for a moment how powerfully such an atmosphere must degenerate life. But the migratory character of the population masks the result, for the deaths among 496 residents were only 8, or 1 in every 62. On the social and moral bearings I will not dwell: their symbols are poverty, misery and degradation. Another avoidable evil is, storing house refuse in cellars, whence gaseous poison, "at night when doors and shutters are closed, accumulates within the house, and is a constant source of illness and expense in houses of every class." Passing on to the subject of drainage, I would strenuously urge that, in every possible case, on the abolition of the cesspool and substitution of closet-apparatus, you enforce an independent supply of water, to prevent contamination in the house cistern or butt. I would, too, advise that wherever secondary or pipe sewers are used, strict attention be paid to the trapping of drains, because—in the absence of street ventilation—the gases intensified by concentration rush into the interior of every dwelling.* In this respect, and because their sides are impermeable, and do not drain off the water from the surrounding subsoil, pipe sewers are inferior to those constructed of brick. Again, with Cholera looming ahead, it is my duty to recommend that, wherever pump water * To such causes Dr. Arnott attributed the Croydon epidemic. 19 is drunk, as in some of our gardens, and certain houses in Emma and Swan Streets, &c., a supply be laid on from the East London Company's mains. I would also suggest, more frequent street cleansing; and that all the paved courts, public sewers and drains be from time to time sluiced with water by engine, or hose apparatus affixed on the mains; furthermore —to obviate contamination by storage,—that the Company be requested to furnish Sunday supplies.* The evils of deprivation of light and solar rays are so strongly exemplified in the diseases, deformities and short lives of miners, that we ought, whenever practicable, to enjoin their full admission to every room. These and other matters were fully discussed in the Report that I had the honour to present on the advent of Cholera, at West Ham. 5. Concluding Remarks. "As the drop of water hollows out the stone, not by its force, but by frequently falling," so sanitary evils by "repetition of impression" waste and wear life away. The Tables now laid before you tell how few among us reach old age— how many fall in life's full prime—how many more in its first 5 years. They point to misery, disease and death; and urge us with a warning voice to uproot the evils whereby we die. To do this will be the work of years: whole streets and courts must be leveled to the ground; houses with all health requirements built, and open spaces left where the sun can shine and the ventilating breezes blow. Other records prove that the years of infancy are not ever thus destructive, and that longevity is not necessarily so rare a boon. The statistics of the Society of Friends are fraught with these deeply interesting facts.—Throughout Great Britain, in the year 1855-56, amongst 287 of their members' deaths 37 only, or not quite 13per cent.,"died from birth to 5 years old; from 60 to 70, 46; 70 to 80, 50; 80 to 90, 43; and 90 to 100, 9. The greatest *This has been done in Bermondsey by the Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company, on the suggestion of Dr. Challice. 20 tality amongst Quakers is between the ages of 70 and 80; the next greatest, between 60 and 70; and the third greatest, between the ages of 80 and 90." Their "average duration of life is 51 years, 2 months and 21 days," which is "equivalent to a rate of mortality of only 9.76 to 1000 annually." Like experience in Prisons, where health is now at a premium; and the reduction in the mortality of the Navy from 7.2 to 1.6 per cent. testify to the saving that may be made in life. But the latter two augment only adult force, which has not deteriorated in the same proportion as infant life.* We have before us a double task—to fortify the tenure of the two. And as we save infant life, we shall lessen the tax on the mother's strength; there will be fewer but stronger children born, and our sum of vitality will be increased! So shall we "substitute men for children,"—vigour for weakness,—long life for early decease! I have the honour to be Gentlemen, With great respect, Very faithfully yours, SAMUEL PEARCE. To the Gentlemen of the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. *It is stated by Mr. Edmonds in his Paper on the Mortality of England, that, "the actual mortality under the age of 5 years had increased in the interval of 20 years in the high proportion of 44 per cent; "while" the mortality at every age above 20 years has remained the same, with little or no variation, for the last 30 or 40 years." 21 APPENDIX TO REPORT; Or, Tables to illustrate the Mortality and Sanitary Progress of Bethnal Green, during 1857.

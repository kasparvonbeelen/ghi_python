BET 80 St. Matthew Bethnal Green. SANITARY STATISTICS AND PROCEEDINGS FOR THE YEAR 1866. THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: MINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, BY J. S. PORSAITH, BETHNAL GREEN ROAD, N.E 1867. St. Matthew Bethnal Green. SANITARY STATISTICS AND PROCEEDINGS FOR THE YEAR 1866. THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED 15Y ORDER OF THE VESTRY, BY J. 8. FORSAITH, BETHNAL GREEN ROAD, N.E. 1867. REPORT. July, 1867. Gentlemen,— In presenting my Third Annual Report, it is with extreme regret I have to inform you that there has been a great increase in the number of Deaths in this District during the past year. This was mainly due to the outbreak of Cholera; but not entirely, since, independently of that disease, our mortality was far greater than the average. The Deaths from all causes were 2770 in 1865, against 3823 in 1866—increase 1053. The Deaths from Zymotic Diseases were registered as follows:— 1865. 1866. Fever 122 125 Small Pox 39 155 Measles 27 91 Scarlatina 145 99 Diphtheria 11 12 Diarrhoea 132 182 Cholera 10 612 Whooping Cough 117 169 603 1445 Increase 842 It will be seen that, with the exception of Scarlatina, which fell from 145 in 1865 to 99 in 1866—decrease 46—there was an increase in all. The increase was specially marked in Small Pox, which rose from 39 in 1865 to 155 in 1866—increase 116; if the deaths of patients sent from this District to the Small Fox Hospital were included, our mortality would appear still higher. Small Pox is an eminently preventible disease (thanks to the discovery of Jenner), and the increase is without doubt attributable to the antipathy 4 of very many of the poorer and uneducated classes to Vaccination, and their consequent neglect of that means of prevention. The New Vaccination Act will, I hope, have a beneficial effect in this respect. While upon the subject of Small Pox, I cannot refrain from adverting to one means of propagation of this and other Zymotic Diseases: the use of street cabs for the conveyance of affected persons to the various Hospitals. The Public Health Act of 1866, took cognizance of this abuse, and clauses were inserted to prevent its occurence; which, however, have utterly failed in their intention. Clause 25. If any person, suffering from any dangerous or infectious disorder, shall enter any public conveyance without previously notifying to the owner or driver thereof that he is so suffering, he shall, on conviction thereof before any Justice, be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds, and shall also be ordered by such Justice to pay to such owner and driver all losses and expenses they may suffer in carrying into effect the provisions of this Act; and no owner or driver of any public conveyance shall be required to convey any person so suffering until they shall have been first paid a sum sufficient to cover all such losses and expenses. Clause 38. Any person suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder, who wilfully exposes himself, without proper precaution against spreading the said disorder, in any street, public place, or public conveyance, and any person in charge of one so suffering who exposes the sufferer, and any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after it has, with the knowledge of such owner or driver, conveyed any such sufferer, ****** shall, on conviction of such offence before any Justice, be liable to a penalty not exceeding five pounds * * * * * Now the only effect of these clauses is to open the door of venality to cabmen, since there is here nothing to prevent their taking as many infected passengers as they please, provided they “have been first paid a sum sufficient to cover all losses or expenses." As to the disinfection of cabs, I have never known an instance of it. It is therefore by no means pleasant to think how frequently one may have occupied a vehicle whose last passenger was a Small Pox or Fever patient. It would be a great boon if in every District suitable vehicles (distinct from those used for the conveyance of paupers), were provided, to be hired at a low rate for the conveyance of patients to the Hospitals, and persons appointed to ensure their disinfection before being used again. As such vehicles do not exist, except in a few places, I think the best way to prevent contagion in this respect would be, that any cab 5 employed in conveying an infected person to a Hospital, should not be allowed to leave until it had been thoroughly disinfected under the superintendence of the Hospital authorities. The number of Deaths from Cholera in this District during the epidemic of 1866 was 612, and the rate of mortality lower than in any of the Eastern Districts, with the exception of Shoreditch. This low rate in Shoreditch may be accounted for by the fact that that district is almost wholly supplied with water by the New River Company. The first case registered in this Parish in 1866, as one of Choleraic disease, was that of a girl, aged 5 years, who died May 6th, at 5, Gibraltar Walk. I agree with the Registrar that this was not a case of real Cholera, although I enter it as it was registered. Then follow a male of 5 years, 3, Charles Street; a male of 11 months, 21, Old Bethnal Green Road; and a female, aged 9 years, 21, St. Jude’s Street. The first case of true epidemic Cholera I believe to be one which occurred July 12th— a porter, aged 37 years, at 29, Wellington Place; a second occurred at the Workhouse on the 13th instant; these, with a doubtful case of a female, aged 1 month, constitute the 3 registered for the week ending July 14th. For the next week, ending July 21st, 43 deaths were registered. When this became known, a Vestry was convened for July 26th, the earliest legal date to consider what steps should be taken to prevent the extension of the disease. In the interim, the Order in Council, dated July 21st, was received, so that when the Vestry met, measures were at once taken to put in force its provisions. A Committee of the whole Vestry was formed, and it was arranged that I should confer with the District Medical Officers, and report accordingly. A meeting was held at my residence the same evening, at which all the District Medical Officers attended, with the exception of Dr. Lyell, who was out of town, and all agreed to accept appointments as Medical Visitors, to keep open surgeries for the gratuitous supply of medicines, and to leave the question of remuneration until the termination of their duties. It was proposed that the Vestry should find disinfectants, nourishments, and stimulants, and provide fifteen assistants for house to house visitation, &c., at a salary of 4l. 4s. each per week. This was reported the next morning (July 27th), and agreed to by the Vestry. At the last moment, however, some of the District Medical Officers, refused to act, except at a remuneration of 2l. 2s. per day; and this not being acceded to, they were not appointed. It was arranged to form Dispensary Stations in 6 those parts of the Parish which had been centres of disease in former epidemics, and premises were engaged for the purpose at 13, Gretton Terrace, and 11, Winchester Street. There was at first some difficulty in getting any where they were most needed, that is, in the densely crowded district at the back of Shoreditch Church. However, they were not long wanting, as the Committee of the Nichol’s Row Schools kindly placed a portion of their premises at our service, free of charge. The situation of these Schools was all that could be desired; added to which, they were well known to the residents of the locality, as medicines and disinfectants had been given away there prior to our taking possession. The Dispensaries were opened on August 2nd, and the following gentlemen were appointed, with three assistants to each:— Van Ess Parker, M.D., C. C. Richards, M.D., E. Nicholas, Esq., Nichol’s How. Winchester Street. | Gretton Terrace. Dr. Irwin had been first appointed to Gretton Terrace; but was superseded in a few days by Mr. Nicholas. The gentlemen who acted as assistants, although not all legally qualified, had a fair knowledge of their profession, and were mostly second or third years' students. Some of these gentlemen did not remain long on the staff, leaving from various causes, but were immediately replaced by others. Amongst those that remained at their duties throughout, I may mention Messrs. Sanders, Lyne, Haylock, Chambers, and Ward. At the Dispensaries, applicants suffering from Cholera or Diarrhoea were supplied with medicines night or day, or were visited without delay if the case required it. Nourishment, stimulants, and bed clothing, were also distributed where needed. Disinfectants (chloride of lime and McDougal’s powders), were given to all comers; a very large quantity being used in this way. In the distribution of nourishments, stimulants, bedding, &c., considerable help was given by the Clergy throughout the Parish, the Sisters of Mercy, the Committee of the Nichol’s Row Schools, and the Bedford Institute; in fact, religious differences seemed forgotten, and persons of all denominations vied with each other in doing good. House to house visitation was set on foot, and all cases discovered (not under treatment), were attended by the Dispensary staff. Nuisances, &c., were reported to me. The total number of applicants at the Dispensaries were 17,533, of which the cases were:— 7 Cholera 366 Cholcraic Diarrhœa 822 Diarrhœa 16,345 Total 17,533 Deaths 104 Three men were engaged, one at each Dispensary, under the direction of the Medical staff, to wash down and disinfect closets and drains; this was done in every house where a case of Cholera was known to have occurred. The courts and alleys were well flushed two or three times a week. When a death was reported, the house was visited by me, and every infected article to which the process of disinfection could not be applied, was destroyed by my order, and replaced by the Vestry. Infected beds, &c., were removed in a cart kept for that purpose, and burnt at dusk by a person specially appointed. Arrangements were made with Mr. Martin, 78, High Street, Hoxton, for the speedy burial of the dead; and with the Great Northern Cemetery Company for their interment. For the immediate knowledge of where a death had taken place, I have to thank the Registrars, Messrs. Murray, Brad brook, Ashford, and East, to whom were supplied stamped envelopes and forms, which, on the registration of a death, they at once filled up and sent to me without fee or reward. The good effect of this is incalculable, as I often obtained knowledge of a death a few hours after it had taken place, (at least twenty-four hours before it appeared in the Daily Returns), and I was able to take measures promptly and effectively against the spread of the disease. In addition to the two ordinary Sanitary Inspectors a third was appointed, who has been retained ever since; and a Clerk was employed to write notices. Forms, ordering the cleansing and disinfection of premises, were carried by the Inspectors, which, in cases of Cholera, were served forthwith; if this notice was not attended to, a summons was issued without delay. The Privy Council required a weekly return of the number of attacks from Cholera and Diarrhoea, the recoveries, and deaths. Such a return it was difficult to furnish, as no report was made to me by the District Medical Officers with the exception of Drs. Smart and Welch. With the reports received from these gentlemen, (to whom I owe my best thanks), 8 from the Dispensaries, and from a few private practitioners, I did the best I could; but I fear my returns were not the most correct sent to their lordships. By the Order of Council, it was incumbent to establish a hospital for the reception of those Choleraic patients who could not be well cared for at their own homes; and, until this could be done, a few beds were secured at the London Hospital. Every means to obtain a suitable building was tried, without success, and the Vestry at last hired a house upon the Green; against this, however, there was so great an outcry, that it was not used for the purpose; and while it was in serious contemplation to use the Town Hall for the reception of patients, the Commercial Street Hospital sprang into existence. The hospital was opened for the reception of patients on August 20th, and was closed on November 1st. This hospital was conducted in the most admirable manner, the patients receiving the utmost care and attention, insomuch that wealthy people, at their own houses, could not have been better tended. The patients from this Dictrict were conveyed to the hospital in a carriage gratuitously placed at our disposal by the kindness of J. D. Link, Esq. (one of the Vestry); the vehicle, when not further required for this purpose, being broken up. The number sent from Bethnal Green was 97.

This excessive mortality created quite a panic among the residents; fortunately, one of the Dispensaries being close at hand (Winchester Street), patients received the most prompt attention. This, with the active measures taken by the Sanitary staff, together with the influence and kindness shewn by the Clergy in these extreme cases, at length succeeded in staying the ravages of the disease, and allaying the fears of the people. I am unable to give any special reason why these streets should have been visited thus severely, for although they were somewhat over-crowded, they were not more so than other parts of the District. The drainage was good, the houses were in decent repair, and the inmates not of the poorest class. The next greatest number of deaths occurred in the Old Bethnal Green Road and Cranbrook Street—10 persons having died in each. The remarks made with reference to Hare Street and St. John Street, apply to the Old Bethnal Green Road; and as regards Cranbrook Street the houses arc well drained, not over-crowded, and have been recently built on a sandy soil nearly 40 ft. above high water level, and the inhabitantsare of a wellto-do artizan class. In Princes Court, where 9 deaths occurred, the houses were well drained, and had been cleansed about twelve months before the outbreak. They were occupied by the poorest classes, whose habits caused the houses to be in a very dirty state. The water receptacles were foul and totally inadequate in size. Since then, however, we have had the whole court cleansed and placed in a satisfactory condition. 17 In Old Castle Street, where 8 deaths occurred, the above remarks apply, with the exception that the houses had not been cleansed for a much longer period. In Myring Place there were 6 deaths; these, following in quick succession, caused the greatest alarm. The Sanitary conditions here were the same as in Princes Court, with the exception that the water supply was constant. The whole of the houses were immediately cleared, thoroughly cleansed, and disinfected throughout before re-occupation. The greatest mortality in any one house was at No. 1, Butler's Buildings, where 5 deaths occurred. This house is situate on the confines of tho Parish, adjoining Spitalflelds; it is very old, and crowded with inmates of the poorest class. The house was dirty throughout, closet and drainago accommodation defective, and the water supply scanty. As the lease had nearly expired, we could get but little done by the landlord. In fact, upon proceedings being taken, he chose rather to surrender the lease than to put this and the adjoining houses into suitable repair. The whole buildings have since changed hands, with every prospect of their being kept in a more satisfactory condition. A case, exemplifying the good effects of energetic measures and promptitude of action, occurred at 13, Tyrrel Street, Turin Street, where G out of a family of 9 persons were stricken in one night. I had the remaining 3 sent out of the house, and they were not attacked. The father, mother, and 4 children were sent to the Cholera Hospital before noon the following day. The mother was the only one who came out alive. The house was immediately closed, and every article of wearing apparel and bedding destroyed ; and it was then thoroughly cleansed and disinfected before it was allowed to be inhabited again, and I am happy to say not another case occurred in the street. The Committee for carrying out the provisions of the Order of Council, with its indefatigable chairman, J. H. Edwards, Esq., ably supported by the Vestry Clerk, K. Yoss, Esq., sat daily from July 26th until September 8th; then twice a week until October 6th, at which date its functions were delegated to the Sanitary Committee. The sittings of the Committee usually occupied from two to three hours, during which they heard all applicants ; gave orders for restitution of bedding, &c., destroyed ; received reports, medical and sanitary; and directed summonses to bo issued in cases where notices for the disinfection and cleansing of houses had been neglected, &e. In fact, gave their best consideration to everything 18 brought before them, which might tend to mitigate the evils and prevent the spread of Choleraic disease. Our Rector, tho Eev. S. Hansard, attended the Committee very regularly ; this, with his other duties, kept him fully employed. With him was his most esteemed friend, the Rev. H. "Whitehead, who left the salubrious locality of Highgate, and relinquished the enjoyment of an autumnal tour, in order to come to Bctlinal Green, and pass his time amongst the poor and stricken. Much good be did : reward he had none here below; but it is long ere he will be forgotten, for he lives in the grateful memories of many. Trior to the outbreak of Cholera iu 1866, the water supply was very deficient, and no doubt impure ; even if pure when delivered, it frequently became contaminated in consequence of the filthy state of the receptacles. This was specially noticed where the tanks were placed over the water closets. Such water should never be drank ; in fact, the storage of water for domestic purposes is radically bad, the butts, tanks, &c., being seldom kept clean even by the better classes, while the negligence shewn by thepoor in this respect is truly deplorable. As an instance of this, I may state that, on one occasion on examining a water butt, of large size and in good condition, I saw lying on the bottom a small-tooth comb. I pointed this out to the inmates, who of course promised to remove it. Imagine my astonishment and disgust, when, on another visit, nearly three weeks afterwards, I saw the comb in exactly the same spot as when I first discovered it. Such instances of culpable neglect are frequently met with, and tend greatly to produce disease, and whatever were the causes which led to the outbreak of Cholera, there can be no doubt that the character of the water supply had a very great influence in its development. It is generally believed that in June or July, immediately after which date the outbreak occurred, impure water from some adjoining ponds found admittance into the Old Ford reservoir. However this may be, certain it is, that districts supplied from the Old Ford reservoir suffered, while those drawing their supply from other sources (even from the reservoirs of the same Company at Lea Bridge), were nearly free. As an instance, Shorcditch, which is principally supplied by the New River Company, had but 135 deaths from Cholera. The water question being thus of the greatest importance. I am glad to find that, upon a requisition made to the Board of Trade, through the exertions of the East London Water Association, (which was 19 chiefly represented by residents of TSethnal Green, and of which the Rev. S. Hansard was president), a searching inquiry was instituted which was conducted by Captain Tyler, and the whole of the East London Water Works examined. On a cold Sunday in February of this year (1867), I was present with about thirty scientific gentlemen, when the Old Ford reservoir was nearly (by the order of Captain Tyler it should have been quite) emptied. In order to prosecute the examination, we had to wado in it in long boots, and found impure water oozing into it from various places. It further appeared the reservoir had not been eleansed since its construction in 1855, so it is quite evident that the water drawn from it could not have been of the purest kind. The Company have since been advised by Captain Tyler to close this reservoir. This is a step in the right direction; for whatever is done to obtain the 100,000,000 gallons of water required for daily use in London, it must not be drawn from its present polluted sources, and whether we have to go to Scotland, Wales, or tho Lakes of Cumberland, the supply must be constant, and not as it is as present , intermittent. I trust indeed that the day will come (though I may not live to see it), when all water reccptacles will be abolished, except those holding water for the purpose of flushing closets. Bad drainage is another means by which Cholera is propagated. A circumstance however, which presented itself to my observation during the late epidemic, shews that, under the worst conditions, in this respect, some localities escape. When, during the existence of the epidemic, the drainage in White Street and Swan Street was being altered by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the old drain was being taken up, the pipes and bricks of which it was composed, impregnated with soil, and emitting a most offensive effluvium, were thrown carelessly about; and, despite all I could do, I could not get them disinfected. The work was stopped for a time, but this remedy was worse than the evil, for the sewer being left uncovered, the exhalations became more offensive than before ; and when the work was resumed, no means were taken to prevent the nuisance. The Board of Works being written to on tho subject, a gentleman was sent to inquire into the matter. Together we waited upon the contractor, expostulated with him, and pointed out the danger arising from the continued neglect ol sanitary precautions; when he promised to carry out such suggestions as we had to make. Notwithstanding this, the only thing done was to scatter disinfecting powder over offensive matter when brought to the surface, and that in quite insufficient quantities. Had Cholera decimated the streets and neighbourhood 20 nobody could have been surprised; yet only 2 deaths occurred in "White Street and 3 in Swan Street. No settled plan of treatment for Cholera has been agreed upon by the Profession, and the late opidemic has added little to our knowledge in this respect, unless it be to shew the fallacy of some modes of treatment; if, however, we have made no advance in curative treatment, we have arrived at more certain conclusions as to the causes, prevention, &c. These conclusions are—that Cholera may be conveyed from place to place in various ways ; that it may remain innocuous for a very long period; but that, under conditions favourable to its development, it springs into action and spreads ad infinitum. These conditions are bad water, bad air, defective drainage, overcrowding, dirty and irregular habits. "When, then, Cholera prevails in a neighbourhood, such precautions as the following should be particularly attended to :—Obtain advice upon the first symptoms of Diarrhoea ; let all water be boiled before it is drunk; if, after boiling, there is any doubt as to its purity, pour into it a small quantity of Condy's Red Fluid, sufficient to tint it a slight pink ; if the water retains the pink cast for an hour or so, you may safely drink it. Let a supply of pure air be maintained by thorough ventilation. Let some of ilcDougall's disinfecting powder be continually kept in the sick room, and care taken to disinfect excretions with carbolic acid directly they are passed; and let attendants be very careful to wash their hands thoroughly before meals. In case of death, relatives and friends should not allow their feelings to get the better of their discretion, but the burial should take place as soon as possible. This is specially necessary in over-crowdcd localities. All contaminated bedding, clothes, &c., if of little value, should be burnt; if valuable, they may be placed in boiling water, to which has been added carbolic acid, and washed without delay. As although carbolic acid does not (like chloride of lime), destroy clothing, it attacks the skin, and care must be taken not to let it get on any part of the body. Woollen and other goods that would spoil in the washing, should be submitted to a temperature of 260" Fahrenheit in an oven or other suitable place. Closets and drains should be well looked to, and trapped and panned where necessary. If offensive smells arise from them, pour down some carbolic acid. If, in addition, you live regularly and temperately upon those things that generally agree with you, and are conducive to health, if you are clean in house and person, and avoid excesses of all kinds, there will be less to fear in any future outbreak of Cholera. 21 Now that the epidemic ha8 passed away, we who have lived through it and seen its ravages, should profit by the experience of tho past, and keep the District in such a condition as, in the event of another outbreak, will shew that at least all the means in our power have been taken to avert the calamity. POPULATION. The population of Bethnal Green is now 116,574, and is still on the increase, though not in the same ratio as heretofore. Building operations are stopped, for the best of reasons, that there is no ground to build upon; and our house room being still encroached upon by the Great Eastern Railway Company, over-crowding is as rife as ever. The Public Health Act, 1866, provides for cases of this nature, in giving to the Vestry the power of adopting lodging house regulations. These have been drawn up, and have received the sanction of the Secretary of State, but have not yet been put in force ; consequently, at present, any proceedings are taken under the Sanitary Act, 1855. The average Deaths for the whole of London in 1865 were 24-5 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 30'7 living. For Bethnal Green it was 24 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 41 '5 living—1 death in 4-5 being from Zymotic Disease. In 1866 the average for the whole of London was 26-4 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 37-9 living. For Bethnal Green there were 32-9 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 30'4 living—1 death in 2-8 being from Zymotic Disease. Although our death rate was higher during the past year than the average for the whole of London, it was less than the average for the East Districts combined, which was 33-9 per 1000. The Births registered in Bethnal Green for 1866 were—Boys, 2517 ; Girls, 2308—total, 4825 ; being 1 birth to every 24-1 persons living in 1866, against 1 in 23-8 persons living in 1865. For the whole of London the rate was in 1866, 1 birth to every 28'1 persons living; for 1865 it was 1 to every 28 persons; so that for 1864, '65, and '66, the average birth rate for the whole of London has been nearly the same. PAUPER ILLNESS. I am sorry to say that the system of making me acquainted, through the Relieving Officers, with the outbreak of contagious or infectious disease amongst the pauper population, has fallen into disuse, for I am convinced that, if promptly carried out, it would tend to lessen materially the spread of such disease. 22 Table 5 contains a statement of the new cases attended by the District Medical Officers, as entered by them in their books. I am unable to give the particulars of the first and second quarters of the Second and Fourth Districts, as the Medical Officers' books for those quarters are filled up, and consequently not sent to the Guardians. After many applications, 1 have failed to obtain access to them. I have not compiled any statistics respecting the "Workhouse. After the very able report of Dr. Smart, they would superfluous. That report I herewith give in extenso, with the exception of thcJTables stating the causes of and ages at death, which are embodied in my own. On the 1st of January, 1866, the number of eases on the Medical Relief Book was 425 ; from the 1st of January to the 31st of December, the number of fresh eases admitted to the Sick Wards was 2,215, making a total of 2,640 cases under medical treatment during the year; being a very great increase upon those admitted in previous years. Thus, in 1863, the number of netv cases was 1,327 ; in 1864, 1,404 ; in 1865, 1,614 ; and in 1866, 2,215—shewing an increase over 1863 of 888. Of tho 2,G40 cases, 1,826 were discharged cured or relieved; 336 died; 478 remain under medical treatment. The class of cases were of the ordinary charactcr admitted into Workhouse Infirmaries (excepting Cholera and Small Pox), such as Consumption, Bronchitis, Asthma, Paralysis, Old Age, Chronic Rheumatism, Disease of the Heart, Destitution, &c., &c. The Deaths in 1865 were 249; in 1866, 344. The oldest person that died in 1865 was 94 years ; in 1866, 104 years : both females. Tho following are the number of Births:— Males. Females. Total. Legitimate. Illegitimate. 1865 52 48 100 36 64 1866 43 39 12 33 49 The number of stillborn children in 1865 was 14 ; in 1866, 5. In nearly all these eases the mothers were suffering from Syphilis. Small Pox.—In June and July we were compelled to admit Small Pox cases, in consequence of the Small Pox Hospital being full. The Male and Female Receiving Wards were appropriated to these cases—12 were admitted : 6 adult males, 4 adult females, and 2 children. The adults had been vaccinated, the children had not; they all did well. Most of them were confluent, and of a bad character, requiring good nourishing diet, porter and quinine. Cholera.—In the month of July an outbreak of Cholera occurred in the east-end of the metropolis; and among the first to feel its effects was the Parish of Bethnal Green, more especially the eastern end. The Workhousc,for some considerable time, was the only place in the Parish for the reception of such cases. The first was admitted into the South Lodge on the 12th day of July. The patient, a bricklayer, stated he had walked 23 from Southampton, complained of a feeling of weakness and constant vomiting. On inquiry, it was ascertained he had been suffering from Diarrhoea for two days, lie soon passed into a state of collapse, and died thirty hours after admission. The next case occurred on July 17,—an inmate of the Workhouse. He was attacked at three o'clock a.m., and died at three p.m. There was no premonitory Diarrhoea. The man was well 011 the previous day, and cleaning windows. It then became evident we must be prepared fur other cases. Application was at once made to the Infirmary Committee. Two Waids were placed at my disposal, and others to be had as occasion required. After July 17th, cases were admitted daily, and by the 31st the number had reached 39. On August 1st, 9 were admitted (the largest number on one day). The admissions continued daily up to August 11th, about which time, through the vigilance and activity of the Vestry, places were provided for the treatment of Cholera; and not any more cases were admitted from the street, and only 5 fresh cases from the house. It was found necessary to fit up 6 Wards, and employ a staff of Day and Night Nurses. Over 1,000 cubic feet of air was allowed to each patient. Seventy-six cases in all were admitted—31 males and 45 females. The following will show the dates of admission :— July 12 1 Aug. 1 9 Sept. 7 1 1 Oct. 3 1 17 1 2 5 18 3 3 3 19 2 4 3 20 2 5 3 21 2 6 2 July, from 12th to 31st 39 22 1 7 1 August 35 23 1 8 3 September 1 24 6 9 1 October 1 25 0 11 2 26 3 21 2 76 27 5 28 1 28 4 - 29 1 35 30 3 31 3 The shortest period in which death occurred was 1 ½ hours, the longest 7 days. The oldest person that died was 78 years, the youngest I5 years. 39 Of the 76 cases, 10 were inmates of the Workhouse, 66 from different parts of the Parish, but chiefly from Twig Folly. 12 were under 10 years of age. 7 „ 10, and under 20. 9 ,, 20, ,, 30. 12 „ 30, „ 40. 14 „ 40, „ 50. 5 „ 50, „ 60. 9 ,, 60, ,, 70. 8 „ 70, „ 80. 76 No Parish order was necessary from tho Relieving Officer for admission. No case was refused either day or night. Forty-six out of the 76 died. 24 I do not intend to enter minutely into the treatment of Cholera, as no satisfactory conclusions have yet been arrived at. At the London Hospital, which I visited several times, various plans were adopted, as the Astringent, Purgative, Castor Oil, Calomel, Baths, &c., &c., each of which lays claim to a certain amount of success. The treatment at Bethnal Green consisted of the Calomel and Saline combined, with Hot Baths, &c. The number of successful cases at the Workhouse will be found about the same as at the Hospital, if numbers are compared. This is the third epidemic I have witnessed, and must candidly confess I do not think the Profession have yet made any advance in the successful treatment of Cholera. We have had an opportunity of comparing the different kinds, and avoiding those which appear to be decidedly bad. Active measures were taken to prevent contagion in the House, and, I am happy to say, our efforts were successful. I have avoided purposely saying anything about the arrangements of the House, such as nursing, crowding of sick wards, &c.: improvements are taking place in nearly every department. I consider we are in a transition state, and on the eve of eventful changes, more especially as regards the medical department. I commenced the new year with 478 cases on the Infirmary Medical Relief Book, and 57 insane and imbeciles, making a total of 535 under medical supervision. JAMES SMART, F.R.C.S., Medical Officer. As regards the Cholera patients, I may say that they were so well attended to by the Dispensary staff, that little was left for the District Medical Officers to do, with the exception of Dr. Welch, who, in consequence of residing at some distance from the Dispensaries, had more work thrown upon him than any of the others. I am glad to say that he performed his duties most effectively. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS FOR 1866. Male. 1 Female. Total.

These are in much the same condition as in 1865, and need no special notice. SANITARY AND MISCELLANEA. The Reports of the three Sanitary Inspectors, Mr. Christie, Mr. J. W. Burrows, and Mr. "W. "W. Burrows, give the following results:— " 8,929 houses have been inspected, and 3,165 notices served upon owners, requiring them to make sanitary improvements. " 20,704 visits have been made to ascertain that the work was progressing satifactorily. In 206 cases, owners were summoned before the Magistrate at the Police Court for neglect to comply with the requirements of the noticcs served upon them. 2,696 houses have 26 been cleansed and purified; 779 cesspools filled up and done away with ; the defective drainage of 2,379 houses remedied; dirty closets and defective privy accommodation have been cleansed and supplied in 1,992 cases; 57 houses have been cleared and closed as unfit for habitation; over-crowding in 83 dwellings abated; 50 horses and dogs, kept iu an unwholesome state in dwellings, have been removed ; 98 foul urinals have been cleansed ; 457 pigs have been removed; accumulations of muck, dung, and other offensive matter, have been carried away in 104 instances ; and 101 slaughter-houses and cow-houses have been inspected and cleansed. In addition to this, 7 water waste preventers, with constant supplies, have been erected in the following places, with the most beneficial results, viz. :—2 in Gibraltar Gardens ; 2 in Peacock Place; 1 in Charlotte Court, Turvilte Street; 1 in Reform Square, Friars' Mount; and 1 in Smith's I'lacc, Hackney Road. " On November 4th, 1866, another seizure of diseased meat was made at the slaughterhouse of Mr. Charles Geary, Essex Street, Cambridge Road. The carcase of a cow, ia a state totally unfit for human food, was discovered in process of being dressed for market. It was taken before the Magistrate at Worship Street, who at once condemned it and ordered it to be destroyed, which was immediately done. The defendant was fined 10/. and costs." SCAVENGING AND DUSTING. There has been an improvement in these departments, but not nearly so much as I could desire. In the first quarter of the year 1867 there were in this Parish 1323 births and 796 deaths, particulars of which will be given in the next Report. i must not conclude without expressing my sincere thanks to the Committee appointed under the Orders in Council, for the handsome manner in which they recognized my extra services during the epidemic, when the energies of all were taxed to the utmost degree; and also to the Sanitary Committee, for their hearty co-operation and goodwill in considering suggestions and furthering endeavours in all things which tended to the improvement and well-being of the District, during this most eventful year. i am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, THOMAS SARVIK, M.D. 135, Bethnal Green Road.

YEAR 1860. BET 76 SIXTH REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of BETHNAL GREEN, by SAMUEL PEARCE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH, London: PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY, by J. S. FORSAITH, 118, BETHNAL GREEN ROAD, N.E. 1861, DEDICATED in remembrance of instruction afforded and favors received, to JAMES LUKE, ESQ., F.R. S., F.R.C.S., LATE PRESIDENT OP THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND,) senior surgeon of the london hospital, and surgeon of st. luke's hospital; to whom the author of this report will ever owe life-lasting gratitude and respect. 135, Bethnal Green Road, May 6th, 1861. Gentlemen, Following the course heretofore pursued, I beg to lay before you the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Progress of Bethnal Green during the year 1860. It will, at the onset, gratify you to know, that notwithstanding the extraordinary weather and the high price of provisions, our Births rose and our Death-roll fell. In the first quarter the mean temperature was but 38.9°, and the mortality was great. The maximum of deaths for any one week of the year was registered with us in this quarter on March 24th, and numbered 77. In the second quarter, the month of June was wet and cold, and on the 24th the humidity attained 100, or the point of saturation; so that "there was no difference between the mean dew point temperature and air temperature." During this quarter the mean temperature was 50.5°, and in the week completed on April 21st, there died only 20 persons in Bethnal Green. This was the minimum of our weekly returns. Throughout the Summer the fall of rain was large, and the mean heat 56.8°, or "five degrees less than the average of four corresponding quarters, 1856-9." Fortunately the wet and cold "retarded putrefaction and washed away" the poisons as they rose. In the last quarter "the weather was generally cold, frequently wet or dull, and before the year closed singularly severe." The mean temperature was 42.8°. Table I. in the Appendix furnishes month by month the readings of the Barometer and Thermometer, the relative proportions of the wind, the fall of rain, and the Deaths in London and Bethnal Green. In London 4 the obituary list consisted of 61,821 persons; in Bethnal Green of 2184. The latter figures represent for this District an average of 182 deaths every month, of* 42 every week, and of 6 every day. "Not certified" was recorded against 11, and "No medical attendant" against 19 of the deaths. The total Returns show, when divided, a mortality of 1100 males and 1084 females, whose per centages are to population 1.054 and 1.039. The sum of the children born alive was 4107, or 4 more than in 1859. It exceeded the deaths by 1923, and bore an average to them of 1.8 to 1. Of sexes, the proportion of the Boys was 2072, that of the Girls 2035, or 98 females to 100 males. In reference to population, the Births formed a per centage of 3.9, i.e., 1 to every 25.4 living. Throughout England in 1860 the per centage was 3.4, or of the living 1 in 29. The highest amounts occurred in Bethnal Green in March and August, the lowest in September and July. Out of 1000 Births, our mortality below 5 years numbered 284. Of each 1000 "only 221 die in agricultural districts, whilst 385 die annually at that age in closely-built towns." Comparatively the mortality in 1860 was 89 less than in 1859, and 258 less than in 1858. It was too 146 below the mean of the foregoing 10 years. Derived from weekly averages of a similar time, the Death-rolls show an excess during 16 weeks in London, 11 in Whitechapel, 19 in Shoreditch, and 18 in Bethnal Green. For the latter place the death rate of the year—worked on the excess of the Births over the Deaths—fell "100 lower than the Metropolitan, and .228 lower than the East Districts' Return. These figures express, that of 43 living persons 1 died in the East Districts; of 45.5 living 1 died in London; and of 47.7 living 1 died in Bethnal Green. They tell therefore where life was of most value last year. 5 If the Deaths be apportioned by the New Classification, 498 persons sank from Diseases of the Zymotic Class ; 449 from those of the Constitutional; 857 from those of the "Local, comprising diseases of the brain, circulation, respiration, digestion, urinary, reproductive, locomotive, and integumentary systems;" 266 from those of the Developmental, or "Diseases of Growth, Nutrition and Decay;" and 114 from those of the Violent Class, or "Deaths from evident external causes." On the other hand, by the Old Classification (Table II.) the formula supplied by the Registrar-General, the per centage of the 1st Class ("Epidemic, Endemic, and Contagious") was 22.5; of the 2nd Class(Dropsy, &c.) 2.7; of the 3rd (Tubercular) 18.6; of the 4th (Brain) 9.2 ; of the 5th (Heart) 3.0; of the 6th (Respiratory) 22.2; of the 7th (Stomach) 5.0; of the 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th (Kidneys, Childbirth, Joints, Skin, and Malformation) 20; of the 13th and 14th (Premature Birth and Atrophy) 3.9; of the 15th (Old Age) 5.2; of the 16th (Sudden Death) 2.1; and of the 17th (Violent Death) 2"7. By the Epidemic group 430 were destroyed, of whom 326 died under 5 years; 61 between 5 and 20; and 43 more at all other ages. Of all deaths it formed 19.6 per cent., while in London it constituted 16.4. In the East Districts—in which Bethnal Green is comprised —its per centage was 17.6. Small Pox, the most preventable and appalling of this " great class of maladies," was fatal, mostly through negligence, to 36 individuals, 4 of whom had reached their 21st, 22nd, 26th and 38th years. The great culpability so incurred is thus noticed by Mr. Simon: "The death of a child by Small Pox would in most instances call for a verdict of 'homicide by omission' against the parents who had neglected daily opportunities of giving it immunity from that disease, by the simple process of 6 nation." Measles, which became more virulent after the continued prevalence of Small Pox, swept away 112. Now in Scotland, it has been observed by the Registrar-General, "that in years when, or localities where, Small Pox has not been prevalent, the mortality from Measles is very small, but when Small Pox has extended and put on the epidemic form, the mortality from Measles becomes very great." The quotation demonstrates the double safeguard that early vaccination forthwith confers. Scarlatina and Diptheria fortunately decreased from 188 and 157 in 1858-9 to 96 in 1860. Malignant was registered against the former 22 times. How tenaciously this dire disease may cling to a house the following shows:—"In a village in Essex there was a severe outbreak of Scarlet Fever. A man at the extremity had a child die with the disease. This was the last case that occurred at that time in the village. He had three other children, the whole of whom he at once sent away to their grandmother, 8 miles off. None of the children were recalled for two months, and the house was in the meantime whitewashed, and together with the bed linen and every other material that could be considered capable of retaining the disease, was thoroughly cleansed. At the end of the two months, one boy returned home; he had not been in the house a day before he was seized with the premonitory symptoms, had the disease in its severest form, and in spite of all treatment died. A period of between four and five months elapsed, in which interval the same cleansing processes were carried on as before; and the parents thinking that all danger must now necessarily be passed, recalled their last remaining boy. There had been no case in the village during the time intervening, but this boy on returning home was seized exactly in the same manner as the previous one, and also died." Whooping Cough, which is also 7 a very fatal disease, numbered four victims more than in 1859. One person died from it at the age of 20 years. Diarrhoea showed a minority of 121 deaths and Typhus of 10, when contrasted with the year before. Taken severally there died from the living 1 in 2897 by Small Pox, 1 in 931 by Measles, 1 in 1086 by Scarlatina and Diptheria, 1 in 1768 by Whooping Cough, 1 in 1580 by Diarrhœa, and 1 in 1709 by Typhus. In their social relation the Epidemics caused among the gentry 1 death in 10.2, among the tradesmen 1 in 4.5, and among the artizans 1 in 5.1. Nos. 3 and 4 (the Epidemic Tables) compare them side by side in London, the East Districts and Bethnal Green. Excepting in Whooping Cough, the Epidemic per centages of Bethnal Green surpass those of London, excepting also in Typhus they surpass the East Districts in every form. One other observation in the way of prevention is worthy of note, that "the younger a child is, the greater is the danger of its sinking under an attack. Every effort should therefore be made to improve the health during childhood, and if possible to prevent attacks of these epidemic diseases till the seventh year of life is attained." Exclusive of the Epidemics, the Zymotic Class caused 62 other deaths from Croup, Cholera, Erysipelas, Puerperal and Rheumatic Fevers, &c., &c. Various forms of Haemorrhage, Dropsy, Abscess, Mortification, Cancer, and other affections of "uncertain seat" removed from our population 60 more. Under Tubercular headings there were registered 408 deaths; 3 of which occurred from Scrofula, 105 from Marasmus or Wasting, 260 from Consumption, and 40 from Water on the Brain. To Consumption 157 males and 103 females owed their fate. It was most destructive in March and November, and least of all in August, September and October. In regard of age, 18 sank below 5, and 28 between 5 8 and 20 years; 138 at 20—40, 72 at 40—60, and 4 beyond the 3rd vicenniad. Out of every 10,000 living, our loss was 25; in England it is annually about 26, and "in eight counties of Scotland 17." The colder the place the less it prevails; it is, in fact, "rare in Siberia, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Orkneys," and "in the Arctic Regions it is all but unknown." In hot climates, however, there happens just the reverse: for "13 in the 1000 is the proportion of soldiers attacked by Consumption in Jamaica, whilst it is only 6 per 1000 in England." The one condition to prevent it, is to breathe plenty of fresh air.* The mortuary returns of the gentry give a loss therefrom of 1 in every 7; those of the tradesmen of 1 in 8.5; those of the artizans of 1 in 8.4. Of "the maladies of that wonderful system of organs which especially distinguish man from the inferior animals—some at the various stages of life paralyzing him, some deranging his powers of motion, and others assailing his passions or his intellect," there died 202. 38 of these perished by Apoplexy, 33 by Paralysis, 4 by Tetanus, and 1, the widow of a solicitor, forfeited her life to Delirium Tremens. Among the 66 cut off by Heart Disease, I allude with much regret to the late Mr. John Shenton, an old and faithful servant of Bethnal Green, who as he was passing, while on duty, along the road, fell against his son and was suddenly summoned hence. "When called to him, and the event occurred only five doors from my own, he was no more. To Pulmonary Affections 487 deaths are referred, which, owing to the untoward weather, were much in excess. Their *On the evils of want of air, it has been facetiously said:— "Who gets the wind but through a hole, May make his will and mind his soul." 9 numerals in 1857-9 are expressed by 413, 461, and 350. How the quota of Epidemics, Consumption, and Diseases of the Respiratory Organs varied month by month last year I annex below:— Diseases. January. February. March. April. May. June. July. August. September. October. November. December.

Among its sub-divisions Teething took off 50, Liver and Stomach Affections 31, and Intestinal Complaints 14. By the several headings of Classes 8, 9, 10, and 11, the numbers carried off were 40, namely:—by the Kidneys 13, Childbirth 21, Joints 3, and Skin 3. In Classes 12, 13, 14, and 15, the Deaths by Malformation were 4, by Premature Birth and Debility 66, by Atrophy 20, and by Old Age, "the only disease natural to man," 114. Finally, Classes 16 and 17, which comprise chiefly the Sudden and Violent Deaths, register our loss at 115. 121 Inquests were recorded in the year. The individuals on whom the inquiries were held included 62 males, or 35 children and 27 adults; and 59 females, or 34 children and 25 adults. Of the verdicts, 1 was from "Effusion on the Brain," 1 from "Exhaustion," 1 from "a Shock," 1 "through 10 drinking boiling water," 1 "through being thrown out of a chaise," 1 by "Gangrene from Injury to the Hand," 1 by "Perforation of Skull from falling on an upright nail," 1 of "Manslaughter against some boy unknown" for drowning a child, 1 from being "Crushed by a Railway Engine," and 1 by "Hanging;" 2 were from "Excessive Drinking," 2 from "Burns and Injuries from clothes getting on fire," 3 by "Cut-throat," 3 from " Injuries to Head from a fall," 4 by "Wilful Murder" of infants newly born, 4 by "Drowning," intentional and accidental, 6 from "Rupture of a Bloodvessel," 7 from "Ossification of the Aorta, Hypertrophy, and Fatty Degeneration of the Heart," 13 were "found Dying or Dead," 25 were from "Suffocation," and 42 from "Sudden Deaths." "The individuals who, Judas like," took "with their own hands the lives God gave," numbered 6. One was only 24, while another had passed her 72nd year. Incision of throat was the means employed by a corn dealer, a weaver, and the widow of a twine spinner; hanging by a hawker, and drowning by the daughter of a furniture dealer and an ostler. At the several Institutions in the District the deaths consisted (1) in the Workhouse of 82 male and 100 female Paupers; (2) in Bethnal House Asylum, of 8 male and 5 female Lunatics; (3) in the City of London Hospital, of 29 male and 5 female Patients; (4) in the Trinity Ground, of 2 male Pensioners; (5) at the Barracks in Globe Street, of 1 Staff Sergeant; and (6) at the Model Buildings of Miss Burdett Coutts, of 4 male and 2 female Lodgers. Table 7 classifies the Causes of the Workhouse Deaths. It shows—with the exception of the column headed "All other Diseases," which consists for the most part of Deaths from Age and Decay—that the greatest fatality depended on Tubercular Affections; two of which, Marasmus and 11 sumption, killed the entire 39; and that the next in rotation was from Diseases of the Air Passages and Lungs. It assigns to certain Brain Affections, namely, Apoplexy, Paralysis, Epilepsy, and Convulsions a loss of 25; and to certain Zymotic Maladies, chiefly Fever and Diarrhoea, a loss of 23. Successively in the gradations of each 20 years, 35 of the inmates died in the first vicennium ; 19 in the second; 45 in the third; 68 in the fourth ; and 15 in the fifth. 85 and 89 were the highest ages on the list. Registered as on the gross returns, the 182 deceased comprised 1 Seamstress, 1 Laundress, 1 Nurse, 1 Carman, 1 Brush-maker, 1 Twinespinner, 1 Chair-maker, 1 Cork-cutter, 1 Cooper, 1 Butcher, 1 Hatter, 1 Iron-moulder, 1 Painter, 1 Builder, 1 Engraver, 1 Type-founder, 1 Bookbinder, 1 Mathematical Instrumentmaker, 2 Bakers, 2 Box-makers, 2 Blacksmiths, 2 Winders, 3 Binders, 3 Tailors, 3 Porters, 3 Carpenters, 4 Hawkers, 6 Shoe-makers, 7 Unknown, 21 Labourers, 43 "Weavers, and 63 Servants. At Christmas ult., the living comprehended 359 men, 423 women, and 287 children; or an increase over the Christmas of 1859 of 217 of the In-door Poor. So likewise the Outdoor Poor, who numbered 964, showed an excess of 103. The following entry in the "Visitors' Book" testifies to the advantages of our "Model Workhouse:"— "I have this day inspected the Bethnal Green Workhouse, and it would be difficult for me to express the surprise and gratification with which I have seen all the arrangements. Not only have I not found anything defective under the important heads of cleanliness, ventilation, &c., but it seems to me that the gardens and yards for the use of the inmates constitute a feature which one would not have expected to find in an establishment of this description, and which must be of the greatest comfort to the aged and infirm persons who have here found a home. "A. A. KNOX, Magistrate, Worship-street. "April, 1861." 12 The ages of the 2184 persons whose mortality is recorded during 1860, extended over 48,511 years of life. These years when sub-divided, give a mean age of 22.21, and if worked on the Registrar-General's form a mean life-time of 40.5.* In London, and in all England, the mean age is 29 years, and the duration of life about 37 and 41. With us the Gentry outlived the Tradesmen by more than 24, and the Artizans by 27 years.† Respectively they passed away as seen in Table 5, at the ages of 48, 23, and 21. Of the adults who died, the years of life were 53, or 7 below the term that an Englishman on the average may expect to endure. Passing on to the deaths at different times and commencing with those at the earliest age, 287 occurred under three months, 113 between three and six, and 220 between six months and twelve. Under one year the deaths were to the births as 620 to 4107, or 1 in each 6.6. Between the years 1 and 2 the infantile loss was 288; between 2 and 3, 135; between 3 and 4, 80; and between 4 and 5 it was 44. By adding these the total is 1167, or a loss of 53.4 on every 100 deaths. Throughout London the per centage below 5 years rates above 40, in Liverpool (1860) at 43, in Leeds at 46, and in Manchester at 47. Taking the ratio to the living at the like age 75.9 per 1000 fell in 1860 in Bethnal Green. In the Healthy Districts of England, there are found to die in that number 40.3; while in England during 1847-56 they amounted to 68.2, and in London during 1849-53 to 77.1. The employment of many of the mothers in other than domestic work, with certain endemic influences, and too often want of means, account for much of the waste of infant life, and, by conse- *"The mean age of those who die is less than the lifetime, because the Births exceed the Deaths." †Prohably for the reason that the 1st Class consists principally of those who have retired at middle age, whose families for the most part are beyond the age of 5. 13 quence, for its high rate of death. "Inasmuch," says Mr. Simon, "as the few days of these wretched children are passed mainly within doors, so their high mortality constitutes the readiest and least fallacious evidence of the unwholesomeness of the dwellings in which they die." Of the population living in the five succeeding years, there perished 92, or to each 1000, 7'05. In England the rate is 8.96 Between the ages 10—20, which comprehend (at 10 —15) the healthiest years of life, the mortality was 61; or of 1000, 2.93. Up to this period, that is, under 20 years, 1320 persons, or a per centage over 60, terminated their career below. In the vicenniads 2 and 3, the dying numbered 239 and 275. Hence, 514 were swept away at "the periods of life when the organs of the body have attained their full growth and put forth their full strength; when the physical organisation has acquired its utmost perfection; when the senses, the feelings the emotions, are in the highest degree acute, intense, and varied; when the intellectual faculties, completely unfolded and developed, carry on their operations with the greatest vigour, soundness, and continuity ; in a word, when the individual is capable of communicating as well as of receiving the largest amount of the highest kind of happiness." As a relief to this premature decay, the deaths referable to Age were 350; of which 290 occurred at 60—80 and 60 at 80—100 years. Among these, 3 only lived to 92, 93 and 94. It was stated in my Report on 1858, that the numbers living in Bethnal Green in 1851 exceeded those of London at all ages under 20 years; but were afterwards inferior at every other age. When, however, weighed with England, we have a surplus of children under 10; a less amount of youths, more adults at 20—60; and fewer at every age beyond 14 On every 10,000 of the Sub-District population the difference of health is represented by 191 deaths in the Hackney Road, by 219 in the Green, by 181 in the Church, and by 169 in the Town.* Correspondingly the Birth-rates varied from 380 in No. 1, to 457 in No. 2, to 379 in No. 3, to 365 in No. 4. So, too, the Epidemic per centages ranged consecutively from 23.5, 15.5, 16.7 to 25.5. In the Green 1 person out of every 213 died of Consumption, in the Town 1 in 537, in the Hackney Road 1 in 549, and in the Church 1 out of every 614. Further, the infantile loss was respectively in the first, second, third and fourth Divisions, 113, 129, 103, and 102. The mean vitality of the dying reached only 17 95 years in the Town, 1950 in the Hackney Road, 19.87 in the Church, and 27.84 in the Green; while the adult vitality averaged 52.18 years in the Church, 52.87 in the Green, 5341 in the Town, and 53 91 in the Hackney Road. On calculating the mortality of each sex for the last 4 years, there was an excess of 34, 80 and 44 deaths of males in the Hackney Road, Green, and Church; whereas 35 more females died in the Town. The latter fact is curious, and perhaps depends on the greater emigration that goes on in the Town. Of adult Weavers 10 were cut off in Sub-District 1, 55 in No. 2, 38 in No. 3, and 32 in No. 4. 34 of them lived beyond 70, and 11 beyond 80 years; 6 of their deaths occurred from Epidemics, 21 from Consumption, 3 Suddenly, 1 by Suicide, and 1 from Fracture of the Skull. Their mean age was 61. Among the males dying in certain occupations, professions or positions above 20 years of age (Table 9) the proportions to the living in 1851 ranged from 1 Accountant in 13, 1 Agent in every 3, 1 Annuitant in 25, 1 Baker in 52, 1 *These rates are derived from adding the excess of the Births over the Deaths to the population of each of the Sub-Districts in 1851. 15 Butcher in 39, 1 Carman, Carrier or Drayman in 56, 1 Carpenter in 38, 1 Cheesemonger in 57, 1 Commercial Clerk in 25, 1 Commercial Traveller in 45, 1 Cowkeeper in 124, 1 Druggist in 37, 1 Engraver in 7.5, 1 Fishmonger in 129, 1 Gentleman in 6, 1 Grocer in 88, 1 Hawker in 32, 1 House Proprietor in 13, 1 Labourer in 23, 1 Licensed Victualler or Beer Shopkeeper in 30, 1 Messenger or Porter in 26, 1 Painter, Plumber, or Glazier in 52, 1 Printer in 24, 1 Shoemaker in 82, 1 Surgeon in 41, 1 Tailor in 58, and 1 Weaver in every 68. With regard to places where, for size, the mortality preponderated in 1860, Austin, John, and Scott Streets, Weatherhead Gardens, Myring and Elizabeth Places, and Prospect Terrace figured highest in their death-returns; while, on the contrary, Sherwood and Accidental Places, Lenham and Turville Buildings, Sweet Apple Square, Ely and Providence Places, with Digby Street and Walk, rose considerably in the scale of health. Having laid before you our Vital Statistics for 1860, I now proceed to the New Cases of Illness in the Guardian Asylum, Queen Adelaide's Dispensary, the City of London Hospital, and the Pauper Medical Practice. In the first Institution the cases were only 39, of which 12 depended on Diarrhoea, 5 on Rheumatic Fever, 12 on Bronchitis or Catarrh, and 10 on Diseases of other forms—there was no death within the walls. At Queen Adelaide's Dispensary the Epidemics numbered 74, namely, Small Pox 5, Measles 10, Scarlatina and Diptheria 14, Whooping Cough 4, Diarrhoea 27, and Continued Fever 14. Ague attacked two of the patients treated there, Carbuncle 2, Erysipelas 4, and Rheumatic Fever 6. 164 were affected with Bronchitis, 2 with Pleurisy, and 16 with Inflammation of the Lungs. All the other Diseases superadded raised the total to 1969; on which 57 16 deaths occurred. In the City of London Hospital the Inpatients amounted to 363, and the Out-Patients to 7725; whereof the mortality was 34. Sub-divided into Out and In-door cases, the Pauper Practice comprised 635 in District 1, 1241 in District 2, 881 in District 3, 1438 in District 4, 1475 in District 5, and 1075 within the House. Measured by the years 1857—59, the numbers are 27 short of 1857; 599 fewer than in 1858, but 235 higher than in 1859. Against the cases there rate 511 Deaths, or 1 to 13. For 1857 the Pauper mortality was 448; for 1858, 539; and for 1859, 441; or of the Deaths to Cases as 1 in 15, 1 in 13.6, and 1 in 14.7. Small Pox, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhoea were the ruling Epidemics in Sub-division 5, Measles and Scarlatina in Sub-division 4, and Fever in Sub-division 2. Erysipelas predominated in No. 3, Pulmonary Inflammations and Rheumatic Fever in Nos. 4 and 5. Among the Hygienic Improvements of 1860, the fulfilment of the following Order in Council will be highly advantageous:— Order 3.—"Saint Matthew, Bethnal Green. That the coffins contained in the vaults beneath the Church of Saint Matthew, Bethnal Green, if required in the restoration of the Church, be re-arranged; that the vaults be filled up with earth, and covered with a layer of concrete three feet thick, and that the remaining part of the area of the Church be covered with a layer of concrete two feet thick; and that the works, so far as regards the protection of health, be superintended by the Medical Officer of Health of the District, and that Chlorine, McDougall's Powder, or other Disinfectants be used whenever necessary." These works, completed under the supervision of the Churchwardens, render it impossible for any effluvia ever again to enter the Church. 17 Several Branch Sewers in Sclater, Anchor, and York Streets have enhanced considerably the Sanitary Defences of the year. Steps have been taken to obviate the nuisances of certain offensive trades : such as Fish Caring, Frying and Smoking, Boiling of Oil, Heaping of Tan, and Boiling of Decomposed Meat. The enormous mounds of Rubbish and Dust in Mr. Newman's yard, in Tyssen Street, have, by the Magistrate's order, been reduced in bulk and height; certain Lucifer Works have been improved; Pig Keeping, wherever possible, has been prevented; and the Slaughter Houses have been supervised. Ventilation has been put in force, and overcrowding stopped; the latter especially in one case, where a woman died from exhaustion after her confinement "in a room where 9 others slept." Many other appliances in trapping and improving drains, in abolishing cesspools and erecting closet apparatus, in establishing sewer communications, and rendering homes more healthy, have aided the advantages heretofore obtained. Their figures, which I owe to the kindness of the Surveyor and Inspector, constitute the last Table of this Report. The Summary of the foregoing shows, that in 1860 the quota of the Epidemics and Consumption declined; that the mortality was smaller and the waste of life less. This "lowness of mortality" and diminution of disease may doubtless be increased, "if only the removable evils be removed, if only the practicable good be made practical." It is related, that in the Scottish Isle of St. Kilda, where refuse in thrown on the floors and trodden down under foot, "8 out of every 10 children die between the 8th and 12th days of their existence." They die from breathing foul air, for the refuse 18 is saved and sold as manure. One family only is said to escape, the family of the Clergyman resident there. In his house, of course, no such custom prevails. Many of these deaths, but for such insanitary conditions, would not occur. If, then, we would "abate the pace of death," we must avail ourselves of all the defences of health—of sewerage, water, scavenging, ventilation, and light, with the strict avoidance also of overcrowding—so that our blood may not be poisoned nor we destroyed by disease. Thus shall we "not only live longer, but be better fitted to answer the great ends of life." I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, "With great respect, Very faithfully yours, SAMUEL PEARCE, Medical Officer of Health.

4 BET 74 REPORT No. 4. YEAR 1858. FOURTH SERIES OF THE SANITARY EPITOME OF BETHNAL GREEN, BY SAMUEL PEARCE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY. 1859. THIS AUDITION by the medical officer of health to the SANITARY HISTORY OF BETHNAL GREEN, IS INSCRIBED WTTH DEEP GRATITUDE AND RESPECT to the NUMEROUS FRIENDS, WHO IN HIS HOURS OF SUFFERING, AFTER AN ACCIDENT IN OCTOBER, 1858, AIDED HIM BY THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS, and reinstated him in the PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION. 135, Bethnal Green Road, May 20th, 1859. "Property no less than life is interested in the progress of Sanitary Reform." Gentlemen, The Report that I have now the honour of presenting, comprises the Sanitary Epitome of Bethnal Green during 1858. Putting in juxta-position the three years of your regime, the Births and Deaths have ranged thus:— Years. Births. Deaths. 1856 3640 1905 1857 3854 2291 1858 3922 2442 Totals. 11,416 6638 As in Bethnal Green, so throughout London, the Deaths increased year by year; rising consecutively from 56,786 to 60,150 and 63,882. On the triennial average, our Death rate was 21.55 in the 1000, or one out of every 46.40 living; that of the Metropolis was 22.51, or one in each 44.42 persons. The mean temperature was 49.1 in the first year, 51T in the second, and 49'2 in the third; whilst the "daily amount of horizontal movement of the air" averaged 100 miles in the first period, 76 in the second, and 86 in the third. So too the rain-fall varied, being 21.5 inches in 1856, 21.4 in 1857, and 17.2 in 1858. The weather of each month 4 of last year and the Deaths in London and Bethnal Green are shown in the first Table of the Appendix to this Report. "1858," says the Registrar-General, "was an unhealthy year." The heat of the second quarter was great; some days "were of almost tropical heat, but as November overtook us there came an extraordinary change. A long drought was followed by intense cold which deformed for ever the aspect of 1858." In our District, the maximum mortality consisting of 70 and 76 deaths occurred in the weeks ending July 17th and December 4th, while the minimum mortality was attained in the two terminating February 13th and June 5th. Nosologically, the increase of Small Pox and the prevalence of Scarlatina were the distinguishing features of the year. Computing the population by the surplus of births, it numbered 101,966 persons in the middle of 1858. If, however, the influx of immigrants equaled the rate of the preceding dccennium, it was 104,755. Assuming—from the great increase of new buildings, and from the birth ratio exceeding by 4.8 the London proportion—that the rule still obtains, I have made the latter estimate the basis of my calculations in the present Report. Accordingly, the population under the age of 5 would be 15,431; at 5—10, 13,090; at 10—20, 20,908; at 20—40, 32,296; at 40—60, 17,245; at 60—80, 5,404; at 80—100, 380; and beyond the age of 100, 1. Consequently the children under 5 constitute 14.7 per cent. of our people; whereas in all England in 1851 their percentage was about 13. Of the 104,755 persons there would be living on the 141 acres of the Sub-District—Hackney Road, 27,149; on the 391 acres of the Green, 30,230; on the 132 acres of the Church, 25,747; and on the 96 acres of the Town, 21,629. The area to each individual therefore will be 25 square yards in Sub-District 1; 62 in No. 2; 25 in No. 3; and 21 in No. 4. Such, speaking generally, is 5 the actual area, but of course, as divided, each person has not the advantage of equal proportional space. "In the City of London, without the walls, the density is one person to every 16 square yards of area;" and at the Census there was in all London, if "uniformly distributed, 1 individual to every 160 yards." Analytically the births—exclusive of those still-born— comprised 2011 Boys and 1911 Girls; the addition to the population by the preponderance of births was 1480; and the birth ratio 37.43 to 1000 living. The following was the Sub-District distribution of the births, and the number to each 1000 of their population:— Sub-Districts. Births. Ratio to 1000 living. Males. Females. Total. Hackney Road 549 481 1030 37.93 Green 538 541 1079 35.69 Church 473 442 915 35.53 Town 451 447 898 41.51 Totals 2011 1911 3922 The yearly mortality was at the rate of 2.331 per cent.; that of London was 2.356; that of the East Districts 2.530. Respectively, these represent 1 death in 42.90, in 42.44, and in 39.52 persons. It was also .169 below the average of the town districts generally in England and Wales. Supposing however our population not to outnumber the excess of births over deaths, the mortality of the year would be to the living as 1 in 41.77. And here I may notice that if thus estimated, the death rates of 1856 and 1857 would be 1 in each 51.30 and 43.31 persons, in lieu of 1 in 52 and 45 individuals, as stated on the decennial calculations of 1841—51, in the Reports. Compared with the foregoing 10 years, health was 6 above par in 35 out of the 52 weeks in Whitechapel, in 30 in London, in 28 in Shoreditch, in 24 in Bethnal Green, in 16 in Poplar, and in 10 in Hackney. For the entire Parish the mean age at death was 22.64 years, and the mean lifetime 36.14. The Gentry lived 47.42 years, the Tradesmen 24.64, and the Artisans 20.98 years. In adult life the 1st class lived 62.20 years, the 2nd 53.33, and the 3rd 54.06. In all England the mean age at death is 29, and of those who pass the age of 20—60 years. Thus, in the one case we lost 5¾ and in the other 6¼ years of life. Our differences are illustrated in Tables 3 and 4. With respect to the influence of the Seasons, 640 deaths, or 26.20 per cent. of the mortality occurred in the Winter; 581 or 23.79 per cent. in the Spring; 603 or 24.69 in the Summer; and 618 deaths or 25.30 per cent. in the Autumn. The relative fatality in each Quarter is exhibited in Table 2, side by side with the Causes of, and Ages at, Death. That Table also recounts the deaths in 1857, and facilitates the comparison of one year with the other. It illustrates, for example, that the mortality by Fever, Erysipelas, Dropsy, and Consumption was nearly alike, that it was higher by the first three epidemics, by Child-birth, Puerperal and Rheumatic Fevers, by Brain, Heart and Lung affections, by Premature Birth and Old Age; and was lower by Whooping Cough, Diarrhoea, Hœmorrhage, Tabes, Diseases of the Organs of Digestion and Kidneys, and by Violent and non-specified Deaths. Specially, the death percentages in the several classes were in the 1st, or Zymotic, 29; in the 3rd, or Tubercular, 17.48; in the 4th, or Brain, 10.36; in the 5th, or Heart, 1.8; in the 6th, or Lung, 18.8; in the 7th, or Digestive, 5.7; in the 16th, or Violent class, 3.3; and in all the other groups, 13.2. Distributed according to the new classification, which consists of 5 classes only, 728 deaths belong to the Zymotic class, 479 to the Constitutional, 850 to the Local, 298 to the 7 lopmental, and 87 to the class of Violent Deaths. "In the order of their fatality" you will see that Consumption occupied the first place, Pneumonia the second, Scarlatina the third, Bronchitis the fourth, Tabes the fifth, Old Age the sixth, Whooping Cough the seventh, Typhus the eighth, Diarrhœa the ninth, Measles the tenth, Convulsions the eleventh, and Teething the twelfth. As regards the fatality of the first 8 diseases, 1 person out of every 410 fell by Consumption, 1 out of 482 by Pneumonia, 1 out of 557 by Scarlatina, 1 out of 658 by Bronchitis, 1 out of 838 by Tabes or "Abdominal Consumption," 1 out of 851 by Age, 1 out of 918 by Whooping Cough, and 1 out of every 1007 by Typhus, Just as in London so in Bethnal Green there was an increase in the deaths by Epidemics, the rise in the one being 81, in the other 2445. With us their ratio of mortality was 1 out of every 3'91 deaths, in London 1 to 4.75. Our large onslaught from Small Pox, consequent often on neglect of vaccination, forms a melancholy characteristic of the year. Unhappily, too, Scarlatina assumed a most malignant type; in several instances proving fatal in the eruptive stage. In many cases no special insanitary conditions prevailed; showing, in the words of Mr. Simon, "it is impossible to doubt that the severity of its attack mainly depends on conditions peculiar to the person of the patient, and that no perfection of external circumstances will insure mildness of infection."* Diptheria, or "Malignant Throat Disease," is registered under Scarlatina, and among its victims are recorded—in an open well-constructed house—a father and two sons, of the respective ages of 35, 9, and 7 years. In social position the six Epidemics constituted 1 out of each 6 of the deaths of the * Dr. Greenhow says too, "that the average annual proportion of deaths produced by Scarlatina in Glendale, the healthiest district in England, is about the same as occurs in Liverpool, the unhealthiest city in the kingdom." 8 Gentry, 1 in every 4 of the Tradesmen, and 1 in every 3.7 of the Artisans. And of the mortality of the four Sub-Districts, they formed 28.71 per cent. in the Hackney Road; 28.62 in the Church; 28T6 in the Town; and 19.92 per cent. in the Green. Their numbers severally are contrasted in Table 5, and their epidemic percentages in London, the East Districts, and Bethnal Green, in Table 6. The 2nd group of the Causes of Death, comprising Hœmorrhage, Dropsy, Mortification, Cancer, &c., cut off 66 persons; 20 of whom were between 20 and 60 years of age. Of Tubercular Diseases, "Consumption, the enemy of mature life, carried off" 1 of every 7 of the Gentry, 1 of 9 of the Tradesmen, and 1 of 10 of the Artisans. Among all classes from 15 to 40 years it destroyed 127. Its death percentage was 14.43 in the Green, 8.62 in the Town, 8.51 in the Hackney Road, and 7.9 in the Church. Where not derived hereditarily—in-door occupations, close heated rooms and deprivation of pure air are the most potent causes of this "mammoth disease." "Inflammations and other local affections of the 8 great systems of organs of which the human body is made up, were fatal to" 934 persons. In the Brain class, convulsions, chiefly of infants, were the most destructive by far; while Apoplexy caused 33 deaths, Paralysis 59, and Epilepsy 13. 46 persons succumbed to diseases of the heart and large vessels, and 461 to affections of the lungs and organs of respiration. By diseases of the Digestive organs there fell 141, of which, affections of the Liver cut off 13, those of the Stomach 6, and those of the Intestinal Canal 14. To the other 4 groups, including diseases of the Kidneys, of Childbirth, and of the Joints and Skin, 33 deaths are referred. By the several diseases in the classes 12, 13, 14 and 15, comprehending those of "growth, nutrition and decay," there died 215—namely, by Malformations 3, by Premature 9 Birth and Debility 70, by Atrophy 19, and by Old Age 123. Classes 16 and 17, record 10 Sudden and 81 Violent, or non-specified deaths. On the other hand, taking the 3 great groups of diseases, which Dr. Greenhow states are both absolutely and relatively the chief causes of high death rates—viz., (1.) Pulmonary Affections, including Consumption and the several diseases of the respiratory class; (2.) Profluvial Diseases, comprising Diarrhoea, Dysentery and Cholera; and (3.) the Nervous Diseases of children, comprehending Water on the Brain, Convulsions and Teething—they numbered in each 1000 deaths, 293, 46, and 75. In England and Wales, and in all London, out of every 1000 deaths, Pulmonary Affections constitute 241 and 264; Diarrhœal Diseases 72 and 110; and the Nervous Diseases of children 87 and 68. On the 99 persons in respect of whose deaths Inquests were held, the Verdicts may be thus summed up:—"Found Dying" or "Dead" in houses, streets, canals, or parks, 43; by "Suffocation or Overlaying," 4; by "Sudden" and "Natural Deaths," 26; by "Visitation of God," 2; by "Drowning," 6; "Hanging," 4; "Cut Throats," 2; "Excessive Drinking," 1; by "Compression of Brain" and "Rupture of Blood Vessels," 3; by "Falls," "Pressure from an Engine," and "a Carriage Wheel," 4; by "Haemorrhage and Exhaustion after Labour," 2; "From cold, and insufficient food," 1; and "from the effects of 3 drops of Laudanum," 1. Of the Adults 29 were Males and 24 Females; of the children 23 were Boys and 23 were Girls. 5 unknown infants, newly-born, were left to perish in a privy, the canal and streets; and among the suicides, one—under alcoholic influence—cut his throat at his own shop door. The number of those who ended their days in our 3 large institutions, was 288; of whom there died in the Consumption Hospital 14, in Bethnal House Asylum 59, and in the 10 Workhouse 215. 7 other deaths also were registered in Grigg's and Pemmell's Alms Houses. The sum total is not the equivalent of our population proportion of the public institutions of London, which would amount to 90 besides. Many of the inhabitants die, of course, in Hospitals and Institutions situated elsewhere. The Workhouse mortality forms Table 7. You will there see that 33 fell by Epidemics,—that the Tubercular class, comprising Marasmus and Consumption killed 58; that the great bulk died at 60—80, the second at 40—60, and the third at 20—40 years—and that from 10 to 20 the deaths were only 6. It also shows that one, a weaver, reached the patriarchal age of 101. Classified by trades and occupations, the several inmates, Children and Adults, consisted of 64 Servants, 53 Weavers, 24 Labourers, 8 Unknown, 6 Shoemakers, 6 Seamstresses, 4 Winders, 4 Charwomen, 4 Bootbinders, 3 Dyers, 3 Laundresses, 2 Coal Porters, 2 House Painters, 2 Shoe-binders, 1 Chair Stuffcr, 1 Carver, 1 Cabinet Maker, 1 Waiter, 1 Sawyer, 1 Braid-maker, 1 Tinman, 1 Cornchandler, 1 Baker, 1 Cigar Stripper, 1 Twine Spinner, 1 Carman, 1 Nurse, 1 Tailoress, 1 Straw Bonnet-maker, 1 Cooper, 1 Case-maker, 1 Butcher, 1 Porter, 1 Dress-maker, 1 Cab Driver, 1 Coachman, 1 Hawker, 1 Victualler, 1 Clerk, 1 Musician, 1 Jeweller, 1 Engineer, 1 Matron, and 1 Gentleman. The total amount of Pauperism was, at Christmas, 1660, or less by 825 than in 1857. Exclusive of the Lunatics at the different Asylums, the number of the inmates was, in the Workhouse 896; and of those out of doors 764. "Thus," says the Times, "in Bethnal Green the pauperism is less in proportion to other parishes as compared with population." In reference to the mortality at certain ages, 1276 died below 5 years; 144 from 5 to 10; 68 from 10 to 20; 425 over 60; 82 above 80; 8 over 90; and 1 beyond the 11 plete cycle of existence, or at 101 years.* Of the 1276 Infants, "the unripe harvest for the scythe of death," 277 fell under 3 months; 109 from 3 to 6 months; 231 from 6 to 12 months; 303 at 1—2, 165 at 2—3, 105 at 3—4, and 86 at 4—5 years. Under the age of 1 the deaths formed 157 per cent. of the births, or 1 in 6.3; while in the 61 healthy districts of England enumerated by Mr. Lee, the proportion was 1 to 11. In the period intervening from 20 to 60 years, there passed away from us 529 persons. Between those years "the quotients of the dying by the living" were considerably below the proportions of London in 1855. As "individuals of this class are of much higher political value than the individuals under 5 years, or above 60 years of age," it would appear prima facie that the advantage at those ages is in favour of Bethnal Green.† Table 8 represents the deaths at 8 ages, and in the 5th column the corresponding amounts in 1857. It shows that the numbers of the dying to the living were 82.6 per 1000 at less than 5 years; 11 at 5—10; 3.25 at 10—20; 7 4 at 20—40; 16.7 at 40—60; 63.4 at 60—80; and 215.7 at 80—100 years. If the amount below 5 years be compared with those of 1857, it is less by .89 per 1000; if with the returns of 1838—44, the gain on each 1000 is nearly 3. "Their safety depends very much on the power of the parents to supply them with food and raiment—upon the mothers watchfulness and cleanliness—upon the air they are doomed to respire in imprisoned courts and alleys;" and "where the women are employed in any but domestic labour, they discharge the duties of mothers imperfectly, and the mortality of their children is high." The relative * 100 years, according to M. Flourens, being the natural duration of life, † The ages specified in the quotation by Mr. Edmonds, ranged between 15 and 60 years; but as the Registrar General in the Weekly Return of 1855 distinguishes vicennial periods only, I am unable to contrast them otherwise than as above. The difference however would be small. 12 tion of each 1000 deaths, according to the ages of the dying is annexed below:— London. Bethnal Green. Ages. Composition of each 1000 Deaths. Ages. Composition of each 1000 Deaths. 0—5 399 0—5 522 5—20 86 5—20 87 20—60 312 20—60 217 60—and all beyond. 203 60—and all beyond. 174 Totals 1000 1000 You will gather therefrom, that 124 more of our population died under 20 years, and conversely 124 less at after ages. Such a result, therefore, invalidates greatly our apparent advantage between 20 and 60 years. It follows, too, that the "political value" of our living people is less. At the Census, the life-differences stood thus:— London, 1851. Bethnal Geeen, 1851. Ages. Numbers in each 10,000 Living. Ages. Numbers in each 10,000 Living. 0—5 1243 0—5 1475 5—10 1031 5—10 1249 10—20 1821 10—20 1995 20—40 3531 20—40 3083 40—60 1764 40—60 1646 60—80 572 60—80 516 80—100 38 80—100 36 Totals 10,000 10,000 The Vital Statistics of the 4 Sub-Districts are in Table 9. Analysis shows that their death-rates were respectively 1.860 per cent. in the Hackney Road, 2 062 in the Church, 2.626 13 in the Town, and 2.739 in the Green.* It shows, too, that the mortality of the Zymotic, Tubercular and Respiratory classes of disease ranged, to every 10,000 living, from 124 in the Hackney Road to 130 in the Church, to 173 in the Green, and to 185 in the Town; and that the deaths under 5 years of age were to each myriad 109 in the Hackney Road, 109 in the Green, 115 in the Church, and 164 in the Town. That you may measure the force of these figures, it is proper to state, that in 1851 out of every 10,000 inhabitants, the Green had 1385 children under 5 years of age, the Church 1481, the Hackney Road 1483, and the Town 1553. At all ages life was longest, or 29.51 years in the Green; shorter, or 20.06 in the Church; shorter still, or 18.93 in the Hackney Road; and shortest, or 18.23 in the Town; whilst Adult life was highest, or 55.10 years in the Town; next in amount, or 55.07 in the Green; lower, or 53.14 in the Church; and lowest, or 52.36 years in the Hackney Road Sub-Division. In the next Table, No. 10, I lay before you the Deaths, according to Occupations. Of the 478 persons specified therein, 2.8 per cent. were "engaged in the general or local Government;" 7.6 "in the Defence of the Country;" 4.0 "in the Learned Professions;" 2.9 "in the Fine Arts and Science;" 1.6 "in clothing and performing personal offices for man;" 4.3 per cent. were individuals "who buy or sell, keep, let, or lend money, houses, &c.;" 2.6 were "engaged in the conveyance of men, animals, goods and messages;" 2.6 again included those "possessing or working the Land;" 8.0 per cent. were "engaged about Animals;" 2.3 "in Art and Mechanic Productions;" 1.7 in "working and dealing in Animal Substances;" 2.6 in "working and dealing in Vegetable Substances;" 4.8 in "working and dealing in * In respect of the difference of the death-rates, it must be borne in mind that the Green contains within it 3 "elements of high mortality," i. e., the Workhouse, Lunatic Asylum, and Consumption Hospital; and that the Town has the least individual space. 14 Minerals;" 4.2 as "Labourers and others, branch undefined;" 8.4 were "Persons of Property;" and 54 per cent. were "supported by the Community," and comprised "others of no stated occupation." Of Adult Weavers—combining also the female sex—the mortality was 153 and the mean age 60 years; 10 were cut off by epidemics, and 24 by consumption; 38 lived beyond 70, 16 above 80, 2 over 90, and 1, a Pauper, to 101 years. 1 died suddenly, another "from Rupture of Aorta," 4 were "Found dead in bed," 2 hanged themselves, and 1 "died of excessive drinking." Lastly, I have to point out to you certain portions of Bethnal Green which stood forth pre-eminently for the high mortality that they sustained. Thus, the deaths in Cheshire Street reached 14, in Digby Street and Walk 13, in Lisbon Street 10, in Turk Street 10, in Turville Street to 9, and in Martha Street to 8. In other places the mortality mounted up in Jubilee Place to 4, in Thorold Square to 4, in Sherwood Place to 5, in Hammond's Gardens to 7, in Princes Court to 8, and in Elizabeth Place to 10 per cent. Fortunately—contrasted with 1857—the fatality was less in John's Court, Prospect Terrace, in Ely, Helen and Miring Places, in Butler's Buildings and Sweet Apple Square. We learn from the Retrospect of 1858:— 1. That the mortality, both total and epidemic, rose. 2. That Fever and Consumption were proportionally of less amount. 3. That the infant mortality was in each 1000 somewhat less. 4. That the mean age or value of life was 1 year more. 5. That, compared with London, the children are in excess, and the adults fewer in Bethnal Green. Table 11 portrays the Poor Law Medical Practice, or the Pauper Health of 1858. It summarises 7344 new cases of disease, against 6772 in 1857. Amongst these, 539 deaths 15 occurred, or 1 to every 136 attacked. 1258 of the cases were treated in the Workhouse, and 6086 in the 5 Out-door Divisions. Of the Nosological groups, the 6 Epidemics took as usual the prominent place, numbering together 1832, or 1 to every 4th attack. Their percentage was 18.7 in the Workhouse, and 26 in the Out-door divisions. In point of frequency, Fever ranked first, and attained its maximum in No. 2; Diarrhœa, Measles, Scarlatina, and Whooping Cough were most prevalent in No. 5; whilst Small Pox predominated in No. 4. You will learn with deep regret that the seizures by Small Pox rose to 103, and that they amounted to 79 more than in 1857. Much of this lamentable increase was doubtless owing to non-vaccination; for by the Returns it appears that the certificates of successful cases in Bethnal Green were 1817 short of the Registered Births. Hence, on deducting the 617 deaths under 1 year of age, 1200 infants were left unprotected during 1858. In regard of the sites of the epidemics, 127 occurred in the Eastern out-door division, or No. 1; 294 in the South-Eastern, or No. 2; 242 in the South-Western, or No. 3; 429 in the North-Western, or No. 4; and 504 in the North-eastern, and, in part, Western district, or No. 5. One person out of every 14 of the population had the advice of one or other of the Poor Law Medical Staff. Exclusive of the Pauper Practice, 278 In-patients were admitted into the Consumption Hospital, and 6925 Outpatients were attended in the year. There were also 2396 New cases under treatment at the Dispensary, embracing 1 of Small Pox, 11 of Measles, 18 of Scarlatina, 20 of Whooping Cough, 42 of Diarrhoea, 32 of Fever, 9 of Erysipelas, 3 of Carbuncle, 1 of Elephantiasis, or "Arabian Leprosy," 51 of Consumption and other Tubercular diseases, 229 of Acute Pulmonary Affections, 2 of Ague, and 9 of Rheumatic Fever. In addition, the Returns at the Lunatic Asylum comprised 179 New cases of Insanity, 2 of modified Small Pox, 10 of 16 Diarrhœa, 2 of Erysipelas, 2 of Carbuncle, 10 of Catarrh, and 34 of various kinds. Besides the above, 18 others were attended at the Guardian Asylum on the Green. As the ratio of deaths is annually to the sickness as 1 to 28, the illness, General and Pauper, of Bethnal Green would be 68,376 attacks. I have now to record the Sanitary Progress of the year, which I beg to preface with the annexed remarks :—In the year 1838, when the population of Bethnal Green was little above 70,500 persons, 2254 deaths occurred, and 1 out of every 104 fell by diseases of the epidemic class. When however in 1858 the people amounted to nearly half as many more, the deaths numbered but 2442, and the epidemics were fatal to 1 only out of every 167. These numbers consequently represent the rates on life as Bethnal Green then was and at present is. Entire streets are no longer as at that time swamps, and though from increase of people the area to each one is smaller, the climatorial conditions have so much improved that instead of 1 inhabitant dying annually (as in 1838) out of every 35,* the proportion in 1858 was but 1 in 43. 3 blocks of Sewers, constructed since my last Report, will uphold and advance the vantage ground. By their construction the sanitary condition of the surrounding neighbourhoods will be improved, and the value of the dwellings in 67 streets increased. Favoured with information by your Surveyor and Inspector, whom I very cordially beg to thank, I have now the pleasure of specifying "the numbers of houses drained and completed " in a few " of the several streets where Sewers have been constructed since September 1857." Thus, omitting the streets where less than 30 entries were made, the houses drained in Anglesea, Bath and Essex Streets, numbered respectively 31; in Abbey Street 32; in * " Annual Rate of Mortality per 100 in Bethnal Green 2.873," and " of the Epidemic Class 0.959."—Second Annual Report of the Registrar General, p. 166. 17 George, Orange and Thomas Streets 34 ; in James Street 35; in Gosset Street 36 ; in Cheshire Street 38 ; in North Conduit Street 39 ; in George Street 41 ; in Little Collingwood and Northampton Streets 44; in Duke Street 47 ; in Hereford and Minerva Streets 54; in Norfolk Street 55; in Selby Street 62 ; and in Suffolk Street 70 more. Other auxiliaries in warding off disease are now in requisition : there is less difficulty in getting dust removed, and the work of the Scavenger is better done. The Slaughter-houses have been again examined by the Inspector and myself, and many improvements in their supply of water, paving, lime-whiting, and ventilation have been carried out. The 12th Table particularises the improvements of the year. It shows the number of House Inspections made, of Drains constructed or improved, of Cesspools emptied or filled up, of Privies altered to Water Closets and of New Closets built, of Drains and Gullies trapped, of Houses connected with adjoining Sewers, of miles of Sewers flushed, of Dust Bins and Dust Removals made, and of other measures which amount together to 16,696 Total Works. In all, 1141 complaints of Nuisances have been received, in 23 of which Summonses were ordered and duly served. 15 of these were remedied before the day of hearing, and in the other 8 orders to execute the requirements were obtained. On a former occasion I had to congratulate you on the enclosure of Nova Scotia Gardens, and on its proposed ap propriation to " healthy homes " for our Artisans. Through the philanthrophy of Miss Burdett Coutts the latter has been done, and a Church and Terrace of Model Lodgings now utilize and ornament the ground. Many other parts, too, as Elizabeth Place, Gloucester and Hammond Gardens, John's Court, and the large Dust-hole behind Gibraltar Walk, have been improved, and will, doubtless—like Prospect Terrace, noted down last year—extend the term of health and life. b 18 It is said by M. Mallet, that " the strength of a people does not depend on the absolute number of its population, but on the relative number of those who are of the age and strength for labour." Now, in another page I have shown that we have comparatively a surplus of children and a small proportion of adults, and consequently " that we have fewer brains and fewer arms at work." How to fortify health and so politically to lengthen life, is the great problem that we have to solve : for " property no less than life is interested in the progress of sanitary reform?" On us it rests, both morally and economically, to work the solution out. To open out avenues through our cul-de-sac courts— to promote the sanitary condition of every house—to arrest, by thorough drainage and removal of refuse, the elimination of aerial poison—to dilute and carry off, by free ventilation, the exhalations of the breath and skin—are the great duties that we have day by day to do. Happily life rose one year in 1858, and the mortality under 5 years—the grand test of salubrity—was reduced. Hence, as by Sanitation the causes of ill-health decline, so will the duration of life increase. And as you add block after block of sewers, you not only build such bulwarks up but you magnify the value of the house property in Bethnal Green. Though the task before us be great, the objects in view are immeasurably greater—to exalt the standard of life, to economize rates, and above all to decrease the sum of misery, disease and death. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, With great respect, Very faithfully yours, SAMUEL PEARCE. To the Gentlemen of the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green.

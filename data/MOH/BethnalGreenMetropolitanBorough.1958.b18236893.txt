May, 1959. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentleman, I have the honour to submit my report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1958. Staff. At the beginning of the year, the Department was still three short of its establishment of nine public health inspectors. In April, one of the Inspectors left to take up another appointment and for the remainder of the year there were four vacancies. During the year, the Council approved the appointment of a pupil public health inspector for training with the Department. The work of the Public Health Department is summarised in the report which follows and the L.C.C. Divisional Medical Officer, Dr. G.O. Mitchell, has again kindly supplied me with some particulars of the personal health cervices which are, of course, the responsibility of the London bounty Council. I am pleased to have this opportunity to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their support and encouragement during the year. I am also grateful to my colleagues in other departments for -6- their willing assistance and my particular thanks are due to my own staff for their loyal assistance and support at all times. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, S.A. BOYD, Medical Officer of Health SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population, estimated mid-year 49,830 Number of Dwellings 15,301 Rateable Value £649,852 General Rate 20s. 4d. Sum represented by a penny rate £2,525 VITAL STATISTICS Total Males Females Live Births: Legitimate. 422 385 807 Illegitimate 37 25 62 Live Birth rate per 1,000 Population 17.4 Stillbirths: Legitimate. 10 7 17 Illegitimate 1 - 1 Stillbirths rate per 1,000 live and Stillbirths 0.36 Total live and stillbirths 17.8 Infant Deaths: Legitimate 8 6 14 Illegitimate 2 - 2 Infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births: a ii Total 18.4 Legitimate 17.3 Illegitimate 32.2 Neo Natal mortality rate 1,000 live births (First Four Weeks) 11.5 Illegitimate live birth per cent of total live births 7.1 Maternal Mortality: There were no deaths associated with Pregnancy or childbirth. Death Rate per 1,000 estimated population 11.4 During 1958 the Registrar General estimated the population as 49,830, which is 1,110 less than in the previous year. The death rate was 11.4 per 1,000 persons as compared with a rate of 11.3 for 1957. Both births and deaths depend to some extent on the proportions of young and old people and of males and females in the area, and in order to make comparisons between one area and another the Registrar General gives Area Comparability Factors which take into account these variations in age and sex. Using this factor the adjusted death rate for Bethnal Green would be 11.4 as compared with 11.7 for England and Wales. The birth rate during 1958 was 17.4 as compared with 15.7 during the previous year. The adjusted rate for comparison with other areas is 16.2 as compared with 16.4 for England and Wales. The Infant mortality rate was 18.4 as compared with the rate of 22.6 for England and Wales. It is, in Bethnal Green, however, calculated on a very small number of infant deaths and is consequently subject to large variations from year to year and as an indication of child care the figure should be used with some caution. The causes of death are shown In Table 1, which follows. Notification of Births Arrangements continued in operation during the year whereby the London County Council furnished to the Borough Council a weekly return of births (including stillbirths) notified to them as the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. During the year 889 live births (467 male and 422 female) were notified and in addition there were 18 stillbirths (12 male and 6 female). These figures represent corrected totals after the addition of inward transfers and the deduction of outward transfers and the difference between these figures and those set out previously is due to the fact that births must be registered within 6 weeks and it is not uncommon for a child to be born and notified in one calendar year but not actually registered until the following year.

Laundry Service for Incontlnent Persons. During the year, the Council approved the provision of a laundry service for incontinent persons in accordance with the provisions of Section 122 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936.

The arrangement is working satisfactorily and the service fills a most needed want. The laundry of two persons was dealt with during the year under review. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 During the year. 327 complaints of infestation by rats or mice were received and in most cases smoke tests of the drainage of the premises affected were carried out by the rodent operatives under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors.

National Assistance Act, 1948 Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951. provision is made whereby a court of summary Jurisdiction may make an order for the removal of ill, infirm or incapacitated persons who are not receiving proper care and attention. Whilst this provision is necessary in order to deal with unusual and very difficult cases it is one which should be resorted to only when all else has failed. -21- During the year under review It was found necessary In two following cases to use the powers of the Act:- 1. Miss L.S., aged 78 years, was found to be Infirm and physically incapacitated and living in insanitary conditions. She was in need or' urgent hospital treatment and was unable to devote to herself, and was not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. She refused to enter a hospital voluntarily and, in her own interests, there was no alternative but to apply for a removal order, which was granted by the Magistrate. 2. Mr. E.H., aged about 75 years, was found to be infirm and living in insanitary conditions. He was unable to devote to himself, and was not receiving from other persons, proper care and attention. He refused to enter a suitable institution and, in his own interests, there was no alternative but to apply for a removal order, which was granted by the Magistrate. Mr. H., settled down very happily in the Home to which he was admitted and expressed no desire to leave. During the year, 28 other cases were brought to the notice of the Department where aged persons were in need of attention. It was possible in a number of these to provide necessary care for these old people in their own homes and the Home Help service provided by the London County Council was again helpful in this connection. In other cases where it was not possible to make satisfactory provision in their own homes the old people were persuaded to enter a hospital or an Institution. The Old People's Welfare Committee, comprising representatives of the Council and the various local organisations and social settlements, continued to provide all possible assistance to old people in the Borough by the provision of clubs, home visitation, meals-on-wheels service, chiropody service, holidays and outings, etc. Offensive Trades There are three premises in the Borough registered for the purpose of carrying on offensive trades. One being the business of fur skin dresser and two poultry slaughterhouses. Twentytwo visits of inspection were made to these premises* -22- The use of the animal slaughterhouse that had been licensed for many years was discontinued during the year, Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act,1951 This Act provides for the licensing by the local authority of all premises used for the manufacture and/or storage of filling materials to which the Act applies, and for the registration of certain premises where such materials are used in upholstering, stuffing or lining of bedding, toys, baby carriages, etc, There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock or other filling materials are manufactured but 44 premises are registered for the use of such materials in the trades conducted therein. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The operation of this Act is probably of more importance in Bethnal Green than in any other London Borough on account of the Sunday morning dog market which has been held in Bethnal Green for many years and which serves both vendors and purchasers throughout the whole of the County of London and even beyond„ During the year 15 licences were granted in respect of shops and 51 licenses in respect of stalls. Eleven warning letters were sent in connection with various infringements of the Act. Clean Air Act, 1956. During the year, the Council forwarded proposals to the Ministry of Housing and Local Government for approval to the making of an order declaring 136 acres of the Borough as a Smoke Control Area. The Ministry has since given provisional clearance to these proposals. A large slum clearance area, comprising 373 privately owned dwellinghouses, comes within the proposed smoke control area and in view of the fact that its clearance is not likely to be completed until 1960, the suggested date for the coming into operation of the Smoke Control Order is Ist September, 1960. 23 The following is a summary of the types of properties that come within the 136 acres:- (i) Dwellinghouses - privately owned 447 owned by the Crown 30 Borough Council 17 L.C.C. 5 499 (ii) Borough Council flats 636 (iii) L.C.C. flats 266 (iv) L.C.C. pre-fabs 24 (v) Factories and Industrial Premises 38 (vi) Shops and other business premises 103 (vii) Non-business premises Hospital 1 Nurses' Home 1 Schools 5 Church 1 Church Halls 2 Meeting Halls 1 Vicarages 2 Manse 1 14 Atmospheric Pollution A station for the monthly measurement of deposited matter and of sulphur dioxide is installed on the roof of a building at one of the Council's Depots. The apparatus used is in two parts, one instrument being a deposit gauge for the measurement of ash and grit, etc., in the atmosphere and the other a lead peroxide instrument by which the amount of sulphur dioxide is measured. In addition, a second station for recording the daily measurement of pollution by sulphur dioxide and of smoke is installed at the Town Hall. The results obtained from the instruments at the two stations are communicated to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. Hairdressers and Barbers Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954, requires the registration of premises and the persons carrying -24- on the business of hairdressers or barbers thereat.

The first week of the survey was spent by the Unit in visits to four of the largest housing estates in the Borough. The response to these visits was most disappointing, only 588 persons attending for examination. For the other two weeks the Unit was based at the Town Hall where sessions were held for the general public and for organised groups from factories, offices, etc., when 2,242 persons attended. The total of these figures, 2,830, compares with 2,716 persons who were X-rayed when the Unit visited Bethnal Green during 1955.

It is only exceptionally that it is necessary to require a contact or carrier of infectious disease to stay away from work and during the year under review no certificates were issued. It was however necessary on one occasion to exclude a food handler from her place of work whilst she was a contact of a case of infectious disease. This woman, who was not entitled to Nationa Health sickness benefit, applied to the Council for payment of loss of earnings and the consent of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government, in accordance with Section 228 (1) of the Local Government Act, 1933, was obtained to the payment of an agreed amount. -44- SECTION F MISCELLANEOUS Burial of the Dead In accordance with Section 50 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, the Council is responsible for the burial or cremation of the body of any person who had died or been found dead within the BOrough, and where no private arrangements are being made for the disposal of the body.

Mortuary The arrangement between the boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch, Stoke Newington and Bethnal Green whereby the Hackney Mortuary is the main mortuary for use by the four boroughs with the Bethnal Green Mortuary being maintained as a reserve for use in emergencies is working satisfactorily. Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933 The provisions of the Act and the Poisons Rules relating to the sale of poisons specified in Part II of the Poisons List were administered during the year. During 1958, the names of 43 persons were retained on, and five persons added to the Council's list of Persons entitled to sell Part II Poisons. All applications are investigated to ensure compliance with ths Act and Poisons Rules.

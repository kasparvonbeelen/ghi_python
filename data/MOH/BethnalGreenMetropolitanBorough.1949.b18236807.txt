Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the Annual Report for the year 1949. Dr. C. Porter continued to hold the appointment of Acting Medical Officer of Health until I commenced duty in June, 1949. General Standard of Health. The general standard of health in the Borough during the year may be regarded as satisfactory. The total number of notifications of compulsorily notifiable disease received during 1949 was 974 as compared with 1,475 in 1948. The number of cases of Acute Poliomyelitis (8) did, however, show an increase as compared with the number (1) for the previous year. No deaths from this disease occurred during the year. Vital Statistics. The Birth Rate for the Borough was 17.5 per 1,000 population as compared with 18.9 for the year 1948. The recorded death rate per 1,000 population was 12.6, the standardised rate 13.7 and that for the country as a whole 11.7. The recorded rate for the Borough is slightly higher than for 1948 (10.9), the increase being attributed mainly to the increased number of deaths from cancer and respiratory diseases. Housing. During the year a slum clearance survey of the whole Borough was carried out by the Public Health Department, details of which have been forwarded to the London County Council with a view to co-ordinated action being taken in relation to the areas revealed in the survey. Food Hygiene. Every effort has been made by officers of the Public Health Department to raise the general standard of cleanliness and personal hygiene in relation to the handling and distribution of food in the Borough. A letter was addressed to the food traders asking for co-operation in this matter which was followed by visits of the inspectorial staff when advice on any particular problem was given to the trader concerned. 6 I should like to express my appreciation to members of the Public Health Committee for the consideration given in all matters affecting the public health of the Borough, to my brother officials for their co-operation and to the entire staff of the Public Health Department for their assistance. I have the honour to be, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. T. Donovan, Medical Officer of Health. July, 1950. 7 SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population, estimated mid-year 59,170 Number of inhabited houses (at 31st December, 1949) 15,229 Rateable Value £434,997 General Rate 17s. 4d.

These figures represent corrected totals after the addition of inward transfers and the deletion of outward transfers. 15 SECTION C SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE AREA (1) Water Supply. The water supply of the Borough is provided by the Metropolitan Water Board and has been satisfactory as regards quality and quantity. Bacteriological examinations and chemical analyses are carried out at frequent intervals by the Metropolitan Water Board. The water is not known to have any plumbo-solvent action. No complaint of contamination was received during the year. In 161 cases notice was sent to the Metropolitan Water Board of observed wastage of water. There are 7 wells in the Borough, two of which have not been in use for some years. The position as regards the remaining five wells is as follows:— Attached to Council's Public Baths 2 Attached to a local hospital 1 Supplementary supply for industrial purposes 2 Under the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, certificates of satisfactory water supply were issued in respect of 292 new dwellings. (2) Drains and Sewers. During the year a total of 3,727 inspections were carried out in connection with drainage works. No legal proceedings were found necessary or were taken in respect of infringements of Drainage By-laws. (3) Sanitary Inspection of Area. During 1949, a total of 32,615 visits were paid by Sanitary Inspectors, a summary of which will be found in Table 4. Details of sanitary defects discovered as a result of these visits will be found in the accompanying Table 5. 16 TABLE 4 Record of Visits Notifiable Infectious Diseases 450 Non-notifiable diseases 82 Complaints as to insanitary conditions 4,220 Food Poisoning 13 Aged and Infirm persons 85 Factories 1,390 Milkshops 548 Other Food premises 1,255 Outworkers' houses 225 Tenement houses 106 Common Lodging Houses 4 Drainage work 3,727 Smoke observations 1 Enquiries with regard to housing 1,090 Other inspections and special work 4,504 Slum Clearance Survey 875 Re-inspections 14,040 Total 32,615 TABLE 5 Sanitary Defects in Connection with which Notices were Served Dirty rooms 7,593 Defective drains and chocked W.Cs. 623 Defective and dirty W.Cs. 1,271 Defective water supply 214 Defective paving 157 Defective gutters and rain water pipes 713 Defective roofs 1,806 Dampness 1,612 Defective dustbins 172 Other defects 5,833 Total 19,994 (4) Legal Proceedings. On 51 occasions during the year it was necessary to take legal proceedings to enforce compliance with the requirements of Notices served. In 11 of these cases Nuisance Orders were made by the Magistrate with the infliction of fines and costs amounting to £43 14s. 0d. 17 Closing Orders were made by the Magistrate in 6 cases and Costs amounting to £16 16s. 0d. were awarded to the Council. In 33 cases the summonses were withdrawn owing to the nuisances being abated prior to the date of hearing, the defendants paying costs varying from £1 11s. 6d. to £2 5s. 0d. The proceedings in one case were adjourned sine die. (5) Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Act. During the year 44 certificates of disrepair were issued to tenants and 7 certificates of fitness were subsequently issued to property owners. (6) Swimming Baths. During the year one sample of water was collected from the Council's Swimming Bath and submitted for chemical and bacteriological examination. The sample was reported to be satisfactory and the water safe for bathing purposes. (7) Factories, Workshops and Workplaces. During the year a total of 2,391 inspections were made to factories and workplaces in the Borough, the number of which exceeds 1,500. Efforts have been made to improve conditions in a number of factories which as a result of the war had fallen below the standards required under the Factories Acts. The Inspector has paid special attention to the Defence Regulations with a view to preventing the conversion of dwellinghouses and flats for factory purposes. A number of complaints with regard to noise and smoke attributable to the increasing introduction of power machinery have been made. The solution of this problem would appear to be the separation of factories and houses, a difficult matter in a densely congested Borough. In a number of factories in the Borough canteens have been introduced and these have been periodically inspected and advice given where necessary with regard to matters of hygiene. 18 In addition to the ordinary routine inspections, the Inspector has made a considerable number of visits in regard to drainage and applications under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947. The following Tables give details of work carried out under the Factories Act. 1937:— TABLE 6 Inspections for the Purpose of Provisions as to Health {including inspections made by Sanitary Inspectors) Premises Number on Register Number of Inspections Written notices Occupiers prosecuted 1.

(9) Disinfection and Disinfestation. In 7 cases the furniture belonging to persons in the course of transfer to Borough Council flats was disinfested by means of hydrocyanic acid gas, by arrangement with contractors, the bedding of such persons being treated by steam disinfection at the Council's Disinfecting Station. In addition, the following routine work was carried out by the Council's Disinfecting staff :— No. of rooms disinfested 998 Articles of clothing, bedding, etc., submitted to steam disinfection 2,425 Articles disinfected by formalin 122 Hospital mattresses, pillows, etc., disinfected 7,375 No. of articles destroyed by request 253 All bombed sites, static water tanks and stables in the Borough were sprayed with insecticide. (10) Personal Cleansing Station. During the year 52 adults and 6 children had baths, simultaneous disinfection of clothing being carried out. In addition 23 adults and 5 children received treatment for Scabies at the Station. (11) Rats and Mice. 193 complaints were received during the year, all of which were investigated. Systematic baiting and poisoning was carried out by the Council's Rodent Operatives in respect of 353 premises with satisfactory results. In addition a considerable number of smoke tests of the drainage of the premises was carried out. On two occasions during 1949 all the sewers in the Borough were baited involving a total of 1,352 manholes. Positive results were obtained in 669 instances, it being estimated that at least 2,000 rats were poisoned. 21 (12) Mortuary. The Council's Mortuary at St. Matthew's Row continued to serve both the Shoreditch and Bethnal Green Boroughs. During the year 270 bodies were received there and 249 post mortem examinations were made. (13) Burial of the Dead. During 1949 the Department continued to carry out its obligations under the National Assistance Act, 1948, Section 50, and arranged for the burial of those cases in which liability rested with the Council. It was necessary to carry out this duty on 14 occasions during the year. 22 SECTION D HOUSING Slum Clearance. The Public Health Department was confronted in the immediate post-war period with the following urgent matters—the accumulated disrepair of properties, the outstanding war damage repairs and the investigation of a considerable number of applications for housing accommodation. The difficulties associated with these matters were accentuated by shortage of staff, of materials and labour and the necessity of obtaining licences for building work. Nevertheless sufficient progress had been made in these matters to enable the Department's officers to give attention to a housing survey in relation to slum clearance. During the year consultations were held between officers of the London County Council and of this Authority as a result of which a survey was carried out by the Borough Housing Inspector. The details of the survey have been forwarded to the London County Council with a view to securing concerted action in relation to slum clearance sites in the Borough. The survey revealed the following information :— No. of areas suitable to be dealt with as Clearance Areas Properties involved Persons likely to be displaced 15 1,984 6,983 In addition to the above there are two large redevelopment areas which are being dealt with by the London County Council. Closing Orders (Public Health (London) Act, 1936).

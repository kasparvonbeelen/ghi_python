Report Of the Proceedings of the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, from the 25th March, 1872, to the 25th March, 1873. NEW APPROACH FROM SHOREDITCH. The Bill for effecting this and other improvements in the Metropolis, mentioned in the last Report, was strongly objected to by some Vestries and District Boards of Works. The Vestry of Islington appeared by counsel to oppose the Bill; but their locus standi was objected to on the ground that the Metropolitan Board of Works represented the entire Metropolis. After argument, the Committee of the House of Commons, to which the Bill was referred, decided that Vestries and District Boards had no right to appear. The question of their right to appear was also raised before the Committee of the House of Lords, but that Committee decided in the same way as the Committee of the House of Commons. The Vestry, by their Officers, got up statistics and evidence in support of the Bill, and to meet the expected opposition; but in consequence of the decisions of the Committees, the Bill, so far as related to the Improved Approach from Shoreditch, and the Widening of High Street, Shoreditch, was practically unopposed, and ultimately, with some modifications, was passed. The Metropolitan Board of Works is proceeding to acquire the necessary property for the Improvement in this Parish. TRAMWAYS. The North Metropolitan Tramways Company applied for permission to lower the road under and approaching to the Great Eastern Railway 14 Bridge in Grove Road; but the Vestry considered that to increase the dip in the road already existing would be extremely objectionable, and refused the permission, so far as the part of the road in this Parish is concerned. Subsequently, a Committee of the Officers of the Vestry met, at the bridge, a Committee and the Officers of the Mile End Vestry, to view the part of the road proposed to be altered; but the Committee of the Vestry of Bethnal Green recommended the Vestry to adhere to its former resolution, and that recommendation was adopted. The tramway in Grove Road is completed, and so much of the carriageway of the road as the Company were bound to pave has been paved. A question arose as to the stone to be used. The Company wished, for the purpose of saving expense, to use smaller stone than that used by the Vestry. As the burden of repairing the paving is on the Company, the Vestry consented to the Company using stone of the same kind as they had been permitted to use in the adjoining Parishes and Districts. At the date of this Report, the tramways are being laid in Hackney Road. Previously to the work being begun, the amount to be paid by the Company in respect of the paving in the road, pursuant to the agreement referred to in the last Report, was fixed at £3,320. Of that sum £500 has been paid, and the remainder will be paid by instalments as the work proceeds. The entire sum will be applied, as hereinafter mentioned, in part payment of the cost of paving the eastern part of the carriageway of Bethnal Green Road. RAILWAY TO COLUMBIA MARKET. A memorial was presented by the Vestry to the Corporation of the City of London requesting the Corporation to make the proposed communication, by rail, from the Market to the Great Eastern Railway. The Corporation introduced into Parliament "The Columbia Market Approaches and Tramways Bill," by which it was proposed to give powers to use, on the trams or rails to be laid in the streets, locomotives propelled by steam. Desirous as the Vestry was of facilitating the progress of the Bill, they, after frequent considerations, have determined to oppose the clause authorizing the use of steam locomotives in the streets, and have instructed the Clerk accordingly. 16 PASSAGE ROUND NORTH TERRACE. In November, Mrs. Natt, who claims to be the owner of the property on both sides of the passage, gave a notice, under the "Highway Act," calling on the Vestry to consider her wish that the passage should be entirely stopped up as unnecessary. At a meeting, on the 5th December, specially convened to consider the notice, a resolution was passed stating that, in the opinion of the Vestry, the passage was unnecessary, and should be entirely stopped up, and directing the Clerk to apply to two Justices to view and certify, in pursuance of the Act, and to take the other proceedings directed by the Act. The two Justices who viewed the highway being of opinion that it was unnecessary and should be entirely stopped up, directed the requisite notices to be given, which has been done, and it remains for the Justices in due course to certify their opinion, and that proof has been given to them of the due publication of the notices. Memorials, expressing strong objections to stopping up the passage, have been presented to the Vestry, and motions to rescind the resolution of the 5th December have been made, but none of them have passed, as the requisite statutory majority was not obtained. CARRIAGEWAY PAYING.—BETHNAL GREEN ROAD. The subject of paving with cubes the unpaved part of the carriageway of Bethnal Green Road was again brought under consideration, and as it was felt desirable to get the paving done, if possible, the subject was referred to the Works Committee, by whom there was submitted, to a Committee of the whole Vestry, a Statement, as follows Your Committee haTe had under their consideration the subject referred to them of paving the unpaved carriageway of Bethnal Green Road, and report thereon, as follows:— The road now requires repair, and, if it be not paved, must have expended on it, for macadamizing, not less than £300. The cost of paving would be £9,000, and as your Committee anticipate that the Vestry would feel it undesirable at present to raise any further sum by loan, they have considered how the work can be done without borrowing. The following are the means available towards defraying the costs :— 16 Amount to be paid by Tramway Company in respect of Hackney £3,000 0 0 Amount to be paid by Railway Company in respect of paving in 300 0 0 Amount of Special Paving Fund unexpended, exclusive of interest (from June, 1871), to be allowed by General Rate Account, for Loan, to that Account of £1,500 1,745 8 4 £5,045 8 4 This would leave a balance of £3,954 l1s. 8d. to be found, and it is proposed to raise that by equal quarterly instalments, extending over three years, from the beginning of the work. The annual cost of repairing the road is about £500, and the value of the metal and material on it, which would belong to the Vestry, is about £100. The cessation of the annual cost, and the metal and material being available for other roads, would diminish so far the burden of raising the proposed quarterly instalment. The Contractor, who executed the works in Hackney Road and Green Street, has been seen by the Committee, and he is willing to execute the work at the rate paid to him for the paving in Hackney Road and Green Street, which would amount to the sum of £9,000, and to accept payment of the first instalments out of the money to be received from the Tramway Company; to accept payment of the balance by quarterly instalments, extending over the three years; to undertake to keep the work in repair for three years, and to maintain the road in good condition until the paving is begun, and he is prepared to begin immediately a contract has been entered into. It will be remembered that when Hackney Road and Green Street were paved, the metal taken off those roads was used on other streets, and the value of that metal is taken to be about £2000. That sum is therefore due from the General Rate Account to the Special Fund for Paving Carriageways, and if the proposed plan be adopted, that liability, including any interest which would be allowed on it, will be discharged. The Vestry determined upon the Report of the Committee of the whole Vestry to do the Work, and it was referred to the Works Committee to arrange with the Contractor to carry out the work on the terms proposed. A. contract was accordingly prepared and executed, and at the date of this Report the work is in progress. NEW STREETS. Orders have been made for paving and constructing sewers in the new streets, known as Burgoyne Road, Conyers Street, Lawfranc Road, They- 17 don Road, and Gernon Road. The cost of the paving, and two-thirds of the cost of the sewers, are to he paid by the owners of the properties abutting on the several new streets, and such cost has been apportioned on the respective owners, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Parliament. "ADULTERATION OF FOOD ACT, 1872." The subject of appointing an Analyst under this Act was referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry. In November, Messrs. Francis, Jacobs, Edwards, and Pringle, were appointed a deputation to attend, with the Clerk, a meeting at the offices of the Whitechapel Board of "Works of "Contiguous Local Authorities." The resolutions passed at that meeting were submitted to the Vestry, and at a meeting, held on 12th December, Dr. Sarvis, the Medical Officer of Health, was appointed, for six months from that day, Analyst under the Act; and it was determined his salary should be fixed at the expiration of that time. At the same meeting it was also resolved to refer to a Committee of the whole Vestry the question of appointing Inspectors under the Act. The appointment of Dr. Sarvis has been reported to the Local Government Board, and a letter has been received from that Board asking for evidence that Dr. Sarvis possesses the requisite knowledge of chemistry and microscopy, which letter was submitted to the Vestry at its last meeting, and was referred to the Sanitary Committee. MEMBER OF THE METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. In June, Mr. Beven was unanimously re-elected the Member for this Parish of the Metropolitan Board of Works. OFFICERS. Mr. James Long, originally Surveyor of Highways, and afterwards Surveyor's Assistant, died in June. It has not been found necessary to fill up the vacancy occasioned by his death. Application was made by the Sanitary Inspectors of the three divisions for an increase of their salaries; and, after investigation and consideration 18 by a Committee of the whole Vestry, the salaries of Mr. "William W. Burrows and Mr. Lapworth were raised to £100 per annum each, and that of Mr. John W. Burrows to £40 per annum; and the Inspectors were required to attend to the removal of dust, and to give especial attention to that duty. GAS. The Imperial Gas Company, in December, gave notice to determine on the 30th June next, the existing contract for supply to the public lamps. That notice was expressed to be given as a matter of necessary precaution, and not as a result of any actual resolution on the part of the Company to raise the price ; but the Company pointed out that under any circumstances it might be a question whether the Company ought " to continue "to supply the public lamps at the rate of 6d. per 1000 (or thereabouts) "less than is charged to the private consumer, to the manifest prejudice "of the latter." The notice of the Company has been referred to the Works Committee for consideration. A conference was held in February at the Vestry Hall of St. Martin'sin-the-Fields, on the supply of gas, and Messrs. Jacobs and Meadway were appointed delegates to represent the Vestry at the conference. At the meeting a committee was appointed to draw up a report as to the best course to be pursued. FOURNIER'S CHARITY. Of the applicants, 34 were found on examination eligible as Candidates, out of whom the following were elected and received the gift:— Alderton, William, 5, Garnet Place.

Of the recipients last year, six were dead or disqualified. The remaining thirty-four recipients were re-elected. The "Widows of William Thompson and Thomas Dradge, two of the recipients who had died during the year, were elected in the places of their deceased husbands, and the number of forty recipients was made up by the election of— Michael Ferry, 53, Sewardstone Road "West. Amelia Green, 248, Cambridge Road. Richard Hatta, 16, Cooper's Gardens. Napoleon Payne, 1, Collins Place. WATER SUPPLY. The Vestry, being of opinion that the regulations made by the Board of Trade, under the "Metropolis Water Act, 1871," are unnecessarily stringent, arbitrary, and expensive, and practically inapplicable to the class of houses for which a constant supply is most required, have, in common with other Local Authorities, asked the Metropolitan Board of Works to press upon the Government the necessity of new legislation. MISCELLANEOUS. In April, a petition of ratepayers against the conversion of the old Watch-house in the Churchyard into a Mortuary, was presented to the Vestry, and the subject of providing a Mortuary still remains in abeyance. A memorial to the Vestry was presented by the owners of houses in Morpeth Road, asking the Vestry to get that road made an open continuous thoroughfare at the western end. Application was made by the Vestry to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, who, in reply, stated it was open to anyone interested in Morpeth Road to arrange with Mr. Borton, the Crown lessee of the land through which it was desired to continue the thoroughfare. In July, the Rev. George H. Waldron resigned the Afternoon Lectureship, and, on the 3rd October, the Rev. W. Stainer was elected to the vacant office. 20 The subject of making arrangements for bathing in "Victoria Park in the evening has been brought under consideration several times, but a motion made to appoint a deputation to the Chief Commissioner, to press on him the advisability of providing for evening bathing, was lost. Several applications have been made to the Vestry with respect to the proposed extension of the Roman Road to Stratford; but the Vestry did not find it was possible to give any assistance, and the Metropolitan Board of Works, after a Report by their engineer, Mr. Bazalgette, came to the conclusion that the work could not be regarded as a metropolitan improvement, or as meeting any local want of importance. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk. SURVEYOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED, PROM LADY-DAY, 1872, TO LADY-DAY, 1873. Gentlemen, I do not consider it necessary to recapitulate remarks which have appeared in my previous Annual Reports. The importance of the works performed, and the reason for the performance of such works, are now so fully understood and appreciated, that a bare description of the works performed is all that I now deem necessary. The most important works have been carried out at the expense of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company in Grove Road, Cambridge Road, and Hackney Road. In Grove Road the whole macadamized surface of the carriageway has been broken up, between the boundary at the Railway Arch and the junction of Grove Road with the Old Ford Road, a length of 773 yards ; 5539 yards super of new carriageway paving has been laid on the above. In Cambridge Road, between the junction of Whitechapel Road and the boundary near the Canal Bridge, the macadamized surface, to the extent of 9025 yards super, has been broken up and paved with new carriageway stone. A portion of this length is incomplete, viz., the narrow part in Patriot Row and the south end to connect with Whitechapel Road. In Hackney Road, which was paved by the Vestry nearly five years ago, it is intended to lay down a tramway, which will involve the removal and relaying of the carriageway paving between the junction of Hackney Road with Cambridge Road, and an agreed transverse boundary line at "Weymouth Terrace, This work is now progressing. 22 A contract having been entered into for paving the carriageway of Bethnal Green Road, between White Street and the junction of Bethnal Green Road with Cambridge Road, the work is now progressing. A clause was inserted in the Great Eastern Railway Company's Act of 1870, binding the Company to pave under all newly formed arches and bridges belonging to them. A portion of this work has been carried out, and arrangements made with the contractor for its completion. An arrangement has also been made for payment, by the Great Eastern Railway Company, of the sum of £264 to the Vestry for old carriageway paving left in St. John Street. The following is a list of streets where paving works have been performed during the past year by men employed by the Vestry. NAME OF STREET OR PLACE. Carriageway relaid. Footway relaid.

SANITARY STATISTICS and PROCEEDINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1873. THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, by J. S. Forsaith & Sons, 329, Bethnal Green Road. 1873. Report September, 1873. Gentlemen, It is with great satisfaction that I lay before you the Seventeenth Annual Report, compiled for this District. The Vital Statistics and Sanitary Proceedings are of the most gratifying character, for you will find our birth rate far higher, and our death rate far lower, than it has been for many years. As to our birth rate, if it continues in the same ratio as last year, the population will be so great that there will not be houses enough in the Parish to hold them. The work done by the Sanitary Staff greatly exceeds that of former years, and one duty, of an important nature, has taken up very much time. I refer to the Water Supply, which has been a source of great trouble during the last few months; but this matter will be treated with further on. The total number of registered births daring the year was 5187, while the total number of registered deaths was 2588 ; excess of births, 2599, or there were more than double the number made their advent into this Parish than passed away out of it "to that borne from whence no traveller returns." The deaths from Zymotic diseases were fewer than in any year since I have been your Medical Officer of Health. The word Zymotic is not generally understood, so I will here give a definition of the term, extracted from " Aitken's Practice of Medicine," vol. I., pages 196, 199. " The name Zymotic (first suggested by Dr. William Farr to designate the class) is not to be understood as implying the hypothesis that these diseases are fermentations, which the derivation of the term would lead one to believe. It has become extensively used of late as applied to the diseases whose characters as a class are already indicated, and for whioh some convenient term is applied. The class, then, to which the term Zymotic has been applied is intended to comprehend all the principal diseases which have prevailed as epidemics or endemics—all those which are due to paludal or animal malaria; and those due to specific disease poisons, capable of propagation from one human being to another, and communicable either by direct contract, or indirectly through various channels of human intercourse, contaminating drinking water or infecting the air, or by animals in a state of disease. The class also comprehends the diseases that result from the scarcity and the deterioration of the necessary kinds of food, or from the generation, propagation, or existence of parasitic animals. The diseases of this class are 4 thus conveniently arranged into four orders or groups, of which specific fevers, syphilis, scurvy, worms, are the common names typical of diseases in the respective groups. " In the greater number of the diseases of this class the blood is more or less changed, and by some is presumed to be the primary seat of diseases which result from specific poisons, of organic origin, either derived from without or generated within the body. These specific poisons tend to produce in the blood an excess of those decomposing organic compounds which physiology teaches us are always present in the circulating current. " That the habitual ingestion of decomposing matter in the water used as drink is capable of inducing conditions favourable to the development of Zymotic diseases, admits of no doubt. Cogent instances of this are to be found recorded in the bitter experience of epidemics of cholera." The deaths from this class of diseases were registered as follows:— 1872. 1873. Small Pox 269 41 Measles 82 43 Scarlet Fever 41 17 Diphtheria 2 6 Whooping Cough 118 147 Fever 63 44 Diarrhœa 159 143 Cholera 11 12 745 443 Decrease 302 It will be seen that there was a decrease in the number of deaths in all the Zymotics, with the exception of Whooping Cough, which rose from 118 to 147, and the small increase in Diphtheria, which rose from 2 to 6. Happily the Small Pox, that lately was so rife amongst us and greatly added to our mortality, and to which 269 deaths were attributable the the preceeding year, fell during the past to 41. There is no doubt that the carrying out of the Vaccination Act energetically by the Vaccination Officer, Mr. Winter, has greatly conduced to lessen the number of Small Pox cases. The Registrars forward to the Vaccination Officer a statement of the names and addresses of all children born, and if the Certificate of Vaccination is not sent in within the three months prescribed by law, then notice is served by him upon the parents, and if this in due course is not complied with, a summons is issued. The following is a table shewing the number of children born, those that were successfully vaccinated, together with those that were in- 5 susceptible, had small pox in infancy, died unvaccinated, postponed by medical certificate, removed to other districts of which the Vaccination Officer has been informed, removed, not known at address given, empty houses, &c , in default, and to whom final notice has been given prior to proceedings being taken.

Fever fell nearly one-third, or from 63 to 44. This I believe to be in consequence of the facility we have of sending the poorer class of patients to the Hospital at Homerton, directly they are attacked, thus releasing them from close and budly-ventilated rooms, and placing them in large, clean, and well-ventilated wards,with skilled medical aid, attentive nurses, good food, and every appliance needed. Yet with the knowledge that all these advantages can bo readily obtained, there are numbers of persons who prefer staying in their own homes, where the friends, even under the direction of the most clever medical attendant, and however good their intentions may be, have not the knowledge or skill required to nurse efficiently and prepare properly the scant food they can obtain, thus rendering the probability of recovery less likely, while it increases the tendency to the spread of the disease under the most careful and skilled sanitation. Diarrhœa fell from 159 to 143. The cases registered as Cholera wore 6 11 and 12 respectively in each year. I must here protest against the use of the words Cholera and Choleraic-Diarrhoea, except it be to signify that the disease is of the Asiatic type, for at all times such certificates tend to create alarm in the public mind, and in my opinion it is unwise to do so, it is a pity that medical men should certify that the case is one of Asiatic Cholera when it is Diarrhoea. This disease is in itself bad enough, and is the cause of grea': mortality; but it should not be magnified into that fearful disease, Asiatic Cholera, which seven years since carried off from this Parish no less than 612 persons. The cases that were registered during the year as having been caused by Cholera were as follows:— Date and Address. Sex. Age. Occupation. Disease. July 14, 1872. 1, Teal Cottages, Teal Street. F 7 weeks Daughter of a Labourer. No breast milk— Cholera—4 days. July 23. 7, Park Place F 26 years Wife of Law Stationer. Cholera after childbirth—2 days. July 25. 36, Nelson Street M 9 months Son of a Dealer in Maty Dust. Cholera. July 27. 1, Godfrey's Place F 9 months Daughter of a Cabinet Carver. Choleraic Diarrhoea —5 days. July 29. 2, Durham Street . F 12 months Daughter of a French Polisher. Choleraic Diarrhoea. July 29. 4, Fleet Street F 6 months Daughter of a Tailor. Choleraic Diarrhœa —3 weeks. July 30. 6, Bedford Terrace M 5 months Son of a Baker. Cholera infantum. July 30. 149, Cambridge Road. F 9 weeks Daughter of a Cheesemonger. Cholera infantum. July 31. 14, Hope Street F 10 months Daughter of a Bricklayer. Cholera infantum— 10 days. August 8. 13, Carter Street F 31 years Wife of Toy Maker. Parturition—Choleraic Diarrhoea. August 11. Auckland Road M 2 years Son of a Carver and Gilder. Choleraic Diarrhœa —Hœmatemesis— 7 days, 12 hours. September 16. 75, Green Street M 10 months Son of Rag Merchant Cholera infantum. 7 It will be seen that nearly all were children of tender age, the exception being two women who died shortly after child-birth. All these cases were found upon enquiry to be Diarrhoea of the ordinary type. POPULATION. The population of this District I estimate at 124,000. This is below rather than above the number, as there have been many houses built at the south-eastern portion of the Parish, and as they are inhabited as soon as finished, it shews how much they are needed. There is no doubt that some will be occupied by persons from other parishes, so we must allow somewhat for immigration. I hope the immigration will not be great, for we want all the house room we have, and could well do with more. Then comes the question of rent. This increases year after year, while the income of the artisan does not increase in the proportion to enable him to meet the demand made by the advanced prices in coals, meat, butter, &c.; and the fish supply is so small, and in consequence so dear, that little can find its way to his table. Now, finding this, the head of a family will look round and see where he can retrench, and feeling the pressure of the weekly or monthly payment of rent, he diminishes it; where a whole house has been kept, by letting off a portion; in other instances, where three rooms have been kept, reducing them to two, and from two to one : thus is perpetuated that great evil in this and all surrounding districts—overcrowding. BIRTHS. The rate of increase during the year has been 41.6 per 1000, while during the same period the average for the whole of London was 35.4 ; so that we had nearly six children per 1000 born in this Parish more than the average for the whole of London. DEATHS. The annual rate of mortality was 20.8 per 1000, or one person died of every 48 persons living, one death in 6.4 being from Zymotic disease. The average death rate for the whole of London during the same period was 21.4 per 1000, so that the mortality for this District was lower than 8 London taken as a whole. This is highly satisfactory, as it must alter the impression held by some that Bethnal Green is such a very unhealthy locality. In the preceding year, the death rate for Bethnal Green was 25 per 1000, or one person died of every 40 living, one death in every 7.9 being from Zymotic disease. The average of deaths for the whole of London during the same period was at the rate of 24.7 per 1000, or very slightly under that of this District. The average for the two years was—Bethnal Green, 22.9 per 1000 ; for the whole of London, 23 per 1000; so that we may fairly assert the healthiness of the Parish. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.

These comprise the following cases of Zymotic disease:—Small Pox, 118; Measles, 50; Scarlet Fever, 28; Diphtheria, 7 ; Whooping Cough, 95 ; Fever, 269 ; Diarrhoea, 189. The dispensary system is still being carried out in the District, and there are two Dispensaries. The one in Church Row remains as at my last report; the other has been removed from Morpeth Street to some premises built for the purpose adjoining the Workhouse. The system works well, and gives general satisfaction. 9 city of london hospital for diseases op the chest. The following is the Medical .Report for the Year 1872:— in-patients.

The " Metropolis Water Act of 1871 " has caused much inconvenience and trouble in this District. Shortly after it was declared that there would be a constant supply to various localities then water was cut off 10 from various houses, and, in some instances from whole streets or courts, the work required to be done was so much that it could not be performed for a long time. The consequence was that houses were left without water for, in some cases, weeks, and in others three or four months. This caused a great deal of work for the Sanitary Inspectors, especially Mr. W. W. Burrows, in whose District the greater number of houses were without water. Frequent complaints were made by occupiers, and the houses had to be visited. Communications and remonstrances were addressed to the Company. Now, the East London Company, by whom we are mainly supplied, are rather capricious, and they have power under the New Act to order certain fittings, and, in the event of their requisitions not being complied with, then they have the power to cut off the supply. In doing this, however, they must within twenty-four hours, give notice to the Sanitary Authorities that such house or houses are without water. The Act, under such circumstances, declares that such houses are unfit for human habitation, and therefore there is little difficulty, by taking proceedings, to get them closed. But this would be rather arbitrary, as the Company object to certain fittings in one case, and allow them in another, when the supply required is of the same nature. In some instances they allow Kilmarnoch's to be used; in others they object to this new kind of water waste preventor. It is of recent origin, very simple, and I believe it to be effective, and not likely to get out of order ; but the demand up to the present time has exceeded the supply. Other fittings are sometimes used, but are not in all cases to the satisfaction of the Company; if this is so, then the supply is cut off. The owners naturally object to change the fittings, after having, as he believes, fulfilled all the requirements of the Company ; and thus are the tenants left without water for weeks. It is true that they can obtain it possibly next door, or some few doors off; but this causes great trouble and inconvenience, and poor people, who have to work hard for their living, have not the time to fetch large quantities from any distance : hence ensues that want of cleanliness which engenders disease. The quantity of water supplied by the East London Water Company is said to be 160 gallons per day to each house, or at the rate of 25 gallons per day for each person. This would give as supplied to this Parish the large quantity of three million gallons per day. If this be so it must be very unequally used. 11 COW AND SLAUGHTER HOUSES. These have been frequently visited by the Sanitary Staff throughout the year, and have been found in good order. There were three new applications for licenses for cow houses, and two new applications for slaughter houses. The new application for cow houses was from John Greiser, Chisenhale Road, and one from Edward Jones, Hamilton Road : these two were granted. The third application was from John Jenkins, who sought for a license to the premises at 62, Totty Street. These premises are situated in the centre of a square of buildings, and the inhabitants, fearing a nuisance would arise, formed a deputation and waited upon the Sanitary Committee, to express their hope that the license would not be granted. Mr. Jenkins was communicated with, and was induced to desist from endeavouring to obtain the license. He then tried for premises situate in Robinson Road. The same proceedings were again gone through, with the like result. Of the two slaughter houses, one was from Alexander Clark, 348, Hackney Road, and the other from Job Mansfield, of Digby Street. No opposition was made ; consequently the licenses were granted. All the premises for which new licenses were sought were visited by the Sanitary Committee prior to any action being taken ; and any alterations or improvements required were ordered to be done. The following are the Licensed Cow Houses:— Name. Address. Bailey, John 46, Sommerford Street. Bailey, William 5, Suffolk Street. Boakes, William 12, Barnet Street.

Over 9000 houses have been inspected ; and, as some of them required to be visited several times before the owners would do the work, it entailed the necessity for 15,782 visits to be made; 348 workshops were also inspected, and 145 were cleansed; 3146 notices were served; and 90 14 summonses were issued and heard before the Magistrates at Worship Street Police Court. All Cow and Slaughter Houses were constantly kept under surveillance. All known cases of Small Pox have been attended to, disinfectants supplied, and the houses cleansed. Much of the Inspectors' time has been taken up in looking to the removal of dust for the work has been very badly done by the Contractors. This has given rise to much dissatisfaction, and the complaints have been numerous ; in fact, piles of letters have been laid before the Committee at each sitting. Remonstrance and fines seem of little use ; but I trust, in the future, a better state of things will exist. The water supply has given much trouble, and caused a great deal of work. The Returns of the Sanitary Inspectors give the following results:— Houses inspected 9164 Workshops inspected 348 Notices served 3146 Compulsory Notices served 417 Summonses issued 90 Number of Summonses heard 90 Number of Visits to ascertain the progress of Work required to be done under Notices served 15,782 Work Executed in compliance with Notices served. Houses cleansed and purified 1373 Workshops cleansed and purified 145 Houses closed as unfit for human habitation 2 Cases in which Defective Drainage has been remedied 1858 Cesspools abolished 34 Closets cleansed and purified 1975 Privy Accommodation provided — Urinals cleansed 33 Removals of accumulations of Dung and other Offensive Matter 372 Animals Removed in consequence of being a Nuisance, or kept in a condition injurious to public health 141 In conclusion, I again thank the Vestry and Committee for the kind co-operation and support afforded me in carrying out the various Sanitary improvements during the year. And remain, % Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, THOMAS SARYIS, M.D., 350, Bethnal Green Road. TABLE I.

SANITARY STATISTICS and PROCEEDINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1872. THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, by J. S. Forsaith & Sons, 329, Bethxal Green Road. 1872. 4 70 years old. How many of these were vaccinated the registers do not shew. Occasionally you have the entry, "Small Pox—certified" (vaccinated or unvaccinated, as the case may be); but this is the exception, not the rule. It is at all times difficult to obtain reliable information as to vaccination in private practice. I trust, however, that this will be obviated in the future, as the Yaccination Acts of 1860-71 are now in full operation, and are being vigorously carried out by the Vaccination Officer appointed by the Guardians of the Parish. In hospitals, statistics are more readily attainable, as will be seen from the following extracts from the Report of the Committee appointed on the 1st June, to collate and report upon the Returns obtained from the several Hospitals, with regard to the cases of Small Pox treated therein:— "It will be seen that 11,174 cases reported as vaccinated have been treated, of which 6169 were males, and 5005 females; that 3634 unvaccinated cases have been treated, of which 1884 were males, and 1750 females; and that the rate of mortality in vaccinated cases has been 10.15 per cent., and in unvaccinated cases 44.80; the percentage in both classes being higher in the male than in the female cases. "The mortality, which in unvaccinated cases was no less than 47.5 per cent., and in badly vaccinated cases 25 per cent., varied in well vaccinated cases from 5.3 in those shewing one good mark, to l.l in those shewing four or more good marks; and that of the total of 420 well vaccinated cases under 15 years of age, the death rate was only 0.47 per cent., giving a comparative immunity from fatal results." My experience shews me that, in this disease, there is more concealment than in any other; for in Cholera, the people become so frightened, that they will give early information, and hence the statistics of that disease are more exact and reliable. But here the parents or friends do not like to let it be known that this terrible scourge is amongst them ; and, in many cases, whole families have been attacked, and would not have any regular medical attendance, for fear some of them should be sent to the hospital; and, in many instances, it was not until a death took place, that the state of things became known. Tradesmen, if it existed in their houses, would seldom let it be known, for fear of losing their customers. Pew medical men sent in returns, lest they should offend 5 their patients by bringing them under Sanitary supervision—all this tending to the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, 1477 cases were brought under notice of the Sanitary staff during the year—all being duly attended to ; and we are mainly indebted for information of cases to the Sisters of Charity, Clergy, Medical Officers, District Visitors, and to house to house visitation by the Sanitary Inspectors. It is to be deplored that, notwithstanding all our efforts, this disease still remains amongst us, though in much less degree. The Sanitary Inspeetors continue to visit every known case, no matter what station of life the patient holds, or by whom attended. "We supply disinfectants, destroy bedding where necessary, serve notice on owners to have the houses thoroughly cleansed and disinfected after each case, and, in default, summon them before a magistrate, when fines are frequently inflicted. When the District Medical Officers are called upon to attend a person Buffering from the disease, the patient is removed without delay, if in a fit state, to the Small Pox Hospital. Should there be any circumstances to prevent such removal, the case is carefully watched by the Sanitary staff, and all is done to impress upon the friends the necessity of strict cleanliness and disinfection ; and should a death take place, speedy burial is enforced. Amongst diseases of the Zymotic class, Whooping Cough shewed the greatest increase, the deaths rising from 66 in the preceding year to 118. Measles from 38 to 82. The greatest decrease was in Scarlatina, the deaths from which fell from 107 to 41. Fever fell from 77 to 63 ; Diarrhoea from 164 to 159. There were 11 deaths registered as from Cholera, against 9 in the preceding year. These cases would more properly have been termed Diarrhoea, as they were the ordinary summer disease, and not at all of the Asiatic type. POPULATION. The population of Bethnal Green, as shewn by the last census, was 120,200, and during the past year the total number of births registered has been 4875, against 2958 deaths, giving a natural increase of 1917. This number, added to the 120,200, amounts to 122,117; and there 6 having been, during this time, little emigration from, or immigration into, the Parish, we may fairly estimate our population, in round numbers, at 122,000. Our increase has been at the rate of 40 per 1000—that is, 1 person out of every 25 gave birth to a living, child. Still-born children are not required to be registered, and therefore are not enumerated. The annual birth rate for the whole of the Metropolis was 34.5 per 1000, or 1 child to every 29 persons living, so that our rate is greatly above the average birth rate for the whole of London ; and we still maintain our rate of increase, though not quite so much as in the preceding year, when the births in this Parish were at the rate of 43 4 per 10.00, or 1 person in every 23.1 gave birth to a living child. DEATHS. The death rate for Bethnal Green during the year was 25 per 1000, or 1 person died of every 40 living—1 death in every 39 being from Zymotic disease. The average of deaths for the whole of London during the same period was at the rate of 247 per 1000, very slightly under that of this District. In the preceding year our death rate was 24 per 1000—1 death in every 41.5 living; 1 death in 4 being from Zymotic disease. PAUPER ILLNESS. The following is the number of new cases attended during the year by the District Medical Officers:— District No. 1 Mr. Massingham 1297 Cases. „ 2 Dr. Welch 1394 „ „ 3 Dr. Richards 673 „ ,, 4 Mr. Defriez 985 „ „ 5 Dr. Burgess 493 „ „ 6 Dr. Sarvis 815 „ Total 5657 Cases. 7 The Dispensary system is being carried out in the Parish. We at first had three Dispensaries, viz., Church Row, Morpeth Street, and Quilter Street. It was deemed, however, expedient to abolish the latter, and to transfer the medical men to Church Row, so that four are in attendance there daily. This system is found to work admirably, for while it tends to lessen the number of pauper patients, it ensures prompt attention and medicine to those who apply. QUEEN ADELAIDE'S DISPENSARY. The following is the Medical Report of this Charity for the year ending December 31st, 1871:— New Patients have been admitted, who have had Advice and Medicine, Gratis, at the Dispensary, or at their own homes 2769 Have been visited at their own homes 519 "Were so visited during the last week of the year 1871 23 Have been discharged Cured, or not returned their Letters 1352 Ditto, Relieved 1414 Have died 33 Were still under Medical treatment in the last week of December, 1871 611 The total number of Patients attendances during 1871 having been 43,088 CITY OF LONDON HOSPITAL FOR DISEASES OF THE CHEST. The following is the Medical Report for the Year 1871 :— The number of Patients admitted to the benefits of the Charity, during the year, 1871, has been— IN-PATIENTS 688 Ditto admitted prior to 31st December, 1870 7,299 Total to 31st December, 1871 7,987 OUT-PATIENTS 13,877 Ditto admitted prior to 31st December, 1870 183,721 Total to 31st December, 1871 197,598 Average attendance of Out-Patients each week during the year 1,175 8 COW-HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. The Cow and Slaughter-houses that have been previously licensed present no special feature for comment. They have been conducted in a proper manner, and have been kept in good order throughout the year. There have been several applications for new licences ; all the premises have been visited by the Sanitary Committee, and the following is the result:— Robert Corbett, 152, Brick Lane, applied for a license for a Slaughterhouse the premises are large, well built, ventilated, and properly drained. It was resolved not to oppose, consequently the license was granted. Herman Burgin, 3, Burgin Terrace, Grove Road, applied for a license for a Slaughter-house ; the premises were found to be unexceptionable, and the license was granted. Samuel Simonds, 21, Roman Road, applied for a license for a Slaughterhouse; it was found, on visiting the premises, that there was no building erected for the purpose, but that a portion of the yard had been well paved and drained, and Mr. Simonds desired to kill there, merely providing a temporary covering. This the Committee would not sanction, consequently he was opposed until the adjourned session. He has since erected a suitable building, and the license has been granted. A license was sought for a Slaughter-house at 1, King Street, Viaduct Street, by Philip Howes, baker, of Bethnal Green Road. A similar application was made last year, but was refused. The opposition was made not so much from the inadaptability of the premises, as from the fear that if such license was granted the premises would be converted into a piggery. This year the premises have been sot thoroughly in order, and Mr. Howes, who has dealt in country produce for many years, having assured the Committee that he will only have pigs on the premises for the purpose of slaughtering, was not opposed, and the license was granted. There were five new applications for Cow-house licenses; they are as follows:— 9 William Bailey, 5, Suffolk Street. Walter Burrows, Ivy Cottage, West Street. William Bogus, 42, Collingwood Street. Jenkin Morgan, 5, Mount Street. David Jenkins, 20, Turk Street. All these were opposed conditionally, as there were certain alterations necessary, prior to their being used for the purpose intended. The work was done in each of these cases previous to the adjourned sessions, the opposition withdrawn, and the licenses granted, with the exception of David Jenkins, 20, Turk Street, who did not comply with the requirements made, and consequently was again opposed, and the license refused. The number of Cow-houses is 45, viz.:— Bailev, William Bailey, John Boakes, William Bogus, George Burrows, Walter Chamberlain, William Childs, James John Coleman, Isaac Day, Thomas Hanchard Dupuy, William Edwards, Edward Edwards, Micah Edwards, Thomas and David Elliott, John Evan, E Greenslade, Henry Edwin Griffiths, Humphrey Harrington, Thomas Hills, William Hodges, William Manners Hollo way, William James, William Jenkins, Thomas Jones, Edward Lockyor, John Henry 5, Suffolk street. 46, Sommerford street 12, Barnet street 42, Collingwood street, Cambridge road Ivy cottage, West street 8½, North street 17, Coventry street Spencer passage, Hackney road 21, West street Cranbrook road 4, Boundary street 3, Birdcage walk 5, Virginia row 1, Vivian road 44, Squirries street 1, East street 3, William street 12, Gibraltar walk 46, Edward street Digby street 4, Albion street Oval, Hackney road 45, Gloucester street 4, Sclater street 8, Minerva street 10 Cow-houses (continued.)

I think I cannot do better, however, than lay before you some extracts from the minutes of the Sanitary Committee, so as to bring to your recollection the facts as then laid before you. 12 It will be in your remembrance that, upon the 22nd September (in consequence of a complaint made), a resolution was passed that the premises in question should be visited without previous intimation to the proprietor, at the hour when the nuisance was said to be at its worst, viz., midnight. This was done on September 26th, with the following result:— In accordance with a resolution, passed at the mooting of the 22nd September, the Committee assembled in Peel Grove with a view of making themselves better acquainted with the nature and extent of the alleged Fish Curing Nuisance in that neighbourhood, the weather on the occasion being favourable for the purpose. Having waited some time in the immediate neighbourhood in order, if possible, to detect the presence of smoke, or other offensive effluvia, they proceeded to inspect the premises of Mr. Cushway, the process of Fish Curing being then in full operation. It was stated by the foreman in charge that 70 barrels, each containing about 600 herrings, or a total of 42,000, were being cured at the time. The foreman further explained that the curing commenced at about six o'clook in the evening, and continued till twelve o'clock at night, the only material used in the preparation being the stumps of oak trees, which were placed upon the ground and lighted about that time, the smoke being allowed to escape gradually the whole of the time, but not in one dense body at the close of the process; and that the Committee saw on this occasion a fair specimen of how the business was usually carried on. The Committee, after deliberating for some time, Resolved—" That a meeting be convened for Tuesday, tho 13th Octobcr, at 3 p.m., to consider and report as to the result of their visit." Special Meeting of the Sanitary Committee, Midnight, October 13th, 1871. Present—Messrs. Jacobs, Beale, Attwell, Smither, Cook, jun., Owen, Ward, and Ames; also, Dr. Sarvis; Inspectors W. W, Burrows, J. W. Burrows, and J. Lapworth were present. The Committee again viewed the premises of Mr. Cushway, of Peel Greve, and took careful note of the process and its apparent effects, and the further consideration of the matter was adjourned to the 17th inst. October 17th, 1871.—At the Meeting of the Sanitary Committee, it was moved by Mr. Owen, seconded by Mr. Attwell, and carried unanimously,— "That the question of the Fish Curing or Smoking Factory in Peel Grove having been referred to the Committee, we have given it our fullest consideration and attention. We have made two midnight visits, quite unexpected by the proprietor, and on each occasion have carefully examined the premises and their surroundings—the result of our investigation is, that the process of Fish Curing as carried on by Mr. Cushway does not create a nuisance of such a nature as to call for the legal interference of the Vestry." 13 1 think, after the full consideration that has been given this matter by the Sanitary Committee and Staff, that it should be allowed entirely to rest. SANITARY MISCELLANEA. The work done in this department far exceeds that of former years. 1477 cases of Small Pox have been attended to by the inspectors, disinfectants supplied, and the houses cleansed and purified. Quantities of unsound meat and fish have been condemned and destroyed. All Cow and Slaughter-houses have been frequently inspected, so as to ensure cleanliness and prevent nuisance. A great number of workshops, where children are employed, have been repeatedly visited, and the hours of labour abridged, in accordance with the " Workshops' Regulation Act." The returns of the Sanitary Inspectors give the following results:— Small Pox cases visited 1477 Houses inspected 8871 Notices served 8391 Compulsory Notices served 520 Summonses issued 95 Number of Summonses heard 95 Number of Visits to ascertain the progress of work required to be done under Notices served 16,851 Work executed in compliance with Notices served. Houses cleansed and purified 2694 Houses closed as unfit for habitation 23 Cases in which Defective Drainage has been remedied 1075 Cesspools abolished 44 Closets cleansed and purified 2936 Privy Accommodation provided 19 Urinals cleansed 445 Removals of accumulations of Dung and other offensive matter 210 Animals Removed in consequence of being a Nuisance, or kept in a condition injurious public health 166 14 In conclusion, I have again to thank the Vestry for the assistance afforded me in carrying out the Sanitary Work during the year.

Gentlemen, I have the honour to lay before you my Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Condition of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, during the year 1885—a year of more than common interest, since it is marked by the elevation of the Parish to the rank of a Parliamentary Borough, returning two members to the House of Commons. The year too has witnessed a re-adjustment of the Sanitary Staff, and of the divisions of the district, for health purposes: these changes have been brought about by the resignation of Sanitary Inspector W. W. Burrows, and the retirement of his father, Sanitary Inspector J. W. Burrows, from their respective districts. It has long been practically recognized that, though nominally separate districts, the two allotted respectively to father and son were practically united, and the duties of both efficiently performed by the son. The retirement of the son, therefore, involved a double vacancy, and the opportunity was thought a favourable one to reorganize the Health Department of the Parish. The whole question of Sanitary Inspection was accordingly referred to a Committee, with instructions generally to consider and report. A sketch of the Sanitary History of the Parish may in this connection materially help to mark the progress we have made. The startingpoint of our local Sanitary History may, for present purposes, be taken to be the year 1855, when the Metropolis Local Management Act (18 and 19 Vie., c. 120) first gave to this Vestry its present constitution as the local authority, and created the offices of Medical Officers of Health and Inspectors of Nuisances; and when 2 the Nuisances Removal Act (18 and 19 Vie., c. 121) repealed the earlier sanitary legislation, and substituted a more efficient, if still defective, code in its place. Both these important Acts have subsequently had valuable amendments engrafted on them, as for instance, the Act amending the Nuisances Removal Act (23 and 24 Vic., c. 77). Mr. Pearce was appointed the first Medical Officer of Health under the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, and Mr.H. Bliss, the sole Nuisance Inspector. At this time the Parish contained about 97,647 inhabitants and 13,500 houses. In 1857, Mr. Bliss resigned his post as Nuisance Inspector in consequence of being appointed Rate Collector. Ho was succeeded by Mr. Eagles, who subsequently was also appointed a Rate Collector, and in due course resigned the Nuisance Inspectorship. Mr. Cornwall was the next Inspector, he died in 1863, and was succoeded by Mr. Morris. Mr. Ford was appointed to act in conjunction with Mr. Morris, but an indiscretion on Mr. Ford's part in writing to the public press on Parish matters, caused him to be dismissed. Mr. Christey was then appointed as Chief Inspector, and Mr. Morris acted as his subordinate. A prosecution, instituted by the Inspectors, against a vendor of what was alleged to bo unwholesome meat, having miscarried by reason of insufficient evidence, and neither of the Inspectors being possessed of adequate experience to guarantee the efficient discharge of the duties of their offices in the matter of the condemnation of unsound meat, the Vestry ordered that they should not seize any more meat until it had been first inspected and condemned by Mr. J. W. Burrows, the Coroner's Officer and Beadle, and who had formerly carried on business as a butcher. The Vestry thought so highly of Mr. Burrows' skill in the discharge of the new duties they entrusted him with, that in 1868 he was made a third Nuisance Inspector in addition to his other duties. The Parish was at this time divided into districts, and Mr. Morris was transferred to other duties under the Surveyor. The population at this time was about 112,650, and the numbor of houses 14,500. 3 In 1866 (the Cholera year), Mr. W. W. Burrows was appointed a temporary inspector. Six months afterwards this appointment was made permanent. There were now three Inspectors working together,—two of whom devoted their whole time to Sanitary work, while tho third had other parochial duties to perform, in consideration of which ho only received a proportionate salary. he was, however, assigned a district, which though in area nearly one half of the Parish, yet contained but very few houses, as it included Victoria Park, the Green, and much vacant land, which however has since been built upon. Mr. Christey had a severe illness in 1870, which left him incapacitated for work, and as it was not considered advisable to superannuate him, he was made an assistant Inspector at £50 a year, and did no more duty. At this juncture, Mr. J. Lapworth, a clerk in the Surveyor's department, was appointed a Nuisance Inspector, and took over Mr. Christey's district. The first Medical Officer of Health was Mr. Pearce, he was suooeeded by Dr. Sarvis in 1864. Dr. Sarvis held office till his death in 1875, and then your present Medical Officer was appointed. The amount of work devolving upon the Sanitary Staff increased as time went on. No. 3 district, which had originally the fewest houses, beoame gradually covered with buildings. The population of the Parish rapidly increased, and of course added very considerably to the work of the department. Year by year new Acts of Parliament have augmented the duties of the Inspectors, amongst these I may mention the Sanitary Act of 1866, and other amending Acts, the Bakehouse Regulation Act, and the Food and Drugs' Act. It will thus be seen that though for the last twenty years there have been three Inspectors, only two have devoted their whole time to Sanitary duties, while the third Inspector, whose district equalled in area that of the other two put together, only gave as much time as he could conveniently spare from his other multifarious duties, to Sanitary work. 4 The rule has been to hold each Inspector responsible for his own district; and each Inspector has accordingly reported the result of his inspections direct to the Sanitary Committee; but the Medical Officer of Health, though freely applied to for advice and assistance in difficult cases, has never been considered responsible for the manner in which the work of the department was conducted. Owing to there being no clerical assistance provided in the office, the book-keeping has been most imperfectly done. The Inspectors have never kept diaries, and no proper record of the results of inspections, or the action taken thereon, has been preserved. It is, however, distinctly laid down in the Metropolis Local Management Act, that the Nuisance Inspectors shall keep a complaint book, in which shall be entered particulars of all complaints of nuisances, or of any infringement of the provisions of tho Act, together with a record of any action taken by the Vestry thereupon : further, this book is to be open to the inspection of the parishioners at all reasonable times. A book called a complaint book certainly has been kept in the office, but very few complaints were ever entered in its pages; while the results of inspections, and the action taken in consequence, were never recorded therein. The Inspectors have never kept daily records of their work, and they have been perfectly irresponsible agents ; in fact, there has been in the past no system or method whatever. I had long felt discontented with the manner in which the Sanitary work of the Parish was transacted, and in 1883, the year of "The Bitter Cry," I prepared and presented to the Vestry a report, in which I sketched out a scheme for the better management of the department, from which I quote the following recommendations: 1st.—Mr. Burrows, Sen., should be relieved of his duties as Inspector of Nuisances for the No. 3 District, and be appointed Food Inspector and Disinfecting Officer for the whole Parish. 2nd.—A new Officer should be appointed for the district thus vacated. 3rd.—The Inspectors of the other districts should confine themselves to Sanitary work and perform no duties under the Food and Drugs' Acts, and do no Disinfections. 5 4th.—A Clerk should be appointed to attend at the Office all day, who should keep the books, make out notices, receive complaints, and perform such other duties as may be required. 5th.—The three District Inspectors and the Clerk should be placed under tho orders of your Medical Officer of Health; to perform such duties as he may direct, and report to him daily. Your Medical Officer would thus be head of his department and solely responsible to the Sanitary Committee for the condition of the Parish, and for the manner in which the Inspectors perform their duties. If some such system as this were adopted, an enormous amount of work could be got through. Each Inspector would have his day's duties laid down for him, and would not be liable to bo called away, and would not be required, as now, to spend half his time in making out and copying notices. No action was taken upon this report, and things drifted on in the old way till the resignation of Mr. W. W. Burrows brought the matter prominently forward, and the subject was referred to the Sanitary Committee for consideration and report. It has become year by year more obvious that Nuisance Inspectors should be regularly trained for their duties, and should give evidence of fitness for the position by the possession of a certificate of proficiency conferred after examination by some public body, such as the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain. I understand Mr. J. Lapworth was the first Metropolitan Inspeotor of Nuisances who obtained this certificate. Had Mr. W. W. Burrows retained his appointment, I am informed he also intended to present himself for examination. Many members of the Committee felt strongly upon this point, and determined to support only candidates holding certificates of this nature. The constitution of the Sanitary Staff was discussed at several meetings of the Committee, and it was considered that as the duties of the Inspectors had been recently modified by the appointment of a Disinfecting Engineer and two assistants, who in their spare time act as Dust Inspectors, a staff of two Nuisance Inspectors and a Sanitary Clerk would suffice for the needs of the Parish. I cannot say that I concur in this opinion, for there is 6 certainly work enough in Bethnal Green for at least three active officers. It was at first proposed that the Medical Officer of Health should be made responsible head of the department, and called upon to attend at the Vestry Hall each morning for the purpose of supervising the work of the Inspectors. This recommendation was, in my opinion unfortunately, not adopted. At the last meeting of the Committee it was decided to divide the Parish into two districts, with an Inspector for each, and to promote Mr. J. Lapworth to the position of Chief Inspector. The following is a copy of the report sent up to the Vestry: Your Committee having considered what arrangement it is desirablo should be made in the Sanitary Department, in consequence of the resignation of Sanitary Inspector Mr. W. W. Burrows, report and recommend as follows :— Your Committee are of opinion that Mr. J. W. Burrows' age and health render it desirable he should cease to be a Sanitary Inspector, and that he be awarded a pension, according to the scale allowed by the Act of Parliament. That the Parish should, for the purposes of Sanitary Inspection, bo divided into two Districts; one to the north, the other to the south of an imaginary continuous line, from the boundary of the Parish in Church Street, along the centres of Church Street, Bethnal Green Road, to its eastern end, thence northward along Cambridge Road to Old Ford Road, and thence along this road to the boundary of the Parish. That there shall be one Chief and two other Inspectors. That Mr. Joshua Lapworth, now one of the Inspectors, be appointed Chief Inspector, at a salary of £160 per annum. That tho two othor Inspectors be appointed at salaries of £2 per week each, and that a lad be employed to attend at the Sanitary Offico, at tho Vestry Hall, to koep books and give assistance in writing documents and correspondence, at about 15s. per week. That (the Medical Officer oxcepted) no porson employed by the Vestry on tho Sanitary staff bo allowed to engage himself or be concerned in any office, appointment, business, or occupation, without the previous consent by resolution of the Vestry, and upon the terms of such resolution. 7 Your Committee suggest that it be referred to them to advertise for Candidates for the office of Inspector. That the applications be received and considered by the committee, and that they select the more eligible Candidates, out of whom the two Inspectors shall be elected by the Vestry. That the advertisement for Inspectors shall state that each Candidate must have had experience as a Sanitary Officer, or in some other practical occupation of a similar character, and that preference will be given to Candidates who hold certificates of the Sanitary Institute of having passed an examination in Sanitary knowledge. That it be referred to the Committee to engage a lad upon the terms already mentioned in this report. At the meeting of the full Board that portion of the report recommending the appointment of a Chief Inspector was negatived. The opinion of the majority was that an officer of this nature over such a small staff would be unnecessary, and the original proposition of Mr. Norris, to have two Inspectors, each responsible for his own district, was reverted to and carried. Advertisements were inserted in the public press, in answer to which a large number of applicants came forward, some sixteen of whom held certificates from the Sanitary Institute of Great Britain; six out of these were selected, and their names sent up to the Vestry, whose choice ultimately fell upon Mr. J. Weston, who, in addition to the above-mentioned certificate, had already filled the post of assistant Inspector in St. Luke's. I have had considerable opportunities of watching this officer in the performance of his duties, and I am more than satisfied. I think a most judicious selection has been made, and a very intelligent and energetic officer has been appointed. The Sanitary Committee selected Mr. Meadway for the post of clerk. He soon mastered the duties of the office, is a very neat and accurate book-keeper, and takes down the instructions of the Inspectors in shorthand, and writes out the notices at his leisure, thus effecting a considerable saving of public time, and enabling the Inspectors to devote more attention to their out-door duties. He is certainly worth more than the salary he is receiving. I consider the appointment a distinct gain to the department. 8 Previously to these appointments, I designed a system of work for the Sanitary department, together with a complete set of books and report sheets. The whole of the notice forms were revised and re-arranged, and the entire scheme was laid before the Sanitary Committee and approved. As soon as the new officers entered on their duties, I commenced to attend at the Vestry Hall each morning for the purpose of supervising the work of the department. Mr. Lapworth resented this, and brought the matter before the next meeting of the Sanitary Committee. He said he had not been accustomed to work in leading strings, and preferred to be responsible solely to the Yestry. The consideration of the matter was postponed, and at the next meeting, after the ordinary business was concluded, the adjourned discussion on the duties of the Sanitary Staff was resumed. The Medical Officer stated that he desired no additional power to be conferred upon him, and simply asked that the Inspectors be directed to report to him daily, and for the purpose of receiving these reports and advising upon them, he would attend at the Vestry Hall each morning at nine o'clock. After some discussion, a Member of the Committee suggested that the system of bookkeeping, proposed by Dr. Bate and adopted by the Committee, was so complete that the Medical Officer's daily attendance would not be required. He therefore proposed that the further consideration of the matter be adjourned for six months in order to give the system a trial. This having been seconded, another Member proposed, as an amendment, that the Inspectors be ordered to report daily to Dr. Bate, and to act generally under his supervision. The amendment, however, was lost, and the original proposition, to postpone consideration of the matter, was then carried. Now in order to be in a position to advise the Yestry in its deliberations, I have made certain enquiries as to the method of procedure in other parts of the Metropolis, and for this purpose I sent out to every Metropolitan Medical Officer of Health a circular asking for replies to certain questions. I have digested the answers received in the accompanying Table. No District. Population. No. of Inspectors of Nuisances. Other Officers. If Inspectors have extra duties. No. of Inhabitants to each Inspector. If Chief Inspector. If Inspectors are allowed to take legal proceedings. Do they Report to M.O H., and when ? Do they Report to San. Com., and when ?

I find that the Health Department is variously managed in different parts of London. In a few instances a Chief Inspector or Sanitary Superintendent is appointed, but usually he is chief only in name, and the almost universal custom seems to be to consider the Medical Officer of Health chief of the department, and solely responsible to the Sanitary Committee for the due performance of their duties by the Nuisance Inspectors. It must of course be distinctly understood that the authority spoken of extends only to the supervision of the manner in which the officers perform their inspections. The action taken as a result of these inspections is in all cases entirely in the hands of the Vestry or Local Board, or of the Committee to which its powers are delegated. No Medical Officer or Inspector has authority to serve even a simple notice under the Sanitary Acts without the sanction of the Sanitary Committee, much less to take legal proceedings. In one district, the Strand, where the Surveyor is nominally Chief Inspector, the Nuisance Inspectors (here designated "SubInspectors") are under the control of, and are actually appointed by, the Medical Officer of Health, who also has the power of discharging them. In Fulham the seven Inspectors are under the direct authority of the Medical Officer, who has the power to suspend if he thinks necessary. On the other hand, the Medical Officer of a very large and influential district, and who is himself perhaps the most talented and energetic Health Officer in the Metropolis, tells me that he distinctly disclaims legal authority over his Inspectors, and that there is no bye-law, directi on, or resolution of his Vestry bearing upon the question. He claims no 10 superiority, but as a matter of fact he has as much authority as ho chooses. He suporvisos the work of the Inspectors daily, and directs them as much as ho considers necessary. All forms and methods of work are devised by him, and he carries out the work of the department in the mannor ho considers best for the public good. I find that in a largo numbor of instances tho Inspectors do not report diroct to tho Sanitary Committee, but do so only through tho Modical Officer. In other districts they submit their reports to him beforo presenting thorn to tho Committee. It will thus bo soon that opinions and customs vary within wido limits. Tho Metropolis Local Management Act directs that "Every . . . . . Inspector shall forthwith enquire into tho truth or othorwise of . . . . . complaints, and roport upon tho same to tho Vestry . . . . at their next meeting." The general custom over noarly tho whole of London seems for the Inspectors to roport to the Modical Officer daily, either at tho Town Hall or at tho Modical Officor's own house, as has been found most convenient. Yory few Medical Officers are bound to attend at the offico daily; but most of them find it convenient to do so in order that thoy may effectually supervise tho work of the Inspectors. In eleven districts Chief Inspectors are appointed, but three of those are only nominal, as they have no power over the others. In one instance the Surveyor is Chief Inspector. In all but five districts tho Inspectors take legal proceedings when directed by the Vestry or Sanitary Committee to do so. This duty is distinctly thrown on these officers by the 133rd section of the Metropolis Local Management Aot. Notwithstanding this, in three Metropolitan districts, tho Yestry Clerk prosecutos. In ono, the City, a solicitor acts, and in another tho Modical Officer himself takes all legal proceedings. In five districts tho Chief Inspector only acts in this capacity, and calls tho other Inspectors when requisite. In very fow districts have the Inspectors any duties other than should naturally pertain to their office. In some districts special Dust and Food Inspectors are appointed, leaving the Nuisance Inspectors free to perform their special functions. In Clerkenwell the 11 assistant Inspector has parochial duties such as one of the Inspectors of Bethnal Green has been in the habit of performing for years past. In St. George's-in-the-East the Senior Inspector acts as Hall Keeper, and the Junior as Messenger. In a few districts the Nuisance Inspectors have duties in connection with street obstructions and pavements, but these may be fairly considered as Sanitary duties. I find that in the whole of the Metropolis there are 103 Nuisance Inspectors; and this gives a rough average of one Inspector to about 40,000 of the population. In the annexed table I have calculated the proportion of inhabitants to each Inspector in the various Metropolitan districts, and I find that the proportion varies through very wide limits; for instance, Greenwich and St. Olave's have each only one Inspector; the population of the first is 148,545, while that of the second is 10,000 only. These certainly are almost rural districts, and cannot be fairly compared with a densely-populated parish like our own. Reckoning our number of Inspectors at two and a half, we have in times past had one Inspector to about 52,000 inhabitants. This is about 12,000 below the average; but as we have recently reduced the number of Inspectors to two, we have one Inspector to 65,000 inhabitants— a number exceeded by only six other Metropolitan districts. The amount of assistance given in the Sanitary department by other officers, makes a very considerable difference in the amount of work the Inspectors are capable of getting through. I consider that a Dust Inspector and a Sanitary Clerk ought, in a large district, to be equivalent to an additional Sanitary Inspector. The duties of food sampling and disinfecting also take up a great deal of time that might be more profitably occupied in inspectorial work, and in many districts special officers are appointed for these duties. In Bethnal Green the Inspectors have in times past done their own clerking, and have been held responsible for the proper performance of the dusting, scavenging, and disinfecting, and for the carrying out of the provisions of the Food and Drugs' Acts; but since we have had a "Lyons'" steam disinfector, and a staff of three men to attend to it, the Inspectors have been relieved of some portion of their duties. Moreover, the Disinfecting Engineer and 12 his two assistants have been available, when not actually engaged in working the apparatus, as Dust Inspectors, and have rendered very good service in that capacity. The reorganization of the Sanitary Department has been recently under consideration in the Islington district, and a very full and well-considered report upon the whole subject has been presented jointly by the Medical Officer and the Sanitary Superintendent. By reference to the annexed tabular statement, it will be seen that Islington has a population of 321,824. There are, including the Sanitary Superintendent, nine Inspectors; and three Clerks are engaged in the office. With an enormous district such as this, and with so numerous a staff, a Chief Inspector or Sanitary Superintendent is an absolute necessity; and from the report I see that the duties of this officer are chiefly those of direction and general supervision. He controls the Inspectors, manages the correspondence and legal proceedings, books and records, and acts as Clerk to the Committee. The Clerks assist in all office work as far as possible, and even the Messengers when not actually engaged as such, also assist in the copying of notices. The Islington regulations for the work of the Inspectors are so good that I quote them in full. Vestry of St. Mary, Islington, Sanitary Department. KEGULATIONS As to the Work of the Inspectors of Nuisances and Sanitary Inspectors. 1. To carry out all inspections arising out of sanitary or other complaints received at the offices, and those deemed necessary by the Medical Officer of Health, or Superintendent, on account of death, outbreaks of disease, and for disinfection or registration, and other purposes. These inspections, and all re-inspections of premises where works are required, will be most conveniently carried out on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in each week. To take proceedings at the police-court when necessary. 2. The cow-houses, slaughter-houses, and bakehouses to be inspected every three or four months, under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health, or of the Superintendent. Upon each occasion the whole should be inspected within as short a time as possible, and those requiring to be cleansed, &c., are then to be revisited in the ordinary course. 13 3. The systematic inspection of houses in the poorer localities of the Parish to be carried out when practicable, one day in each week, Tuesday generally being the best day for that purpose, all such inspections to be carried out under the direction of the Medical Officer, of Health, or of the Superintendent. The Inspectors will make note on all occasions of any accumulations of dust at the houses which they visit. 4. In the ordinary course of their out-door duties the Inspectors will inspect the meat, fish, fruit, and vegetables, &c.; exposed for sale in their respective districts, and will seize any of the same if it appear to be unfit for human food. On Saturday evenings also, between the hours of seven and nine, they will specially perform this duty in the various market thoroughfares of the Parish. 5. The Inspectors to attend at the Vestry Offices between nine and ten o'clock each morning to make up their diaries recording their previous day's work, to enter in such diaries any complaints which may have been made to them in their rounds, and to receive instructions from the Medical Officer of Health, or Superintendent, or to confer when necessary with other officers, to make out notices, &c , if required. and a weekly return of work every Monday morning. 6. To return to the Offices at 4.30 p.m. (except on Saturday), and arrange for the notices which will be required to be made out on the following morning by the clerks, and to enter their own reports and the orders made in the Complaint Book. 7. To purchase samples of food, &c., for analysis as directed by the Committee or the Superintendent. 8. The Inspector of Dust to visit daily under direction as many houses as possible in the poorer localities of the Parish to ascertain the existence of accumulations of dust, to inquire into and report upon all specific complaints as to dusting, and to enter in his diary any sanitary nuisance which he may observe or receive complaint of on his rounds. To make out the orders for the removal of dust each day, and to keep and furnish the weekly tables relating thereto. He will also purchase samples of food, &c., for analysis when directed to do so. In considering the duties of a Sanitary Officer, the investigation of cases of infectious disease claims the first mention; next come enquiries into complaints of unsanitary conditions (of which. it may be mentioned, many are made anonymously); and the periodical inspection of cowsheds, slaughter-houses, bake-houses, offensive trades, and the courts and alleys of the district. In times past attention to these three classes of cases, and the making out, serving, 14 and following up of the necessary notices, has swallowed up the greater portion of our Inspectors' time; but seotion 20 of the Sanitary Aot, 1866, lays down that "it shall be the duty of the nuisanoe authority, either by itself or its officers, to make from time to time inspection of the district, with a viow to asoertain what nuisances exist calling for abatement, under the powers of the Nuisance Removal Acts, and to enforce the provisions of the said Acts, in order to cause the abatement thereof." I must confess that, so far as Bethnal Green has been concerned, this elause has been almost a dead letter. I gather from the figures furnished me by the Inspectors in Table VI., Annual Reports on Bethnal Green, that the average number of premises of all kinds yearly inspected has been about 3800. Dividing these between two Inspectors, there would be 1900 each, and reckoning three hundred working days in the year, each officer would have six or seven primary inspections to make each day. Now each case requires on an average about three visits, in addition to the primary inspection, before the work in those requiring sanitary amendment has been satisfactorily completed. This tells up to about twenty-four visits per diem; and as the premises under inspection would probably be scattered over a wide area, the average time oonsumed in attending to each case could not be put lower than a quarter of an hour ; the twenty-four cases would therefore occupy six hours of the Inspector's day. This, with the extra duties previously mentioned, and the office work, is about as much as one man can be expected to perform. Dr. Tidy, in the Islington report previously referred to, considers that each Inspector should have charge of a district containing in round numbers 40,000 inhabitants, and about 5000 houses, of which about 1500 would require either annual or more frequent inspection. In addition to these there would be the infectious cases, and complaints, and the periodical trade inspections. He considers that these altogether would require an average of about twentyseven or twenty-eight visits per diem, and that this is about what an Inspector ought to be able to get through. 15 VITAL STATISTICS, SUMMARY. 1884. 1885.

I estimated the population of Bethnal Green, for the middle of the year 1884, at 129,055, and taking into consideration the fact that the births, deaths, and marriages have all considerably decreased 16 since last year, and also that tho rato colloctors roturn 46 fewer houses than thoy did in 1884, I have reluctantly arrivod at the conclusion that although the births registered during the yoar have exceedod tho deaths by 2308, yet that an equivalent number of adults must have omigrated from tho district, leaving our numbers as nearly as possible tho same as last year; I have therefore based my statistics upon the assumption that our population is stationary, or very nearly so. Tho area of the distriot is 755 acres, of which about seventeen are covered with water. Tho number of inhabitod houses is 17,787; this corresponds to a population of 7.25 persons to each louse and 171 to each acre. These figures are almost idontical with those of the previous two years. Tho following Table, which has been prepared from the rate books, shews the distribution of the houses, workshops, and factories in the several wards of the Parish:— TABLE A.

The number of deaths registered during the year was 2797, against 2884 last year, a decrease of 87. This number is inclusive of 139 strangers, who, though ordinarily resident in other parts of London, came for treatment and died in hospital in Bethnal Green ; they are therefore excluded. On the other hand, I have received information from the General Register Office of the deaths of 192 inhabitants of Bethnal Green who died in hospital outside the Parish. In this number are included the deaths of parishioners in the extra Metropolitan Small Pox Hospitals. These 192 deaths must therefore be added, making a net total of 2850. BIRTHS. The births during the year were 5158, against 5475 in the preceding year, a decrease of 317. The excess of the births over the deaths was 2308; this is 158 fewer than last year, as is shewn by the subjoined Table:— TABLE B. 1884. 1885. Estimated Population in the middle of the year 129,055 129,055 Total Births 5475 5158 Total Deaths 3009 2850 Excess of Births over Deaths, shewing the natural increase of the Population 2466 2308 ANNUAL DEATH RATE. On the basis of our estimated population, we shew a death rate for the year 1885 of 22.08. This is 0.09 below that of last year, and though much above the general Metropolitan rate, which was only 19.7, it is slightly below that of the Eastern districts of London, which was 22.1 per thousand. The rate in the Western 18 districts was 17.7; in the South, 18.8 ; in the North, 18.5; and in the Central, 25.5. As before mentioned, the death rate for the whole of London was 19.7. This is the lowest rate on record in London ; the next two lowest, however, having been those recorded in the two immediately preceding years, 1883 and 1884, when the death rates were 20.5 and 20.4 respectively. The Registrar-General remarks, in his annual report, that some share in producing this low death rate is attributable to the low birth rate. Had the birth rate been equal to the average in the preceding decennium (1875-1884), 10,431 more infants would have been born in the year ; and with an infantile death rate of 148 per thousand, there would have been 1544 additional infant deaths, which would have raised the general death rate from 19.7 to 20.0 per thousand, which rate would still have remained the lowest on record. Had the deaths in London in 1885 equalled the corrected average annual number in the preceding decennium, 8412 persons would have died in the year who as it was were alive at its close. In the following Table aro compared the mortality rates for London and for Bethmal Green, by quarters:— TABLE C. London. Bethnal Green. March Quater 21.6 21.14 June ,, 19.3 24.80 September „ 18.2 20.92 December „ 19.5 21.08 BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. The number of births registered during the year was 5158, and corresponded to an annual rate of 39.96. This rate is slightly lowor than that of last year, but considerably above that of London, 19 which was 32.6. The Registrar-General remarks that this was the lowest rate on record since 1850, when it was 32.0. MARRIAGES. In this Parish there are 14 Churches, 15 Chapels, and 1 Registry Office, licensed for Marriages. Of these there were in the First Quarter 497 Second „ 658 Third „ 638 Fourth „ 739 Total 2532 This total indicates a marriage rate of 19.62 to every thousand persons ; or, as in each marriage there are two contracting parties, 39.24 per thousand of our population entered the bonds of matrimony. Sixty-one of these weddings were purely civil contracts, and required the presence of the Registrar; 29 of them took place in Chapels, and 32 at the Registrar's Office. The rate for London was 16.9. This was the lowest marriage rate as yet recorded in London ; and the two next lowest, moreover, were those of the two immediately preceding years, 1883 and 1884, when the rates were 17.9 and 17.6 respectively. DEATHS OF INFANTS. No less than 26.32 per cent. of the deaths from all causes were those of infants aged less than twelve months ; for out of 5158 children born, 750 died before reaching the age of one year, leaving only 4408 who attained that age. This gives a death rate calculated upon tho births of 145.4 or of 5.8 per thousand population at all ages. The diseases most fatal to infants were:—Inflammatory Chest Diseases, 131; Atrophy and Debility, 120 ; Convulsions, 88 ; Premature Birth, 63; Diarrhæa, 57; Diseases of Brain, 46; Suffocation, 36; Measles, 35; Consumption of Bowels, 33; Whooping Cough, 25. 20 DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. As usual nearly half the deaths (1213, equal, that is, to 42.5 per cent.) were those of young children aged less than five years. Assuming the proportion of young children to adults to have been maintained since the last census, the number of young children in 1885 would be 19,700 ; upon this estimated population we shew a death rate of 61.57.

The total number of deaths referred to this class of diseases was 497, of which 110 were cases of young children under five years of age ; amongst these 145 occurred during the first year of life ; 158 were from Measles; 90 from Whooping Cough; and 72 from Diarrhæal Diseases. THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths from the diseases grouped under the two orders, Miasmatic and Diarrhceal, were 463, against 578 last year—a decrease of 115. The decennial average of Zymotic deaths for the ten years, 1875 to 1884, was 532. (See Table V.) In Table D are shewn the deaths from each of these diseases oompared with those of the preceding year.

The death rate from Zymotic diseases was 3.5, against 4.4 last year. The corresponding rates for London were 3.3 in 1884, and 2.7 in 1885.

(Decennial average, 45.8). The number of cases of Small Pox reported to us during the year was 258; of these 191 were removed to hospital, where 18 died and 2 remained still under treatment at the end of the year. The total deaths from Small Pox, including those in hospital, were 22 ; of these 7 had been vaccinated and 7 were unvaccinated, in the remaining 8 cases the vaccination was doubtful. The great majority of the cases reported to us were certified by the parochial Medical Officers, and were removed to hospital by the Relieving Officers. 23 In September, a communication was received from the Asylums Board asking to be informed if the Vestry would be prepared to enter into a contract with them to receive non-pauper cases of infectious disease upon certain specified conditions in accordance with the terms of section 15 of the Poor Law Act of 1879. Under this proposed contract, patients were to be admitted upon the certificate of the Medical Officer of Health only. This certificate was required to be sent to the Clerk of the Managers, who would then admit the patient, providing there was room. This plan would have required your Medical Officer of Health to visit each case before removal—a duty almost impossible in times of epidemics, and a requirement which would always cause great delay in the removal of cases. In addition, considerable friction would undoubtedly be caused, as medical men practising in the district would resent the visit of the Medical Officer of Health to their patients as casting a slur upon their powers of diagnosis. It was the opinion of the Vestry that, as nearly the whole of those persons removed from this district were either actual paupers, or became so by reason of their illness, the duty of removing and treating them belonged properly to the Poor Law authorities. The Vestry, therefore, declined to enter into any contract on the matter with the managers of the Asylums Board Hospitals. Recently some new regulations for the removal of Small Pox and Fever patients, and for furnishing information concerning the same, have been framed and issued by the Asylums Board. They are as follows :— Metropolitan Asylums Board. REGULATIONS For the Removal of Smallpox and Fever Patients, and for Furnishing Information concerning the same. 1. Applications for the removal of patients to the Hospitals of the Board must be made to the Chief Officers (Ambulance Department) between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on week days, and to the Ambulance 24 Stations between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Sundays, and between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. every day. 2. Such applications must state the name, age, and full address of the patient, from what disease suffering, and in cases of fever the particular kind of fever; and also the name of the person making the application, and the Parish ho represents. Applications which do not give these particulars will be referred back to the applicant for the required information to be furnished. 3. The Medical Certificate or Order for the admission of the patient must be handed to the Nurse in charge of the Ambulance. Should neither of those documents bo handed to the Nurse, the patient will not bo removed. 4. Subject to the control of the Committee appointed to regulate such matters, tho Clerk of tho Board is to give all necessary directions for the removal of patients from their homos to the Hospitals, and for the conveyanco of recovored patients from the Hospital Ships to their homes. 5. At the time of the removal of a patient the Ambulance Nurse is to leave with a relative or friend of the patient, or, in tho absence of such a person, with a resident in the house from which the patient is taken, a notice stating the Hospital to which the patient is to be removed, and such notice is to have annexed to it a copy of the regulations as to visiting, &c. She is also to place on the "Delivery Note" left with the patient at the Hospital the name and address of the relative, friend or resident above referred to. 6. Upon the removal being effected, the Superintendent of the Ambulance Station shall report the fact to the Clerk to the Board, who shall at once send notice thereof to the Clerk to the Guardians of the Parish or Union from which the patient was conveyed. 7. Upon the transfer of a patient to another Hospital, notice thereof is to bo sent by the authorities of the Hospital from which the patient is transferred to the relative or friend of the patient, and to the Clerk to the Guardians of the Parish or Union to which the patient is chargeable. 8. When a patient is transferred to another Hospital, a copy of the particulars given on the admission order relating to the patient is to bo sent with the patient, care being taken that if such order does 25 not contain the name of a relative or friend, the name and address of the relative or friend on the "Delivery Note " are furnished. By Order, W. F. JEBB, Clerk. Chief Offices of the Board, Norfolk Street, Strand, W.C. 30th March, 1886. Note.—The Regulations dated 1st March and 21st June, 1884, are rescinded. SCARLET FEVER. (Decennial average, 111.8). The Scarlet Fever cases reported to us during the year were 131 in number. The disease proved fatal to 62 persons, 38 less than last year ; 46 were infants and young children. The Registrar General, in his annual report for 1885, notes this diminution of Scarlet Fever mortality all over London, and suggests as a not impossible explanation that it may be due to the increasing use of public hospitals for cases of this disease,—in other words, to improved isolation. FEVERS. (Decennial average, 43.7). The various forms of Fever were responsible for twenty-one deaths, less than half the decennial average. Enteric Fever caused fifteen deaths, Typhus one, and Simple Fever five. One hundred and ninety-eight cases of the various forms of Fever (including Scarlet Fever) were reported to us; 150 were removed to hospital, 21 died, 135 recovered, and 21 remained under treatment at the end of the year. The following table shews the infectious cases reported during each month of the year, the numbers of those admitted to hospital, and the termination of the latter cases.

(Decennial average, 9.7). Nineteen deaths from this disease were returned by the registrars. All these except two were of young children aged less than five years. Fifty deaths were referred to Laryngitis and Croup: doubtless many of these were cases of Diphtheria. WHOOPING COUGH. (Decennial average, 129.5.) The prevalence of this disease was considerably below the average, as it caused only 92 deaths. I had the appended correspondence with the School Management Committee of the London School Board upon the advisability of excluding children coming from houses where other children were suffering from either Whooping Cough or Mumps. School Board for London, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 10th March, 1886. Sir, The attention of the School Management Committee of the Board has been directed to the fact that "Mumps" is not included among the specific diseases mentioned in the enclosed list. It has also been suggested that Whooping Cough is not such an nfectious disease as to preclude any child coming to school from a house Where such a disease exists. I shall be obliged if you, as the Medical Officer of Health for your own district, will kindly assist the Committee with your advice upon hese points, and also as to whether the enclosed regulations relating so infectious diseases are in your opinion sufficient to prevent their spread among the children in the schools of the Board. I am your obedient Servant, G. H. CROAD, Dr. G. P. Bate. Clerk of the Board. Extract from Board Code. Any child shewing symptoms of an infectious disease, or any child Coming from a house where an infectious disease exists, must be sent Lome at once. The Medical Officer of Health for the district must it the same time be informed of the child's exclusion, and furnished with the name and address of the child, and the reason for its exclusion. When there is not a Medical Officer of Health the information just be forwarded to the Sanitary Authority. Any child suffering 28 from Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Smallpox, or Typhus Fever, and excluded under this rule, should not bo allowed to resume attendance at school within two months, unless a Certificate from tho Medical Officer of the Sanitary Authority, or of the Union, is produced to show that he or she may safely be re-admitted; but when a child has been attended by a duly qualified medical practitioner, his Certificate shall be sufficient. If the school fees are remitted for such child, or paid by tho Guardians of the Union at tho time of its exclusion, the cost of the above Certificate will be defrayed by the Board. Symptoms of Infectious Diseases. Scarlet Fever.—By the child being feverish, and having a sore throat, and a red rash ovor the chest, and often elsewhere. Diphtheria.—By the child being feverish and having a sore throat, with white patches on the interior of the throat. Smallpox.—By the child being feverish, and having a number of small pimples over tho face. Typhus Fever.—By the child being feverish, having headache, and a rash over the chest, stomach, and wrists. Whooping Cough would be recognised by the child coughing until it is out of breath, and then drawing in its breath with a crowing noise, the child often being sick from the violence of the cough. Measles.—By the child being feverish, having all tho symptoms of a bad cold, running at tho eyes, &c., and by the presence of a rash on tho face and wrists. School Board for London, Victoria Embankment, W.C. 10th March, 1886. Sir, It may bo within your knowledge that a Committee of the School Board for London recently considered the question of overpressure, and recommended that a short statement of the premonitory symptoms of diseases likely to affect children whether arising from over-work or otherwise, be drawn up by Medical Authority for the use of the Teachers and Local Managers. May I ask you as one of the Medical practitioners to whom the Board refer Pupil Teachers for health Certificates, whether you have any suggestion to offer to the School Management Committee to enable them to carry out that recommendation. I am your obedient Servant, G. H. CROAD, Dr. G. P. Bate, Clerk to the Board. 412, Bethnal Green Eoad, E. 29 412, Bethnal Green Road, E. Sir, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication re Whooping Cough and Mumps. It is undoubtedly possible for the infective matter of these diseases to be carried in clothing, but I should not consider it necessary to exclude children from school who reside in houses where such diseases exist, such cases however should be registered and carefully watched, they should be sent home on the first symptom of illness without waiting for anything special to develop. Symptoms of Infectious Disease.—I think some of these descriptions might be improved. One of the earliest symptoms of Smallpox is great pain in the back and sickness, these symptoms frequently disappear when the rash comes out on the third day of the fever, the patient then thinks he is getting better and sometimes attempts to go out and follow his usual avocation. I would say nothing about rash in Typhus and Typhoid Fevers as this is a late symptom in both these diseases; frequently the only symptoms a non-professional observer would notice in Typhoid would be lassitude and some heat of skin. It would be a good plan to provide every Head Teacher with a clinical thermometer, he could be taught how to use ?t in five minutes by a medical man; any child shewing a temperature of 100° Far. should be sent home at once, and directed to apply for medical advice. Over-pressure.—I have not much experience in this, but I believe he symptoms classed under this head are more often due to defective home sanitation than to over-work. I have had several cases of Meningitis in which excessive home lessons might have caused the symptoms to appear somewhat earlier than they ordinarily would lave done, but in each case the child was predisposed to disease. I have the honor to be, Sir, Yours obediently, H. Croad, Esq. GEORGE PADDOCK BATE. The subject was discussed by the Members of the Society of Medical Officers of Health, and the following letter was sent to Mr. Croad:— Society of Medical Officers of Health, Scottish Corporation Hall, Crane Court, Fleet Street, E.C. April, 1886. Sir, The Society of Medical Officers of Health have had under consideration a letter addressed to their Metropolitan members by our Board, asking for information concerning certain infectious 30 diseases, viz , Mumps and Whooping Cough, and as to the Board's regulations generally in respect to other infectious diseases. In view of the importance of the subject, the Society have deemed it desirable to offer a collective reply to the letter; and we are instructed to submit the following observations : The Society are of opinion that a child, if suffering itself from Mumps, should be excluded from school; but it is not necessary to prohibit the attendance of a healthy child coming only from an infected house. Again, in the case of Whooping Cough, if a child itself is suffering from this disease, it ought certainly to be excluded; but having regard to the fact that the danger from the disease is not so great at school-attending ages, the Society would not prohibit the attendance of healthy children coming from infected families. The Society, while believing that an elementary knowledge of the symptoms of infectious disease may be of use in enabling school teachers to exclude children having marked signs of such disease, think that no regulations can be trusted to replace medical inspection of children, and therefore desire to express no opinion as to the sufficiency of those regulations adopted by the Board for this purpose. The Society regret to find that Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health generally have not received notification of cases of infectious disease from teachers and visitors, as the regulations of the School Board appear to require. We are, Sir, Your obedient servants, SHIELEY F. MUEPHY, Hon. C. E. SAUNDEES, M.D., Secs. G. H. Croad, Esq., B.A., Clerk to the London School Board. MEASLES. (Decennial average, 83.0). This disease was very prevalent and fatal. The deaths referred to it were 163, double the decennial average, and four times as many as in the preceding year. One hundred and fifty-eight were young children. DIARRHœA. (Decennial average, 109.2). Diarrhœal diseases caused 84 deaths, one of which was attributed to Cholera, and two others to Choleraic Diarrhoea. Seventy-two of the deaths were amongst young children, 57 of whom were infants. 31 An outbreak of Cholera occurred in Spain at the end of May. It extended to southern France and Italy, where it destroyed numbers of lives. In view of the extension of the disease to this country, a conference was held in July between the Medical Officer to the Local Government Board and the Metropolitan Medical Officers of Health in order to concert preventive measures. It will doubtless be remembered that a similar conference was held in 1883 when Cholera prevailed in Egypt, and threatened to extend to this country. At the conference in July, Dr. Dudfield, the President of the Society of Medioal Officers of Health, took the chair, and made a lucid statement of the present state of preparation in which the Metropolis was. The Medical Officer to the Local Government Board (Dr. George Buchanan, F.R.S.) explained that his object in desiring to have the advice of the Medical Officers of Health was to avoid fuss and panic. He stated the views and practice of the department. No confidence was reposed in quarantine, but much in the practice of medical inspection through the officers of the several Port Sanitary Authorities. The duties of those authorities were defined by the Board's Order of 1883. A vessel coming from an infected country was required to anchor where ordered until inspected. If found healthy the passengers were allowed to go free. If any on board were sick they were detained, the healthy being allowed to depart, their several destinations being recorded, and the vessel was disinfected. The Board had been looking to the defences of the principal Ports, by inspections made in 1883-4. The survey was now completed, and all arrangements settled, including plans for the provision of hospital accommodation. The Board's Inspectors had looked closely to the condition of the several towns, and to see how the local authorities were doing their work. At some of the Ports the arrangements were very satisfactory, the authorities being careful and thoughtful in their preparations. At others there were shortcomings. The Inspectors had striven to rouse less careful authorities. A principal danger to be guarded against was the importation of Cholera in rags, and so it had been 32 arranged that rags should not be imported without proper precautions against possible mischief. With reference to hospital provision for London, the Asylums Board could only act, as had been stated, as a first line of defence. The two thousand beds they were said to be able to provide would be very useful, but it was important to inquire as to the convenience of the proposed hospitals in point of nearness to those who would be likely to require hospital treatment. The Vestries and District Boards would form the second line of defence, and this would be the more important should Cholera come. The Vestries would have to provide places of refuge for the healthy when the sick were too ill to be removed. With this branch of work, probably the most important, as being the best way of dealing with Cholera, the Asylums Board would have nothing to do, nor with the provision of disinfectants, medicines, &c. He concluded by inviting suggestions as to arrangements it was desirable for the Board to make, and as to any arrangements with reference to which it was desirable that the Board should make communication to the Sanitary Authorities. In September a communication was received from the Asylums Board informing the Vestry of the extent of hospital accommodation which, in the event of the Local Government Board issuing an order under the Diseases Prevention Act of 1855, will be provided in the Metropolis for persons suffering from Cholera. The Managers, by the offers of Boards of Guardians, and the Governors of Hospitals, &c., anticipate being able to provide about 1800 beds for Cholera patients, but up to the present time, notwithstanding the endeavours of the managers, little or no accommodation is forthcoming in certain large districts where it might be required. Should, therefore, no further accommodation be secured, and the disease break out in those particular districts, it will be the duty of the Sanitary Authorities to provide accommodation for, and to treat the sick in hospitals, or to provide houses of refuge for the healthy, and to undertake the care, nursing and treatment of the sick in their own homes, since it is considered to be prejudicial to the recovery of a patient to remove the case to a hospital at any considerable distance. 33 Tho duty of providing hospital accommodation for Cholera patients being divided, as above explained, between the Managers and the Sanitary Authorities generally, it is necessary that the Sanitary Authorities should understand exactly where their action in the event of an outbreak must begin, and for the Managers and the Sanitary Authorities to act in harmony, so that no unnecessary delays may occur. They make the following recommendations :— 1. That the Managers do agree to utilize (as far as possible) their own hospitals, ambulances, and staff, and arrange with other institutions for the reception of cases of Cholera, the responsibility of removing patients devolving upon the Managers and not upon such institutions. 2. That, subject to the Local Government Board so desiring, the Vestries and District Boards (being the Sanitary Authorities of the Metropolis) be informed what provision the Managers will be able to make for the treatment of Cholera patients, and also that the Managers are not able to extend such accommodation unless they (the Sanitary Authorities) are themselves able within a limited period to point out where buildings or plots of land could be obtained for the purpose, and that the duty of providing hospital accommodation for Cholera patients, in the event of the accommodation provided by the Managers being insufficient or becoming exhausted, will devolve upon them. In compliance with Mr. Jebb's request, I forwarded to the Board a list of sites or vacant plots of ground in this Parish where I thought it would be possible to erect temporary hospitals. These sites were examined by the officers of the Board, but the only one considered suitable was the site of the Peel Grove Burial Ground, and upon this spot it was considered that, if required, an hospital to accommodate twenty patients might be erected. Local Government Board, Whitehall, S.W., 29th July, 1885. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to state that having regard to the serious and continued prevalence of Cholera in 34 Spain, they deem it desirable to bring under the attention of the Sanitary Authority the Memorandum of the Board's Medical Officer, on the precautions to be taken against the infection of Cholera, of which copies were forwarded to the Sanitary Authority in July of last year. The Board direct me to enclose a reprint of that Memorandum, and to urge upon the Sanitary Authority the importance of their taking such measures of precaution as the sanitary condition of their district may demand. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, HUGH OWEN, Secretary. To the Clerk to the Sanitary Authority. PRECAUTIONS AGAINST THE INFECTION OF CHOLERA. 1. The Order of the Local Government Board, of July 12, 1883, now in force, gives certain special powers to the Sanitary Authorities of the sea coast, enabling them to deal with any cases of Cholera brought into port, so as to prevent as far as possible the spread of the disease into the country. But as cases of Choleraic infection have widely different degrees of severity, it is possible that some such cases slightly affected, will, notwithstanding the vigilance of local Authorities, be landed without particular notice in English sea-board towns, whence they may advance to other, and perhaps inland, places. 2. Former experience of Cholera in England justifies a belief that the presence of imported cases of the disease at various spots in the country will not be capable of causing much injury to the population, if the places receiving the infection have had the advantage of proper sanitary administration; and, in order that all local populations may make their self-defence as effective as they can, it will be well for them to have regard to the present state of knowledge concerning the mode in which epidemics of Cholera (at least in this country) are produced. 3. Cholera in England shows itself so little contagious, in the sense in which small-pox and scarlatina are commonly called contagious, that, if reasonable care be taken where it is present, there is almost no risk that the disease will spread to persons who nurse and otherwise closely attend upon the sick. But Cholera has a certain peculiar infectiveness of its own, which, where local conditions assist, can operate with terrible force, and at considerable distances from the sick. It is characteristic of Cholera (and as much so of the slight cases where diarrhoea is the only symptom as of the disease in its more developed 35 and alarming forms) that all matters which the patient discharges from his stomach and bowels are, or can become, infective. Probably, under ordinary circumstances, the patient has no power of infecting other persons except by means of these discharges; nor any power of infecting even by them except in so far as particles of them are enabled to taint the food, water, or air, which people consume. Thus, when a case of Cholera is imported into any place, the disease is not likely to spread, unless in proportion as it finds, locally open to it, certain facilities for spreading by indirect infection, 4. In order rightly to appreciate what these facilities must be, the following considerations have to be borne in mind:—First, that any Choleraic discharge, cast without previous thorough disinfection into any cesspool or drain, or other depository or conduit of filth, has a faculty of infecting the excremental matters with which it there mingles, and probably, more or less, the effluvia which those matters evolve; secondly, that the infective power of Choleraic discharges attaches to whatever bedding, clothing, towels and like things, have been imbued with them, and renders these things, if not thoroughly disinfected, as capable of spreading the disease in places to which they are sent (for washing or other purposes) as, in like circumstances, the patient himself would be; thirdly, that if, by leakage or soakage from cesspools or drains, or through reckless casting out of slops and washwater, any taint (however small) of the infective material gets access to wells or other sources of drinking water, it imparts to enormous volumes of water the power of propagating the disease. When due regard is had to these possibilities of indirect infection, there will be no difficulty in understanding that even a single case of Cholera, perhaps of the slightest degree, and perhaps quite unsuspected in its neighbourhood, may, if local circumstances co-operate, exert a terribly infective power on considerable masses of population. 5. The dangers which have to be guarded against as favouring the spread of Cholera infection are particularly two. First and above all, there is the danger of water-supplies which are in any (even the slightest) degree tainted by house refuse or other like kinds of filth, as where there is outflow, leakage or filtration, from sewers, house-drains, privies, cesspools, foul ditches, or the like, into springs, streams, wells, or reservoirs from which the supply of water is drawn, or into the soil in which the wells are situate; a danger which may exist on a small scale (but, perhaps, often repeated in the same district) at the pump or dip-well of a private house, or, on a large or even vast scale, in the source of public water-works. And secondly, there is the danger of breathing air which is foul with effluvia from the same sorts of impurity. 36 6. Information as to the high degree in which those two dangers affect the public health in ordinary times, and as to the special importance which attaches to them at times when any diarrhoeal infection is likely to be introduced, has now for so many years been before the public, that the improved systems of refuse-removal and water supply by which those dangers are permanently obviated for large populations, and also the minor structural improvements by which separate households are secured against them, ought long ago to have come into universal use. So far, however, as this wiser course has not been adopted in any Sanitary District, security must, as far as practicable, be sought in measures of a temporary and palliative kind. (a.) Immediate and searching examination of sources of water supply should be made in all cases where the source is in any degree open to the suspicion of impurity; and the water both from private and public sources should be examined. Where pollution is discovered, everything practicable should be done to prevent the pollution from continuing, or, if this object cannot be obtained, to prevent the water from being drunk. Cisterns should be cleaned, and any connexions of waste-pipes with drains should be severed. (b.) Simultaneously, there should be immediate thorough removal of every sort of house refuse and other filth which has accumulated in neglected places; future accumulations of the same sort should be prevented; attention should be given to all defects of house-drains and sinks through which offensive smells are let into houses; thorough washing and lime-washing of uncleanly premises, especially of such as are densely occupied, should be practised again and again. 7. It may fairly be believed that, in considerable parts of the country, conditions favourable to the spread of Cholera are now less abundant than at any former time ; and in this connexion, the gratifying fact deserves to be recorded that during recent years enteric fever, the disease which in its methods of extension bears the nearest resemblance to Cholera, has continuously and notably declined in England. But it is certain that in many places such conditions are present as would, if Cholera were introduced, assist in the spread of that disease. It is to be hoped that in all these cases, the local sanitary authorities will at once do everything that can be done to put their districts into a wholesome state. Measures of cleanliness, taken beforehand, are of far more importance for the protection of a district against Cholera than removal or disinfection of filth after disease has actually made its appearance. 8. It is important for the public very distinctly to remember that pains taken and costs incurred for the purposes to which this 37 randum refers cannot in any event bo regarded as wasted. The local conditions which would enable Cholera, if imported, to spread its infection in this country, are conditions which, day by day, in the absence of Cholera, create and spread other diseases; diseases which, as being never absent from the country, are, in the long run, far more destructive than Cholera ; and the sanitary improvements which would justify a sense of security against any apprehended importation of Cholera, would, to their extent, though Cholera should never re-appear in England, give amply remunerative results in the prevention of those other diseases. GEORGE BUCHANAN, Medical Officer of the Board. Local Government Board, July 21st, 1885. DIETIC DISEASES. ALCOHOLISM. Thirteen deaths were recorded under this head. In two the immediate cause of the death was Delirium Tremens. Most of these cases were the subject of enquiry by the Coroner. In the following cases the fatal termination of the disease was in the opinion of either the Coroner's jury or of the medical attendant, accelerated by intemperate habits:— Sex. Age. Cause of Death. Female 45 Sudden failure of heart. Male 67 Pneumonia. Female 65 Chronic Dyspepsia. Female 48 Chronic Bronchitis and Heart Disease. Male 42 Failure of heart. Female 34 Failure of heart. Male 75 Apoplexy. Female 75 Effusion on brain. Female 49 Failure of heart and fall in street whilst drunk. Male 52 Pneumonia. Female 53 Phthisis. Male 66 Congestion of brain. Male 32 Delirium Tremens. Male 36 Delirium Tremens. 38 PRIVATION. Five infants died from want of breast milk; and tho following wore the subject of Coroner's inquests:— Sex. Age. Cause of Death. Male 73 Want of proper food and nourishment. Female 57 Pneumonia, accelerated by want and destitution. Male 34 Disease of lungs, accelerated by want of proper nourishment. Infant 5 weeks Pneumonia and exposure. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASE. Under this head 523 deaths were roturned; of these Cancer caused 71. The chief organs affected wore Uterus, 15; Stomach, 13—six males, six females; Liver, 9—five females, four males; Tongue, 7—two females, five males; Neck, 6—all males except one; Breast, 3—all females; Rectum, 3—two females, one male. Nino others were simply returned as Cancer, six of whom were females and three males, and one each as Cancer of Bladder, (Esophagus, Ovary, and Abdomon. TUBERCULAR DISEASE. The total number of deaths from diseases grouped under this head was 515, of which Phthisis caused 282, about ten per cent. of the total deaths from all causes; in eight the immediate cause of death was stated to bo Hœmorrhago from the Lungs. The deaths from the tubercular group formed thirteen per cent. of the mortality from all causes, and corresponded to a rate of 2.9 per thousand population. 39 DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASE. Sixty-three infants died because they were prematurely born; seven others could not live as their lungs never properly expanded; and twelve were so deformed as to incapacitate them from living. Six of these had deformed hearts, five deformed spines, one had a hare lip and cleft palate, another a contracted throat, and the remaining one an imperforate rectum. One hundred and seven old people died from natural decay. DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. Under this head 331 deaths were returned, more than eleven per cent. of the total deaths—a mortality rate of two-and-a-half per thousand population. Inflammatory diseases of the brain oaused 71 deaths; and 120 persons died from chronic brain affections such as softening and paralysis. One hundred and fourteen children died from convulsions, 86 of these were infants. The convulsive diseases of infants, which in addition to those just mentioned include Hydrocephalus and Dentition, caused 151 deaths, a mortality of 29.27 calculated on the births, or twenty per cent. of the total infantile deaths from all causes. See table IV. RESPIRATORY ORGANS. The deaths from this group of diseases, exclusive of Phthisis, were 627, twenty-two per cent. of the total mortality, and corresponded to a rate of 4.8 per thousand population. This is a high mortality, and considerably above that of the previous year. Table H separates this mortality into quarters, and shews the age, distribution, and also the mean temperature and rainfall, conditions which exert considerable influence upon the mortality from chest diseases. 40 TABLE H.

Eighteen women died either in childbed or from some disease resulting from the act of parturition. Six of these were cases of Puerperal Fever and four of Hœmorrhage; Peritonitis and Convulsions caused two each ; shock in one case and Pelvic Cellulitis in another, both after the performance of the operation of craniotomy on account of contracted pelvis, caused death; the remainder were certified simply as childbirth. WASTING DISEASES OF INFANTS. This group, which includes atrophy and debility, want of breast milk, and premature birth, caused 188 deaths, a proportion of twenty-five per cent. of the total infantile mortality, giving a rate of 36.4 per thousand births. 41 INQUESTS. The Coroner held 209 inquests, 7.3 per cent., or one in thirteenand-a-half of the total deaths. This is slightly above the general Metropolitan rate, which was seven per cent. The violent deaths numbered 94, three-and-a-quarter per cent. of the total mortality. Eighty-two were from accident or negligence, and twelve were suicides. Of these latter five men hanged themselves, one woman jumped out of window and fractured her skull, and two men and one woman took poison, one of these took cyanide of potassium, another carbolic acid, and the third "poison." Thirty-nine children were suffocated, and two adults died from this cause, one was an old man, 75 years of age, who was suffocated through the neglect of his wife, the cause of death in the other case was spasm of the glottis, consequent on the bite of a cat. One death was returned as from Hydrophobia. Much alarm was felt all over London during the year from the numerous deaths from this disease. This result led to energetic measures on the part of the police in regard to stray dogs. The deaths ascribed to Hydrophobia in the year were 27, much over the average, and more numerous than in any previous year. The nearest approach having been in 1877, when 16 deaths were registered from this cause. UNCERTIFIED DEATHS. Eighteen deaths were uncertified ; nearly all of these were those of infants who died a few hours after birth, either from convulsions or from deficient vitality. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. The number of persons who died in Hospital in Bethnal Grreen was 534; of these 365 died in the workhouse (212 males and 153 females); 99 in the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, Victoria Park (61 males and 38 females); 54 in Bethnall House Lunatic Asylum (28 males and 26 females); and 16 in the Mildmay Mission Hospital (9 males and 7 females). 42 BETHNAL GREEN INFIRMARY.

The Washington Lyon Steam Disinfecting Apparatus has now been at work for more than twelve months, and so far as we can judge we have every reason to be satisfied with its performance. At first we had some little difficulty, and some bedding was spoiled by the condensed water from the steam; but since the machine has been properly covered with non-conducting material, and we have gained more experience in its working, there has been no further trouble. The pattern of machine we have, with a door at each end, is worked with a minimum of labour, and I do not think will be much improved upon. My opinion, expressed in previous reports, as to the value of high pressure steam as a means of disinfection, remains unchanged. Mr. John W. Lyon informs me that machines similar to ours have been fixed at St. James's, Westminster, Deptford, Plumstead, Hampstead, and also for the Admiralty at the Royal Hospital School, Greenwich. SLAUGHTER HOUSES, BAKEHOUSES, AND COWSHEDS. All these have been kept under careful supervision, and call for no special remark. It was not necessary to oppose the renewal of any licence at the sessions in November. A complete list of the existing licences will be found in the appendix. Some new regulations have been issued by the Metropolitan Board of Works under section 34 of the Contagious Diseases (Animals') Act. They came into operation in August. The provisions are somewhat more stringent than those of the old Order, especially with respect to prevention of the spreading of infectious disease by the agency of milk. The Board has supplied this Vestry with a list of registered premises, and has arranged to give notice to your Medical Officer of Health of any outbreak of infectious disease upon the premises of a purveyor of milk. The following are the regulations referred to:— 46 Metropolitan Board of Works. 41 and 42 Vict., CH. 74. REGULATIONS AS TO DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS. In pursuance of Section 34 of the 41 and 42 Vict., Ch. 74, the following Order in Council was made on the 15th June, 1885:— THE DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS ORDER OF 1885. At the Council Chamber, Whitehall, the 15th day of June, 1885. By Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council. PRESENT: Lord President. | Mb. Trevelyan. The Lords and others of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, by virtue and in exercise of the powers in them vested under The Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, and of every other power enabling them in this behalf, do order, and it is hereby ordered, as follows: Short Title. 1. This Order may be cited as the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order of 1885. Extent. 2. This Order oxtends to England and Wales and Scotland only. Commencement. 3. This Order shall commence and take effect from and immediately after the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and eighty-five. 47 Interpretation. 4. In this Order— The Act of 1878 means The Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878. Other terms have the same meaning as in the Act of 1878. Revocation of former Order. 5. The Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Order of July, 1879, is hereby revoked: Provided that nothing in this Order shall be deemed to revive any Order of Council thereby revoked, or to invalidate or make unlawful anything done before the commencement of this Order, or interfere with the institution or prosecution of any proceeding in respect of any offence committed against, or any penalty incurred under, the said Order hereby revoked. Registration of Dairymen and others. 6.—(1.) It shall not be lawful for any person to carry on in the District of any Local Authority the trade of cowkeeper, dairyman, or purveyor of milk unless he is registered as such therein in accordance with this Article. (2.) Every Local Authority shall keep a Register of persons from time to time carrying on in their District the trade of cowkeepers, dairymen, or purveyors of milk, and shall from time to time revise and correct the Register. (3.) The Local Authority shall register every such person, but the fact of such registration shall not be deemed to authorise such person to occupy as a dairy or cowshed any particular building, or in any way preclude any proceedings being taken against such person for non-compliance with or infringement of any of the provisions of this Order or any Eegulation made thereunder. (4.) The Local Authority shall from time to time give public notice by advertisement in a newspaper circulating in their District, and, if they think fit, by placards, hand-bills, or otherwise, of registration being required, and of the mode of registration. (5.) A person who carries on the trade of cowkeeper or dairyman for the purpose only of making and selling butter or cheese or both, and who does not carry on the trade of purveyor of milk, shall not, for the purposes of registration, be deemed to be a person carrying on the trade of cowkeeper or dairyman, and need not be registered. 48 (6.) A person who sells milk of his own cows in small quantities to his workmen or neighbours, for their accommodation, shall not, for the purposes of registration, be deemed, by reason only of such selling, to be a person carrying on the trade of cowkeeper, dairyman, or purveyor of milk, and need not, by reason thereof, be registered. Construction and Water Supply of New Dairies and Cowsheds. 7.—(1.)

By Order, J. E. WAKEFIELD, Clerk of the Board. Dated this Third day of July, 1885, at the Office of the Metropolitan Board of Works, Spring Gardens, Charing Cross. NOTE.—Sections 60 and 61 of the 41st and 42nd Victoria, Ch. 74, provide that any person who does anything in contravention of an Order in Council or of a Regulation of a Local Authority is guilty of an offence against the Act, and is liable to a Penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. 63 OFFENSIVE TRADES. Report on Messrs. Link's Catgut Factory, Weaver Street. The Sanitary Committee having visited the premises in the occupation of Messrs. Link, in Weaver Street, presented the following report to the Vestry:— There are in Weaver Street two factories, one in the occupation of Mr. J. D. Link, and the other of Mr. G. Link. The buildings in which the operations of scraping and preparing the gut are carried on are not modern, and without re-building it would be impossible to make them as perfect as could be done with modern appliances. The third bye-law of the Metropolitan Board of Works for regulating the conduct of this business, made under the 37th and 38th Vic., c. 67, requires that every gut scraper shall cause his business to be so carried on, and shall in all other respects cause such precautions to be taken as may be necessary to prevent the emission of any offensive smell into the external atmosphere from any part of the premises where such business may be carried on. For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this bye-law, the process of scraping the gut is performed in, what is called, a close chamber. The air from this chamber is drawn through a furnace and burnt; the inlets for fresh air are protected by valves opening inwards, and the windows and doors are supposed to fit air-tight. Upon examination the Committee find that the doors fit very badly, permitting the escape of a good deal of noxious effluvium into the external atmosphere, and that the inlet valves are hung so imperfectly and close so badly as to offer very little impediment to the efflux of air. By the twelfth bye-law, every floor upon which any process of the business is carried on in any part of the premises is required to be properly covered with a layer of concrete or other suitable jointless impervious material. Upon examination the Committee find that the floors of both factories are laid with York flagging 64 with open joints, thus favouring the collection of offensive matters. By the same bye-law, all drain openings are required to be covered with a fixed grating, the bars of which shall not be more than three-eighths of an inch apart. The Committee find this rule to be obeyed in every instance; but Mr. Hughes, a member of the Committee, considers this not to be sufficient, and advises that a second grating, the bars of which shall be one-eighth of an inch apart, should be placed about six inches below the top grating so as to intercept anything passing through the larger openings. Another plan proposed is to leave all drain openings as at present, but to lead the pipes to an intercepting chamber having an opening near the top leading to the sewer and protected by fine gauze. In this chamber all offensive matters would subside, and could be periodically removed, the clear portion only flowing away through the openings protected by the gauze. The Committee are of opinion that if these alterations in the drainage are carried out, the floors of the factories covered with concrete or asphalte, and the doors and air valves made tight and efficient, and kept so, a great mitigation of the nuisance will result. They accordingly recommend that Messrs. Link be required to carry out these requirements to the satisfaction of the Surveyor and Medical Officer. This was done and the work is in hand. PUBLIC MORTUARY. This building has been thoroughly cleansed, repaired, and painted. The ventilation of the post-mortem room has been much improved by the insertion in the outer walls of four of Hayward's vertical inlet tubes, and now leaves little to be desired. The failure of the old ventilating arrangements was due to the small size and faulty position of the air inlets, which were placed at the floor level, where they caused great inconvenience from draught without doing much good. The number of bodies temporarily placed in the mortuary chambers was eighty-seven. 65 DUSTING. For the better collection and removal of dust and house refuse, the Parish has been divided into three districts, each of which has been further subdivided into six blocks. Each district is the subject of a separate contract; and one block in each has to be cleared daily in rotation in accordance with a printed list and block plan, copies of which are supplied to the contractors. The dustmen are thus restrained from wandering all over the Parish at irregular intervals as heretofore, and the whole of the district is gone over at least once a week in accordance with the terms of the contract. Great credit is due to Mr. Lapworth for the manner in which he has worked out this scheme, and for the carefully prepared street lists and plans, copies of which, together with his reports, were placed in the hands of each Member of the Vestry. The use of galvanized iron pails is being gradually extended over the whole of the Parish, and is a great improvement upon the old evil-smelling and constantly overflowing dust-bins. FOOD ANALYSIS. The reports of Mr. Stokes, the Public Analyst, shew that the Yestry is not idle in the direction indicated. A good deal of the Inspectors' time has been absorbed in the procuring and forwarding of samples, and in the necessary attendance at the police court when legal action against adulterators has been taken. SANITARY PROCEEDINGS. Table VI. gives some details of the Sanitary work performed during the year. Now that we have a proper set of books, and efficient clerical assistance in the office, I hope to be able in future reports to give more detailed statistics. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, GEORGE PADDOCK BATE. e 66 Bethnal Green Sanitary District. TABLE I.

SCAVENGING- AND WATERING ROADS. Tenders for the execution of the work, from 10th August 1885, to 10th August, 1886, were advertised for, and opened at the meeting held on 2nd July, when the consideration of them was adjourned to the following morning. At the adjourned meeting the tenders and the whole subject of the execution of Scavenging work was referred to a special Committee of 16 members. The Committee reported at a special meeting of the Vestry, held on 13th July, that after making enquiries and full consideration they had obtained fresh tenders, and recommended that the Tender of Mr. Henry Potter for District No. 1 at £1690 „ „ „ No. 2 at 1840 „ Mr. W. Porter „ No. 3 at 1680 be accepted. The recommendation of the Committee was adopted. The total for the three Districts was £910 more than the price paid for the three Districts for the previous year. The Sanitary Committee in February reported that the collection of dust by the pail system having proved successful, they deemed it advisable to extend the system, and recommended the purchase of 3000 pails more, making 8000 pails. The recommendation was adopted and the order given for the additional pails. 17 DISINFECTOR. The purchase (mentioned in the last Report) was made and the Disinfector erected in Digby Street Yard. The cost has been as follows:— Disinfector, Trucks, &c. £363 0 0 Fittings 19 14 0 Shed and Gates 49 15 0 £432 9 0 Happily, since the purchase of the Disinfector, no infectious disease has extensively prevailed in the Parish, so that the utility and advantage of the Disinfector have not become fully manifest. COMPOSITION RATE. The appeal to the House of Lords against the judgment of the Lords Justices confirming the award, by the Queen's Bench Division, of a peremptory mandamus commanding the Churchwardens to make a rate sufficient for all the purposes specified in the Composition Rate Act, was heard on the 8th and 9th June before Lords Blackburn, Bramwell and Fitzgerald. Judgment was delivered on the 14th July and the appeal dismissed with costs. See Judgment, page 38. A copy of the account rendered by Mr. Churchwarden Baugh will be found at page 36. A rate at a half-penny in the pound for the then current year was agreed to on the 17th December, and has since been duly signed and sealed by the Vestry. THAMES COMMUNICATION. At the request of the Thames Crossings Committee, Messrs. Abbott, Pickard, Thurgood, Wright & Loveday were authorised "to continue their services in the matter of Thames Communication B 18 below London Bridge, with a view of removing the objections raised by the Metropolitan Board of Works to the construction of the Shadwell Subway, as recommended by the Engineer of that Board." The Vestry petitioned the House of Commons, and afterwards the House of Lords, in favour of the Bill brought in by the Corporation of the City, authorising the Corporation to construct a Bridge across the Thames, from near Irongate Stairs on the North, to or near Hartley's Wharf on the South. The Bill passed, but with power to the Thames Conservancy Board to require the Bridge to be kept open for a time before and after high tide. Even with the existence of such a power it was considered the Bridge will be a great convenience to the Eastern part of London. The Yestry passed a resolution expressing its warm appreciation of the great and successful efforts made by the Corporation to procure for the East of London additional means of communication across the Thames. LIGHTING. The Yestry have by arrangement with the Great Eastern Railway Company erected an additional lamp in Grove Passage, the cost of lighting which is to be paid by the Railway Company. The Commercial Gas Company gave notice that as from April, 1886, they should reduce the price of gas to 2s. 6d. per 1000 feet, and that the charges for public lamps in this Parish would accordingly be reduced from £3 16s. Od. to £3 12s. 6d. per lamp per annum. The other particulars with respect to lighting are given by the Surveyor's Report. LOAN. A further sum of £6000 has been borrowed of the Metropolitan Board of Works to defray the cost of Carriageway Paving. The rate of interest is £3 10s. per cent., and the principal is to be repaid by twenty equal annual instalments. 19 REGENT'S CANAL DOCK AND RAILWAY BILL. The Vestry petitioned Parliament in favour of the Bill which proposed to authorise within certain limits the payment of interest on Capital during the progress of the Works. Until lately Parliament has disapproved of and prohibited interest being paid out of Capital, but is now disposed to relax what has heretofore been regarded as a necessary restriction in the interest of the Shareholders and of the Public. In this case and in some others Parliament has given power to pay interest on Capital during the period allowed for construction and before income is earned. FOURNIER'S CHARITY. The fourteen candidates who were elected and received the gift were: Mr. Thomas Bell, 2, Roman road. Mr. James William Boddy, 63, Cheshire street. Mr. Richard Child, 115, Gosset street. Mr. Andrew William Clark, 20, The Oval. Mr. Thomas Robert Davey, 49, White street. Mr. James John Johnson, 227, Bethnal Green road. Mr. Robert Jones, 16, Mape street. Mr. Charles Wallace King, 73, Wellington row. Mrs. Mary Lane, 53, Gosset street. Mrs. Susannah Nicholls, 7, Brierly street. Mrs. Matilda Peaston, Parmiter street. Mrs. Rebecca Sanders, 14, Thomas street, Brick lane. Mr. Thomas Stracey, 23, Chilton street. Mrs. Susan Hadley Wheeler, 4, Nelson street. LEVERINGTON CHARITY. Ail the recipients of last year were found to be alive and qualified, except William Griffin and Samuel Bolton, who had died. The surviving 38 recipients of last year were elected recipients for this year, and the two vacancies were supplied by the election of Elizabeth, the widow of the late William Griffin, and by the re-election of Susan J ones, who, last year, was erroneously supposed to have left the Parish. 20 FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. The Quarterly Reports of the Public Analyst for the year ended Lady-day, 1886, will be found on page 27. TREASURERS. In May, 1885, Mr. Beven, who had been a member of the Vestry since its creation, retired, and the vacancy thereby occasioned in the office of Treasurer was supplied by the election of Mr. Joseph Jacobs to be one of the five Treasurers. WATERLOO ROAD. (Reg. v. Little). As Messrs. Little, the owners of the Saw Mills in the road, continued to stack timber on the road, it became necessary to proceed against them by indictment. The indictment was tried at the Middlesex Sessions on the 29th of May and 5th June, and a verdict found for the Crown, and the defendants were fined. USE OF VESTRY HALL. The subject of letting the Hall was referred to the Finance Committee, who in September reported and recommended as follows:— That there should be a uniform charge of £1 Is. for the use of the Hall, to be paid to the Yestry before the Hall is used. That the allowance to be made for removing furniture, cleaning and any other work incident to the use of the Hall when let shall be settled in each separate case by the Finance Committee. The applications for the use of the Hall shall be made in writing and submitted to the Yestry at its next meeting, but in case of emergency the Finance Committee shall consider and determine as to granting any applications and the terms on which it shall be granted. The Members of the Yestry, the Yestry Clerk and the other Officers to have a right of entry at all |times. That the person who applies for the Hall shall be responsible for and shall make good any damage done to the building or furniture, and if thought desirable by the Vestry or the Committee (as the case 21 may be) shall before the use of the Hall be granted make such deposit as may be required to secure the making good of any damage. The deposit to be returned after deducting the cost (if any) of repairing any damage. The Report of the Committee was adopted. REGULATIONS UNDER, SEC. 35 OF SANITARY ACT, 1866. In consequence of further letters from the Local Government Board it was in June referred to a Committee of the Whole Vestry to consider as to making any and what Regulations under Sec. 35 of the Sanitary Act, 1866. The Committee reported that after considering the communications from the Looal Government Board, urging that Regulations under the 35th Sec. of the Sanitary Amendment Act, 1866, and the Sanitary Amendment Act, 1874 should be made; and having before them the suggestions for Regulations issued by the Local Government Board, and the two drafts of proposed Regulations prepared in 1884 by the Sanitary Committee in pursuance of a reference made to them, that in the opinion of the Committee it is not advisable or desirable that the Yestry should frame and adopt Regulations under the 35th Sec. of the Sanitary Act, 1866, and the Sanitary Amendment Act, 1874, and that the Committee do recommend accordingly. The recommendation was adopted unanimously. SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENT OF CAMBRIDGE ROAD. A plan was prepared shewing two proposed widenings of Cambridge Road, between the Green and Palestine Place, and by Darling Row. An effort was made to induce the Metropolitan Board of Works to undertake to make the widenings as a Metropolitan Improvement at the same time as suggested widenings of the same road in Hackney. The Metropolitan Board decided they were not then in a position to undertake further Improvements, and could not therefore accede to either of the applications by the Hackney District Board and the Yestry. 22 PROPOSED NEW TOWN HALL. In pursuance of the reference made to thorn (see page 32 of the last Report) the Works Committee reported that they were of opinion the cost of acquiring the vacant ground in front of Paradise Row, of erecting a Hall with Council Chamber and offices, of furniture and fittings, with architect's fees and sundries, could after giving credit for sums to bo derived from letting and the value of the present Vestry Hall, bo defrayed by less than a half-penny rate. The Vestry then resolved that a New Town Hall should bo provided. A Special Committee of eighteen members, consisting of six from the Finance, Works, and Sanitary Committees, respectively, was appointed, to which it was referred to proceed with the arrangement for purchasing the ground, to go into the calculation as to cost, the amount to be borrowed, probable income, and generally into the subject of providing the New Hall. Messrs. Abbott, Pitt, Bishop & Dyer were subsequently added to the Committee. Provisional agreements have been entered into with the owners of the houses who might consider their property prejudicially affected by the erection of the proposed building. VALUATION LIST. Subject to the appeal by the East London Water Works Company to the Board of Assessment Sessions, the Valuation List for the five years, from April, 1885, made the gross value £489,450. Rateable value £398,907. The increase of rateable value in the new list over that of 1880 is £41,028. The increase of rateable value in the new list over the list of 1880 as altered by the four annual supplemental lists is £17,810. The Committee, under the advice of Messrs. Castle & Son, fixed the assessments of the Water Company at gross £6840, rateable £5700. The provious assessment was at gross £5568, rateable £4640. 23 The Company claimed to be assessed at gross £4507, rateable £3380. SANITARY DEPARTMENT. Mr. W. W. Burrows having announced his desire to resign the office of Sanitary Inspector, it was arranged he should do so at Christmas. It was thought desirable on account of the impaired health of Mr. Burrows the elder that he should not continue to be a Sanitary Inspector. He ceased to hold office as from Christmas, and was awarded £50 under the provisions of the 29th Vic., cap. 31. !The subject of arrangements in the Sanitary Office for the future occupied much time and attention. Finally it was decided there should be two Inspectors of Nuisances, each having charge of a distinct District, and that a lad should be appointed at a salary of 15s. a week, to attend at the Sanitary Office to keep books and give assistance in writing and correspondence. Advertisements for Candidates were issued. On the 21st January, Mr. Benjamin Samuel Weston was elected a Sanitary Inspector and Inspector of Nuisances at a salary of £120. Mr. Frederick William Meadway was appointed Clerk in the Sanitary Department at a weekly salary of 15s. HAMPSTEAD HEATH. The subject of purchasing further ground for the extension of the Heath and the preservation of Parliament Hill has been before the Vestry more than once. The opinion of the Vestry as to the "Hampstead Heath Enlargement Bill" was asked by the Home Secretary. The letter from the Home Office and letters from the Vestries of Hampstead and St. Pancras, suggesting that the Metropolitan Board of Works should make the proposed purchase or obtain compulsory powers to do so, were referred to the Parliamentary Committee. The view of the Committee, which was unanimously adopted by the Vestry, was that there was no reason 24 why exceptional facilities should be provided for enlarging Hampstead Heath, which is already secured as an open space, in preference to providing open spaces for other parts of the Metropolis, from which Hampstead Heath is practically inaccessible to the many who have but a few hours at a time available for recreation. STALLS, &c., IN STREETS. A Special Committee has been appointed to consider and report as to the best mode of dealing with street obstruction and making regulations with regard to costermongers. The real costermonger with a barrow is unobjectionable, but the practice of erecting on the foot or carriageway what practically are shops has so extended as to become a serious evil. EAST LONDON WATER WORKS COMPANY BILL. The Bill contained provisions as to stop cocks and other matters prejudicial to the interest of the Parish. After communicating with other East End Parishes the Vestry decided to oppose the Bill when in Committee. The Boards of Works of Poplar, Hackney, and West Ham are also opposing the Bill. STOP COCKS IN STREETS. The special case stated between the East London Water Works Company and the Vestry as to the right of the Company to make and maintain openings in the footways over stop cocks on service pipes was argued before Justices Smith and Matthew, who decided in favour of the Company. The Vestry have thought it advisable to appeal to the Lords Justices. IMPROVED ENTRANCE TO GREEN STREET. In view of the proposed widening by the Metropolitan Board of Works of the western part of Green Street, it appeared desirable to set back the railings of St. John's Church and the fence of the Vicarage garden, so as to form up to Cambridge Road a continuation of the intended new line of street as laid out by the 25 politan Board, and thus bring the end of the street more nearly opposite Bethnal Green Road. A plan showing the proposed alteration has been prepared and submitted to the Vicar and the Bishop of London, who have approved and assented to the proposed alteration. The estimated cost of the improvement was £1,642. The subject was brought before the Metropolitan Board of Works by Mr. Ewin, and that Board have agreed to contribute towards effecting the improvement one half of the estimated cost. RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING, SEWER WORK, AND ROAD WORK. Particulars as to the work done in carrying out orders of the Metropolitan Board of Works for Re-naming Streets and Renumbering Houses, also of Sewers and Road Works are given in the Surveyor's Report. CHURCH YARDS. The church yard of St. Bartholomew was in 1885 laid out by the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association, and opened as a recreation ground. Another application has been made by the Chairman of the Association, Lord Brabazon, that the Vestry should take the ground to maintain it as a recreation ground. The Vestry declined the proposal, feeling they would not be justified in incurring the perpetual cost that accepting the proposal would entail. SPECIAL CARRIAGEWAY PAYING. The cost of the work in Bethnal Green Road, Fournier Street, Cross Street, Jacobs Street, and Brick Lane, towards defraying which the sum of £6,000 was borrowed of the Metropolitan Board of Works, amounted to £6,103 13s. 8d. leaving, after crediting £10 19s. 11d. interest allowed by the bank, £92 13s. 9d. to be defrayed out of the General Rate. 26 MISCELLANEOUS. An offer was made by the Metropolitan Public Gardens, &c. Association to entertain applications for free labour "to be utilized s in providing gardens or play grounds for the free use of the public. or the planting of trees throughout the thoroughfares of youi Parish."It did not appear to the Vestry that the offer could bed advantageously accepted. A suggestion was made on behalf of the owners that the Vestry should take the disused Victoria Park Cemetery, in Green Street, subject to a perpetual rent charge of £21 per annum, and a rent of £22 10s. per annum up to Lady-day, 1912, for the purpose of converting it into and maintaining it as a pleasure or recreation ground. The subject was referred to a Committee, who, after visiting the ground, considered it was not desirable to accept the offer. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk, 21 Analyst’s Reports. Analytical Laboratory, Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, W., August, 1885. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Chairman and Gentlemen,—A total of 26 samples of food has been submitted to me for analysis, by your Inspectors during the past quarter. All the articles were samples of Milk, of these no less than 16, that is 61 per cent., were adulterated either by the abstraction of cream or by the addition of from 8 to 40 per cent. of water. Where the added water did not exceed 8 per cent., the vendors were only cautioned to be more careful in future; in the other cases legal proceedings were taken. In one case where cream had been abstracted the vendor denied the fact, though he gave evidence stating that his own Analyst had reported the sample to be skimmed. The Magistrate hereupon sent a duplicate sample to Somerset House, the three chemists there stated that half the cream had been abstracted. The defendant produced a scientific witness to give evidence that he had known cows to give poorer milk than this sample. Although no less than five Analysts were agreed as to the abstraction of cream, the Magistrate dismissed the case on the evidence of this one witness, allowing however no costs to the defendant. In another case a Street Milk Seller gave the Inspector a false name and address, hence it was impossible to find and serve a summons upon him. The percentage of adulterated samples still continues very high, the fraudulent vendors doubtless thinking that this enquiry into the quality of their goods is but temporary and may soon cease. Continued vigilance may however lead them to see that the Sanitary Committee is in earnest in its effort to secure to the parish a supply of pure and wholesome food. The sum of £32 for fines has already been ordered to be paid into the Yestry's account. One case of adulteration stands adjourned for future hearing. I forward herewith a tabulated statement of the result of each analysis. I have the honour, Gentlemen, to be Your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES. Public Analyst. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Chairman and Gentlemen,—Now that the various prosecutions for adulteration during the quarter ending September 29th are finished, I am able to present to you my Quarterly Report. There has been submitted to me for analysis a total of 27 samples of food. Of these, 16 were samples of Milk, and 11 were samples of Butter. No less than II of the Milk samples were adulterated by the addition of from 7 up to 40 per cent. of water. Prosecutions were undertaken against 9 of the vendors of these adulterated milks, and fines ranging from £2 to £5 were imposed. In 2 cases in which the watering was but slight no proceedings were taken. If these are fair specimens of the milk supplied to the parish it is exceedingly unsatisfactory to find that upwards of 73 per cent. of the milk samples are adulterated, and that on an average with 24 per cent. of added water. The chances of obtaining a pure sample seem to be very small. In the case of the Butter samples, 4 out of the 11 contained beef-fat, in two of them there was no butter present at all. The vendors of these adulterated samples were summoned, and in three cases convictions were obtained. In the fourth case the defendant declared that the purchaser asked for Butterine, on this exceedingly unlikely, as well as false plea, the vendor got off. A case of adulterated Milk No. 1/31 which was not concluded in the previous quarter was finished in this, the vendor being fined £3 and costs. A total of £36 10s. for fines has been paid into the Vestry's account during the quarter. Appending a tabulated account of each separate analysis, I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, Public Analyst.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, Chairman and Gentlemen,—During the quarter ending December ith, 1885, only 8 samples of food were submitted to me by your ispectors. Six of these were samples of Butter, and 2 were Milk samples. Not one of the butters was made from milk, but they all nsisted of beef-fat, with a little salt, curds and water, and were relored by annatto to resemble the real article. As samples of utterine they were well made, pure and wholesome, but they were Id at a comparatively high price as butter. The vendors were osecuted and fines in all cases were imposed. Of the 2 samples of Milk 1 contained 25 per cent. of added water, e other was genuine. Proceedings are now being taken against the mdor of the adulterated sample. The sum of £8 10s. for fines has meen paid into the Vestry's account during the quarter. A summary of the year's work may be perhaps of interest. During the year 1885, I have analysed for the Vestry 100 samples food, consisting of 65 samples of Milk, and 35 samples of Butter. these 41 samples of Milk were adulterated, and 21 samples of utter, that is 62 per cent. of these samples of food had been tampered ith. This percentage is exceedingly high and shews that much reams to be done to diminish this wholesale adulteration. A good deal harm to the health as well as to the pocket must result from this lpoverishment of the food supply. In one case a milk had been >prived of all its cream and then diluted with 40 per cent. of water. rosecutions were undertaken in 52 cases, and were almost always iccessfully conducted, the fines paid into the Vestry's account amountg to £175. 32 It is to be regretted that there is no Board of Analysts appointed b; law to which disputed cases may be referred. The Chemists o Somerset House do not occupy this position; Magistrates do not take their opinion as final unless it happens to be for the defendant. A cases in which this Vestry was concerned during this year may illustrate that fact. A man was summoned on my certificate for selling skimmed milk, his evidence he admitted that his own Analyst also said it was skimmed On the Magistrate referring to Somerset House the three Chemists therered also agreed as to the skimming. So that five Analysts stated that the sample had been skimmed. The vendor then produced a sixth Chemist to state that it was not skimmed. Hereupon the case was dismissed. Such a state of affairs would not be possible were there a Board of Appeal whose decisions were final. I owe the heartiest thanks to the members of the Sanitary Committee, and to their Inspectors for the zealous way they have worked to stem, if possible, the strong current of adulteration. Appending a tabulated account of the samples examined last quarter, I have the honour to be Your obedient servant, ALF. W. STOKES, Public Analyst.

A total of 23 samples of food, all of them Butters, has been examination Of these 9 were adulterated, only 2 of which contained any buttei-t all, the others consisting entirely of beef-fat, a little curd, water, s. and some annatto to give the requisite color. They were wholese and good articles of food, not however possessing the same delici taste as good butter. Considering that dripping can be purchased at fi 4d. to 8d. per pound and that these samples were sold at from 1 to Is. 4d., it is clear that a great profit was made by passing them as pure butter. The vendors in all cases were prosecuted, and fii imposed varying in amounts from 10s. to £5. A total of £16 10s. has been paid into the Vestry's account during the quarter as fines for adulterated samples. This includes a fine: a sample of adulterated Milk, the prosecution not having been conclud during the previous quarter. Appending a tabulated report of each of the samples analyzed, I remain Your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, Public Anal Articles submitted for Analysis. State whether the sample was submitted to the Analyst by an Officer acting under the direction of a Local Authority, under Section 13 of Act, and if so, the name of such Authority.

VESTRY OF ST. MATTHEW, BETHNAL GREEN, Appellants, and PERKINS AND OTHERS, Respondents. Budgment. LORD BLACKBURN.—My Lords,—This is an appeal against an Order of the Court of Appeal, affirming a Rule of the Queen's Bench Division that a peremptory Mandamus should issue. There are some allegations on the part of the Defendants, apparently not disputed as to the state of facts, which immediately preceded the passing of the 8th and 9th Victoria, chapter 180. It was argued that the rule of the Queen's Bench Division was at all events erroneous, as the Mandamus ought to have been in such a form as to permit a return to be made ; but those facts, so far as they are relevant, are only as to aiding the Court in construing that Statute, and are not such as could have been made the subject of a return. The question is one depending on the construction of several Acts. That which it is convenient to consider first is the Compulsory Church Rate Abolition Act, 1868, 31 and 32 Victoria, chapter 109. The Legislature thought it expedient to put an end to the power to compel payment of Church Rates which are defined to be rates for any of the purposes to which, by common or ecclesiastical law, a Church Rate is applicable. By section 2 it provides for cases "where, in pursuance of any general or local Act, any rate may be made or levied which is applicable partly to ecclesiastical and partly to other purposes," which I thiuk it Avas truly said shows that it was not intended by the Legislature that the mere fact that a Church Rate was the creature of a local statute should take it out of the general powers of the Act. 39 But section 5 of the Act is as follows : " This Act shall not affect any enactment in any private or local Act of Parliament, under the authority of which Church Rates may be made or levied iu lieu of, or in consideration of, the extinguishment, or of the appropriation to any other purpose of any tithes, customary payments, or other property, or charge upon property, which tithes, payments, property, or charge, previously to the passing of such Act, had been appropriated by law to ecclesiastical purposes, as defined by this Act, or in consideration of the abolition of tithes in any place or upon any contract made, or for good or valuable consideration given ; and every such enactment shall continue in force in the same manner as if this Act had not passed." I think this shows that the Legislature thought that there might be rates wholly or partly for ecclesiastical purposes created by private or local Acta of Parliament, under such circumstances that it might be unfair to abolish them, at least except on terms. And as it seems to me the intention of the Legislature was that whenever an enactment in a private or local Act, authorising the levying of Church Rates, came within the categories which are enumerated in that section, it was not to be affected by this Act; but if those enactments are to be affected, it is to be so by legislation, which would give an opportunity for imposing such terms as were just. The enactments in 8 and 9 Victoria, chapter 180, are those under which the Composition Rate is for the first time authorised to be levied, and are, I think, enactments in a local Act under the authority of which that rate may be levied. And as that rate is in express terms to be inter alia for "making up any deficiency in the rates and duties for maintaining Divine Worship in the said Church of St. Matthew, and for repairing and keeping in repair the said Church and the Churchyard belonging to the same," they are, I think, enactments under the authority of which a Church Rate may be levied. The question, therefore, I think, is this: Are they such enactments as to bring the case within that class of enactments which the Legislature intended by 31 and 32 Victoria, chapter 109, section 5, to exempt from the operation of that Act ? The judges below have all thought that they were, and I think that if this case came before me without any authority I should probably have come to the same conclusion. I certainly cannot now say that they are wrong. I would wish that the Legislature had more clearly and distinctly expressed what were the class of local enactments that they intended to exempt from the operation of the 31 and 32 Victoria, chapter 109 ; more particularly I would wish that it had more clearly been explained what was intended by the last clause— " Upon any contract made or for good or valuable consideration given." I shall not, however, attempt to do what the legislature have not done, and to put in different words a more clear definition. I agree with Lord Justice Cotton that the true construction of the 8th and 9th Victoria, chapter 180, was to authorise the levying of the Composition Rate in part, in lieu of the garden pennies which were abolished by that Act. I have not myself any doubt so far. 40 By the 16th George II., Chapter 28, Section 36, the garden pennies are given to the Churchwardens to be applied " for the maintenance and support of the Rector, and such other uses as are hereby directed; and the surplus (if any) shall be applied to such other parochial uses as the Vestry of the said new intended Parish shall from time to time direct." I have great difficulty in making out what—on the true construction of that Act—were "the other uses directed." But, on the whole, I agree with Lord Justice Cotton, that, as there are directions in the Act that the new Parish shall keep up the Church and Churchyard, and various other Ecclesiastical purposes (which must cost money), and no provision as to how these are to be paid, the construction of that Act should be that the garden pennies are to be applied to paying the Rector, and to these Ecclesiastical purposes; and that only the surplus (if any) after these have been paid is at the disposal of the Vestry. If that be held, I think the garden pennies were property appropriated by law to the payment of the Rector, and to Ecclesiastical purposes, as defined by the 31 and 32 Victoria, Chapter 109, and I cannot think it material that the produce of the garden pennies was not sufficient to meet the Rector's salary. The Legislature did not—when passing the 16th, George II., Chapter 28—know whether the produce of these garden pennies would be more or less than that salary, and I cannot agree that the word "appropriated" means exclusively appropriated. On this ground, without deciding more, I think that the Order appealed against should be affirmed, and the appeal dismissed with costs, and I move accordingly. LORD BRAMWELL.—My Lords, I am of the same opinion, and for the same reasons I just wish to add one matter shortly. It seems to me that in this case there was a giving up and handing over to the new Parish of a portion of (I do not know what the right technical expression is) the emoluments or property of the Rector of Stepney, or the Stepney Rectory or Vicarage, whichever it was—Rectory I think it was—a portion of those emoluments was given to this new Parish upon the consideration of their doing that which this Mandamus seeks to compel them to do. It seems to me that comes within the words in the Compulsory Church Rate Abolition Act, " upon any Contract made, or for good or valuable consideration given," and that upon that ground, without more, the judgment of the Court below is right. LORD FITZGERALD.—My Lords, this is a case in which the decision cannot go beyond the case before us. The enactments which we have had to examine are of that complicated and unsatisfactory character that, speaking for myself, I could not say that a decision either way on the point before us would be incorrect. The Appellants have failed to convince me that the decision of the Court of Appeal was wrong, and therefore, upon that ground, I am obliged to concur in your Lordships' judgment. Order appealed from affirmed and Appeal dismissed with costs. ST. Matthew, Bethnal Green. SURVEYOR'S REPORT of WORKS EXECUTED t From Lady-day, 1885, to Lady-day, 1886. london: forsaith brothers, printers, 329, bethnal green road. 1886. Survenar's Vestry Hall, Church Row, Bethnal Green, August, 1886. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Gentlemen, I beg to lay before you my report on the various works carried out under the supervision of my department during the year ending Lady-day last. ROADS AND PAVING, &c. Bethnal Green road. The condition of the Carriageway of Bethnal Green road, between White street and the Post Office, having been several times brought before the notice of the Vestry, it was resolved, on the recommendation of the Works Committee, to repave the road with 3-in. x 7-in. Guernsey pitchings on 9 inches of conorete. The road was closed for a period of six weeks, and the work completed. The crossings contiguous were repaved with the old pitchings redressed. The oost of the whole work being £4,468 18s. Od. Brick lane. The old pitching removed from Bethnal Green road was redressed, and 1528 yards used in repaving the Carriageway of Brick lane, between Virginia road and Peter street, at a cost of £574 12s. 3s. 4 Fournier street, Jacobs street, Cross street. The Carriageways of Fournier street, Jacobs street, and Cross street were paved with 4-inch and 5-inch town-made pitchings on 6 inches of concrete, at a cost of £1,060. Sundry works. The smaller works executed during the year are included in the following list:— £ s. d. Club row (footway) 41 11 7 Buxton street and George street (carriageway) 204 0 7 Boundary street (footway) 90 15 1 Bethnal Green road (footway) 160 4 4 Grove passage (footway) 68 4 11 Grove road by Old Ford road (carriageway) 298 10 0 Satchwell street and Satchwell rents (carriageway) 407 18 7 Weaver street and Fleet street hill (carriageway) 217 2 7 Victoria street and Cooper's gardens (footway) 215 3 3 Dixie street (footway) 220 14 11 Camden street (carriageway) 85 5 8 Old Bethnal Green road (footway) 17 2 11 Twig Folly Bridge (footway) 18 8 2 Blythe street (footway and carriageway ) 193 13 8 Punderson gardens (footway and carriageway) 160 6 2 Trenches. The amounts charged to Gas and Water Companies for repairs to Trenches opened during the year are :— £ s. d. Gas Light and Coke Co. 389 16 7 Commercial Gas Co. 30 10 0 East London Water Co. 327 19 10 Total £748 6 5 5 Macadam roads. The following Roads have been Channelled with dressed Pitchings from stock, made up with Macadam, and Steam-rolled, the work being carried out by the Vestry workmen, viz.:— Andrews road Moss street (part) Baxendale street Quilter street Bandon road Ramsey street Bellhaven street St. James' road Burnside street St. Jude street Butler street Sowardstone road Bonwell street Scott street Cordova road Seabright street Durant street Tuscan street Elwin street Victoria street Florida street Wharf road Hamilton road Waterloo road Knottisford street Wimbolt street Being a total length of 21/3 miles. The following Roads have also been made up with Macadam, and Steam-rolled:— Abbey street Medway road Ada place Queen street Hassard street Temple street And small Repairs have been carried out on nearly all the other Macadam Roads in the Parish. For the purpose of these Works the following quantities of Broken Granite have been used:— Supplied by Contractor 285 cubic yards. „ Guardians 179 „ ,, Tramways Co... 1073 „ Broken by Contract at Digby Street Yard 382 „ Broken by men from the Workhouse at Digby Street Yard 957 „ Total 2,876 6 Eighty-six yards cube of old York Paving was also broken up in the yard and used in concrete. New streets : Mansford street On November 5th, an estimate and apportionment was presented to the Vestry for paving and making up this street, and the demands were served upon the owners of the houses and land on November 9th. The collection is proceeding and the works are in progress. Arbcry road. Numerous complaints having been made by residents in this road with respect to its condition, it was resolved on 18th February to put in force the powers relating to new streets. An estimate and apportionment amounting to the sum of £611 12s. 6d. having been adopted by the Vestry, the collection of the amounts is proceeding and the works are in progress. Labour account. During the year the sum of £4,161 14s. 4d. has been paid by my department under the head of Labour Account. The following analysis of the account may be of interest:— £ s. d. Foreman (Mr. Stone) 130 0 0 Storekeeper (Mr. Rutty) 80 8 9 Yardmen 150 2 4 Paviors 183 9 5 Masons 172 6 1 Sewer men 517 3 6 Bricklayer 10 11 6 Carmen 127 12 9 Road men and Labourers 973 7 0 Stone breakers 173 17 2 Scavengers 1215 2 2 Watchmen 75 18 6 Sanitary Department, including men who work disinfecting apparatus and superintend the pail system of dust removal 351 15 2 Total £4,161 14 4 7 Snow. The snow storm commencing at about 7 o'clock on the morning of Wednesday, January 6th, will long be remembered, as much as nine inches of snow falling in about five hours. The subsequent alternations of thaw and frost increased the difficulty of dealing with it. Ninety additional men were employed for some days, and 9 tons of salt were used on the main roads. The whole of the main roads were kept clear, and the traffic carried on without interruption. In order to give an approximate idea of the difficulty of removal of the snow (except at enormous expense), it is calculated that as much as 4,000 cubic yards (after compression) would have had to have been carted from Bethnal Green road alone. This, allowing two cubic yards to a cart-load, would be equal to 2,000 cart-loads, and it would require 100 horses and carts for two days to remove it,. allowing 10 loads per cart per day. There is also the immense difficulty of disposing of it when it is loaded into the carts. It cannot be carted to the Thames as is done in the City, and it is to be borne in mind that the slippery condition of the roads after a fall of snow, succeeded by a sharp frost, not merely makes it difficult and somewhat dangerous to carry on the ordinary traffic, but is an equal obstruction and hindrance to the carts and horses employed in the removal of the snow. The judicious use of salt on paved roads only, the heaping of the snow at the sides of the roads, clearing the channels and carting the snow from the narrow parts of main roads seems to be the only solution of the difficulty at a reasonable expense. Large quantities of snow were carted to Hereford street and Usk street and melted by steam from the 8 steam road roller. The process was very successful, and I am inclined to think that if put in operation immediately the snow is heaped, it will prove a cheap and efficient means of disposing of it. If this is so the clearing of the main roads upon these occasions will be much facilitated. Street watering. The quantity of water used for street watering was 9,794,000 gallons, and the cost, including meter rent, £387 4s. 10d. Bedford row, Mane street. After considerable negotiation, the owner of the property at Bedford row paved this court with Victoria stone and 4-inch pitchings at his own expense. Improvements. Improvements by widening have been effected at Punderson gardens and Hollybush gardens, the owners of the property giving up to the public an area of 200 superficial yards of land upon the condition that the Vestry properly pave the same. A further improvement was also effected at the northern end of Hollybush gardens (by setting back a projecting fence) on payment of the sum of £10 as compensation. A give and take line at Felix street and Clare street, which will form an improvement by straightening the lines of footway, has been arranged with the Governors of Parmiter's Charity. A communication having been received from the School Board for London with respect to the extension of the New Castle street Board School, the desirability of widening the passage leading from Jacobs street to New Castle street was brought before the Vestry. The School Board offered to sell to the Vestry the land necessary for the widening for the sum of £526, but after some negotiation agreed to give the land subject 9 to the condition that the Vestry properly pave the same. Plans for the improvement by widening of Cambridge road were prepared and submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works with the application that that Board would undertake the widening of the road as a Metropolitan Improvement. Plans were also prepared for the widening of Green street by St. John's Church in extension of the improvement about to be carried out by the Metropolitan Board of Works. The plans have been approved by the Vicar of St. John's, and also by the Bishop of London; and an application is now before the Metropolitan Board of Works for a contribution of a moiety of the sum of £1,650, the estimated cost of the work. Fire alarm posts. Fire alarm posts have been fixed by the Metropolitan Board of Works at the following places, viz.:— Hackney road by Cambridge Heath Station Hassard street by Columbia road Cambridge road by St. John's Church Approach road by Bonner road Grove road by Roman road. Old iron. The old iron at the depot at Digby street was sold, realising the sum of £9 9s. 0d. Tramways. The condition of the tramways running through the Parish has been a matter requiring considerable attention. That in Cambridge road has been entirely reconstructed, the old wooden sleepers and worn-out iron rails being removed, solid steel girder rails substituted, and the paving redressed and relaid. The work, which occupied a period of six months, was substantially carried out. 10 Small repairs have been done on the Hackney road and Grove road routes to keep them in order until the Company can reconstruct them as was done in Cambridge road. Steam Roller. The steam road roller was let to Mr. Rutty, of Bow, for a period of eight weeks for the purpose of rolling the Victoria Embankment, and the amount paid to the Vestry for the use of the same was £64. Horses and carts. An additional horse, cart, and harness, has been purchased, to commence work on March 11th. Water van. On August the 5th, a water van was purchased of Messrs. Glover & Sons, of Warwick, at a cost of £43. It is used for the purpose of disinfecting the gullies, &c., in hot weather, and to supply water on roads under repair by the steam road roller. SEWERS. Flushing, &c. The disinfection of the gullies with Jeye's Purifier was carried out during the hot, dry weather, as also the general flushing of the pipe sewers, courts, alleys, &c. The sum of £32 2s. Od. was paid for the water used for this purpose. House drainage. Connections were made with the sewers for the purpose of draining 120 houses, and the amount paid to the Vestry for constructing the outlets of these drains, and for releasing choked drains, was £256 13s. 10d. Cooper's gardens. A length of 210 feet of 12-inch pipe sewer was laid in Cooper's gardens, connecting with the sewer in Gascoyne place, at a cost of £35 5s. 9d.; Mr. W. Porter being the contractor. 11 Pollard row and Old Bethnal Green road. The construction by the Metropolitan Board of Works of the sewer referred to in my last report, has been in progress during the whole of the year. The sewer, so iar as regards Bethnal Green, consists of a 5-feet by 4-feet egg-shaped sewer, and passes through Pollard row, St. Peter street, Hackney road, to and along Great Cambridge street. In Hackney road the new sewer was to have passed under the old sewer, but in consequence of the treacherous nature of the ground it became necessary to do away with the old sewer and connect the house drains with the new one. Considerable inconvenience was caused to the inhabitants and the public generally by the stoppage of the traffic for some weeks for this purpose. Buxton street. The stoppage of the sewer in Buxton street, between George street and Brick lane, called attention to its over-charged condition. In order to relieve this, a short length of 12-inch pipe sewer was laid between George street and the Parish boundary, to connect with the sewer in Whitechapel district. Sea bright street, Hackney road The work referred to in last year's report has been executed by contract, Mr. H. Potter being the contractor. The old sewer was broken up, and a new 15-inch pipe sewer, 420-feet in length, constructed. The cost, including the connection of the drains previously connected with the old brick sewer, being £114 6s. 3s. Plans of Sewers. Plans, shewing the sewers in the Parish, are being prepared, and a map of the Parish, to a large scale, is now being lithographed, and copies will shortly be sent to all the members of the Vestry. 12 Ventilation of Sewers. A lengthy and exhaustive report was received from the Metropolitan Board of Works, and considered by the Works Committee. Many of the suggestions made by the Metropolitan Board were already carried out in the Parish, such as the construction of flushing ehafts, the flushing of the surfaces of courts, &c., during the Summer months. Ventilating shafts, consisting of iron pipes fixed to the buildings and carried up to above the level of the roofs, are strongly advocated by the Surveyors of some Parishes, but the evidence obtained by the Metropolitan Board of Works shews that as a consequence of the difficulty of obtaining the consent of the owners of houses, only about 450 such shafts have been fixed through out the area under the control of the Metropolitan Board of works. Urinals. The cost of the water supply to the public urinals, including meter rent, was £88 5s. 6d. RE-NAMING STREETS AND RE-NUMBERING HOUSES. The following Streets have been re-named, all subsidiary names abolished, and the houses re-numbered :— York street Now Ebor street South street and Ann street ,, Florida street East street ,, Lyte street Gawber street & Grosvenor street ,, Gawber street Gloucester street ,, Parmiter street Pedley street and Fleet street ,, Pedley street Pollard street and Bennet's place ,, Pollard street Royston street & Wellington place ,, Royston street 13 The subsidiary Names in the following Streets have been abolished, and the houses re-numbered :— Bethnal Green road Stainsbury street (part of) Satchwell rents Hart's lane Weaver street Hartley street Lark row Wharncliffe street In all 713 houses have been re-numbered. Notices are served upon the occupiers of each house and a register is kept at the Office showing the old and new numbers; 51 new street name plates have been fixed at a cost of £9 9s. 6d. LIGHTING. Additional lamps have been fixed and put in lighting as follows :— Albert road 1 Oakley street 1 Burnside street 1 Providence place 1 Bedford place 1 Pritchard's road 1 Bethnal Green road 1 Rapley place 1 Braemar street 1 Squirries street 1 Cyprus street 1 Satchwell rents 1 Dixie street 1 Satchwell street 1 Derbyshire street 1 Sclater street 1 Globe road 2 Strahan road 1 Hereford street 1 Scott street 1 Marian street 1 Treadway street 1 Mape street 1 Temple street 1 Moss street 1 Usk street 1 NewTyssen street 1 Vivian road 1 14 The total number of Lamps is as follows :— Gas-Light and Coke Co. 887 5 feet Lamps. „ ,, 4 3-light Sugg's Lamps. „ „ 3 2-light ditto Commercial Gas Co. 78 5 feet Lamps. „ ,, 2 3-light Sugg's Lamps. And the amounts paid for lighting, including cleaning and repairing lamps, meter rents, &c., were for street lighting by the Gas - Light and Coke Company £3,013 15s. 0d. For gas consumed and meter rents at Vestry Hall, Mortuary, Digby street yard and the clock at St. John's Church, £78 5s. 4d. The sum of £334 17s. 0d. was also paid to the Commercial Gas Co. for street lighting. The cost of lighting the following lamps (not included in the above totals) is paid by the Great Eastern Railway Co.

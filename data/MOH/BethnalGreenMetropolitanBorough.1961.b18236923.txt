June, 1962. To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen , I have the honour to submit my report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for the year 1961. During the year the Council decided to speed up its smokeless zone programme. Originally it was intended to make the whole Borough a smokeless zone by 1965, now this has been shortened by two years and we shall complete the programme by the end of 1963. Smoke is not only a nuisance but there is more and more evidence to show that smoke is a danger to health and it is quite proper for the local authorities to do their utmost to clean the air in their areas. Cigarette smoking is still more dangerous. I wrote about this in my last Annual Report and because I consider it so important I mention it again this year. Smoking is a major cause of bronchitis and lung cancer and is a contributory factor in coronary heart disease and other serious ailments. In this Annual Report in the table giving the causes of death you will find the number of deaths from lung cancer 29 males and 3 females up to the age of 75 bronchitis 23 ,, ,, 6 ,, ,, ,, ,, ,, coronary heartdisease 32 ,, ,, 17 ,, ,, The marked preponderance of male deaths, as compared with female deaths, due to lung cancer and bronchitis points to an association between these diseases and smoking because men smoke more heavily than women. When you examine the deaths from other causes you find an even distribution between men and women, e.g. all other malignant growths 28 males and 28 females up to the age of 75 - 5 - Why do we connect these deaths with smoking? A number of investigations are being carried out at present which started many years ago. For example, I am included in a survey of many thousands of doctors which commenced in 1951. At the very beginning every doctor stated whether he was a smoker or not and how many cigarettes he smoked or whether he smoked cigars or a pipe. At present from the number of deaths which already have taken place the investigators find that a doctor aged 35 and over has a 15 per cent chance of dying before reaching the age of 65 if he is a non-smoker. This is bad enough , but a doctor who decides to smoke 25 or more cigarettes a day will step up his chances of dying before the age of 65 to 33 per cent. Is it really Worth it? What is the cause of lung cancer amongst cigarette smokers? We are unable to give a complete answer. This may be given in a few years time or indeed it may remain a secret for over, but that is no reason for ignoring the danger. A hundred years ago Dr. John Snow found when investigating an outbreak of cholera in the City that nearly all those who died had drunk water from the Broad Street Pump Well but he was not able to say what was in the water which caused the disease. The discovery of the cholera germ through improved bacteriological technique had to wait many years but it would have been very shortsighted not to have acted on the evidence available at the time. In fact the handle of the Pump was removed and the local outbreak of cholera was brought to an end. I am pleased to have this opportunity of thanking Councillor Mr. J.D. Sivill, Chairman of the Public Health Committee , and the Members of the Committee for their help and encouragement during the year. I would also like to thank the other Chief Officers of the Council and their staffs for their assistance and my particular thanks are due to my own staff for their loyal assistance and efficient support at all times. I have the honour to be , Your obedient Servant, S.A. BOYD, Medical Officer of Health - 6 - SECTION A STATISTICS OF THE AREA Area 760 acres Population , estimated mid-year 46 ,490 Number of Dwellings 15 ,057 Rateable Value £744,415 General Rate 21s. 8d. Sum represented by a penny rate £2 ,929 VITAL STATISTICS Live Births Number 816 Rate per 1 ,000 population 17.5 Illegitimate Live Births (per cent of total live births) 8.9 Stillbirths: Number 19 Rate per 1 ,000 total live and stillbirths 0.4 Total live and stillbirths 17.9 Infant Deaths (deaths under 1 year) 16 Infant Mortality Rates: Total infant deaths per 1,000 total live births 19.6 Legitimate infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births 21.5 Illegitimate infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births 27.4 Neo-natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 4 weeks per 1 ,000 total live births) 17.1 Early Neo-natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 total live births) 15.9 Perinatal Mortality Rate (stillbirth and deaths under 1 week combined per 1 ,000 total live and stillbirths) 38.3 Maternal Mortality (including abortion) Number of deaths Nil Rate per 1 ,000 total live and stillbirths — Death Rate per 1 ,000 estimated population 12.1 During 1961 the Registrar General estimated the population as 46,490 which is 1 ,090 less than in the previous year. The death rate was 12.1 per 1 ,000 persons as compared with a rate of 11.3 for 1960. Both births and deaths depend to some extent on the proportions - 7 - of young and old people and of males and females in the area , and in order to make comparisons between one area an,d another the Registrar General gives Area Comparability Factors which take into account these variations in age and sex. Using this factor the adjusted death rate for Bethnal Green would be 11.4. The birth rate during 1961 was 17.5 as compared with 17.3 during the previous year. The adjusted rate for comparison-with other areas is 16.8. The infant mortality rate was 19.6 which is, in Bethnal Green, however. calculated on a very small number of infant deaths and is consequently subject to large variations from year to year and as an indication of child care the figure should be used with some caution. The causes of death are shown in Table 1 , which follows: Notification of Births Arrangements continued in operation during the year whereby the London County Council furnished to the Borough Council a weekly return of births (including stillbirths) notified to them as the Local Health Authority under the National Health Service Act, 1946. During the year 837 live births (434 male and 403 female) were notified and in addition there were 17 still birth5(12 male and 5 female). These figures represent corrected totals after the addition of inward transfers and the deduction, of outward transfers and the difference between these figures and those set out previously is due to the fact that births mast be registered within 6 weeks and it is not uncommon for a child to be born and notified in one calendar year but not actually registered until the following year. - 8 - - 9 - CAUSES OF DEATH Causes of Death under 1 year 1 to 4 5 to 14 15 to 24 25 to 44 45 to 64 65 to 74 75 and over Totals All causes M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F M F 7 9 2 1 2 — 3 1 8 10 96 37 85 76 86 142 289 276 1 Tuberculosis, respiratory 1 1 1 1 3 1 2 Tuberculosis, other — — 3 Syphilitic disease 1 1 1 1 4 Diphtheria — — 5 Whooping Cough — — 6 Meningococcal infections — — 7 Acute Poliomyelitis — — 8 Measles 1 1 2 — 9 Other infective and parasitic disease — — 10 Malignant neoplasm, stomach 5 1 2 2 4 3 11 6 11 Malignant neoplasm, lung, bronchus 18 2 11 1 4 1 33 4 12 Malignant neoplasm , breast 4 3 — 7 13 Malignant neoplasm, uterus 2 1 — 3 14 Other malignant and lymphatic neoplasms 1 1 2 12 3 6 10 5 6 25 21 15 Leukaemia, aleukaemia 1 1 1 1 1 16 Diabetes i 1 4 1 1 2 5 17 Vascular lesions of nervous system j 1 9 5 7 14 3 16 20 35 18 Coronary disease, angina 3 2 12 5 17 10 14 22 46 39 19 Hypertension with heart disease 2 1 1 3 3 5 5 20 Other heart disease 1 1 4 4 6 6 29 16 41 21 Other circulatory disease 2 2 1 4 3 8 6 14 22 Influenza 1 3 1 1 4 1 23 Pneumonia 3 2 8 4 11 20 22 27 24 Bronchitis 12 1 11 5 23 10 46 16 25 Other disease of respiratory system 1 1 1 1 3 2 2 26 Ulcer of stomach and duodenum 2 4 1 1 3 7 4 27 Gastritis, enteritis and diarrhoea 1 — 1 28 Nephritis 1 1 1 1 2 29 Hyperplasia of prostate 1 2 3 — 30 Pregnancy, childbirth, abortion — — 31 Congenital malformations 1 2 2 1 4 2 32 Other defined and ill-defined diseases 6 5 1 2 4 4 6 7 2 11 19 29 33 Motor vechicle accidents 1 1 1 2 2 4 3 34 All other accidents 1 1 2 1 1 2 5 4 35 Suicide 36 Homicide and operations of war 1 1 1 — 2 2 — - 10 - SECTION B SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BOROUGH Water Supply Water for domestic purposes in the Borough is obtained in all cases from the Metropolitan W ater Board. Bacteriological and chemical examination of the water is carried out at frequent intervals by the Metropolitan Water Board. Notices were sent to the Board in 42 cases where wastage of water due to defective pipes or fittings was observed. During the year 37 new premises were certified as having a proper and sufficient water supply in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act,1936. In addition to the supply from the Metropolitan Water Board, there are four wells in use in the Borough. These are as follows:- Attached to Council's Public Baths 1 (not used for domestic purposes) Attached to a hospital 1 (used for all purposes) Supplementary supply for industrial purposes 2 (used for refrigeration purposes only) These wells are sampled at regular intervals. Sewerage and Sewage Disposal Arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the Borough are adequate. Sanitary Inspection of the Borough Following the 2 ,008 complaints of insanitary conditions, defects were found requiring the service of Intimation Notices in 934 cases, in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Of these , Statutory Notices were required in 315 instances and legal proceedings were instituted in 22 cases. In addition, 4 notices in accordance with the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955 , one under Section 26 and three under Section 27 , were served. In one case the necessary work was carried out by the Council and the expenses incurred recovered from the owner of the property. In connection with the supervision of drainage works a total of 2 ,287 inspections were made during the year. Thirty three notices in accordance with Section 25 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955 , were served and in nine instances the necessary work was carried out by the Council and the expenses incurred recovered from the owners of the properties. -11 - TABLE 2 RECORD OF VISITS Bakehouses 95 Bakers Shops 64 Butchers 210 Canteens 70 Confectioners 142 Eel & Pie Shops 26 Fish Curers 21 Fried Fish Shops 45 Fruit and Greengrocery 113 Grocers 370 Ice Cream 319 Licensed Premises 179 Milkshops 356 Restaurants 359 Slaughterhouses(Poultry) 10 Street Stalls 421 Miscellaneous Food Premises 139 Infectious Disease 242 Food Poisoning 20 Complaints Investigated 2,008 Aged and/or infirm persons 212 Factories 2,004 Outworkers 55 Housing Enquiries 903 Houses let in Lodgings 70 Drainage Works 2,287 Rent Act 37 Smoke Observations 64 Shops Act 549 Miscellaneous 2,678 Re- inspections 6,076 Total z:. .fx* .

Inspector of Factories of the Ministry of Labour and National Service, in conjunction with the local sanitary Authority. Close co-operation is maintained between the two , and defaults found in the course of visits to factories are notified between one and the other according to the body responsible for remedial measures. The principal duties of the sanitary authority are the enforcement of Sections 1,2,3,4,6 and 7 of the Factories Act, 1937, insofar as non-power factories are concerned, and Section 7only-in respect of power factories. Factories and Workplaces in this Borough carrying on a variety of trades number 1,199 and a total of 1,877 inspections and re-inspections were made during the year. 129 investigations were made in regard to drainage and applications under the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947.

Many of the outworkers employed by Bethnal Green firms are resident in places as wide apart as Bath , Birmingham, Caterham, Glasgow, Hove, Maidstone, Spalding (Lines) and Thingoe (Suffolk). Of the 481 names of outworkers which appeared on the employers lists received in August, 133 were given as residing within the Borough; in addition 129 names of outworkers residing in Bethnal Green were forwarded from other Councils. The following information of classes of work and numbers of outworkers employed thereon , being Bethnal Green residents, is in respect of the August lists, received from employers in the Borough and from other Authorities:- Number of Outworkers in August lists required by Section 110(l)(c) Wearing apparel (making, etc.) 155 Curtains and Furniture hangings 23 Brushes 6 Boxes 71 Buttons, etc., Carding 2 Christmas Crackers, etc. 4 Stuffed Toys 1 262 Section 110. There was no case of default in sending lists to the Council. Section 111. There was no instance of Work being carried on in unwholesome premises. Shops Acts The Borough Council has power to require , in any shop in which persons are employed, suitable and sufficient lighting , washing facilities and facilities for the taking of meals and is responsible for ventilation and temperature of shops and their sanitary conveniences. During the year , 441 visits were made to shops and 28 notices were served in respect of unsatisfactory conditions found to exist. - 18 - Disinfection and Di sinfestation The following is a summary of the routine work carried out by the disinfecting staff during the year:- Number of rooms disinfested 697 Articles of clothing, bedding, etc. submitted to steam disinfection 413 Articles disinfected by formalin 367 Hospital mattresses, pillows, etc. disinfected 7,384 Number of articles destroyed by request 2,056 In addition , on 25 occasions rubbish which had been dumped on open sites, etc., was sprayed with insecticide prior to removal. The furniture and bedding of 145 families being rehoused by the Borough Council were disinfested. Personal Cleansing Station During the year, 52 adults had baths for verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station , simultaneous disinfection of clothing being carried out. In addition , 15 adults and 4 children received treatment for Scabies at the Station. Public Health Inspectors visit and advise in all cases of Scabies and in those cases where verminous conditions persistently recur. During the year the mobile bathing equipment for the cleansing , by consent, of aged persons in their own homes where the persons concerned are so enfeebled as not to be able to attend at the Personal Cleansing Station was used on 201 occasions, as compared with 173 during 1960. This is a complicated and difficult service but one which is most worth while and for which the homebound and often disabled persons concerned are very thankful. Laundry Service for Incontinent Persons The arrangement with Hackney Borough Council for the laundering of articles of bed linen and personal clothing from incontinent persons continued during the year. - 19 - 1,797 articles belonging to 24 persons were collected , laundered and returned. Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 During the year, 346 complaints of infestation by rats or mice were received and in most cases of rat infestation smoke tests of the drainage of the premises affected were carried out by the rodent operatives under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Three notices under section 4 (1) of the Act were served. Systematic baiting and poisoning was carried out by the Rodent Operatives at 386 domestic premises and at 245 business premises, with satisfactory results. In .accordance, with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture , Fisheries and Food, all sewers under the control of the Council were baited twice during the year, involving a total of 1,327 manholes. Positive results were obtained in 561 instances. National Assistance Act, 1948 Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948 , as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951 , provision is made whereby a court of summary jurisdiction may make an order for the removal of ill, infirm or incapacitated persons who are not receiving proper care and attention. During the year under review it was found necessary in one instance to use the powers of the Act:- This case was in respect of a woman aged about 87 years, who was suffering from debility and senile dementia and who was in need of hospital treatment. She refused to enter hospital voluntarily and , in her own interests , there was no alternative but to apply for a removal , order which was granted by the Magistrate. - 20 - During the year 29 other cases of aged persons in need of care and attention were brought to the notice of the Department. It was possible in a number of these to provide necessary care for these old people in their own homes. In other cases the old people were persuaded to enter a hospital or a home. The Old People's Welfare Committee, comprising representatives of the Council and the various local organisations and social settlements, continued to provide all possible assistance to old people in the Borough by the provision of clubs, home visitation, meals-on-wheels service, chiropody service, holidays and outings, etc. Offensive Trades There are two premises in the Borough carrying on offensive trades, one being the business of a fur skin dresser and the other a poultry slaughterhouse. Ten inspections were made in 1961, three notices being served. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act provides for the licensing by the local authority of all premises used for the manufacture and/or storage of filling materials to which the Act applies, and for the registr ation of certain premises where such materials are used in upholstering , stuffing or lining of bedding, toys, baby carriages, etc. There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock or other filling materials are manufactured but 26 premises are registered for the use of such materials in the trades conducted therein. Pet Animals Act, 1951 The operation of this Act is very important in Bethnal Green on account of the well known Sunday morning dog market which has been held in Bethnal Green for many years and which serves both vendors and purchasers throughout the whole of the County of London and even beyond. During the year 11 licences for the sale of pet animals were granted in respect of shops and 51 licences in respect of stalls. No warning letters were sent in connection with various infringements of the Act. Common Lodging Houses There are no Gammon Lodging Houses in the Borough. - 21 - Clean Air Act. 1956 Continuing its policy of making the whole of Bethnal Green into a smokefree area , the Council made a further Smoke Control Order in 1961. It is anticipated that the Minister of Housing and Local Government will confirm this Order and that the date of operation will come in the latter part of 1962. The Council's No.2 Order has been operative since 1st November, 1961. Three hundred and forty six acres of the Borough are now covered by Smoke Control Orders and control over a further 228 acres will be achieved in 1962 by the implementation of Order No.3 Where possible , the Council allow householders a free choice of the type of heating they wish to enjoy in Smokeless Zones and tenants readily submit estimates of the costs involved in converting fireplaces and receive the grants payable on completion of the works. Expenditure in this connection up to the end of 1961 amounted to £1,400. From the original survey of premises to be included in a Smoke Control Order to the final approval of fireplace conversions at the premises it is estimated that an average of three visits per dwelling are necessary. When it is noted that the Council's No.3 Order covers a total of 4,200 premises it will be realized what a vast amount of technical and administrative work is involved in making the Clean Air Act effective. Publicity is essential if the full benefit of pollution-free air is to be achieved and putting "Clean Air" on public view was a major endeavour in 1961. A float was entered in the Borough Carnival, an Exhibition was held in July and talks to Clubs were arranged in conjunction with other interested organisations. The Carnival float depicted the dirt and deterioration in a dwelling house caused by pollution from smoke. The Exhibition lasted for a week and covered all aspects of atmospheric pollution. It ranged from the danger of domestic smoke to the latest form of house-heating , from methods of detecting pollution in the air to means of eliminating it from the atmosphere. Much public interest was shown in the Exhibition and it helped the Council to gain goodwill for the introduction of further Smoke Control Orders. Atmospheric Pollution During the year an expert Working Party of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research reported their conclusions on the continued use of deposit gauges and lead dioxide instruments in the investigation of atmospheric pollution. The view of the Working Party was that the information provided by these instruments was extremely localised in its application and of little general value in the investigation of atmospheric pollution. There were also other drawbacks on their continued use. - 22 - In view of this report the use of these particular instruments which had been maintained by the Department was discontinued. The maintenance of the daily smoke filter and hydrogen peroxide apparatus for measuring sulphur dioxide continued during the year and the results obtained therefrom were communicated to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, who undertakes the co-ordination of the observations made by local authorities and investigates the nature, measurement and prevention of atmospheric pollution. Hairdressers and Barbers Section 18 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1954 , requires the registration of premises and the persons carrying on the business of hairdressers or barbers thereat. At the end of the year, 54 premises were registered and 140 inspections were made to them during the year. Ten notices were served in respect of unsatisfactory conditions. - 23 - SECTION C HOUSING Clearance Areas The demolition of unfit dwellings in clearance areas continued throughout the year. Further discussions took place between the London County Council and the Borough Council to reach agreement on the current five year programme (1961-1965) which provides for a representation of 894 houses. Surveys and inspections of properties and areas were carried out for this purpose, and inspections of properties in the Quinn Square , St. Peter's Avenue and Roman Road (Empire Cinema) Areas were commenced prior to official representation in 1962. Demolition/Closing of Unfit Houses One demolition order was made in accordance with Section 17 of the Housing Act, 1957. Closing of Unfit parts of Building: Eight Closing Orders were made during the year under Section 18 of the Housing Act, 1957 , prohibiting the use for human habitation of the rooms concerned. Conversions and Improvements (Peabody Estate) Extensive alterations and reconstructions are being carried out by the owners of this Estate, consisting of some 150 dwellings, to improve the existing standard of accommodation by the provision of bathrooms, internal water closets , wash basins and ventilated food stores. During the year two blocks of flats were completed and work is progressing on a third. Overcrowding (Housing Act, 1957) Details of overcrowding in the Borough , and of cases where overcrowding was abated , are as follows:- 24 No.of cases On register at end of 1960 169 New cases reported during 1961 2 Total 171 Overcrowding abated during 1961 11 On register at end of 1961 160 Families Equiv. Adults Rehoused by London County Council 4 15½ No longer overcrowded 2 10 Removed without trace 5 24½ Towards the end of the year a survey of overcrowded families in the Borough was commenced. This was still in progress at the end of the year and the result will be reported in 1962. Housing Act. 1957-Section 9 During the year 131 dwellinghouses and flats were inspected and detailed specifications prepared of work required to be carried out to render the dwellings in all respects reasonably fit for human habitation in accordance with Section 9 of the Housing Act, 1957, with a view to enforcing all essential repairs providing this could be done at reasonable cost.

Since the summer these meat discharges have been diverted for the time being to Bishopsgate Goods Station in the Borough of Stepney. Imported Horsemeat During the latter part of the year notification was received from the Medical Officer of Health of the Port and City of London that the majority of the horsemeat imported from the Argentine had been found as a result of sampling to be contaminated with Salmonel organisms. One wholesale firm in the borough imports large quantities of such horsemeat all of which is disposed of to retail pet shops and kennels for animal food only. Under the Meat (Staining and Sterilization) Regulations, 1960, all such meat must be sterilized before release and accordingly arrangements were made for this firm to send consignments of the meat to the Government Atomic Research Station at Harwell for irradiation treatment and subsequent return to the firm's premises for distribution for animal feeding.

Gentlemen, I have the honor to present my report on the vital statistics of Bethnal Green for the year 1893. POPULATION. The population of the parish was estimated in the year 1892 at 127,040; for 1893 I estimate the number at 123,000, a decrease of 4,040. I arrive at this figure after a careful examination of the registered births in the three sub-districts into which the parish is divided. It is well known that birth-rates are subject to very small variations from year to year, therefore we may safely assume that, as the number of births diminishes, the number of inhabitants of the district decreases in like ratio. The numbers of births registered in each of the three years 1891, 1892 and 1893, are compared in the following table. The populations, as enumerated in 1891 and estimated in 1892 and 1893, are also shown for purposes of comparison. TABLE A. Population and Births in Sub-Districts for the years, 1891, 1892 and 1893. I 1891. 1892. 1893. Population enumerated. SUB-DISTRICTS. Registered Births. Registered Births. Population (estimated). Registered Births. Population (estimated).

The increase of the population in this sub-district during 1893 is probably due in part to people turned out of the Mount, owing to the demolition of their homes by the London County Council; the importation of Aliens, many of them in a condition of great destitution is nevertheless in all probability the cause of the larger proportion of the increase. The majority of these undesirable immigrants are of an extremely low type both of physical and intellectual development, dirty in their habits, and totally ignorant of the laws of health. They comprehend neither our language nor our customs, and it is most difficult to teaoh them to amend their ways, or to observe the rudiments of clean and healthy living. BIRTHS. The births during the year were 4,756 against 4,911 in 1892, a decrease of 155 The excess of births over the deaths however was 1,499. Table "B " shows this and compares the two years :— TABLE B. 1893. 1892. Estimated population in the middle of the year 123,000 127,040 Total Births 4,911 4,756 Total Deaths 3,257 2,984 Excess of Births over Deaths, showing the natural increase of the Population 1,499 1,927 9 DEATH RATE. The number of deaths registered in the parish during the year was 3,031 against 2,800 in the previous year. This includes 175 nonparishioners who died in Bethnal Green Hospitals, and whose deaths must be excluded from the number. On the other hand I have received information from Somerset House, of the deaths of 399 inhabitants of Bethnal Green who died in Hospitals in other parts of London. After adding these deaths and subtracting the nonparishioners there is a net total of 3,257. The deaths in each Sub-district corrected in a similar manner were as under : — North 1240 South 938 East 1079 Total 3257 Upon the basis of the estimated population we show a mortality rate for the year 1893 of 26 47. This is an advance of nearly three per thousand on the rate of the previous year; and is no less than five per thousand in excess of the general Metropolitan rate, which was itself considerably above the average rate of the previous five years. This is attributed by the Registrar-General to the increased mortality from Diphtheria and Influenza. The mortality in the Sub-districts into which the parish is divided was as under :— North 26.6 South 28.4 East 25.4 8 In the following table the mortality rates from London an Bethnal Green are compared by quarters : — TABLE C. London. Bethnal Green. March Quarter 22.1 28.0 24.8 June Quarter 19.5 September Quarter 25.8 20.5 December Quarter 27.3 23.2 I am indebted to the British Medical Journal for the following extract :— "THE DEATH-RATES OF LONDON SANITARY DISTRICTS DURING 1893. In the accompanying table will be found summarised the vital and mortal statistics of the forty one sanitary districts of metropolis, based upon the Registrar General's returns for the year 1893. The mortality figures in the table relate to the deaths of persons actually belonging to the respective sanitary districts, and are the resalt of a complete system of distribution of deaths occuring in the public institutions of London among the various sanitary districts in which the patients had previously resided. By this means alone can trustworthy data be secured upon which to calculate reliable rates of mortality The 132,965 births registered in London during the year 1893 were equal to an annual rate of 30.9 per 1,000 of the population, estimated at 4,306,111 persons in the middle of that year. This rate corresponded with that recorded in the preceding year, but, with two exceptions, was lower than in any of the past fifty years. In the 9 various sanitary districts the birth-rates showed the usual wide variations, owing principally to the differences in the age and sex distribution of their populations. In Kensington, St. George Hanover Square, St. James Westminster, Hampstead, St. Martin-in-the- Fields, and London City the birth-rates were considerably below the average; while in St. Luke, Bethnal Green, Whitechapel, St. Georgin-the-East, Mile End Old Town, Newington, and Bermondsey the birth-rates showed a marked excess. The deaths of persons belonging to London registered during the year under notice were 90,060, equal to an annual rate of 20.9 per 1,000 of the population, against 21.1 and 20.3 in the preceding two years. During the eight years 1885-92 the death-rate averaged 20.0 per 1,000. The lowest death-rates in the forty-one sanitary districts during last year were 12.9 in Hampstead, 14.6 in Lewisham (excluding Penge), 15.2 in .Wandsworth, 16.1 in St. George Hanover Square, 16.4 in Plumstead, 17.6 in Kensington, and 17.18 in Paddington ; on the other districts the rates ranged upwards to 26.6 in Clerkenwell, 27.1 in Holborn, 28.2 in Limehouse, 28.4 in St. George Southwark, 30.0 in Strand, and 30.8 in St. Luke and in St. Georgein-the-East. During the year under notice 13,091 deaths resulted from the principal zymotic diseases in London; of these, 3,436 were referred to diarrhœa, 3,196 to diphtheria, 2,327 to whooping-cough, 1,658 to measles, 1,587 to scarlet fever, 701 to different forms of "fever" (including 5 to typhus, 675 to enteric fever, and 21 to simple and ill-defined forms of continued fever), and 186 to small-pox. These 13,901 deaths were equal to an annual rate of 3.0 per 1,000, against 2.9, 2.3, and 2.8 in the preceding three years. This rate was, with one exception, higher than that recorded in any of the preceding eight years, 1885-92, during which the zymotic death-rate averaged 2.7 per 1,000. In the various sanitary districts the rates ranged from 1.3 in Hampstead and in London City, 1.5 in St. Martin-in-the-Fields, 1.6 in St. George Hanover Square, 1.7 in Lewisham, 1.8 in St. James Westminster, and 2.0 in Westminster to 4.1 in Bethnal Green, 4.6 in Shoreditch, 4.7 in Limehouse, 4.8 in St. George South- 10 wark, 4.9 in Clerkenwell and in St. George-in-the-East, and 5.6 in St. Luke. Compared with the preceding year, the mortality from measles and whooping-cough showed a decline, while that from each of the other principal zymotic diseases showed a marked increase. The 186 fatal cases of small-pox registered in London during last year exceeded those recorded in any year since 1885; during the preceding six years only 59 deaths from small-pox of London residents had been registered. Of the 186 fatal cases last year, 13 belonged to Rotherhithe, 13 to Greenwich, 12 to Poplar, 12 to Battersea, 11 to Camberwell, and 10 to Kensington sanitary districts. During the year under notice 2,481 small-pox patients were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals, and 82 remained under treatment at the end of December last. Measles showed the highest proportional fatality in Pancras, Clerkenwell, St. Luke, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, St. George-in-the-East, and Greenwich; scarlet fever in Strand, St. Luke, Limehouse, Poplar, and St. George Southwark; diphtheria in Strand, Clerkenwell, St. Luke, Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, St. George-in-the-East, Limehouse, Poplar, Bermondsey, Battersea, and Plumstead; whooping-cough in Clerkenwell, St. Luke."

The births registered during the year were 4,756. This is equal to a rate of 38 6 which is identical with that of the two previous years. It is, as usual, nearly eight per thousand in excess of the general Metropolitan rate, which was 30.9. This was also identical with-that of the two preceding years. In the registration Sub-districts of Bethnal Green the birth rates were as under :— North 40.0 South 40.6 East 35.6 The East district shows the lowest birth rate. This is accounted for by the fact that it contains the largest proportion of children and unmarried women. MARRIAGES. In this parish there are fourteen Churches, fifteen Chapels and one Registry Office licensed for marriages : of these there were in the First Quarter 261 Second Quarter 397 Third Quarter 335 Fourth Quarter 410 Total 1403. This total indicates a marriage rate of 11.40 to every thousand persons; or, as in each marriage there are two contracting parties, 22.8 per thousand of our population entered the bonds of matrimony. DEATHS OF INFANTS. Twenty-six per cent, of the deaths from all causes were those of infants aged less than twelve months; for out of 4,756 children born alive 849 died before reaching the age of one year. This gives 14 a death rate, calculated upon the births of 177.0. The corresponding rate for the whole of London was 164. The diseases most fatal to infants were :— Convulsions 147 Inflamatory Diseases of Chest 143 Atrophy and Debility 137 Diarrhoea 80 Premature Birth 57 Suffocation 41 Tabes Mesenterica 41 Whooping Cough 24 Enteritis 24 The following letter was received from Mr. Lakeman, H.M. Superintending Inspector of Workshops. 8, Finsbury Circus, London, E.C. Dear Sir, By Sec. 17 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1891, "An occupier of a Factory or Workshop shall not knowingly allow a woman to be employed therein within four weeks after she has given birth to a child." It has been proposed to extend this period from one month to three months, and to establish creches. The Report of the Medical Officer of Health for Blackburn has been read by the Secretary of State, in which report startling vital statistics have been given, inter alia, that the death rate of Children under twelve months was 241 per 1000. With a view to elicit the opinion of the Medical Officers of Health for London, in respect of employment of women in factories and workshops, I am requested to ask the favor of your report, so far as your district is concerned. I have the honor to be, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully, J. B. LAKEMAN. DR. BATE, Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green. BET 1 15 I replied that in my opinion the period of four weeks fixed by the section quoted by Mr. Lakeman, is sufficient to safeguard the health of the mother, but insufficient as regards the child. I am strongly of opinion that the above period should be extended to at least twelve weeks. It is all-important for the welfare of the newborn infant that it should have the care and food provided for it by nature during the first few months of its feeble life. If this start be given, it has a much better chance in the struggle for existence. Should the mother for any reason be unable to suckle her infant, it is certain to get neglected and improperly fed. Probably it is trusted to the tender mercies of a sister scarcely able to take care of herself. Then the ignorance of women of the working classes on the subject of infant feeding is colossal. Very few are aware of the physiological fact that infants must be fed on milk alone, as they are unable to digest starchy food. Looking at the statistics of infantile mortality for 1893, I note that Preston leach the way with the enormous figure of 27 infantile deaths to every 100 births registered; Bristol and Huddersfield have the lowest proportion, with 14 per cent., whilst the average in 33 of the largest towns in the kingdom is 18 per cent. London has 16 per cent., and Bethnal Green, 17. In the following table are shewn some Statistics bearing on this point, they are calculated per 1000, not per cent.

Moreover, it would not be impossible to utilize these establishments for educational purposes, and some plain and simple instructions in the feeding of infants might be given to the mothers who bring children to be taken care of. I have made some enquiries amongst the manufacturers in my district and also amongst the women themselves. I find that the employment of child-bearing women is not very prevalent in large Factories and Workshops. The married women mostly work at home at Boxmaking, Tailoring, or Bootwork. Factory Owners tell me that the proportion of married women among their female hands does not exceed five per cent., and some of these are widows. Occasionally their female hands continue their occupation for a time after marriage, but if they become pregnant they leave the Factory six or eight weeks before the expected confinement. Some employers say they will not be bothered with women who have children and decline to allow them to return, as they are apt to be irregular in attendance, and frequently kept at home on account of illness in their families. I notice that many Factory Owners have a somewhat vague knowledge of the law as it at present stands, and I should say that few female operatives know anything about it. In my opinion the clause is a dead letter in Bethnal Green. As the offence under the Factory Act is " knowingly employing a woman, etc." How is a manufacturer to know the date of a woman's confinement ? Say she absents herself from work for six weeks before her child is born, and returns a fortnight afterwards, who can check her statement if she chooses to tell a lie ? Should it be seriously intended to enforce the law, the production of a certificate of birth (which can be obtained for sixpence, and which gives full particulars), must be made obligatory on all women returning to employment after child-bearing. Even if this is done what is to prevent a woman seeking fresh employment where she is not known ? 17 DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. Nearly half the deaths (1,467, that is 45 per cent.), were those of children aged less than five years. This gives a rate of 75.0 calculate 1 upon the estimated population of young children. OLD PERSONS' DEATH RATE. The deaths of elderly persons, that is to say those over 65 years of age, numbered 501. This gives a rate of 69.6 per thousand, calculated on the estimated population of old persons. 18 SPECIAL CAUSES OF DEATH. Summary of Table III. No. of Deaths. Per Centage on Total Deaths.

The total number of deaths from this group of diseases was 595, a figure which represents about eighteen per cent, of the total deaths from all causes. Of these deaths 425 were amongst young children under five years of age; 152 of whom were infants. 19 THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths referred to the orders Miasmatic (exclusive of Influenza and Diarrhoea), were 510, making a decrease of sixteen. The decennial average of Zymotic deaths for the ten years of 1883 to 1892 was 490 (See Table V.) The death rate from Zymotic diseases was 4.14. This is identical with that of 1892. The corresponding rates for London were 2.8 in 1892 and 3.0 in 1893. TABLE D. 1893. 1892.

The diseases showing considerable increase over last year were Diphtheria and Diarrhœa; on the other hand those from Whooping Cough and Measles, had greatly diminished. 20 The following Table shows the percentage of deaths from each disease as compared with the total number of Zymotic Deaths.

(Decennial average 13). The total number of Small Pox cases reported during the year was 79. Of these 67 were removed to Hospital, though only 54 were admitted. Thirteen were sent home again as, in the opinion of the Hospital Medical Officers, the sick persons were not suffering from Small Pox; thirty-seven of the cases came from the North district; fifteen from the South, and twenty-seven from the East. There were seven deaths, all (except one) amongst those removed to Hospital, two had been, vaccinated and five were unvaccinated These numbers are too few to base statistics upon; but so far as they go they strongly support the value of vaccination. From the whole of London 2,376 persons suffering from Small Pox were admitted to the Asylums Board Hospitals in 1893, of these 180 died, a mortality of 75.7 per thousand cases. Of 500 who had never been vaccinated 94 died, a mortality of 188.0 per thousand. Of 1,624 who showed vaccination marks of varying degrees of goodness, only 42 died, a mortality of 25.8 per thousand. 21 In 252 cases the evidence as to vaccination was inconclusive, that is to say, some were stated to have been vaccinated yet showed no marks; others had such an abundant rash on admission as to conceal completely any marks even had they been present; whilst in others the marks were stated to have been obliterated by burns of tatooing. Probably very few of these doubtful cases had been successfully vaccinated. As 44 of them died, there was a mortality of 144.6 per thousand, which is almost identical with that of the avowedly unvaccinated. Looking at the matter from the most unfavourable point of view, and combining the doubtful cases with those known to have been vaccinated, we get a total of 86 deaths out of 1,876 cases. This gives a mortality of 45.8 per thousand as against 1880 amongst those who were certainly never vaccinated; yet there are still people who deny the value of vaccination as a protection against death from Small Pox ! SCARLET FEVER. (Decennial average 71). The number of cases of Scarlet Fever notified during the year was 1,488 resulting in 71 deaths, a mortality of 377 deaths per thousand reported cases. In the North district 609 cases were notified, in the South 399, and in the East 480. 480 persons supposed to be suffering from Scarlet Fever were removed to Hospital; of these only 439 were found to be so suffering on admission; the others were cases either of Diphtheria or some other disease resembling Scarlet Fever; these were retained and treated in Hospital. The mortality amongst the Hospital cases was 61 9 per thousand. The homes of all these people were visited; in 639 instances the sanitary conditions of the houses were found to be fairly satisfactory; in 56 the closets had no water supply; in 70 the internal drainage arrangements were defective; in 169 the outside drains were faulty; in twelve the domestic water supply was drawn from the closet 22 cistern; while in 461 others, various minor insanitary conditions were discovered. 130 of the cases occured amongst families occupying one room only. CONTINUED FEVER. (Decennial average, 27.) The total number of cases of Enteric Fever notified during the year was 138. Of these 47 were removed to Asylums Board Hospitals, but only 13 proved to be true Enteric Fever, the other 34 being cases of quite other diseases. Nine cases were admitted to General Hospitals whilst the diagnosis was uncertain. They were detained and treated, as this disease is, with proper precautions, only slightly infectious, and is very easily isolated. The Enteric Fever Mortality in the Asylums Board Hospitals was 205.4 per thousand cases. Of our own cases 37 were reported in the North District, 58 in the South, and 43 in the East. In 53 instances the residence of the patient was found to be in a satisfactory sanitary condition; in five the W. C. had no water supply; in seventeen the external drainage arrangements were out of order ; in five the drains inside the house were bad; in two the domestic water supply was drawn from the closet cistern ; and in 56, other insanitary conditions obtained. Eight cases occurred amongst families occupying one room only. No case of Typhus was notified. DIPHTHERIA : (Including Membranous Croup.) (Decennial Average 57.) The number of cases reported to me under these two heads was 746. The number of deaths registered was 137, which is equal to a mortality of 1836 per thousand notifications. The Hospital mortality was 304.2 per 1,000. On the estimated population at all ages the mortality was 1.0 as against 0.9 last year. Of the total deaths 107 were amongst young children aged less than five years. This was 5.87 per 1,000 on the estimated population of young children. 23 "The deaths attributed to Diphtheria in the whole of London numbered 3,265, and were in the proportion of 0.75 per 1,000 living, this being by far the highest rate yet recorded, and exceeding the average in the previous decennium by no less than 0.46 per 1,000. The mortality from this disease, which for several years has shown a tendency to increase, had been in the last four years respectively 0.33, 0.34, 0.46, and 0.76 per 1,000. The deaths from Diphtheria and Croup, taken together, amounted in 1893 to 3,482, while the average number in the preceding decennium, corrected for increase of population, had not exceeded 1,861. Distribution of the London Hospital deaths to their appropriate sanitary areas shows the East group of these areas to have suffered the highest Diphtheria mortality, viz., 1.00 per 1,000, the Central group coming next with a rate of 082, then the North and South groups with a rate of 0.73 in each case, and lastly, the West group with a rate of 0.52." Of the total notifications 256 came from the North District, 217 from the South, and 273 from the East. Three hundred and twenty-five premises were found in a fairly satisfactory condition; 34 had no water supply to the closets ; in 50 the internal drainage arrangements were faulty; in 120 the drains outside the house were defective; in 21 the domestic water supply was drawn from the closet cistern; and in 198 various other minor insanitary conditions were discovered. Sixty-eight cases occurred amongst families occupying one room only. The removals numbered 177. Of these 126 were admitted into the Asylums Board Hospitals; the remaining 51 were treated in local Hospitals. Many of these were cases of so-called Membranous Croup requiring immediate operation to avert suffocation. WHOOPING COUGH. (Decennial average 112.) Whooping-Cough caused 59 deaths, all except two being amongst young children, and shewing a mortality of 3.2 per 1,000 on the estimated population of young children. 24 MEASLES. (Decennial average 110.) Measles caused 82 deaths, of which all but eight were amongst young children aged less than five years, indicating a mortality of 4.0 per 1,000 on the estimated population under five years of age. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES. A total of 2,976 notification certificates have been received during the year. 73 of the certificates were duplicate notifications, that is to say, the same case was reported by two or more separate medical men. Particulars of the cases are shewn month by month, together with the Hospital admissions and discharges, in the accompanying table. The usual spot maps indicating the distribution of the cases are also submitted. If one may judge from the Report of the Asylums Board, many of these cases were wrongly diagnosed, as will be obvious from the following particulars supplied by the Medical Superintendents of the various Hospitals :— Small Pox. —2,455 cases sent to Hospital on notification certificates were all admitted, but 108 persons were afterwards found not to be suffering from Small Pox; 183 others also sent on notification certificates, were refused admission and sent back to their homes after examination, as they appeared not to be suffering from Small Pox, making a total of 301 unfortunate persons who had a fruitless journey in an ambulance through incorrect notification certificates. Fever and Diphtheria. —18,674 persons who were certified as suffering from one of these two diseases were admitted to Hospital, but of these 732 were found to be suffering from other diseases. How many of the unremoved notified cases were incorrectly described no one can say, as there is no means of checking the opinion of the Medical attendant.

The deaths from Chest diseases, other than Phthisis, and Pulmonary Influenza were 833, being over one-fourth of the total mortality from all causes, and corresponding to a rate of 6.77 per thousand population at all ages. This is the fourth year of the Influenza outbreak and there is every probability of its being a permanent infliction. The deaths from Influenza numbered 40, most were of the Pulmonary type, and are therefore referred to, though not included under this head. Probably some of the Pneumonia and Bronchitis deaths, which were much in excess of the average, were really due to some form of Influenza. 31 Table "H" separates the respiratory mortality into quarters, shows the age distribution and also the rainfall and mean temperature for each period of three months.

The main distinction between a Factory and a Workshop is the employment of mechanical power, such as steam, gas, or water, to drive the machinery used in the former. The buildings in which trades using mechanical power are carried on are called Factories ; but certain trades are included as Factories by Parliamentary authority irrespective of whether power be used or not. These are :— Print Works, Bleaching and Dyeing Works, Earthenware Works, Lucifer Match Works, Percussion Cap Works, Cartridge Works, Paper Staining Works, Fustian Cutting Works, Blast Furnaces, Copper Mills, Iron Mills, Foundries, Paper Mills, Glass Works, Tobacco Factories, Letter-press Printing Works, Bookbinding Works, and Flax Scutch Mills. All other buildings in which manufacturing trades are carried on where mechanical power is not used are called Workshops. The extent and importance of the business, and the number of workpeople employed in no way alters the classification; and any number of machines driven by foot or hand-power may be in use without affecting the treatment of the premises as Workshops. For many years past it has been recognized that Her Majesty's Factory Inspectors have not been able efficiently to supervise the 34 enormous number of Factories and Workshops throughout the kingdom. It was therefore decided to separate the work of inspecting Factories from that of supervising Workshops, and to distribute the duties. The arrangement obtaining at present is the following:— The Factories proper are left in the hands of H. M. Factory Inspectors. They are solely responsible for the sanitary condition of these establishments and also for the due observance of the law as to hours of employment therein. In Workshops there is a divided responsibility. The supervision of the Sanitary condition of these places was taken out of the hands of the Factory Department and transferred to the Local Authorities by the Public Health (London) Act 1891 and the Factory and Workshops Act 1891. The observance of the law as to conditions of employment, hours of labour, etc. is now supervised by a new class of Government officers styled Inspectors' Assistants. These gentlemen have no power to deal with insanitary conditions, such as overcrowding, etc. Though the law was altered in 1891, it was not until December 1893 that a Special Officer was appointed to look after the Workshops of Bethnal Green. In that month Mr. C. H. Kelf was appointed and commenced his duties. Since this report covers only the year 1893, I defer any remarks on the work of this officer till 1894, beyond mentioning that his duties are to systematically inspect and register all Workshops in the Parish, to measure up and cube all Workrooms and fix the number of persons allowed to work therein, to caution occupiers as to overcrowding, insanitary conditions and defective ventilation, and where his cautions are neglected to report the circumstances, and take such proceedings in the Police Court as may be ordered for the recovery of penalties, etc. Much time and thought were devoted to the arrangement of the work of the new officer and to the preparation of the necessary books, forms, and notices. All this has been satisfactory accomplished, and I now include in my monthly report, a four or five weekly statement of the results of the action taken by your Workshop Inspector. 35 COW-HOUSES AND SLAUGHTER-HOUSES. These have been kept under constant observation and present no point of special interest. The new Bye-Laws of the London County Council as to dung pits will require extensive alterations in the present arrangements at all these places, but no action was taken in this direction during the year 1893. By direction of the Sanitary Committee the occupier of every Cow-house and Slaughter-house in the parish was supplied with a printed copy of the Bye-law referred to. BAKEHOUSES. The total number of those under inspection is 106 ; about a dozen others were temporarily unoccupied at the time of my visit, and were therefore not inspected by me. Forty-four of the Bakehouses are underground, the remainder are situated in yards behind the shops. In the whole of the parish I only found thirteen (a baker's dozen) in a fairly clean and satisfactory condition, the remainder were either dirty or badly ventilated. In 28 the filthy custom of sweeping the refuse under the troughs has been continued notwithstanding my strong remonstrances. Two of these were in such an insanitary condition as to be absolutely unfit for use. Three bakehouses have been rebuilt since my last report. 36 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

It is therefore unnecessary to reproduce them here. One exception, however, I must make, as follows : In Russia Lane is a pile of so-called Model Dwellings in the shape of a hollow square, with a large block in the middle, reproducing and intensifying the evils of the well known "Blind Court." A number of cases of infectious disease were reported and complaints were made as to the insanitary condition of these buildings. I carefully inspected the whole block, presented a report and drew the attention of the Sanitary Committee to its dirty and insanitary condition, specially pointing out the faulty position of the dust shoots, and the defective lighting and ventilation of some of the rooms. These dust-shoots are all inside the buildings and the inlets or apertures through which the dust is thrown are in many instances placed in the closets just over the seats. When the dust shoots are cleared great nuisance is caused, and the stink finds its way into the living rooms. The tenements in one angle of the hollow square are badly lighted and ventilated; the living rooms of each set (there are five floors) have no external window, but are merely lighted from a passage, and the occupants are thus compelled to use lamps all day; the bedrooms are fairly well lighted from the back. The premises were viewed by the Sanitary Committee and as the owners declined to move the dust shoots, on the 29th of November last, proceedings were ordered to be taken at Worship Street for the purpose of obtaining orders to remove the dust shoots to the exterior of the buildings and to close the badly lighted rooms, 169, 170, 171 & 172. In the interval between the issue of the summons and the hearing of the case, the owners did a great deal of work; they cleansed and repaired the buildings, broke down the partition walls between the living room and one of the bedrooms in each dark set and put in windows, and by the free use of whitewash and light-wall papers gave the rooms a fairly light and airy appearance. Still the light and ventilation were only borrowed and in my opinion not satisfactory. 38 The summonses were heard by Mr. Haden Corser at Worship Street. After hearing both sides he adjourned the case for the purpose of making a personal inspection; he did so, and at the adjourned hearing gave his decision : —He had formed the opinion that the dust shoots could not be removed from their present position without materially cramping the internal sanitary arrangements, and that the proposed remedy of placing them outside would bring about a worse condition than the present one, he therefore declined to make an order and dismissed the summonses. With regard to the dark rooms, he was of opinion that No. 169, the ground floor set, were unfit for habitation, and made a closing order, but he considered sullicient had been done to the others to render them habitable. SANITARY WORK. Table VI. details the work done by your District Inspectors. The total shows a considerable increase over that of the previous year, though it does not include one month's work done by your Workshop's Inspector, indeed one sometimes hears murmurs that small property owners are being persecuted in Bethnal Green, the fact is that for years they have had very much their own way and have done as little as they possibly could. Now public opinion is with Sanitary Authorities, and owners feel that they must do their duty. Numbers of dilapidated hovels have been pulled down instead of being patched up, and sound healthy dwellings have been erected on their sites. I have much pleasure in indicating the works completed and in progress in Hart's Lane, as a good example of how things ought to be done. The total number of inspections in Table VI., scarcely shows the amount of work really done, for the examination of drains, etc., is now much more thorough and careful than was the case a few years ago. We are not satisfied with merely testing drains with strongsmelling agents such as peppermint, but we expect all pipes under buildings and all new work to stand the water test, which is much more severe and searching. All this takes time and means money, though the results obtained will certainly pay for the expenditure, as drains once properly laid quite water-tight should require no 39 further attention (except in the event of an accidental stoppage), for many years. The work done in this direction by your Officers has been skilfully and carefully accomplished, and I have much pleasure in drawing your attention to it. Recent Legislation has thrown much additional Clerical Work upon your Medical Officer. The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requires me to forward daily particulars of all notified infectious cases to the Asylums Board. lam also required within twelve hours of the receipt of the notification to send similar particulars to the Head Masters of every school attended by children residing in a house where a case of infectious disease is reported, and I also send a subsequent notice of convalescence and disinfection. Particulars of women and children found employed in Workshops must be reported to the Factory Inspector of the district. Copies of every report made under the Housing of the Working Classes Act must be forwarded to the Local Government Board and to the London County Council, reports of infectious cases in Dairies, and subsequent reports as to disinfection, etc., must be sent to the London County Council. Naturally all this entails a good deal of extra work, and Mr. Meadway, the Sanitary Clerk, though a most energetic officer, has more than he can do. The appointment of an additional Inspector has so greatly increased his duties that he finds it impossible to keep his books from falling into arrear in consequence I have found it necessary to employ an additional clerk and to pay him out of my own pocket. I trust the Vestry will shortly see its way to relieve me of this obligation. Until this is done, however, I must continue the arrangement, as the duty of making these reports is a Statutory one distinctly thrown upon the Medical Officer of Health who is alone responsible that it is performed, and I cannot plead insufficient Clerical assistance as an excuse for failing to comply with the law. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your most obedient servant, George Paddock Bate M.D. 40 BETHNAL GREEN SANITARY DISTRICT. TABLE I.

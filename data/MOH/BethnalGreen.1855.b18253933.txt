AC 4366 ST MATTHEW BETHNAL GREEN BET 71 REPORT [1855] TO THE VESTRY OF St.Matthew Bethnal Green, ON THE SANITARY STATE OF THE PARISH, BY SAMUEL PEARCE, MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY, 1857. 38726 TO JOHN SIMON, Esq. F.R.S. MEDICAL OFFICER OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH; WHOSE NOBLE EXERTIONS IN SANITARY REFORM, HAVE SAVED THE CITY OF LONDON, TWO LIVES, PER THOUSAND, PER ANNUM: THE OFFICER OF HEALTH, OF BETHNAL GREEN, DEDICATES BY PERMISSION, AND IN TESTIMONY OF DEEP ADMIRATION AND RESPECT, HIS FIRST SANITARY REPORT. 135, Bethnal Green Road, April 21st., 1856. "As the Wolf has been extirpated from our forests, so may Pestilence be driven away from our towns." Gentlemen, In accordance with my duties as your first Officer of Health, I have the honour to present to you, a Report on the Parish of Bethnal Green. I have framed it throughout on the subjoined Instructions* of the General Board of Health, and in the order suggested therein. Natural Features. Bethnal Green has, naturally a gravelly soil, and a mean elevation of 38 feet above the high water mark of the Thames. It, therefore, stands high, on the Seventh of the Fourteen Terraces, into which the elevation of London has been divided by Dr. Farr. Some of its ground was, originally, swampy and covered with ponds. Such was "the former geography" * "The duties of the Officer of Health will be to the following effect:— "He will make himself familiar with the natural and acquired features of the place, with the social and previous sanitary state of its population, and with all its existing provisions for health—namely, with the levels, inclinations, soil, wells, and watersprings of the district; with its meteorological peculiarities; with the distribution of its buildings and open spaces, paved or unpaved; of its burial-grounds and lay-stalls: with a plan of its drains, sewers, and water supply; with the nature of its manufacturing and other industrial establishments; with the house accommodation of the poorer classes, and their opportunities for bathing and washing; with the arrangements for burial of the dead, and with the regulations in force for lodging houses and slaughtering places; for the cleansing of public ways and markets; and for the removal of domestic refuse. And if he be the first Officer of Health appointed in his district he will, without unnecessary delay, furnish to the Local Authority a connected account of these matters so far as they relate to the public health, making thereon such practical suggestions as he may think applicable." 4 of the old Hare Street Fields, and of the brickfield to the left of the Road:—the present site of Wolverly, Camden Streets, &c. When filled up with rubbish, houses were planted on that undrained ground. No wonder if some are damp to this day, and dispose, even now, to Zymotic disease ! At the eastern end of the Road, water is reached, in the winter, at 18 inches of depth; proving alike, the dense saturation, and the unhealthy condition below. This was the case where the talented and lamented Mr. Taylor resided, and this probably, with the harass of Cholera in 1849, predisposed to his untimely death. Bethnal Green forms a part of the eastern metropolitan boundary, and has a superficial area of 760 statute acres; whilst "the London" of the Registrar-General numbers 78,029. Its Registration divisions are Four: Hackney Road, Green, Church, and Town. Of these, the areas and elevations are given below:— Acquired Features, TABLE I. Sub-Districts. Area in Acres. Elevation.

Population. In 1801 the population amounted to 22,310; in 1811, to to 33,619; in 1821, to 45,676; in 1831, to 62,018; and from that year to 1841, the annual per centage increase was 1.755.† The annexed Table exhibits the population in 1841 and 1851, the decennial advance, and the relative proportions of the Birth and Immigration Increase:— TABLE III.

For the entire Parish, the decennial increase was 2173* per 100 per annum; which ratio brings us up from 90,193,† to 100,000 in 1856. And as the people of the Metropolis number 2,565,579, it follows that one out of every 25'6 of the Great London Family lives at Bethnal Green. Social and Sanitary state of the Population. By the New Metropolis Management Act, the Parish is divided into Four Wards:—North, South, East and West. In these, its "medical topography" and social condition are very diverse. The North Ward contains many excellent houses, and several of the wealthier and more dlite of the residents in Bethnal Green. In the Hackney Road portion, Mr. Murray reports, that "deaths are comparatively very infrequent." Near the Canal, it is less healthy, and, moreover, is dirty and damp. So, too, are the sites of its original ponds. Fortunately—in so far as the fenny soil is concerned—the Imperial Gas Company have taken much of that ground, which they are extensively improving and draining. Along Ann's Place runs a black arched-over ditch;‡—to this day, I believe, a fertile source of disease. Generally, this division is not overcrowded; unless in and about Cambridge Circus where, Mr. Welch informs me, "Fever and Diarrhoea have been very prevalent from drains running immediately under the * In the 9th Annual Report, page 2, the Registrar-General, alluding to the Increase of Population, Immigration, and Emigration, says, "With so many unknown elements, the equation of increase becomes indeterminate, and as near an approximation to the true rate of increase is obtained by using the rate which prevailed in the years 1831-41, as by any other method that can be devised." I have consequently calculated the rate prevailing in 1841-51, and the subsequent increase therefrom. † Males, 44,081; Females, 46,112—or 20,547 Families or Occupiers. ‡ This was open in 1849, and "near to its edge," in Shoreditch, "many deaths occurred from Cholera."—Notes on Cholera, p. 193. 7 floors." On the west side of Nelson Street, he also reports, "that several cases of Scarlet Fever, Typhus, and Small-pox have occurred." Those cases were probably referable to 30 feet of open sewer close by. The South Ward is remarkable for the cul-de-sac construction of several streets. It is traversed, almost at parallel lines, by Bethnal Green Road, and the Eastern Counties' Railway, which nearly sub-divide it into three equal parts. The superior contains many good modern houses in the district of St. Jude, and a large open space (late an old market-garden) capable of affording much more houseroom. In the central part, are the several free spaces of Camden and other Gardens, which,—though open to objection, in their present unpaved condition—might by judicious alteration, furnish the staple want of the parish—Model Lodgings, Baths, and Wash-houses. Westward of Camden Gardens stand the disease-inviting back-to-back houses of Alfred and Beckford Rows, where Fever reigned supreme in 1838, and Cholera in 1849. But, even here, "relief might be given" by converting every two back-to-back tenements "into one single row of houses with doors and windows before and behind," as admirably suggested, in certain City Courts, by Mr. Simon. In pleasing contrast to these upas spots, are the several improvements made in paving and draining through the praiseworthy exertions of our friend Mr. Goodwin. They illustrate how much each one may do, and forcibly urge us to "go and do likewise." To the south of the railroad is the third subdivision;—the far-famed Lamb Fields, or "St. Giles" of Bethnal Green: now teeming with life, and, perhaps retaining, in its oft-described soil—germs of future disease! Much hazard however, might be avoided by the ventilating chimney openings of Dr. Arnott, "which not only carry away the breath-poison, but also the aerial impurity" of undrained, or badly drained soil. Such chimney openings with the charcoal air filters of Dr. Stenhouse, which purify the air from without before it enters the lungs, would greatly ward off 8 their malarious ills. And, where so many pass their days in-doors, at the looms, and sleep, for the most part, on the ground floors, ventilation demands our foremost regard. The Bethnal Green portions of the Jews' Burial Grounds are in this sub-division. On the opposite side, the neighbourhood is very poor and bad, and is noted for Fever. Equally notorious is the Irish Colony of Elizabeth Place, or Devil's Alley near Mile End Gate. In that close parallelogram bounded before and behind by high walls, the imprisoned air stagnates, and is unfit to breathe. The East is, par excellence, our best drained and most healthy Ward. Open to the Park and the country beyond, it wafts the breezes of life to its less favoured districts. Nevertheless, these advantages have their alloy: for two manufactories of manure flourish still, in this, otherwise, "happy land." The West Ward comprises the more ancient portions of Bethnal Green. Many of its houses are large and lofty; but others, in the Courts and Gardens, are hovels only. The latter, usually do not exceed two rooms in height, which fortunately, lessens the intensity of the emanations, and diffuses them more readily into space. "All the neighbourhood," says Mr. Welch, "north of Church Street, Friar's Mount, and its pestilential blind alleys, all the streets bordering on Gibraltar Walk on the east, and Boundary Street on the west, suffered severely in the Fever Epidemic in 1836-37, and as severely from Cholera in 1849." Being densely peopled by the poorest class, and having but little breathing space, it registers low on the scale of health. Nor can this be a matter of surprise while hundreds swarm, like bees, in close, unsunned, low-lying courts. Here in 1849, "in a space of about 400 yards by 150, out of 342 deaths, 208 were from Cholera, and 27 from Diarrhcea." Here too, "on the 12th, 13th, & 14th of August, Surgeons were wanted in many places at once, and the hurried passing and repassing of messengers, and the wailing of relatives filled the streets with confusion and woe." And here, still, on a low 9 open space, are daily piled enormous mounds of London refuse; "to the sight, disgusting; to the olfactory sense, sickening;" to the health, poisoning! Hence this region is, in a sanitary and social sense, our darkest spot, and imperatively calls for—Regeneration. Mortality. Gentlemen, these differential circumstances influence materially the death returns. It is our lot to live in the least healthy* of the five great London Divisions—to have an early average age at deathf—and consequently to lose several of the best years of life. In the Eastern Division, there were, in 1855, 37 persons living; and in the Northern, 44 to every death; and "the rate of mortality varied from 23 in 1000, in the Western and Northern Divisions; to 25 in 1000 in the Eastern Division." Last year we lost 2143 persons, of whom, 284 died in the Workhouse, and 57 in Bethnal House Asylum. During the previous 9 years, the subjoined were the several variations:— TABLE IV.

(Registrar-General). † Our mean age at death, in the decennium 1841-50 was about 26 years, and the corresponding average duration of life 34 years. 10 Out of every 69 deaths, one person died of Small Pox, one in 27 of Measles, one in 22 of Scarlatina, one in 21 of Hooping Cough, one in 30 of Diarrhœa, and one in 21 of Typhus. In the Metropolis, generally, the per-centage, of the Epidemic to the total deaths was 18.36. The deaths in the SubDistrict Green, are swelled by the Workhouse and Lunatic Asylum returns. In the week ending March 24th, out of 20 deaths from Measles in all London, 6 died at our Workhouse. The per-centage of the Workhouse to the total deaths was 13 25. If we contrast our mortality with that of London, our ratio was 2.14 per cent, or one death to every 46 living, while that of London was 239, or one in 41.* The difference of these proportions is expressed by the numbers .895 and 1.000. Inclinations. Bethnal Green uprises, with slight undulations, from the South to the North, from the East to the West: the minimum elevation being 35.8 in the South; the maximum 59.8 in the North. In the East, the ascent is from 39'4 in Old Ford Lane, to 597 near Boundary Street, in the West. These altitudes are derived from sheets 14 and 21 of the Ordnance Maps, where they are given " n feet above the approximate mean water of Liverpool;" from which a deduction of 12 feet reduces them to their London Reading. Levels. As some of the streets were built in the hollows of the lowlying grounds, with little regard to any general level, and as, subsequently, levels were made—many houses are left below the roadways. Such instances occur behind the high road, in Hill Street, Crab Tree Row, Mount Street, &c. Soil. In our Geology, according to Myine's Topographical Map *See Table VII. 11 of London, the soil is formed of gravel and sand, excepting a small patch in the south eastern division of brick-earth loam. Where there are sewers with "dry bricks" at the sides to admit subsoil drainage, this loose porous mould carries off the fluid, and relieves the surcharged strata above. In the cellars of the house in which I reside, the water rose at times, more than a foot, but when a sewer was made, the ground became dry, and the water was drawn away from a well in the yard. Wells. With some few exceptions, our wells are not deep, nor is their water wholesome from the number of cesspools and easy infiltration of the soil. Most of the superficial ones are fraught with impurities derived in this way, and are, "practically, reservoirs into which all soluble surface nuisances drain." Some, however, do good by relieving the sodden subsoil; as, for instance, the well in the slaughter houses of Messrs. Stevens and Long, where, nearly a hundred cattle are slaughtered each week, and thousands of gallons are pumped up from below. To the deep well-waters, more particularly if softened by the elegant liming process of Dr. Clark, such objections do not apply. The Plumstead Company, by this plan, reduce the hardness 12 84 degrees, or from 309 grains to 18.06, (Thomson) and free it besides, according to Drs. Hofmann and Hassall from all traces of confervœ and infusorial life. Meteorology. On our meteorological history—beyond the influence of the low day and high night temperatures, and the less daily range which Mr. Glaisher tells us, distinguish the London from a country climate; coupled with the fact that the emanations, from the undrained places render our air less salubrious—I regret that I possess no information. But as 12 atmospheric phenomena, and temperature especially, are the most influential agents on life, I have tabulated the variations and deaths of each month in 1855, and the meteorology, and mortality of the year.

Although some parts of the Parish are too thickly peopled, the area of the open spaces is large, and the density is less than in many other districts. The following is the density of each sub-division:— TABLE VIII. SUB-DISTRICTS. Persons to an Acre Hackney Road 170 Green 60 Church 165 Town 218 As population has increased, new streets have been built, and more sewers made: hence were it possible to disperse certain numbers among the new dwellings, our health might improve, or not retrograde. But poverty, which compels herding together, is the poison that prevents such circulation. Our crowded streets and courts are therefore becoming more over thronged. So mortality mounts up, and physical degeneration results. Accordingly, we find that after 1841, when the mortality was one to every 41 living, or 24 in 1000, it rose in the decennium 1841-50 to 1 in 38, or 26 in 1000.* To me it appears that the antidote is—to raze to the ground certain unhealthy buildings, and to erect small Model Dwellings instead. On the differences between Whitechapel, Shoreditch, and Bethnal Green, Dr. Parr remarks, "they are inhabited by very much the same class of people, the sewerage and supply of water are nearly the same, but the density is different, and the mortality is highest in the densest districts." Those differences I append from the Registrar-General's 16th. Report. * Since 1861 several of the worst streets have been furnished with sewers, and their sickness and mortality have very much decreased. 14 TABLE IX. DISTRICTS. Persons to a Square Mile Deaths annually to 1000 living. Excess in Deaths above 17 in 1000. Whitechapel 118942 29 12 Shoreditch 95450 28 11 Bethnal Green 69171 26 9 In that Report "the deaths of 17 persons in 1000" are "considered natural deaths, and all the deaths above that number" are "referred to artificial causes." On every 1000 deaths, in the years 1841-50, we therefore lost 9 persons in excess of the standard proposed. Some of this excess is traceable, I think, to the unpaved, undrained state of many of our by-ways, gardens, and courts. Burial Grounds. The Burial Grounds, closed and unclosed, number 12: those in use are but 2—the Victoria Park Cemetery, and the Jews'. Whether it would be better to super-impose on any a layer of charcoal, as strongly recommended by Dr. Stenhouse, I, with all deference, leave to you to determine. But "as putrefactive changes, for some years longer, must proceed in these saturated soils," it behoves us to supply "sufficiency of vegetation, gradually to appropriate, as fast as they are evolved, the products of animal decay." Lay Stalls. In a public sense, Lay-stalls do not exist; in a minor one, each cow or cattle keeper may be said to have lay-stalls of his own. There are, however, certain courts and corners where accumulations of refuse are made. Certain open spaces also, are, in this respect open nuisances too—Nova Scotia Gardens, to wit. The ground likewise, under and about several arches of the Eastern Counties Railway, and of the 15 passages termed "holes in the walls," (as in Essex, Lisbon Mount Streets, &c.) harbours all sorts of filth. Drains and Sewers. Unhappily our sewers are few, and as a consequence, cesspools abound. "The cesspools now under our houses," says the Registrar-General, "will inflict more pains and destroy more living than 10,000 mad dogs let loose in our streets." Hence, until our highways and by-ways are properly drained, Fever (which begins where sewerage ends) will, ever and anon, decimate our ranks, and spread desolation among our friends and our homes! In the last year alone 194 deaths from Typhus and Scarlatina, were the life price that we paid. How diseases and pauperism are reflected on us in Rates, Dr. Farr thus illustrates:—"in Bethnal Green, a person assessed to £100 a year, pays £13 12s. to the relief of the poor; in St. George, Hanover Square, £2 8s. only." Water Supply. Our Water-supply, (derived from the Lea) has of late been improved; being drawn from a purer source, and filtered "through an extensive surface of sand." But every house has not yet, as each should have, an independent supply; nor are there in many places, taps to the pipes. Consequently the cellars or yards become sodden and wet, the refuse decomposes, and diffuses its gases among the dwellers around. The ill-health depending on this cause alone forms a serious item in the poor-rate account. Dr. R. D. Thomson's analysis of the water of the East London Company shows, in eaeh gallon, 1.940 grains of organic matter, 14.2 of hardness, and 18.461 of total impurity. 16 Manufacturing Establishments. The manufacturing establishments (unless each weaver's household be so considered) are neither numerous nor extensive. The Lead Works in Holly Bush Gardens, Palmer's Candle Factory in Twig Folly, and the Manure Factories in Digby Street, which are also Night Soil Yards, are the most prejudicial. In the Candle Factory, Mr. Welch states, that great care is taken to protect the workmen, chemically, from the arsenical matters employed. House accommodation of the Poorer Classes. The House accommodation of the poorer classes is often faulty and deficient. Frequently there is neither cellar nor yard, no storage room, and not enough water to keep the dwellings clean. To that want of water (that great essential to health) I earnestly invoke your special regard. Another evil is, that in certain cul-de-sac houses, as in Providence Place, the privies belonging to the houses behind abut on the walls, and infiltrate ordure under the floors. Thus "unhealthy and unhappy homes induce thousands to seek escape fron miserable depression in the temporary excitement of intoxicating liquors." If we will apply it, the remedy is —to institute Model Lodgings, Baths, and Washhouses. The pecuniary and moral gain will be great:—there will be less orphanage, less widowhood, more useful, more productive labour. Sensible of the paucity of healthy houseroom, I respectfully suggest to you whether it would not be of advantage to convert some of the larger houses into Renovated Model Dwellings, or to build some small groups after the plans of Prince Albert—out of our rates ? The experiment is neither uncertain nor new; it has been put to the test by Baths and Wash-houses, in St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and has realized 5 per cent. of returns. And, as regards the health question, when, in 1852, the mortality of all London was 22 17 in the 1000,—that of the Model Dwellings reached in each 1000—7 only. Gentlemen, I have ventured, en passant, to touch on these matters because it is one of my privileges, as well as my duties, in the situation that I have now the honor to hold, "to point out the most efficacious mode of checking and preventing the spread of contagious or epidemic disease," and because I believe there is no other plan so efficacious or cheap of increasing the comfort, the utility, the length of life of the poor. Arrangements for the Burial of the Dead. Since the closure of the Burial Grounds, the Victoria Park Cemetery has become the great graveyard of Bethnal Green, and of other places besides. It is easily reached, and has, in some parts plenty of room. But in the pauper divisions, the practice of piling coffin upon coffin, and of barely separating one pit from another deserves deep condemnation. In the more crowded portions, no vegetation enlivens the gloom nor helps to appropriate the gases evolved. It scarcely contains 12 acres of ground. "We alone—on the estimates of Mr. Simon and Dr. Waller Lewis—require a much larger space. To bury in perpetuity—the one says, there should be half an acre to each 1000 living; the other, 18 acres at least to every thousand who die in a year. Lodging Houses. The Registered Common Lodging Houses are 12, and accommodate 176 persons. The names of the Keepers, the situations of the Houses, and the numbers for which they are licensed, I have ascertained from the Police. Slaughtering Places. There are upwards of 50 butchers who kill, but as some kill sheep or pigs only, and those in their kitchens, the 18 regular Slaughter-Houses are not so many. Whether they are "whitewashed with quick lime, at least twice in each year, or have a sufficient number of vessels with tight close fitting covers," it will be hereafter my duty to learn. Cleansing of Public Ways and Removal of Domestic Ref use. With respect to the cleansing of Public Ways, I take leave to suggest, that it would be an advantage to have the refuse more frequently carted away, and that the contractors (so far as relates to the removal of house dust) require both remonstrance and supervision After the purer supply of water, "the next most effectual measure of sanatory improvement will be the purification of the London atmosphere, by the complete removal from the houses and streets daily of the residue of the organic matter which is brought into them daily." (Registrar-General.) Such is the brief sketch that I have to present. Gentlemen, while in the Country 202 out of every 1000 live to be "threescore years and ten,"—105 only arrive at that age in Bethnal Green. Hence, how noble the aim to lengthen the term, and to augment the value of that "great property—Life." But before we shall accomplish desiderata so grand, our highways and by-ways must be thoroughly drained, and mile upon mile of sewerage made. Until then, we are doomed to eke out existence on unhealthy ground—to inhale a slow poison at every breath—and perhaps, at last, to die prematurely— holocausts to preventible, yet unremedied ills! Gentlemen, when the "ordures that now pollute our river shall fertilize our fields, and ceasing at length to breed disease and death, shall spring up, strangely transmuted, in rich crops of the life-sustaining grain," or, when discharged at high water below Barking Creek, they pass down the stream, slowly but surely, one mile per day, to the great ocean beyond:— then, but not 19 until then, may we hope like the long-lived Cornaro, to "number the years of life decreed by nature, and be gathered like a shock of corn, ripe to the tombs of our fathers." I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, With great respect, Very faithfully your's, SAMUEL PEARCE. To the Gentlemen of the Vestry of Bethnal Green. London: J. S. FORSAITH, Printer, 118, Bethnal Green Road.

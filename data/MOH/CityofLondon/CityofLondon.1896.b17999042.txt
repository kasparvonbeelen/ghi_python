The City of London Registration District comprises 672T acres excluding tidal water or foreshore. The first Imperial Quinquennial Census was taken in the City of London on the night of the 29th March, 1896, under the provisions of the London (Equalisation of Rates) Act, 1894, 57 and 58 Vic., cap. 53, sec. 3. In the Returns prepared by the RegistrarGeneral, dated 13th August, 1896, presented to Parliament, the population on the night of the enumeration was found to be 31,711, whilst in the previous decennial Imperial census of 1891 it was 38,320, shewing a decrease of 6,609 persons in the 5 years (1891-6). 6 Assuming that the annual rate of decrease between 1891 and 1896 corresponded to the rate of decrease in the decennial period 1881 and 1891, the estimated population of the City at the end of June, 1896, would be 32,843. At the census taken in March, however, the population, as above mentioned, was 31,711, but calculated to the end of June would be only 31,412, a difference between the estimated and the actual figures of 1,431 inhabitants. This inaccuracy is accounted for chiefly by the large number of persons removed from the City by Widegate Street and other improvements, and apart from financial considerations, illustrates the utility of numbering the people at shorter intervals than has hitherto obtained. In 1896 the Imperial census returns gave a population of 31,711, being a decrease of 6,609 from the previous enumeration 1891, thus: City population in 1861 112,063 1871 75,983 1881 51,405 1891 38,320 1896 31,711 7 The population of the City as ascertained by the Day-census, taken by the Corporation at its own expense, was found to be in 1866— 170,133, in 1881—261,061, and in 1891— 301,384, shewing an increase between 1866 and 1881 of 90,928, and between 1881 and 1891 of 40,323, so that if this progressive augmentation has been maintained since 1891 a Day-census at June, 1896, would have shewn a population of about 324,600. The Day-census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. During 1896 1,066 deaths were registered, including *672 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. Deducting the latter we have to deal with 394 deaths, to which we must add 164 persons *[In St. Bartholomew's Hospital alone 667 deaths of non-residents occurred.] 8 who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where, of course, they were registered. The mortality therefore upon which our death rate is calculated is 558. The details of the deaths occurring in the City will be found in Appendix A. Of the deaths registered, 9.5 per cent. were caused by injuries or violence, as compared with 10T in 1895. The death rate for 1896 was 17.8 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 18.3), that for the whole of the Metropolis for 1896 being 18.6. These figures are not corrected for sex and age distribution. In comparing these figures with the returns of the Registrar-General some slight discrepancies will be observed, due to the fact that I have not been furnished with the number of citizens who died in Institutions other than those with which the City is connected. 9 The number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases was 33, or 1.05 per 1,000, against 3T4 for the Metropolis. The deaths of children under 1 year of age to 1,000 births comes out 133, against 161 for the whole of London. The number of children born in the City (see table B) was 534. The birth rate, therefore was 17.0 per 1,000. The birth rate for the whole of London is given as 30.2. This wide variation is due to the differences in the sex and age distribution of their populations. Of the births 345 were successfully vaccinated, 1 was insusceptible, 45 died before the age for vaccination, 24 were postponed by medical certificate, 50 removed into other districts, and 69 were pending at the end of the year. See table (Vaccination Report). During the same period a number of adults, etc., were re-vaccinated. 10 The following tables. A and B, are compiled in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, upon the form prescribed by that Department.

At these buildings we have to deal with an average population of 1,066 persons—535 per cent. being adults, and 46.5 per cent. children. The Death Rate was 11.2 per 1,000 per annum, of which 60.0 per cent. were children under 5 years of age. In Peabody Buildings 15.6. Deaths of children under one year to 1,000 births, 40, as against 133 for the City generally (Table C.) In Peabody Buildings 120.2. The number of births was 50, viz.: 29 males and 21 females. The Birth Rate is high in our dwellings, viz.: 46.9 per 1,000, as against 17.0 for the whole of the City, and 35.6 in Peabody Buildings. For the third year in succession no births of illegitimate children were recorded, a fact which speaks well for the morality of the inmates.

It will be seen by reference to Table B, that of 312 persons attacked during 1896, 225 or 72.1 per cent. were removed to Hospital. Eight cases only of Erysipelas out of 32, were so treated, but of Small-pox, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Typhoid, and Continued Fever, 77.5 per cent. were taken to an isolation hospital. The figures do not compare favourably with 1895, when no less than 83.9 infectious cases were removed. This diminution was owing to the overcrowding of the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Board, who were unable to provide the requisite accommodation. Of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, no less than 82 4 and 73.8 per cent. respectively were removed. Following these notifications, 287 premises were disinfected. The difference between the 14 number of notifications received and the number of premises disinfected, is accounted for by the fact that in some instances several cases occurred in one house, whilst in others notifications were received in duplicate. CHOLERA NOTIFICATIONS. In my Annual Report for 1894 I tabulated notifications relating to 86 persons arriving in the City from 9 Foreign Ports infected with Cholera. During 1895 and 1896 none reached me. 15 SHELTER FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION DURING DISINFECTION, Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 60 (Sub-Sec. 4). The premises at No. 6, Cotton Street, Aldersgate Street, described in former Reports, continue in active operation. Thirty-one families, comprising 59 adults and 48 children, total 107 persons, were provided with lodging and food during the disinfection of their houses, after the following diseases:— Scarlet fever 17 Diphtheria 12 Enteric Fever 2 31 Of the above, 21 families had been living in one room and 10 in two rooms. The recipients were, with one exception, orderly and well conducted. 16 DISINFECTION 6,066 articles of clothing, etc., and 19 street cabs were received at Golden Lane, and returned to the owners after disinfection, being 418 more than in 1895 of the former, and 14 of the latter. Compensation was given to persons of the poorer classes, in suitable cases, tc the owners of bedding and clothing, when such articles were destroyed as being unfit or unsafe for further use. 94 bodies were received at the Mortuary, pending their removal for interment. CORONER'S COURT. 61 Coroner's Inquests were held on bodies, and 2 on fires. SANITARY INSPECTIONS. 9,410 inspections were made. This number includes the original defects discovered by the 17 Inspectors in the daily discharge of their duty, as well as the re-inspection of the same property during the execution of the works required to remedy the same. Improvements were effected at 1,278 places, necessitating new systems of drainage at many large establishments. 947 "Orders" were made by the Commissioners to abate nuisances, including noxious trades, smoke evil [49 cases reported], neglect of dung-pits, fried fish shops, dirty bakehouses, &c., &c. The Inspectors' returns laid before you every week give full details of this work. Special attention has also been bestowed upon cases of foul emanations from sewer ventilators in road-ways, and during 1896 eleven shafts were fixed in front of adjacent buildings, making in all 294 spread over the City. The erection of these shafts has proved a great boon in some of the narrow streets, and 18 complaints of nuisance formerly occurring and recurring are now rare. One of the most important of these shafts has been placed in Carter Lane to the great advantage of the St. Paul's Cathedral Choir Schools, in which cases of infectious disease, sometimes of an epidemic character, were too frequent. The Engineer reports that in 1896 232 premises were drained. As heretofore, much of this work was done from plans prepared by my Department, but only so far as relates to the interior of buildings. Underground conveniences are now to be found in 19 places in the City, containing 187 compartments as urinals, and 114 waterclosets. The places still used as public urinals above ground are about the same as last year. 12 water-closets with lavatory appliances are now provided for women, and it is to be hoped that this essential accommodation will be much extended in the near future. 19 HOUSE REFUSE. The Engineer further reports that the refuse removed from the City in 1896 consisted of 29,943 cart-loads of street sweepings and slops, and 43,341 loads of house and trade refuse: total, 73,284. Respecting the collection of house-refuse, great benefit has accrued from the extension of the "skip system" which has enabled us to take away most of the public bins from courts and alleys, where they were found to be a source of nuisance. We have now 741 skips in use, and many more will be wanted. SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS, ETC. The customary flushing of the crowded and poorest parts of the City during the hot months was carried out, followed by the use of deodorants in the channels running through the courts and alleys, etc. 20 Fifty-four places were so treated in the East District; sixty-one in the Middle District; and sixty-two in the West District. In the same connection the entrances to forty-seven courts were cleansed and limewashed at the public expense, viz.: thirteen in the East District; sixteen in the Middle District; and eighteen in the West District. The details of this work will be found in Appendix B. DEODORISING PUBLIC ROADWAYS, CATCH-PITS AND GULLIES. During the summer months the public roadways, catch-pits, and gullies have been thoroughly deodorised, special attention being given to those streets paved with wood, and to the granite pavement in the neighbourhood of Billingsgate Market. 21 By the use of a special disinfectant, introduced by myself, we have been able to manufacture at the City Laboratory, Golden Lane, an enormous quantity of an efficient disinfectant, fulfilling all the requirements of an active germicide and deodorant, which is now produced at a fractional cost, as compared with the amounts formerly paid for patented and proprietary articles. The annual saving to the Commission by the above process has been very great. HOUSE TO HOUSE INSPECTION. The progress made in the house to house inspection throughout the City, as ordered by the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891," will be seen at a glance by reference to the map shewn in Appendix. 22 The work in the three sanitary districts during 1896 is displayed in the following Tables:— west district.

Total 316 25 HOUSES LET IN LODGINGS OR OCCUPIED BY MEMBERS OF MORE THAN ONE FAMILY. The following are the Bye-laws for the regulation of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, finally approved by the Commissioners of Sewers on the 28th April, 1896, and confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 8th May, 1896, and which are now in operation. I am now considering the institution of a system of registration of the places concerned in pursuance of Bye-law No. 5, which will necessarily occupy much time and labour. 26 PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1891. Bye-Laws made by the Commissioners of Sewers of the City ot London, being the Sanitary Authority for the City of London, with respect to Houses Let in Lodgings, or occupied by Members of more than one Family. Interpretation of Terms. 1 In these Bye-laws, unless the context otherwise requires, the following words and expressions have the meanings hereinafter respectively assigned to them; that is to say:— "Sanitary Authority" means the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London; "Lodging-house" means a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family; 27 "Landlord," in relation to a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, means the person (whatever may be the nature or extent of his interest in the premises) by whom or on whose behalf such house or part of a house is let in lodgings, or for occupation by members of more than one family, or who for the time being receives, or is entitled to receive, the rent arising from such letting; "Lodger," in relation to a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family, means a person to whom any room or rooms in such house or part of a house may have been let as a lodging or for his use and occupation, or who may occupy or use any such room or rooms by permission of the person to whom the same may be let. 28 Exempted Houses. 2.

Every lodger in a lodging-house shall, at all times when required by the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector, or any other officer specially appointed or authorized by the Sanitary Authority in that behalf, afford free access for the purpose of inspection to the interior of any room or rooms which may have been let to or may be occupied by such lodger. 8. Where the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector, or any other officer specially appointed or authorized by the Sanitary Authority in that behalf, has, for the purpose of inspection, obtained access to the interior of a lodging-house or to the interior of any room or rooms in such house, a person shall not wilfully obstruct the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector, or any such 33 officer in the inspection of any part of the premises, or, without reasonable excuse, neglect or refuse, when required, to render the Medical Officer of Health, the Sanitary Inspector, or other officer such assistance as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of such inspection. 9. In any case where a lodger in a lodginghouse is entitled to the exclusive use of any court, courtyard, area, or other open space within the curtilage of the premises, such lodger, and in any case where two or more lodgers in a lodging-house are entitled to the use in common of any court, court-yard, area, or other open space within the curtilage of the premises, the landlord shall cause such court, court-yard, area, or other open space to be thoroughly cleansed from time to time as often as may be requisite for the purpose of keeping the same in a cleanly condition. 10. The landlord of a lodging-house shall cause every drain or means of drainage with which any water-closet belonging to such house may communicate to be maintained at all times in good order and efficient action. 34 He shall also cause all such means of ventilation as may be provided in or in connection therewith to be maintained at all times in good order. 11. Every lodger in a lodging-house shall cause all solid or liquid filth or refuse to be removed once at least in every day from every room which has been let to him, and shall once at least in every day cause every vessel, utensil, or other receptacle for such filth or refuse to be thoroughly cleansed. 12.

Provided that the foregoing requirement with respect to the lime-washing of the internal surface of the walls of rooms, staircases, and passages, shall not apply in any case where the internal surface of any such wall is painted, or where the material of or with which such surface is constructed or covered is such as to render the lime-washing thereof unsuitable or inexpedient, and where such surface is thoroughly cleansed, and the paint or other covering is renewed, if the renewal 36 thereof be necessary for the purpose of keeping the premises in a cleanly and wholesome condition. 15. The landlord of a lodging-house shall provide, and maintain in good working order, all requisite means for the ventilation of the rooms, passages, and staircases thereof. A lodger having the exclusive use or occupation of any room in a lodging-house shall cause such room to be thoroughly ventilated daily. The landlord of a lodging house shall cause every room therein which is not in the exclusive use or occupation of a lodger, and every common passage and staircase in such house to be thoroughly ventilated daily. 16.

In every case where, in pursuance of any statutory provision in that behalf, an order of a justice has been obtained for the removal from a lodging-house to a hospital of a person who is suffering from any dangerous infectious disease, and is without proper lodging or accommodation, the landlord of such house, and the lodger to whom any room whereof such person may be an occupant has been let shall, on being informed of such order, forthwith take all such steps as may be requisite on the part of such landlord and of such lodger respectively, to secure the safe and prompt removal of such person in compliance with 38 such order, and shall in and about such removal, adopt all such precautions as, in accordance with any instructions which such landlord and such lodger, respectively, may receive from the Medical Officer of Health of the Sanitary Authority, may be most suitable for the circumstances of the case. 18. A lodger in a lodging-house shall not cause or suffer any animal to be kept in any room which has been let to or is occupied by such lodger, or elsewhere upon the premises in such a manner as to render such room or premises filthy. Penalties. 19. Every person who shall offend against any of the foregoing bye-laws shall be liable for every such offence to a penalty of five pounds, and in the case of a continuing offence to a further penalty of forty shillings for each day after written notice of the offence from the Sanitary Authority: Provided, nevertheless, that the justices or court before whom any complaint may be 39 made or any proceedings may be taken in respect of any such offence may, if they think fit, adjudge the payment as a penalty of any sum less than the full amount of the penalty imposed by this bye-law.

Her Majesty's Home Office Inspectors, working under the above Acts, notified 102 cases, of these, 38 related to premises about to be occupied as workshops, 37 changes of premises, and 27 sanitary defects discovered during the inspections. DAIRIES AND MILK SHOPS. The Corporation of London is the Local Authority in the City for the purpose of regulating the sanitary condition of Dairies and Milk Shops, under the Dairies, Cow Sheds, and Milk Shops Order of 1885, and the work of inspection is at present carried out by Officers appointed by the County Purposes Committee. As remarked in my last Annual Report, this duty should belong to the Commissioners of Sewers, as the Sanitary Authority for the City. Chief Inspector A. J. Street, reports that during the year 324 Dairies and Milk Shops 41 were dealt with, being 14 more than in 1895. Of the total number, 273 were registered at Guildhall, 33 were unregistered and 18 were either closed or demolished. These places are also visited periodically by your Sanitary Inspectors, with a view of discovering and remedying any defects found in the general arrangement of the premises. The Regulations made by the Corporation in respect of Dairies and Milk Shops, were printed in my Report for 1895, and need not be repeated here. BAKEHOUSES. The Commissioners of Sewers are the local authority in respect to bakehouses which are workshops under sections 34, 35 and 81 of the Factory and Workshops Act of 1878. The law requires:— 1. The walls and ceilings of the bakehouse must be painted in oil or varnished every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap every six months, or be limewhited every six months. 42 2. No sleeping place to be allowed on a level with a bakehouse. 3. No water-closet may be within or municate directly with a bakehouse. 4. No drain shall have any opening within a bakehouse. 5. After the 1st January, 1896, no bakehouse shall be established anew below the level of the ground. There are 43 bakehouses in the City of London, viz:—18 in the East Sanitary District, 12 in the Middle, and 13 in the West District, located as shown in the following table:— EAST DISTRICT.

Per cent. Putrid Meat 746 about ; 82 Diseased ,, 112 ,, 12 Meat from animals that had died from accident 48 ,, 5 Offal 9 ,, 1 Total 915 100 The above quantity, arranged in monthly seizures, is shown in the following table : 1896.

It will be noted that the highest figures occur during the months of June, July, August, and September. The weather during this time was exceptionally hot, which accounts for the large quantities seized. A considerable portion of this meat was putrid and therefore unfit for human food, but not actually diseased; moreover, the congested state of the frozen meat trade contributed mainly to the bulk dealt with by the Inspectors As heretofore the condemned meat has been converted into articles of commercial utility and the precautions described in my former reports, for preventing its use as food for men or animals, have been duly observed. The same Contractor has been employed since 1886, during which time he has paid to the Commissioners of Sewers, the following amounts:— 46 £ s. d. 1886 725 12 2 1887 457 9 2 1888 399 1 2 1889 411 1 10 1890 733 9 7 1891 834 1 3 1892 996 19 0 1893 1,419 10 9 1894 1.128 16 3 1895 1,572 4 8 1896 2,352 4 5 These sums have never been sufficient to reimburse the Commissioners for the charges incurred in connection with the business. For theyear now under review the expenses may be estimated at £2,532, comprised in the following items, which however do not include the cost of construction and maintenance of the two condemned meat sheds :— 1. Salaries and pensions of Inspectorial Staff (not including the Medical Officer of Health or the Sanitary Clerk). 47 2. Rent of Inspector's offices at Smithfield, with gas, water, &c. 3. Printed registers, stationery and postage (heavy items). 4. Cost of cartage for removal of condemned meat from the markets to the contractor's factory at Bow in Commissioners' vehicles, with repairs to the latter. 5. Hire of extra vans in times of pressure. 6. Heavy market porterage and petty bursements. 7. Cost of chemicals for disinfecting tanks in the two condemned meat sheds. Early in the year the necessity for more Inspectors of Slaughter-houses and Meat was forced upon my attention, owing to the constantly increasing supplies to the Central Markets and the utter impossibility of properly supervising the same with the then existing 48 Staff, which had remained without change in the number of officers since 1881, a period of fifteen years. In a special report to your Honourable Court upon the subject in March last, I compiled the following facts from the Annual Returns of the Superintendent of the Market. In the six years, 1875 to 1880 inclusive, the average yearly supply was 194,336 tons, whereas in the six years 1890 to 1895 inclusive the supply was 322,771 tons, or 66 per cent, more than in the first named period. With respect to condemned meat, the average seizures between 1875 and 1880 amounted to 215 tons per annum, whereas between 1890 and 1895 the yearly average seizures was no less than 517 tons, an increase of 140 per cent. I selected these periods because at the date of my report they represent the first and the last six years of my term of office. 49 The Court concurred in my recommendations, and two additional Inspectors were forthwith appointed. We have now, therefore, six officers, and the business of inspection is more efficiently performed, the work being distributed as follows, viz.: The Eastern Section of the Central Market—The Western Section (including Cold Air Stores at Smithfield and some Rabbit Shops)—The Poultry and Provision Market— The New Extension (including the present Fish Market when converted for the sale of Meat), and the Leadenhall and Aldgate Markets, with the Slaughter Houses, Lairs and Pounds at Aldgate, the Cold Air Stores in Dowgate Hill, and at Paul's Wharf; and the retail shops throughout the City. Each of the above is assigned to an Inspector who by a system of rotation changes his district every month. The five officers are under the general supervision of the Senior Inspector, G. P. Terrett, who in addition to his daily share in 50 the inspection of the Markets is responsible for due observance of my regulations laid down for the maintenance of discipline and efficiency. The total quantity of meat, &c., delivered at the Central Meat Markets, Smithfield, for the year was 380,543 tons, showing a steady and significant increase over previous years. Owing, however, to the intense heat which prevailed during the summer months the trade did not reap a corresponding advantage, the butchers being very cautious in purchasing, and so much meat having become putrid and therefore unsaleable. The variations of the monthly deliveries will be seen in the following table :— 51 Tons Cwts. Qrs.

The following table shows the total meat supply to the Central Markets since I entered upon my office in 1874 to the end of 1896 inclusive, in the last column of which is shewn the percentage of meat dealt with as unsound.

In the S.S. " Celtic " alone, no less than one hundred tons became putrid in a single voyage, and were removed by the Inspectors. 53 It may be interesting to record the circumstances connected with the meat supply at the Central Markets alone at Christmas time, thus : On Monday the 21st of December, the weighing bridges were opened at 1 a.m., by which time a long string of heavily laden vans were waiting their turn at each bridge, and the work went on interruptedly until 10 o'clock at night, by which time no less than 4,159 tons had passed the scales, being 1,200 tons in excess of any previous experience. I may add that but for the fact of a large consignment of American poultry arriving, in an unwholesome condition, the seizures by the Inspectors would not have exceeded the daily average at this period of the year. The bulk cannot be separated, as the parcels include meat and poultry, but a large proportion included Scotch grown beef, intended for the Christmas market supply. The figures for Leadenhall Market are not available, but as the volume of business transacted there is known to have been on a scale of unprecedented magnitude, it is fair to 54 assume that the percentage of increase would be as large as at the Central Markets. SLAUGHTER HOUSES The whole of the Slaughter Houses within the City are situated in Aldgate, High Street ; they are 14 in number. The extent of Slaughtering becomes less and less each succeeding year, and there are several in which none is done. So far as the City is concerned, I hope this diminution will continue, although I admit it furnishes evidence of the decadence of the home grown cattle trade, and the corresponding dependence of the public upon meat of foreign and colonial growth. PROSECUTIONS AGAINST SENDERS OF BAD MEAT. In nine cases prosecutions were ordered by the Commissioners, in six of which £219 9s. were received for fines and costs, and in three 55 the defendants were sent to prison for periods of from one to three months. The following are the particulars :— 1. On 5th February, a cattle dealer from Trowbridge, Wilts, was summoned at Guildhall Justice Room for sending four quarters of diseased cow beef to the Central Markets, and upon conviction was fined £20 and £3 3s. costs. The Defendant was previously unknown to the Inspectors. 2. On the 5th February, a butcher from Salisbury was summoned at the Guildhall Justice Room for sending the carcase of a diseased lamb to the Central Markets, and was convicted and fined £50 and £3 3s. costs. The Defendant had been cautioned on a former occasion for the like offence. 3. On the 22nd April, a pork butcher of Wingrave, near Aylesbury, was summoned at the Guildhall Justice Room for sending four quarters of diseased beef to the Central Markets. Defendant was fined £100 and £3 3s. costs, or in default one month's imprisonment, which on 56 an urgent appeal to the magistrate was subsequently reduced to £50 and £3 3s. costs. This man had also been cautioned by the Inspector on a former occasion. 4. On the 24th April, a dealer in live and dead cattle, residing at Coate, Devizes, Wiltshire, was convicted at the Guildhall Justice Room of sending four quarters of diseased beef to the Central Markets, and sentenced to three months' imprisonment with hard labour without the option of a fine. Defendant had been previously convicted. 5. On the 19th May, a castrator of Westward Ho, Devonshire, was summoned at the Guildhall Justice Room, for sending the carcase, head, and pluck of a diseased sheep to the Central Markets, and a previous conviction for a similar offence having been proved, the defendant was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, with hard labour, without the option of a fine. 6. On the 24th June, a general dealer, of Bloxham, near Banbury, was summoned at the 67 Guildhall Justice Room, for sending to the Central Meat Markets four quarters of beef and the carcase of a calf in a state of disease. The prisoner refused to be tried by a magistrate, and elected to go to the Central Criminal Court, where he was tried on the 3rd July before the Honourable Mr. Justice Lawrence. A plea of guilty having been offered, the man was sentenced to one month's imprisonment, the judge having taken into consideration that he had been detained in custody for a month prior to his trial. 7. On the 18th November, a farmer, of Sutton, near Guildford, was summoned at the Guildhall Justice Room for sending the carcase of a diseased calf to the Central Markets, and was convicted and fined £50 including costs or six weeks' imprisonment. 8. On the 18th November, a jobbing butcher from Diss, in Norfolk, was summoned for sending eleven pieces of diseased sow pork 58 to Leadenhall Market, and was convicted and fined £10, in default of paying which he went to prison for 21 days. 9. On the 9th December, a farmer, residing at Westhorpe, Suffolk, was summoned for sending four pieces of beef and the heart and tongue of a bullock in a state of disease to the Central Markets. The case was heard at the Guildhall Justice Room, and the defendant was fined £25 and £5 costs, or two months' imprisonment. DISEASED MEAT PROSECUTIONS—1896. Date.

N.B.—The average of Fines and Costs in the 6 cases fined amounts to £36 lls. 6d. 60 FISH. 138,162 tons of fish [of which 95,278 were land-borne and 42,884 water-borne] were received at Billingsgate Market during the year, as against 127,291 tons in 1895, 128,361 tons in 1894 and 130,317 tons in 1893. Of the 138,162 tons delivered at Billingsgate, 1,212 tons, or 0.88 per cent, were condemned and destroyed by the " Fish Meters " at the expense of the Fishmongers' Company. In addition to the above, 951 tons were received at the Farringdon Fish Market. So that the total quantity delivered at the City Markets, exclusive of Leadenhall, was 139,113 tons. As explained in my Annual Report for 1894, the co-operation of the Fishmongers' Company under their Charter (James I., 1604) in no way diminishes the rights of the Commissioners of Sewers to deal with unsound fish, and, as a matter of fact, the Inspectors of Slaughter-houses and Meat do seize and destroy any such discovered, either in the retail shops or fish markets, in cases escaping the observation of the " Fish Meters." 61 Fish so dealt with by your Inspectors is included in their reports weekly. The monthly seizures of fish is shown as under:— Fish Condemned at or near Billingsgate Market, for the Year, 1896 :— 1896. Tons. Cwts. qrs.

The material so disposed of consisted of 150 loads of wet and dried fruit, 4 loads of fish, 21 loads of vegetables, and 15 cwts. of rotten cheese [from the premises of the London and North Western Railway Co.]. The procedure prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, sec. 47 (8) is as follows:— " Where a person has in his possession any " article which is unsound or unwholesome, or " unfit for the food of man, he may, by written " notice to the Sanitary Authority specifying such " article, and containing a sufficient identification " of it request its removal, and the Sanitary " Authority shall cause it to be removed as if it " were trade refuse." And section 33 of the same Act directs that the owner shall pay a reasonable sum for such removal, and such sum in case of dispute shall be settled by the order of a Petty Sessional Court. 63 I have endeavoured to touch upon the subjects laid down for my guidance as your Sanitary Adviser in the " General Order of the Local Government Board, 8th December, 1891," which for your information I here reproduce. " He shall also make an annual Report to the " Sanitary Authority, up to the thirty-first day of " December in each year, comprising a summary " of the action taken, or which he has advised the " Sanitary Authority to take, during the year for " preventing the spread of disease, and an account " of the sanitary state of his district generally, at " the end of the year. The report shall also con" tain an account of the inspections and inquiries " which he has made as to conditions injurious or " dangerous to health existing in his district, and " of the proceedings in which he has taken part or " advised under any Statute so far as such pro" ceedings relate to those conditions; and also an " account of the supervision exercised by him, or " on his advice, for Sanitary purposes over places " and houses that the Sanitary Authority have " power to regulate, with the nature and results of " any proceedings which may have been so required " and taken in respect of the same during the year. " The report shall also record the action taken by " him or on his advice, during the year, in regard 64 " to offensive trades, to factories and workshops, " and to dairies.

The Committee took voluminous evidence on the whole subject, and presented a Report, dated July, 1896, of which the following is a summary of their recommendations. 71 1. That in districts other than county boroughs, where the local authorities fail to put the acts in force, the county council should, by their own officers, take samples for the purposes of the Acts. 2. That in connection with the sale of mixed articles it should be obligatory upon the vendor to supply the purchaser with a label setting forth that the article is mixed. 3. That the statement of admixture on labels should be legibly and distinctly printed and so as not to be obscured by other printed matter, and that existing labels should be subject to the provison mentioned in the concluding paragraph of the section of this Report headed "Labelling and sale of mixed articles." 4. That subject to the limitations indicated in the Report, invoices and equivalent documents should have the force of warranties 72 in the cases of all articles to which the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts apply. 5. That the Commissioners of Customs be authorised to examine and take samples of all food imports at the port of entry with a view to subsequent action, as indicated in the body of the Report. 6. That dealers who obtain supplies of foods from abroad should be required to submit to the Customs guarantees of purity given by the foreign vendor, together with evidence that they have taken measures to see that the goods are such as they are guaranteed to be. 7. That retailers should be empowered to refuse to sell an article otherwise than in a manufacturer's unopened labelled tin or packet. 8. That the powers of Section 3 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act Amendment Act, 1879, as to the taking of samples of milk in transit, should be extended to other articles, 73 9. That the maximum penalty for refusal to sell a sample to the authorised officer be increased. 10. That the division of the sample after purchase and delivery of a portion to the vendor should be compulsory. 11. That samples should be divided into four instead of three parts, and that one of these parts should be at the disposal of the wholesale dealer. 12. That the provisions of Section 5 of the Margarine Act, 1887, as to the exemption of an employer from penalty in certain cases, and punishment of an assistant, should be extended to offences under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. 13. That it should be obligatory upon the magistrates or court to refer articles to the Government Laboratory for analysis when such course is desired by either of the parties to the case. 74 14. That a defendant who proposes to rely upon the warrantry defence should be required to intimate this to the prosecutor within a reasonable time of the service of the summons. 15. That the time allowed for appeal to Quarter Sessions from decisions of local justices should be extended from three to fourteen days. 16. That any person guilty of a second offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts should be liable to a minimum penalty of £5, and that in respect of the third or subsequent offences under those Acts and the Margarine Act, 1887, the punishment of imprisonment without the option of a fine may be inflicted at the discretion of the magistrates or court. 17. That magistrates should be authorised to make orders, at their discretion, requiring a person convicted of offences under the Acts to publish a notification of his conviction in 75 the public press of the locality where the offence occurred. 18. That the definition of the word "food" as used in the Acts should be amended so as to include expressly all articles intended to enter into or be used in the preparation or flavouring of food. 19. That an authority should be constituted who should act as a Court of Reference upon scientific and other questions arising under the Acts, and who should be empowered, at their discretion, to prescribe standards and limits of the quality and purity of food. '20. That candidates for appointment as public analysts should be required to produce evidence that they possess the requisite knowledge of analytical chemistry, in the shape of a diploma or certificate given in respect of such knowledge by a recognised school of chemistry, or scientific examining body, and that in the case of candidates, other than duly registered medical practitioners, specific tests of the requisite knowledge of microscopy and the 76 bearing of adulterations upon health should be prescribed. 21. That the remuneration proposed to be given to a public analyst should be subject to the approval of the central authority. 22. That the artificial colouring of margarine to resemble or imitate butter be prohibited. 23 That the mixing for sale of margarine and butter be prohibited. The Board of Agriculture has been particularly active during the year in making enquiries as to the importation of dairy produce from foreign countries, and in January last the Sanitary Committee instructed me to collect and analyse samples of milk, cream, butter, and margarine, in response to which I placed myself in communication with the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London. 77 New Zealand Butter. Three samples were submitted bearing the following labels:— (1).—Drawn from case marked— Inglewood. Ex S.S. " Tainui" @ New Zealand 341 8 Shed, R.A. Dock. (2).—Drawn from case marked— Ex S.S. "Tainui " @ New Zealand Mount Egmont Brand L.C. Manjorei Dairy. (3).—Drawn fiom case marked— Waverley. . Ex S.S. "Tainui" @ New Zealand 8 Shed, R.A. Dock. These samples were genuine, and free from any admixture with foreign fat (i.e., fat other than butter fat). SWEDISH BUTTER. Two samples, imported from Gothenburg, were examined, labelled as under, viz.:— A.A., S.S. " Thule," from Gothenburg. H., S.S. " Thule," from Gothenburg. Both these samples were genuine. 78 Australian Butter. The following six samples, imported from the colony of Victoria (South-East Australia), were examined. All shipped at Melbourne, marked as follows:— (1).—Drawn from case marked— Ex S.S. " Orient " @ Melbourne Laura Brand. M. Shed, Tilbury Dock. (2).—Drawn from case marked— Ex S.S. "Orient " (g Melbourne Yambuk Brand. M. Shed, Tilbury Dock. (3).—Drawn from case marked— Ex S.S. " Orient " @ Melbourne R Dairy Brand. M. Shed, Tilbury Dock. (4).—Drawn from case marked— Ex S.S. " Orient " @ Melbourne B Brand. Dary M. Shed, Tilbury Dock. (5).—Drawn from case marked— Ex S.S. "Orient" @ Melbourne Tower Hill Park Brand. M. Shed, Tilbury Dock. (6).—Drawn from case marked— Ex S.S. " Orient " @ Melbourne Separate Brand. M. Shed, Tilbury Dock. These six samples were, without exception, genuine butters. 79 Danish Butter. Two samples from Copenhagen came under observation, marked:— S.S. "Perm," from Copenhagen. S Marked 947 A S.S. " Perm," from Copenhagen. Mark A/B Both were genuine. Norwegian Unsweetened Condensed Milk. The contents of two tins, shipped at Christiana, were analysed, both marked:— (1).—S.S. " Rita," from Christiana. (2).—S.S. " Nero," from Christiana. Norwegian Sweetened Condensed Milk. One sample was sent marked:— (1).—S.S. "Nero," from Christiana. The first two samples were prepared by the same firm, and made from concentrated unskimmed milk, without the addition of sugar. 80 The third sample was a fair specimen of whole milk condensed with the addition of a quantity of sugar. Norwegian Tinned Natural Milk. One large tin was received marked— * * * * Pure Milk. Millwall Docks. Ex S.S. " Idun," from Christiana, Mark 168a. This tin contained a quart of milk which was sweet and agreeable to the taste—preserved by a sterilisation process, and a great improvement on the old-fashioned method of preservation by concentration, and the addition of large quantities of sugar. The sample was unskimmed, containing the whole of its cream. It will be noted that none of the foregoing samples were adulterated. I entered upon this investigation in deference to the expressed wish of the Sanitary Committee, to whom I reported in May. It, however, forms 81 no part of my duty as Public Analyst for the City of London, and would, if carried to any practical issue, involve the necessity for special arrangements and the appointment of a number of competent analysts, with a corresponding expenditure. The question is a very wide one and can only be adequately dealt with by a permanent chemical staff, a considerable addition to the number of inspectors, and the willing co-operation of the different trades involved. Nor with these adjuncts should we have any legal right to collect samples outside your jurisdiction, and even if we had this power the law would not permit you to prosecute, it having been ruled in the High Court of Justice that the article seized must be dealt with by the Local Sanitary Authority in which it was taken by the Inspector. All these considerations point to the work being done by a department of the Government, who possess already a number of chemical experts both at Somerset House and the Custom House. 82 Four prosecutions were instituted under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, with fines of £3, £2, £15, and two shillings, and one prosecution under the Margarine Act, where a fine of 10s. was imposed. The costs in these cases varied from 2s. to 7s. 6d. The New River Company's water supply to the City of London has been examined from time to time. I have again to acknowledge the assistance rendered in this part of my duty by Mr. Howard B. Turner, F.I.C., Sanitary Clerk. I have the honour to be. Your obedient Servant, WM.

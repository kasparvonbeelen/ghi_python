GUILDHALL, E.C.2. Telephone: 01-606 3030. My Lord Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen. I have the honour to submit the following report on the work of the Department during the year ending 31st December, 1971. During the year much time and effort was devoted by Officers in the Department to the promotion of the clauses in the City of London (Various Powers) Bill 1971 which sought to ensure that only fuels of a low sulphur content were burnt in furnaces within the City. There was strong opposition to the proposals by interested parties, but eventually the City Corporation were successful in obtaining the legal powers necessary to embark on this further effort to reduce atmospheric pollution in the City. The City Corporation have always been pioneers in this particular field and, whilst these additional measures will take up to fifteen years to implement fully, it is hoped that the strenuous endeavours which have been made to secure these new powers will prove to have been worthwhile. I am grateful to all those who have contributed to the work during the year, especially the Chairman and members of the Port and City of London Health and Social Service Committees and the staff of the Department. Co-operation on the part of the medical and nursing staff of St. Bartholomew's Hospital has continued in a most generous manner. I have the honour to be, Ladies and Gentlemen, Your Obedient Servant, W.G. SWANN, M.D., B.Sc., Medical Officer of Health, Port and City of London. 5 HOUSING Housing Acts 1. Number of houses which on inspection were considered to be unfit for human habitation:- 14 2. Number of houses in which defects were remedied in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers:- 5 3. Number of representations made to the Local Authority with a view to (a) the serving of notices requiring the execution of works or (b) the making of demolition or closing orders:- (a) 2 (b) 1 4. Number of notices served during the execution of works:- NIL 5. Number of houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices:- NIL 6. Number of demolition or closing orders made:- NIL 7. Number of houses in respect of which an undertaking was accepted under subsection (4) of section 16 of the Housing Act, 1957:- 1 8. Number of houses demolished:- 2 9. Number of inspections and reinspections of housing accommodation:- 55 During the year under review the Inspectorate have continued to carry out inspections of private sector houses in the City. Inspections have been carried out of accommodation associated with premises used for other purposes, such as caretakers' and managers' flats, as a matter of routine surveillance of housing in the City. In all, 29 inspections were carried out, necessitating 21 re-inspections, of which only three primary visits arose out of complaints. Individual Houses — Part II, Housing Act, 1957 In February of this year, as a result of a routine inspection, one house was found to be unfit and not capable of repair at reasonable cost. As this was a property owned by the Corporation and administered through the Planning and Communications Committee, the matter was referred to the City Surveyor for appropriate action and it was agreed that rehousing of the tenant be arranged and the demolition of the property secured. At the end of the year this had not been effected, but it is hoped that the matter will be resolved in the near future. One other house was found to be unfit and two others required repair. In each case remedial works were carried out by the owners after appropriate representations by this Department. On two occasions owners approached the Department with proposals for improving dwelling-houses and advice was given in each case. Clearance Area - Part III, Housing Act, 1957 Fleet Lane Clearance Area Objections have been received to the decision of the Court of Common Council made during 1970 to declare 29, 30 and 31, Fleet Lane, a clearance area and to compulsorily purchase the cleared land. On 25th June, 1971, the Department of the Environment informed the Corporation of London of the Minister's intention to hold a local Public Inquiry to hear these objections. The Inquiry date was set for 1st September but subsequently it was cancelled in order that negotiations might take place between the owners of the property and the Corporation. At the end of the year under review these negotiations had not progressed. Meanwhile the condition of the premises continues to deteriorate. 6 The following report has been received from the Housing Manager:- "During the year 191 families were rehoused leaving 565 families on the housing register at the end of December 1971. With the second stage of the Middlesex Street Estate almost completed arrangements were made for the completion of the remainder of the redevelopment in one final stage. The estate when completed will provide a shopping and residential precinct of 181 flats and 38 shops. Good progress was made on the construction of the Old People's Unit, comprising 60 units of accommodation and 30 family residential units, on the site of Otto House, Sydenham Hill. The fourth and final stage of the redevelopment of the Holloway Estate was approved and this will provide 62 flats on the site between Camden Road and Parkhurst Road of which 50 flats will be for Corporation use and 12 ground floor flats, designed to meet the special needs of disabled people, will be let to John Groom's Crippleage on terms agreed. Building works will commence in 1972. Of the 2,100 flats and houses in the Barbican residential development some 700 have been completed and occupied, over 200 of these during the year. There are now approximately 1,200 residents in Barbican including 100 children. Work commenced on the Barbican Arts Centre. The Barbican Y.M.C.A. building was completed and officially opened by the Lord Mayor. By the end of the year the first few of the 200 residents had taken up occupation." EXAMINATION OF WATER SAMPLES The Corporation of London exercise their functions with regard to water supply under the Public Health Acts, 1936 and 1961, and the Water Acts of 1945, 1948 and 1955. There is also a provision in the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963, which requires all employers of shops and office workers to ensure that there is available to their staff an adequate supply of wholesome drinking water. In the City there are two sources of water supply:- (1) From the statutory water undertaker, which in the case of the City is the Metropolitan Water Board. (2) From deep wells which supply drinking water to private premises within the City. There are 114 such wells in use and they serve 54 premises. The supply from the Metropolitan Water Board is completely safe and satisfactory at the point of delivery to the premises, but it is the responsibility of the Public Health Department to ensure that this supply is potable when it reaches the consumers within the premises. Various business premises were visited, some as a result of complaint, to examine the distribution of Metropolitan Water Board supplies and during the year 16 inspections were carried out. This included the inspection of tanks, installation services and various draw-off points. Thirty-seven bacteriological samples were taken from food preparation points of drinking water sources within the buildings concerned. As will be seen from the accompanying table of the bacteriological examination of service points within premises, the percentage of adverse results appears high. These are, however, repeat samples in one building where difficulties were being experienced. The water from the bore holes of the private wells comes from the hard grey chalk strata known as the London Basin, some 200 to 600 feet below the City ground level. This supply is satisfactory in quality and quantity and is a non-plumbo-solvent water with a total hardness of about 325ppm. The sterilisation of this water is usually carried out by means of liquid chlorination when the supply is pumped into the storage tank and the chlorine content of the water is tested by the Public Health Inspector concerned. In some cases the water is filtered by means of diatomaceous filters, which control any bacteriological contamination and also eliminate any iron hydroxides which may be derived from the chalk strata. Of a total number of 83 samples taken during the year to bacteriological examination 81 were found to be satisfactory and 2 were unsatisfactory necessitating further investigation. In both cases the appropriate action was taken to prevent any further contamination of the system. 7 Swimming Baths There are three swimming baths within the City, which were visited weekly during the period of the year these baths were in use. The water from these swimming baths was sampled for bacteriological and chlorine contamination and pH value. A total number of 83 samples were taken for bacteriological examination, 166 for the assessment of chlorine content and 83 for the assessment of pH value. Of these samples, 5 were found to be bacteriologically unsatisfactory. In the case of the unsatisfactory samples, instructions were given to the various engineers dealing with these baths to close the pool or, alternatively, maintain it in such a manner as to eliminate contamination. As a result one swimming pool was temporarily closed and extra chlorination and cleaning was undertaken in the other pools affected. In the case of the closed pool, this was emptied, cleaned, re-chlorinated and refilled, and further tests were carried out before the pool was allowed to re-open. A table indicating the results of the samples taken is shown below. The following table shows details of bacteriological examinations of both drinking water supplies and swimming bath water. Source of Supply Number of Samples Number of Samples giving results above 0 per 100 mis. Number of Samples giving plate counts above 0 Cols/ml after 24 hours at 37°c. Coliform Count Bact. Coli. (Type 1) 1. Deep wells within the City area 83 2 - 58 2. Metropolitan Water Board, at service points within the premises 37 3 1 34 3. Swimming Pools within the City 83 3 2 43 TOTAL 203 8 3 135 The Director of Water Examination of the Metropolitan Water Board has supplied the following Report:- "1.(a) The supply was satisfactory both as to (i) quality, and (ii) quantity throughout 1971. (b) All new and repaired mains are disinfected with chlorine; after a predetermined period of contact the pipes are flushed out and refilled; samples of water are then collected from these treated mains; and the mains are returned to service only after the analytical results are found to be satisfactory. The quality control from these laboratories is carried out by means of daily sampling from sources of supply, from the treatment works or well stations, from the distribution system, and through to the consumer. Any sign of contamination or any other abnormality is immediately investigated. (c) (i) The Board has no record of the number of structurally separate dwellings supplied in your area, but the population supplied direct according to the Registrar-General's estimates at 30th June, 1971, was 4,234. (ii) No houses were permanently supplied by stand-pipe. (d) No artifical fluoride is being added, and where the fluoride content is indicated in the analyses it represents the naturally occurring fluoride in the water. 2.(a) The supply was derived from the following works and pumping stations:- Thames Valley works via Battersea Pumping Station and New River-derived water from Stoke Newington Works. No new sources of supply were instituted and there were no changes to the general scheme of supply in your area. The number of samples collected and the bacteriological and chemical analyses of the supply from the above sources after treatment are shown on the attached sheets. (b) On account of their hardness content and alkaline reaction the Board's river and well water supplies are shown to be not plumbo-solvent. It should, however, be appreciated that all types of water pick up varying amounts of metal from the material of water piping particularly when it is newly installed; this applies to copper, zinc, iron and also to lead." 8 METROPOLITAN WATER BOARD - WATER EXAMINATION DEPARTMENT AVERAGE RESULTS OF THE CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF WATER APPLIED TO THE CORPORATION OF LONDON FOR 1971 Milligrammes per litre (unless otherwise stated) Description of the Samples Number of Samples Ammoniacal Nitrogen Albuminoid Nitrogen Nitrate Nitrogen Oxygen abs. from KMn04 4 hrs. at 27°C.

Since people, quite rightly, are showing a greater interest in the surroundings in which they work and reside it is not surprising that the number of complaints concerning noise in the City show an increase, and that the number of complaints requiring continued surveillance likewise show a substantial increase. The figures for complaints and re-visits concerning noise during the year under review are respectively 261 and 1,202. People in the past have tried, perhaps, to show a degree of tolerance, or an appreciation of the fact that some work inevitably creates noise, and have put up with a degree of "inconvenience" before complaining. Probably they are now realising that some of thrs noise is not at all necessary and that much of it could be substantially reduced with a little forethought. As regards the noise-makers, it is appreciated that they have work to carry out, but they should also realise that their activities are going to give rise to resentment and ill will unless they give proper and due consideration to the avoidance of noise before commencing their operations. It should not be assumed when they are working, out of normal hours or at week-ends, that the City is derived of all occupants. Neither should it be assumed, as regards noisy work on building sites and non-urgent roadworks, that noise that might be acceptable during normal working hours is likely to be tolerated in the evenings and on Saturdays and Sundays. On the other hand, complainants ought to appreciate that they may have to endure short periods of quite high levels of noise, i.e. two or three nights, or at week-ends when heavy machinery or equipment is being handled. This is brought about by traffic management and other conditions outside the City and it is unlikely that complete control can be exercised in this direction. COMMON LODGING HOUSES A common lodging house is defined in the Public Health Act, 1936, as "A house (other than a public assistance institution) provided for the purposes of accommodating by night poor persons, not being members of the same family, who resort thereto and are allowed to occupy one common room for the purpose of sleeping or eating, and includes where part only of a house is so used, the part so used." Each year the local authority has to consider, after an inspection and report has been made, as to whether such premises are suitable for use as a common lodging house, having regard to sanitation and water supply, and other respects, including means of escape in case of fire. It cannot be assumed that these premises will always be recommended for continued use as a common lodging house, but it should be borne in mind that if they are closed down many men would be homeless. And, while local authorities have no responsibility for the care of these men, except in certain specified classes of people, common humanity dictates a reasonable approach. The only common lodging house in the City is situated in Middlesex Street. The premises consist of dormitories on six floors including the ground floor, with a canteen in the basement. The canteen in the basement is one of the better features of this common lodging house and it provides reasonable quality food at low prices. The canteen is frequented by many men who do not live in this lodging house and it is known that many of these unfortunate people are liceinfested and usually sleep rough in the surrounding areas. 10 During the year, 63 early-morning inspections have been carried out for the purpose of examining the bedding for evidence of lice infestation. Some lodgers attempt to remove evidence of vermin, and when this is suspected as the result of observation or the presence of bloodmarks on the sheets a more thorough investigation of the bedding is carried out. Usually the presence of vermin is easily detected as movement is seen when the sheets are pulled back or the pillow turned over. On each inspection approximately 100 beds were examined. Of these an average of nine were found to be infested, although it seems certain that some cases went undetected for some time before being noted. Compared with the previous year the degree of infestation has shown a slight reduction, as will be seen from the following table:- Beds Inspected Verminous Average Infestation Rate Total No. Cleansed 1970 2,251 220 9.8% 1,052 1971 6,216 561 9.0% 1,094 Undoubtedly, a more efficient inspection system, coupled with greater experience of the problem, has achieved this improvement, which has been appreciated by both the Salvation Army and the lodgers. Serious breakdowns in laundry services contributed to higher infestation rates during part of the year. Although the accommodation is very basic the occupants vary in their habits of personal cleanliness. Transmission of vermin from bed to bed in the larger dormitories often occurs. Using the model bye-laws as a standard, some rooms are overcrowded. It cannot be doubted that the close proximity of beds is a significant factor which facilitates the spread of lice from bed to bed. One room occupied by lodgers who also carry out the more menial tasks on the premises has 16 occupants instead of the 12 which would be permitted if the model bye-laws standard were applied. A reduction in the number of occupants of this particular room has been promised as soon as suitable beds become available. The overcrowding has also been aggravated by the demands of the fire authorities, who have required longer gangways and additional fire doors. The only standard for common lodging houses is contained in the model bye-laws, which requires 40 sq. ft. per person or 400 cu. ft. where the ceiling height is below eight feet. Lice infestation will continue so long as the present numerical standard of occupation is permitted. Criticism has been made of the laundry facilities during the year under review, but at the time of writing these facilities have been considerably improved. After various representations made by the Public Health Inspector, a regular weekly change of sheets has been put into operation. The model bye-laws also require that beds should be exposed to the air. The stench from this source is at times appalling. In practice the beds are made up as soon as possible and so during the winter months bed-making continues in poor light, which results in vermin being overlooked, it would be foolhardy to suggest that only the Public Health Inspector should carry out an inspection of beds. It is highly desirable that he be assisted by the day-to-day vigilance of the bed-makers and other members of the Salvation Army staff. Inspection during the winter months is more arduous, since a hand-held torch is required to scan the beds. Since the artificial lighting is kept on all night it is of a very poor standard and some form of dimming device would certainly assist in the management of this type of accommodation. This common lodging house sinks into an abysmal state of uncleanliness during the nighttime, although the subsequent daily efforts made to keep these premises clean do not fall short of what is required. As in so many facets of community life in England to-day, a sense of corporate moral responsibility has been lost and many lodgers have no consideration at all for their neighbours. More personal attention to clean habits and a greater sense of corporate living would substantially improve this common lodging house. The immediate objective will continue to be the reduction of the level of verminous infestation and the encouragement of better personal and corporate hygiene. Where a personal approach has been made, as distinct from a letter sent from this Department, men who have initially refused to attend the cleansing station have responded. In the past, cleansing stations have come to be associated with a degree of unpleasantness, but when men have once used the facilities in Moor Lane they do not now hesitate to return. The work connected with the inspection and supervision of this common lodging house is timeconsuming, but in terms of community benefit it is undoubtedly worth while in an effort to prevent lice from being a possible nuisance at places of work or in public transport. OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES ACT, 1963 This Act was passed in 1963 to provide protection for people employed in shops and offices and thus to take the same interest in their welfare as factory workers had enjoyed for many years through the Factory Acts. First of all, such premises where people were employed had to be registered with the authority responsible for enforcing the Act. An abstract of the Act, costing only a few pence, was published for employers to put in a prominent position so that employees could be made aware of their rights. 11 Unfortunately there is no provision in the Act for prior approval of office premises and it sometimes happens that, notwithstanding heavy expenditure on alterations or improvements, a subsequent inspection of the premises may indicate the existence of contraventions of the Act which necessitate further expenditure. This sequence of events is understandably not received with a good grace by the responsible persons, whether they be owners or occupiers of office accommodation. There is also no provision in the Act for the service of statutory notices and the existence of a contravention constitutes an offence in respect of which it is possible to take immediate legal action. However, it is the normal practice of this Department to indicate all contraventions which are discovered as a result of routine inspections to the responsible person, either verbally or in writing, thereby enabling appropriate remedial measures to be taken without the necessity of initiating more formal action. This method of enforcement has worked smoothly, although it must be admitted that, at times, owners and occupiers of office premises have been somewhat dilatory in the execution of essential works. Over the years the principal yardstick for measuring the rate of progress made in the implementation of the provisions of the Act has naturally been the number of general inspections carried out. In this connection, however, it is important to point out that because of the great variations in the size of individual occupations of office space the number of general inspections does not necessarily give an accurate indication of the time and effort expended on this work. However, the improved rate of progress achieved in the last few years has again been maintained in the year under review, the number of general inspections amounting to 2,103 as compared with 2,168 in the previous year. While this figure is not as high as could have been wished, it does however give some indication of the continuous effort which has been made by the Public Health Inspectors engaged on this work, and undoubtedly would have been higher had it not been for an unfilled vacancy in this section of the department. Some of the work carried out has been nullified by the continuous changeover in the occupancy of office accommodation caused by the removal of tenants and the demolition of office blocks which has taken place as an inevitable preliminary to large new developments. It is therefore almost impossible to reach a state when it can be said at any given moment of time that all offices in use in the City have received at least one initial inspection. The table below shows the number of written intimations which have been sent during the course of the year, together with an analysis of the varying types of contraventions which were discovered. Whilst from a technical point of view ventilation continues to be the most difficult problem to resolve, it has been noted that there are an increasing number of offices where there is an absence of thorough day-to-day cleaning, which, it is understood, has been caused by the difficulty of recruiting cleaning staff. The attempt to ease this shortage by the use of contract cleaners has not been entirely successful as such cleaning tends to be superficial rather than thorough. The enforcement of the provisions of the Hoists and Lifts Regulations which came into operation during 1969 has proved to be an onerous and time-consuming additional responsibility, and it is surprising to find the number of small firms, particularly caterers, who have no knowledge whatsoever of the requirements of these Regulations, which were designed to ensure that all hoists and lifts in office and shop premises shall be inspected by a competent person at sixmonthly intervals and that effective steps will be taken to enforce the execution of necessary repairs and renewals and to bring all such lifts up to a prescribed standard of safety. During the year 238 reports were received regarding lifts which required either substantial overhaul or the execution of repairs or renewals. This necessitated a separate communication to the responsible person in each individual case and a varying number of "follow-up" visits in order to ensure that the required work was subsequently carried out. In one case it was necessary to institute legal proceedings where in an office block it was found that the lift had not been enclosed to the full height in accordance with the provisions of Regulations 7(1) to (4), and notwithstanding several written representations by this Department there had been failure to carry the necessary work. The defendants pleaded guilty, and although the requisite work was put in hand after the service of the summons and had been completed by the time of the hearing, nevertheless a fine of £25 was imposed and the defendants were ordered to pay £10 towards the cost of the prosecution. So far as is known, this was the first prosecution of its kind in the country. The fact that a fatal accident occurred during the year to a person using a lift in a block of offices in the City indicates the importance of ensuring the effective enforcement of the Hoists and Lifts Regulations. Unfortunately the imprecise wording of Section 6(2) of the Regulations which states: "The report shall be preserved and shall be kept readily available for inspection by an Inspector for two years after the date of the signing of the report" has resulted in much wastage of the time of the Public Health Inspectors of this Department as there is no agreed definition of the words "readily available". It would undoubtedly be helpful to an enforcing authority if this Regulation were altered to read "... readily available on the premises unless alternative arrangements are made to the satisfaction of the appropriate local authority." 12 As indicated above, there is a statutory obligation on the part of all employers to give notice of their intention to employ office workers. This notification should be given on the prescribed form, but it has been found as a result of routine inspections that in practice many employers fail to carry out their obligation. However, apart from the statistical information provided as to the number and sex of the employees, one is doubtful as to the advantage gained to anyone by this statutory registration procedure, particularly as in any case it is impracticable to enforce.

During the year 22 inspections were made. The Greater London Council (General Powers) Act, 1967 requires all persons who wish to carry on the business of a hairdresser or barber to be registered in respect of their premises. During the year, no hairdressers and barbers were so registered, leaving the total on the Register at 69.

SANITARY CIRCUMSTANCES The general sanitary supervision has been maintained and in this connection 16,837 inspections have been made. As a consequence of these inspections, it was necessary to serve 2,289 Intimation Notices. Tenement Houses were inspected and the only common lodging house in the City was kept under regular supervision. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION CITY OF LONDON (VARIOUS POWERS) ACT, 1954 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1956 CLEAN AIR ACT, 1968 CHIMNEY HEIGHT REGULATIONS, 1969 CLEAN AIR (EMISSION OF GRIT AND DUST FURNACES) REGULATIONS, 1970 The above-mentioned Acts and Regulations provide a broad basis for controlling pollution of the atmosphere in the City and are enforced by the City's Public Health Inspectors, who carried out 1,899 inspections and observations during the year. The following statistics indicate the extent of the work undertaken in this particular field:- 1. Initial inspections — 549 2. Re-inspections - 182 3. Observations made — 583 4. Contraventions noted - 31 5. Verbal intimations — 41 6. Notices served - 6 7. Inspections in connection with special survey of SO2 concentration — 249 While making a study of SO2 pollution in the City area it has been observed that in the past five years most areas in the British Isles showed a steady decline in the concentration of SO2. In the provinces there has been a decline of about 20% and in the Greater London area a decline of about 10% in this concentration, but the level in the City of London has increased and the number of days in the year on which the level of SO2 in the air has exceeded 500 micrograms per cubic meter is greater than in any other similar area. It is somehwat disturbing that while there appears to be a decrease of SO2 in the surrounding areas, the intensity of redevelopment and the installation of larger furnaces using oil of a high sulphur content seem to have aggravated the problem of SO2 pollution in the City. These conditions have been a source of concern and, as a result, research into the problem was carried out by a number of my staff. 17 Mr. Stanley Cohen, C.B.E., C.C., a Member of the Health Committee, showed considerable interest in the matter and on the recommendation of the Committee the City Remembrancer was instructed by the Court of Common Council to promote legislation with a view to mitigating this form of pollution. Suitable Clauses were included in the City of London (Various Powers) Bill which was presented to Parliament in November 1970. The clauses attracted a certain amount of opposition, particularly on behalf of the oil interests who were fearful that a precedent would have consequences in other areas of the country, but in the end a satisfactory compromise was achieved and the Act received the Royal Assent on the 5th August, 1971. The material provisions from the Act came into operation on the 1st January 1972. Their effect will be gradual but by 1987 it will not be lawful to burn fuel oil in a furnace anywhere in the City when the weight of sulphur exceeds one per cent of the weight of the oil. It is hoped that the implementation of the Act will result in a considerable reduction in the ground-level concentration of SO2. During the year four applications have been received under the Chimney Height Regulations, 1968. These regulations provide powers to ensure that chimneys are carried to such a height as to disperse the flue gases, thereby minimising any nuisance to the surrounding locality. As these Regulations deal only with installations which are 1¼ million British thermal units an hour or more, some appliances are installed without any application having to be made to adjust the chimney height. One particular problem is that of gas-fired appliances which are being installed in the City and which dilute the flue gases by means of introducing air into the flue, at a ratio of 50 to 1, and then discharge the resultant mixture near ground level. In practice this method has proved to be unsatisfactory because of the special conditions which exist in the City area. The flue gases are discharged in confined areas within the premises, usually a lighting well, and certain forms of pollution can arise and be retained in such an area, thereafter entering the windows and other apertures in the building. Many suggestions have been made and much useful advice given to the various installers of this equipment, and usually they are prevailed upon to discharge the flue gases in such a position as not to cause pollution. The enactment of the 1968 Clean Air Act and subsequently the Clean Air (Emission of Dark Smoke) (Exemption) Regulations, 1969, have permitted the burning of bonfires, subject to certain conditions, but the provisions and the conditions laid down therein are so wide that they have tended to make the prevention of bonfires and smoke therefrom impossible. Measurement of Atmospheric Pollution These measurements have continued throughout the year at two stations with volumetric apparatus. The purpose of these instruments is two-fold:- (1) To give indication of the pollution of S02- Measurement is made in micrograms per cubic metre. (2) To give an indication of particulate matter which is in the atmosphere. This is also measured in micrograms per cubic metre. The measurement of atmospheric pollution in this manner is carried out on a nationwide basis and the results are forwarded to the Ministry of Technology at Warren Springs for computation. It is becoming apparent that in the near future the number of sets of volumetric apparatus in the City will have to be increased. This is because concentrations of pollution can vary markedly by reason of very localised conditions and, as we now require more information in order to ascertain accurately the level of localised concentrations of sulphur dioxide, arrangements are to be made for the existing volumetric apparatus stations to be increased by three, giving a total of five such stations. Samples of rain-water and various pollutants therein are taken from a standard deposit gauge situated on the roof of the Guildhall. This apparatus had to be moved during the year because of the rebuilding programme on the west side of the Guildhall, when it was found that cement concrete from a hopper which was being used in the building operation was being dropped in the deposit gauge. These samples are submitted to the Corporation's Public Analyst monthly and the resultant analysis is returned to the Health Department. 18 TABLE 1 Results obtained in 1971 of the monthly observations of rainfall and deposited matter by means of the deposit gauge at Guildhall.

(b) Control work in the sewers. (a) Premises Premises inspected (routine or on complaint) 2,923 Complaints received:- (i) House mouse infestations 1,008 (ii) Rat infestations (minor) 53 Initial baiting sites selected 9,817 Total operational visits 5,107 Efforts were made to establish sources of infestation and advice given and "follow up" visits paid to check on the effectiveness of treatment. (b) Destruction of rats in sewers Three direct treatments were carried out in March, September and December, using Ruskarsenic (in March), Racumin 57 (in September) and Rusk-arsenic (in December). In June, baiting treatments were carried out and where takes were recorded poison baits, using rusk-zinc phosphide, were applied. This test-baiting showed a decline compared with 1970. All the sewer treatments were carried out in good dry-weather conditions. 20 PIGEON CONTROL The Public Health Act, 1961, gives local authorities permissive power to take steps to abate or mitigate nuisance from pigeons believed to have no owner. Complaints have been received of the fouling caused by the excessive numbers of pigeons in some parts of the City and of the damage they cause to the young plants in the gardens being established to brighten the City scene. The City Corporation continued to use the services of a pest control firm and in addition control measures were undertaken directly by the Corporation staff, but it is work that has to be carried out with circumspection and skill as there is no intention to eliminate all bird life from the City. These control measures generally have been successful in preventing the pigeon population reaching unacceptable levels.

Public Health staff working in the field have felt for some time that many of the problems associated with catering establishments could have been avoided with a proper system of prior approval, with adequate safeguards for the existing caterer. The great majority of conscientious caterers, and this certainly applies to the City caterers, can view such proposals with assured confidence, since it is only those who are attempting to commence operations in cramped, inadequate premises without essential basic facilities (or those who radically alter their modes of business) would have anything about which to be concerned. Difficulties always arise when people endeavour to convert for catering purposes premises which are inherently unsuitable. The past year has seen an appreciable increase in the growth of sandwich bars, from which premises there are also large sales of "take-away" foods, such as soups, pies, sandwiches, tea or coffee. The large traditional multiple caterers continue their policy of withdrawal from the City and in many cases the sandwich bars with associated sales take their place. The serving of food in public houses is still expanding, particularly at the bar counter, and it is prudent that more consideration should be given to the protection of food on display in these circumstances. 21 Associated with these changes in the pattern of eating has been the remarkable increase in the number of food-vending machines installed, more particularly in the larger dining clubs and canteens serving such City institutions as the head offices of the banks and insurance firms. The use of vending machines started some years ago, initially dispensing beverages such as teas, coffee, hot chocolate and fruit drinks, but they can now be found serving soups and a variety of packaged "ready-to-eat" foods. These machines secure a large saving in staff and there are a number of companies now operating in the City area who offer a full vending service, both in the supply of food and drinks and the regular servicing of the machines. The stocking-up of these vending machines is another part of the services offered. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that regular servicing of vending machines is absolutely essential. Whilst full servicing instructions are issued when these vending machines are supplied, and tuition is given in such servicing to responsible members of the staff where the machine is installed, it has been found that after a time this servicing tends to be treated in somewhat desultory manner, and at times is completely overlooked, with disastrous results. It is felt in this connection that full and regular servicing contracts should be established at the outset with the companies actually fitting these vending machines. Since the G.P.O. became a public corporate body during 1969 and thus came under the jurisdiction of the City Corporation in respect of their premises situated within the City, a regular liaison has been established and maintained with the Regional Catering Officer, Post Office Central Personnel Department, now situated at Euston. Such jurisdiction covers all catering services, varying from the large London Telecommunications Region establishments to the small branch post office canteens. The Post Office has an immense task but there is no doubt that with this co-operation they are achieving better catering facilities for their staff. Four Public Health Inspectors are engaged full time on the inspection of catering establishments and during the year under review 769 routine primary inspections were carried out, together with 2,608 other inspections. This resulted in 309 written communications being sent to the proprietors of catering establishments, drawing their attention to a variety of unsatisfactory conditions. Substantial improvements have resulted from this work. In addition, 127 verbal representations were made regarding relatively minor contraventions of the Food Hygiene Regulations. Legal proceedings were instituted in three cases where exceptionally filthy and unhygienic conditions were found to exist. A conviction was secured in each instance, resulting in the imposition of fines and costs totalling £892. It is still surprising that it is possible to come across the occasional caterer who expects to escape the consequences of gross neglect. During the year a marked increase was noted in the number of complaints received and a considerable amount of time was spent in the subsequent investigation of these particular complaints. This upsurge in numbers may be due to an increasing awareness on the part of the public to the fact that the Public Health Department is always ready to deal with such matters when brought to the attention of the Inspectors concerned. Publicity in the local and national press has without doubt contributed to this growing interest on the part of the public. Continued surveillance on the part of the Inspectors concerned in the inspection of catering premises ensures that every effort is made to maintain a satisfactory standard in existing establishments and special attention has been paid to prospective new catering units where intending caterers have approached this department for advice. In this connection a detailed schedule of requirements has been formulated and has been well received by both prospective caterers and their contractors, who have found it of great assistance to them in formulating proposals which are satisfactory both to the trade and to this department. FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1955 SAMPLING Foods purchased by the Sampling Officer during the year constituted a representative selection of all articles of food in regular use. Of the 381 samples purchased, only 8, or 2.2%, were the subject of an adverse report by the Public Analyst. Most of the irregularities referred to infringements of the Labelling of Food Order and were resolved after consultation with the manufacturers and packers concerned. All formal samples of milk-22 in all-purchased from milk roundsmen and City restaurants were up to standard. 22 Of 17 formal samples of spirits purchased, one sample of whisky was found, on examination by the Public Analyst, to be adulterated by water. The remainder of the samples were found to be up to standard. In the case of the adulterated sample of whisky, legal proceedings were taken against the firm concerned and a conviction was obtained. An informal sample of minced meat was found on examination to contain preservatives, as a result of which a formal sample was purchased from the same premises. This was also found to contain preservatives. Representations were made to the firm concerned, who stated in reply that the preservatives had been added by the Manager, who mistakenly thought these were permitted, as he had read an article in the Meat Traders Journal regarding the addition of preservatives as a way of improving the look of minced meat exposed for sale. The firm immediately ceased this practice and gave an undertaking that in future no preservatives would be used in minced meat. In view of this undertaking no further action was taken in the matter. As in previous years made-up foods, such as pies of all descriptions, sausages, luncheon meats and the like, were purchased as it is felt that this type of food is more prone to contamination through improper handling than other foods which are prepacked by the manufacturers before sale to the retailer. It is usual to purchase these commodities on Monday morning as most retail food premises in the City area are closed from Friday evening to Monday morning and it is felt that this would give a more accurate indication of the freshness or otherwise of food offered for sale during the early part of the week. None of the samples purchased in this manner was the subject of an adverse report by the Public Analyst, and this is an improvement on previous years when legal proceedings were taken against food firms for selling pies, fish cakes and chicken croquettes which were mouldy and unfit for human consumption. FOOD HYGIENE (MARKETS, STALLS AND DELIVERY VEHICLES) REGULATIONS, 1966 Legal proceedings were instituted in two cases under the provisions of the Food Hygiene (Markets, Stalls and Delivery Vehicles) Regulations, 1966, where very dirty and unhygienic conditions were found to exist in two delivery vans. One, carrying meat from Smithfield to a retail butcher in South London, had been detained in Aldermanbury Square. The other van had been detained by the police whilst selling ice-cream in Monument Street and subsequently reported by them to this department. These two prosecutions resulted in total fines of £31 and total costs of £21. The increasing number of City workers and the annually swelling volume of tourists visiting the City have resulted in an increase in the number of opportunist street traders selling food from unlicensed and grossly unhygienic stalls and vehicles. These itinerant traders are proving to be increasingly difficult to deal with, both by the police and by this department. For some time the Department has been concerned in dealing with the problems caused by unauthorised itinerant vendors of ice-cream and hot dogs. The relevant legislation dealing with these food businesses is contained in the Food Hygiene (Markets, Stalls and Delivery Vehicles) Regulations, 1966. These regulations set forth requirements on such matters as personal cleanliness, fitness of food, hygienic condition of the stall, precautionary measures against contamination, provision of washing facilities for attendants and equipment, means of refuse disposal and display of name and address of the person carrying on the business. Fly-by-night traders as recent press reports have shown, prefer to run the risk of prosecution for unlicensed trading rather than display their identity, and to treat the occasional small fine as part of normal business overheads. They work on a day-to-day basis for quick profits and show little regard for the elementary principles of hygiene. Since they are generally of the transient type and unco-operative, considerable difficulties are experienced in enforcement. Addresses given as base premises and home addresses are immediately suspect and may prove to be only of a temporary nature. Following complaint, there is no way in which immediate protection can be afforded to the general public as there is no power to remove the stall from the street. The normal summons procedure used at present is slow and cumbersome and is not capable of dealing with these opportunist traders, since by the time action has been authorised they may no longer be at the original address. They may still be operating in the streets, using the same extremely unhygienic vehicles. A further problem is that, as prices are very rarely displayed, visitors can easily be overcharged and short-changed. It would be an advantage if vendors could be compelled to display a price-list. Undoubtedly the cheating and swindling of foreign nationals is a difficult problem but there is no need to shrink from the idea of harsher penalties, which should be sufficient to be a real deterrent. 23 The situation at present is serious in view of the numbers of unsuitable vehicles and personnel. Since 1968 the problem has been steadily escalating. With the "tourist explosion" in the City projected to a record number next year then the problem, unless it is stopped now, will continue to grow. Recurrent press and T.V. criticism is an annual fact, as is also individual criticism from tourist organisations. No effective and acceptable answer has yet been found but it is obvious that if proper control is to be exercised it must be reinforced by better regulations or a more enlightened approach to existing legislation. Without it adequate control cannot be guaranteed to the people who are most at risk and who have a right to speedy and full protection—that is, the members of the public. FOOD COMPLAINTS During the year under review there was an increase in the number of complaints concerning food sold in an unsound condition or food containing extraneous material. Legal proceedings were instituted in 8 cases and fines and costs were imposed totalling £344. The complaints investigated related to the following:- 1. Severe mould growths, staleness and unsoundness which affected the following articles Egg and Tomato Sandwich-Mouldy Sausage Roll - Unfit; sausage filling had lost moisture Cornish Pasty - Stale, due to sale three weeks beyond "death date" . Dates - Unsound condition and alleged food poisoning Sausage - Unsound condition Pork Pie - Mouldy Pork Pie - Unsound Pork Pie - Unsound Mortadella Pizza - Mouldy Pizza Pie - Mouldy Tinned Salmon - Unsound Steak and Kidney Pie - Unsound Prawn and Lettuce Roll - Unsound Cake — Mouldy Beef Sandwich - Unsound Ham Roll - Unsound Pork Pie — Unsound Pork Pie - Unsound Smoked Salmon — Stale Smoked Salmon — Stale Meat Loaf - Unsound Buttered Scones - Unsound Orange Pudding - Mouldy Bread — Unsound Cheese Roll - Unhygienic Condition Cheese Sandwich — Unsound Fresh Cream Mandarin Dessert - Mouldy Fresh Cream Mandarin Dessert - Mouldy 2. Extraneous objects discovered in food:- Salmon Sandwich - Contained fragments of glass Banbury Cakes - Contained filter tip of smoked cigarette Bun — Contained nail Bread — Contained fragment of wood Pork Sausage — Contained piece of glass Honey - Contained cigarette end Roll - Contained nail Pizza Pie - Contained cigarette Pint of Milk — Contained "conker" Cheese Roll — Contained stud Seed Loaf — Contained nail 3. Adulteration:- Vodka and Lime - Contained added water Whisky - Contained added water White Wine - Contained added water Ice Cream - Adulterated Milk - Contained added water Milk - Contained added water 24 4. Complaints concerning food quality:- Canadian Clover Honey — Alleged not Clover Honey Gateaux — Alleged the filling was artificial cream Buttered Roll - Contained margarine not butter Two Buttered Rolls — Contained margarine not butter Steak and Kidney Pie — Did not contain kidney 5. Insect Contamination:- Cheese and Tomato Roll - Contained maggot and mould Corned Beef Sandwich - Contained cockroach Bread — Contained unidentified insect Baby Food — Contained dead larvae Beefburger Roll - Contained Pharaoh's Ants Sandwich - Contained caterpillar "Picnic" Bar — Contained maggots Tinned Tomatoes - Contained caterpillar Bar of Plain Chocolate - Contained maggots "Picnic" Bar — Infested by larvae Sausage Roll - Contained beetle Fruit Pie - Contained cockroach 6- Rodent Contamination:- Plain Chocolate - Gnawed by mice Plain Chocolate - Contamination by mice and insects The overwhelming majority of complaints concerned foods which were mouldy, stale, putrefied, beyond their "death" date, or otherwise unfit. Of the total number of investigations concerning mould or staleness, 55% related to items of prepacked or factory processed foods containing code indications of their "death" dates. In two instances of complaints concerning Pizza Pies, there were no indications whatsoever of the dates of manufacture or packaging and neither the manufacturer nor the retailer could say with any certainty just how stale the articles were when sold. This haphazard method of manufacture and packing of perishable foods is deplorable. The present method of using secret or complicated codes on perishable packaged foods is little better. The sooner standardisation of information in open-date form is a legal requirement, so much the sooner will the customer be in a position to satisfy himself that perishable packaged food offered for sale is at least within the recommended period of freshness. Extraneous objects found in food included cigarette ends, nails, fragments of wood, glass, a stud, and in one case a "conker" which was discovered in a pint of milk. Most of the metal objects and glass were found to have been introduced during manufacture and had somehow eluded the metal detectors and sieves. Manufacturers were very conscious of the serious consequences of allowing extraneous objects to be passed on to the consumer. In theory it should not happen and non-metallic objects usually find their way into the food after the sieving and the grading operations. Metallic objects are usually discovered by the metal detection apparatus. This apparatus works on a magnetic field principle and is activated by distortion of the field in the presence of metal objects passing directly through it. Checks on the efficiency of the apparatus may only be made by deliberately distorting the field; therefore fail safe devices cannot be effectively used and reliance is placed on manual checks. Until metal detection apparatus with adequate fail safe devices are employed these metal objects in food from the manufacturing processes may continue to occur to a considerable degree. During one investigation concerning a piece of glass in a pork sausage, all the available evidence led to the conclusion that the glass had been introduced after sale to the customer. Adulteration complaints mainly concerned added water to milk and to spirits and wine. The addition of water to spirits is not often encountered nowadays, since this is such a crude method and there are many more sophisticated and less detectable ways of "fiddling" spirits than by the addition of water. Court action resulted in a fine. The monthly incidence of food complaints shows peak periods during the month of June and December. The mild weather during the year probably contributed considerably to the June peak and to the rising number of complaints due to larval and maggot infestation during November and December. 25 No. Monthly incidence of Complaints There is no doubt that in many cases members of the public deal directly with distributors and manufacturers who in general are willing to accept their responsibilities for food quality. This being so, the total number of unsound articles of food sold in the City can never be known. However, the Public Health Service, together with the help of the consumer, the manufacturer, and the distributor, must continue to exercise control and surveillance so that we may be assured of obtaining good quality, clean, wholesome food, so far as is practicable, free from visible dirt, decay, harmful contaminants and toxic substances.

Part I of the Poisons List includes the more dangerous poisons such as strychnine-which may be sold only by Pharmacists registered by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, whereas Part II includes the less dangerous poisons such as phenols, hair dyes, etc. Thirty six inspections ware made in connection with the administration of the Act. Two contraventions of a minor nature were noted and effectively dealt with. PHARMACY AND MEDICINES ACT, 1941 This Act has continued to have the attention of the Inspector. It aims to protect the public from misleading claims by advertisements or by labels on medicine bottles. Eleven inspections were made. No contraventions came to the notice of the Inspector. FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS ACT, 1926 This Act requires sellers of certain specified fertilisers and feeding stuffs for cattle or poultry to furnish purchasers with a statutory statement indicating the name under which the article is sold and the amount, if any, of certain schedule ingredients. Ten inspections were made. One contravention was noted and effectively dealt with. 35 FISH INSPECTION Inspection of fish in the City of London is carried out by officers of the Worshipful the Fishmongers' Company. The Fishmeters returns indicated as follows:- Deliveries at or near Billingsgate Market (including shellfish) Weight of Fish condemned Condemnation Rate 75,490 tons 246 tons 0.33% MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION - SMITHFIELD MARKET Meat, Poultry and Other Foods delivered at Smithfield Market: 1971 275,470 tons 1970 287,444 tons Major differences from 1970: England & Wales Scotland Northern Ireland Republic of Ireland Australia South America Tons Tons Tons Tons Tons Tons -7,431 -3,740 + 4,163 + 5,912 + 2,147 -9,495 These tonnage figures cannot be fully significant because of the increased supplies of boneless meat. Spoilage such as decomposition and bacterial slime was the reason for most losses due to unsound condition. Meat Inspection Regulations, 1963 These Regulations apply to meat slaughtered in England and Wales. Deliveries of meat from these sources to Smithfield during 1971 were as follows: (1970 figures in parenthesis):- Beef & Veal Mutton & Lamb Pork Tons 22,733 (24,194) 13,193 (14,895) 33,342 (39,985) 14 tons 12 cwts 2 qrs 8 lbs amounting to 0.21% (0.03%) of deliveries was surrendered for disease. Local Authorities were kept informed in matters concerning these Regulations and meat from their area. Poultry Inspection There are no premises in the City of London which are used for the processing of live poultry. Poultry packers in the United Kingdom were the main suppliers. Losses mostly consisted of unfrozen carcases. Damp carcases enclosed in plastic bags and cartons are particularly vulnerable. The unseasonable warm spell during Christmas week 1971 was responsible for some large losses. It must be complimentary to the well known integrity of Smithfield Wholesalers that not one complaint about poultry bought in Smithfield at Christmas time was received. Routine scrutiny and examination for disease of unfrozen poultry was carried out, the results prove this to be an important part of the Meat Inspectors task. Imported Food Regulations, 1968 Imported meat in 5,738 containers, mostly from the Republic of Ireland, notified as unexamined at the Port of Entry for the purpose of these Regulations were examined on arrival at Smithfield. 36 Acknowledgement is made to Mr. Forrester of the National Carriers Ltd., for the information he daily supplies of containers en route to Smithfield, often invaluable in providing late information concerning containers not arriving in Smithfield and making possible the expeditious passing of notifications to appropriate authorities. Notifications concerning 437 containers were forwarded to Other Local Authorities.

Each business is equipped with washing facilities required by regulations 16 and 18 of the Regulations. There are 353 porters licensed by the Clerk and Superintendent either self employed or employed by meat carriers. During the year 220 warning letters were despatched in respect of infringements of these regulations and two successful prosecutions were heard at the Guildhall Justice Rooms (details below). An increasing number of persons other than known trade members visited the wholesale market to purchase meat for their own consumption. Being outside the scope of the Hygiene Regulations they are an embarrassment to enforcing officers and upsetting to market personnel who themselves are controlled. In the week of Christmas, 1971 the influx of these people almost overwhelmed sections of the market. Surveillance of vehicles attending to collect meat was maintained. The hygiene of vehicles belonging to meat firms and carriers, generally, was of a good standard. Information concerning unsatisfactory vehicles belonging to food businesses in their area was passed to Local Authorities. Laundering of protective clothing remains a problem, no new services having appeared. Prosecutions Infringement Regulation Fine Costs Employees not wearing sufficient clean and washable overclothing 25 & 9 £40 £10 Failing to keep clean a delivery vehicle 5 £30 £22 Failing to have displayed on a delivery vehicle, name and address of the person carrying on the business 13 £5 The Food Hygiene (General) Regulations, 1970. Around Smithfield, in Leadenhall Market and in the City including Billingsgate area are 32 business dealing in meat, game and poultry which are subjected to routine visits by Meat Inspectors. Number of premises 32 Number of premises fitted to comply with Regulation 18 32 Number of premises to which Regulation 21 applies 30 Number of premises fitted to comply with Regulation 19 29 During the year 8 warning letters were despatched in respect of infringements of these regulations. Food Hygiene (Docks, Carriers, etc.) Regulations, 1960 These Regulations apply to 4 Public Cold Stores where meat is handled. During the year the cold chambers in these stores have been inspected as stock movement allowed and with the co-operation of the management measures taken where necessary to improve hygiene. One warning letter was sent in respect of infringements of these Regulations. Vermin Infestation In the Public Cold Stores improved methods of stowage, vermin proofing and preventive measures were achieved with the co-operation of Management, The Ministry of Agriculture Pest Control Officer and Commercial Contractors. 40 DISEASES OF ANIMALS ACT 1950 & ASSOCIATED ACTS Mr. G.S. Wiggins, M.R.C.V.S., Veterinary Officer for the City of London, has submitted the following report:- "The administration of the Diseases of Animals Act 1950, in regard to the importation of animals, is the responsibility of the Corporation of London for the whole of Greater London under the terms of the London Government Act 1963. The remainder of the functions under the Diseases of Animals Act and Associated Acts are the responsibility of the individual London Boroughs, but the Corporation acts, on an agency basis, for 17 London Boroughs. 1971 was the sixth year in which agency arrangements were in operation and a total of 1840 visits of inspection were made to 803 premises which the Corporation undertook to visit. These premises included animal boarding establishments, cattle and poultry shows, circuses, farms, kosher and other butchers and poulterers, pet shops, piggeries, research laboratories, riding establishments, slaughterhouses, theatres etc. The work carried out under these Acts and Orders included the following:Psittacosis or Ornithosis Order 1953 There were two cases of psittacosis confirmed in parrots purchased from a pet shop in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. In the first case, which occurred in September, the owner of a parrot died and another person was reported as being ill. Both persons purchased parrots which originated from the shop in question. The second case occurred in October and concerned a parrot at a pet shop in Croydon which originated at the same shop. Psittacosis was confirmed in both these cases and full enquiries were carried out with the co-operation of the Ministry of Argiculture, Fisheries and Food. The shop imports some 5,000 to 10,000 birds per month and it is therefore difficult to pinpoint the source of disease. Apart from the above, there were two cases of suspected psittacosis, one in the City of Westminster and the other concerning a person in Exeter Hospital who had purchased a parrot which once again originated at the pet shop in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Fowl Pest Order 1936 The epidemic of fowl pest which began in August 1970 continued into 1971 and eight outbreaks occurred in the Corporation's agency area. Restrictions were placed on four farms which were exposed to infection. Visits were continued to premises where poultry is slaughtered concerning the disposal of waste materials and the cleansing and disinfection of vehicles used for the conveyance of poultry. Farms were visited and the importance of vaccination of birds, disinfection, hygiene etc., was stressed. Riding Establishments Acts 1964 and 1970 Inspections were carried out at 40 riding establishments in eleven London Boroughs. These were mainly for the annual veterinary inspections for re-licensing purposes, but investigations were also made concerning complaints from the public, R.S.P.C.A. and horse societies. A new form of licence was issued this year, incorporating the conditions of the 1970 Act which came into operation on the 1st January. Pet Animals Act 1951 Regular visits of inspection to pet shops are carried out on behalf of seven London Boroughs. There is one pet shop in the City of London. 118 such shops were inspected regularly and recommendations concerning the re-licensing of these shops were submitted to the Boroughs. Club Row, the Sunday market in Tower Hamlets which specialises in the sale of pet animals mainly from stalls, was visited on several occasions and reports were submitted. Animal Boarding Establishments Act 1963 28 animal boarding establishments were visited on behalf of five London Boroughs and reports were submitted concerning the re-licensing of the establishments. The service was also used in a consultative capacity and to investigate complaints. A new form of licence came into operation, incorporating conditions recommended by the British Veterinary Association. Live Poultry (Restrictions) Order 1971 Two requests were received for licences to hold poultry exhibitions, but due to the fowl pest situation these were refused. At the request of the Borough of Guildford, enquiries were made to assure that poultry purchased at Guildford Market and brought to London is for immediate slaughter only as required under the terms of the Order. 41 Performing Animals (Regulation) Act 1925 Certificates of registration under this Act were issued to six persons, enabling them to train and exhibit performing animals. Television studios were visited when performing animals were being used in productions. Three circuses appeared in London during the year and these were visited. All animals, licences etc., were inspected and performances were witnessed. Regulation of Movement of Swine Order 1959 Under the terms of this Order animals moved under the authority of a licence to premises other than a bacon factory or slaughterhouse must be kept on the premises, separate from other animals, for a period of 28 days. Animals moved to a bacon factory or slaughterhouse must be detained there until slaughtered. 353 such licences were received and verified. Post Mortems Requests are received frequently for post mortem examinations to be carried out on animals which arrive dead or die at slaughterhouses or are found dead on public highways. During the year such examinations were carried out on 41 pigs, one lamb and one sheep. Diseases of Animals (Waste Foods) Order 1957 Regular visits of inspection are made to premises where the boiling of waste foods for feeding to pigs and poultry is carried out. Plants and equipment are inspected to see that they are in working order. In March, investigations were carried out at the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, at two farms where unboiled food was allegedly being fed to poultry. A full report was sent to the Ministry. Acts and Orders 1971 The following Acts and Orders, affecting the work of the department, came into operation during the year. Riding Establishments Act 1970 This Act came into operation on the 1st January. It contains conditions concerning conditional licences and amends the 1964 Act by making many new conditions for the operating of establishments. Live Poultry (Restrictions) Order 1971 Live Poultry (Restrictions) Amendment Order 1971 The first of these Orders revokes the Live Poultry (Restrictions) Order 1957 and is concerned with the movement of poultry, licensing of poultry shows etc. The second Order slightly amends the first in removing a prohibition on the movement of poultry. Brucellosis (Eradication Areas) (England & Wales) Order 1971 Brucellosis (Eradication Areas) (England & Wales) (Amendment) Order 1971 Brucellosis (Area Eradication) (England & Wales) Order 1971 Brucellosis (Area Eradication) (Scotland) Order 1971 Brucellosis (Eradication Areas) (Scotland) (No.2) Order 1971 These Orders declare certain areas to be eradication areas and prohibit vaccination of cattle in those areas unless authorised by the Minister. They also contain provisions preventing movement of cattle into such areas and on or off premises and to prevent the spread of brucellosis. Virus (Hepatitis) (Revocation) Order 1971 The purpose of this Order was to revoke the Virus Hepatitis Order 1954. Slaughter of Poultry (Humane Conditions) Regulations 1971 These regulations contain provisions for securing humane conditions in connection with the slaughter of turkeys and domestic fowls for human consumption. Diseases of Animals (Approved Disinfectants) (Amendment) Order 1971 Diseases of Animals (Approved Disinfectants) (Amendment) (No.2) Order 1971 These Orders revoke and re-enact those parts of the schedule to the Diseases of Animals (Approved Disinfectants) Order 1970 which contained lists of approved disinfectants for use in dealing with foot and mouth disease, fowl pest, tuberculosis and other general Orders. 42 Newcastle Disease (England and Wales) Order 1971 This Order amends the Fowl Pest Order 1936 in that Newcastle disease is no longer included in the definition of fowl pest. It prohibits the vaccination of poultry against Newcastle disease with unlicensed vaccine. I would again like to take this opportunity of thanking the staff of this department for their continued enthusiastic service during the year often at times outside office hours." PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE CITY (Comparable figures for 1970 are given in brackets where appropriate) The total number of births occurring in the City (St. Bartholomew's Hospital and domiciliary births) was 580 (915). Births (to City Residents) ] 1970 1971 Hospital Live Births 23 32 Domiciliary Live Births NIL 1 Number of these born with congenital malformations NIL NIL Stillbirths NIL NIL NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT, 1946 (as amended by the Health Services and Public Health Act, 1968) The Corporation of London is responsible for services as set out in Sections 21 to 28 (excluding Section 27) of the National Health Service Act, 1946. The Greater London Council is responsible for the administration of all ambulance services within the Greater London area under Section 27 of the Act. TEMPLES ORDER, 1971 Following the Temples Order which came into effect on 15th November 1971, personal health services have been provided as required to residents of the Temples. Prior to the Order becoming effective only services of an emergency nature were provided. SECTION 21 - HEALTH CENTRES There are no such Centres in the City of London. SECTION 22 - CARE OF MOTHERS AND YOUNG CHILDREN There were no (Nil) notified cases of congenital defects recorded during the year in respect of births to City residents. Infant Deaths 1970 1971 Stillbirths NIL NIL Neo Natal NIL NIL Perinatal NIL 1 Others under 5 years NIL NIL Maternal Deaths 1970 1971 NIL NIL Child Health Clinic Clinic Attendance of Children under 5 years. 1970 1971 Attendances 421 544 Medical Examination 169 174 Hearing Tests 8 12 Phenylketonuria Tests 3 1 43 Dr. A. White Franklin, the Paediatrician, has reported as follows: "Although the use of immunisation facilities continues to be satisfactory, there is still a fall off in third and booster courses. Omission of routine Smallpox vaccination, as recommended by the Department of Health has not ended this practice. Although Smallpox Eradication schemes are making considerable progress, parents liable to travel abroad with their families are still encouraged to ask for vaccination in the second year. More reliance is being placed on routine surveillance of all babies at regular intervals than on an "At Risk" Register. Liaison with the Obstetric Department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital continues close." Vaccinations and Immunisations at Child Health Clinic 1970 1971 Diphtheria/Tetanus/Whooping Cough 12 9 Diphtheria/Tetanus NIL 3 Poliomyelitis 10 11 Smallpox 9 5 Measles 3 3 During the year the Department of Health and Social Services advised that vaccination against smallpox need not now be recommended as a routine procedure in early childhood. At Risk Register Children aged under five years on the Register at the end of the year 1970 1971 1 3 Welfare Foods The sale of Welfare Foods continues at the Child Health Clinic St. Bartholomew's Hospital and at the Health Department Office. SECTION 23 - MIDWIFERY SERVICE The Metropolitan District Nursing Association continued to provide domiciliary midwifery services in the City. No request for midwifery services within the Temples was made. 1970 1971 Home confinements attended NIL NIL Planned early discharge from hospital 2 7 Emergency cases attended 1 1 The midwives continued to visit, on a one day per week rota, St. Bartholomew's Hospital maternity department in order to promote closer liaison between hospital and domiciliary midwifery services and to attend deliveries of City mothers who have been accepted for discharge home after 48 hours. Midwives Act, 1951 The Corporation, as the supervising Authority for the City of London, received from midwives 44 (34) notifications of intention to practise during the year. SECTION 24 - HEALTH VISITING 1970 1971 Home visits to children under 5 years; Successful visits 290 251 Unsuccessful visits 47 65 At the end of the year, 1,216 new residents were living in the Barbican Development. Thus the number of small children and babies increased, as also the number of chronic sick, elderly and handicapped persons requiring information and advice. Many requests for Health and Social Services.were received. The Health and Welfare Officers were involved in helping families and elderly persons settle in their new environment and in many small ways have been able to foster their own endeavours in helping one another within the new community. Liaison with one family doctor group practice has been extended. One Health and Welfare Officer and a District Nurse Midwife make regular visits to the Barbican G.P. Surgery to discuss the care, treatment and provision of services for old and new patients. Monthly attendances to assist the doctors and to help and advise the patients at the Obesity clinic and the Cytology clinic are also made by these officers. Other General Practitioners have been approached regarding the community care of their patients as needed. 44 One student health visitor from the North London Polytechnic was received for her period of training. Student nurses from Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children were also received for Community Care observation visits. Every effort has been made to visit all City residents in hospitals to discuss the Community Care requirements with the patient and hospital staff before discharge; this ensures continuity of care and provides a better service to patients. It has also helped to improve the co-ordination between the hospital and community service staffs. In similar ways we are building good foundations with voluntary organisations who share, with us, in providing personal services for City residents. During the past two years much thought and effort has been spent in making closer ties and improved communications with Occupational Nursing Officers in City banks and offices. In 1970 several nurses in industrial firms were welcomed into the department for practical visits in the community to demonstrate some of the health and social services provided. These links continued to be fostered in 1971, this development is proving most helpful both to clients and the respective nursing staffs. Tuberculosis Health Visiting 1970 1971 Cases notified (residents) 5 9 Home visits, old and new sases 92 32 Shops and office contact tracing No. of investigations 6 16 (involving (involving 240 75 persons) persons) The number of cases in shops and offices requiring investigation of contacts of City workers has increased, although the number of City residents attending the Chest Clinic for observation and treatment remains fairly static. There is always a problem of finding and treating infectious men in the Men's Hostel in the City. Every autumn a special campaign and Mass X-Ray facilities are provided on site and a Health and Welfare Officer visits weekly when a General Practitioner holds a surgery in the hostel. This has enabled a considerable degree of follow up to be done. SECTION 25 - HOME NURSING The Metropolitan District Nursing Association continued to provide home nursing services in the City. Approximately 66% (66%) of visits made were to persons aged 65 years and over. Details of visits are as follows:- 1970 1971 Visits to children under the age of 5 years NIL 26 Visits to age group 5 to 64 1305 823 Visits to persons aged 65 and over 2352 1594 Total visits 3657 2443 Type of Nursing Care and Treatment 1970 1971 Injections only 908 272 Injection plus other treatment 15 372 Nursing care and treatment 2734 1799 Totals 3657 2443 Number of patients being attended at the end of year 20 24 The District Nursing Staff received 24 (28) night calls during the year. SECTION 26 - VACCINATION AND IMMUNISATION In accordance with the then Ministry of Health instructions that smallpox vaccine should be distributed to medical practitioners by the Local Authority in whose area they practise, arrangements continue for the vaccine to be distributed to City doctors. During 1971, 6063 (5336) doses have been issued to City medical practitioners and doctors at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the medical department of Unilever and various City business houses. Poliomyelitis vaccine is also issued at the request of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Unilever Limited and City medical practitioners. In all 3200 (3200) doses were issued. 76 (77) adults (including Corporation Staff) received smallpox vaccinations. (See other sections for vaccinations and immunisations of school children and children under five years of age). 45 SECTION 27 - AMBULANCE SERVICE The Greater London Council are responsible for the ambulance service in the Greater London area. SECTION 28 - PREVENTION OF ILLNESS, CARE AND AFTERCARE City of London Chest Clinic Dr. Neville C. Oswald, the Chest Physician, has reported as follows:- "15 City Residents with Pulmonary Tuberculosis are under regular observation, 9 attended for the first time in 1971. Of the 5 man who attended following Mass X-Ray examination at the Salvation Army Hostel, 2 were found to have infectious Pulmonary Tuberculosis and were admitted to Hospital. During 1971, 13 City Workers were notified as having infectious Tuberculosis. This resulted in 139 contact examinations at the Chest Clinic, a further 93 were X-Rayed by the Mass X-Ray Unit. None had active Tuberculosis. City Workers represent approximately 20%, or about 400 of the 2000 patients seen in the clinic during one year. 14 City Residents with non Tuberculosis chest disease attend regularly. 4 young persons from the Guildhall School of Music and D'ama were seen on account of positive Tuberculosis tests." Mass Miniature Radiography The Mass Miniature Radiography Unit of the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board at Milton Court was closed at the end of February. The figures below represent the work carried out in January and February. Total Number X-Rayed - 6,244 (3830 Males and 2414 Females) 25 persons (15 males and 10 Females) were referred forfurther investigation and the following abnormalities found:- Male Female Total Pulmonary Tuberculosis Requiring treatment 1 — 1 Requiring occasional supervision only 1 — 1 Presumed healed, discharged 3 2 5 Other Abnormalities Carcinoma of Lung 1 - 1 Sarcoidosis 1 - 1 Pneumonitis — 1 1 Acquired abnormalities of the heart — 2 2 Pulmonary Fibrosis 1 - 1 Pleural Thickening 1 1 2 Anomaly of Abdominal Viscera 1 — 1 Abnormalities of Bony Thorax 1 — 1 Unclassified Abnormalities 2 - 2 Special Hostels for Tuberculous Men 1970 1971 Men resident during the year 5 4 Loan of Nursing Aids 1970 1971 Supplied by Health Department 63 67 Supplied by British Red Cross SocietyCity Branch 6 2 The provision of nursing aids for the sick patients nursed in their own homes and for elderly, infirm and residents suffering from chronic illnesses has been steadily increasing over the past seven years, chief ly because of referral by hospitals or general practitioners. The Local Authority Health Staff with the nurses of the Metropolitan District Nursing Association have helped to publicise widely the information on services available, either through patients and relatives or by talks to various voluntary organisations and community groups. Selection of suitable aids requires an increasing amount of knowledge and skills to ensure proper safety, particularly for those elderly, infirm residents living alone. Chiropody Service The following reports have been received from Mr. R. Jones, M.Ch.S., S.R.Ch., and Mrs. M. Graham, S.R.Ch., respectively:- 46 "During the year 1971, 456 treatments were given to patients at Gravel Lane Clinic. This, in spite of local building problems and some of the patients moving to other estates, showed an increase of 31 treatments to the previous year. Each patient had a regular monthly appointment and this was deeply appreciated. No new Diabetic patients were seen, and all the patients were elderly, and treatment has therefore necessarily been mainly palliative in nature with the object of keeping these old people mobile. In the near future it is to be hoped that with a new building in view for use as a Clinic an even better service will be made possible and with the advent of the new flats more people in the older age groups could be given treatment." "There are four sections to the chiropody service arranged by the health department catering for the elderly, physically handicapped and children. The four sections are as follows:- Milton Court There were 94 treatments given during the year. Sessions here are run about twice a month. At the end of the year the number of patients was 10 of whom 7 were women, the average age of patients was 67. Salvation Army During the year 31 treatments were given, a chiropody session being given about once every six weeks. The actual number of treatments is poor compared with the number of people booked in to be treated. In one session for example 5 patients were booked and only 1 attended. The condition of feet here was extremely bad and it is likely that other people here needing the treatment do not make use of the service. Domiciliary Visits This service is for people who cannot get to the clinic. During the year just over 200 treatments were given. About 1 appointment in 8 was cancelled. Of the remaining appointments about 1 patient in 8 was not at home when a visit was made. At the end of the year there were 33 people on the domiciliary list, 27 of whom were women. Sir John Cass's Foundation There were 16 visits made during the year and about 150 children were inspected. 113 treatments were given to 39 children. Verrucae gave rise to 66 treatments, corns to 26 and nail conditions to 15. The other 6 treatments were miscellaneous complaints. More than half the children were wearing shoes that were too small for them,some 2 sizes. The children were advised to have their feet measured when next buying shoes, but it is doubtful whether this has much effect. Girls of 10 and 11 were already tending to fashion before common sense in their choice of shoes. It is not difficult to understand the high proportion of women, for example, on the domiciliary list. I would like to thank the staff of the Medical Officer of Health, the Brigadier and his staff at the Salvation Army Hostel and Mr. Jarvis and his Secretary at the school for their help and cooperation throughout the year." Services for Incontinent Persons 1970 1971 Persons receiving service at end of year 15 10 Items washed 3745 3370 Under Section 13 of the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968 arrangements have been made for the linen of incontinent persons to be laundered free of charge. A twice weekly collection and delivery service is operated by Corporation transport and payment is made to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets for carrying out the laundering on behalf of the Corporation. The service is of great value not only to the incontinent patient, but also to the caring members of the family. Yellow Fever Vaccination The Corporation continued to supply yellow fever vaccine to the designated centre at Unilever House. As the Corporation is also the Port Health Authority for the Port of London arrangements have also been made for distribution to the Shipping Federation Medical Centre at King George V Dock and at Tilbury Dock. During the year 3255 (3098) doses of vaccine were distributed. 47 International Certificates of Vaccination against Smallpox 1970 1971 Number authenticated 3237 3730 Number returned as doctor did not practise in the City 43 42 V.D. Contact Tracing The Principal Health and Welfare Officer is responsible for thefollow up of possible contacts of known cases within the City. Requests received for assistance in 1970 1971 follow up: City Cases NIL 1 Non City Cases 14 2 Health Education Subject Audience No. of Lectures Average number in the audience at each Lecture Health, Hygiene and Primary 17 18 Functions of the School Human Body Children Health and Welfare Police Sergeants, 4 12 Services Barbican Residents, Home Helps The Work of the School Girls 1 20 Health Visitor Baby Care Expectant Mothers attending St. Bartholomew's Hospital. 8 17 The Health and Welfare Officers continued to provide talks to small groups and the demand is steadily growing. There is an ever increasing demand for leaflets and posters on many aspects of health maintenance. A series of Slimmers Lunches was organised by the Spastics Society whose aim was to inform the public about the importance of weight control and also to raise funds. The Corporation made a grant towards the expenses of the project. Four weekly lunches were held, and the would-be slimmers received advice on diet and so on.They were invited to seek sponsorshipfor each pound lost during the period. The project received much publicity and was felt to have been a success. Family Planning Rent free premises are provided for the Family Planning Association at Milton Court where three lunch-time and one evening sessions are held each week for City Workers and residents. The Corporation continues to underwrite the cost of consultation and supplies to married women residents referred on medical grounds. Following the National Health Service (Family Planning) Act 1967, the Corporation also underwrites the cost of consultation to married women residents or other residents who seek advice on social grounds. The Corporation also gives a grant to the Family Planning Association. The Association has submitted the following report on their work in the City:- "There is no doubt at all that thefamily planning service provided by the Corporation through the Family Planning Association clinic continues to be very much welcomed and used by City residents, and workers. 204 sessions were held during the year and the total number of people attending the clinic, of whom 83 were City residents, was 1606 compared with 1480 in 1970. In all 4491 attendances were made by these patients. The number coming for the first time remains about the same, 598 this year and 609 in 1970, and will do so until it is possible to increase the number of lunch time clinic sessions. The waiting list for these sessions is four weeks. The doctors at the clinic discuss all methods of contraception with patients, but as will be seen from statistics kept throughout the year by the clinic for the Department of Health and Social Security the majority of patients attending this clinic chose oral contraceptives, the breakdown of the 598 new patients being as follows:- Oral contraceptives 488 Diaphragm 79 IUD 3 Sheath 5 Chemical 5 Consultation only 18 48 The IUD (intra uterine device) is not fitted at the clinic but for women advised this method of contraception facilities exist at the Islington Family Planning Centre at the Finsbury Health Centre where there are also facilities for advice on psycho-sexual difficulties, infertility and vasectomy. During the year 806 cervical smears were taken, all of which were negative. We are happy to co-operate with the Corporation in the provision of this valuable family planning service which is much appreciated by women living and working in the City." Well Women's Clinic The clinic, set up in 1958 with Corporation funds, is established at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. The following report of the work of the clinic during 1971 has been received from Mr. D.K. Williams, F.R.C.S., M.R.C.O.G. "Total number ot attendances:- 507 Abnormal Smears Inflammatory changes 30 Atrophic changes 38 Trichomonas infection 5 Monilia infection 6 Pap. class III 1 Clinical Findings Cervical Polyps 14 Cervical Erosion 6 Fibroids 16 Primary amenorrhoea 1 Post menopausal bleeding 1 Hyperthyroid state 1 Ca. Breast 1 Benign hyperplasia 2 Urinary tract infection 1" Bank of England Cervical Smear Scheme The following report on the work of the clinic during the year has been received from Dr. I.D. MacDonald, M.D;- "The Bank Cervical Smear Scheme continues to work successfully. During 1971 381 cases were examined. There were no positives although one doubtful case is to be kept under observation. As in previous years, a number of minor gynaecological disorders were diagnosed and referred to their doctors for treatment." Domiciliary Physiotherapy The Metropolitan District Nursing Association continued to employ a sessional domiciliary physiotherapist to treat, under general practitioner or hospital supervision, those persons who would usefully benefit from this type of service which may not be provided by a local authority under the Act. 1970 1971 Number of patients treated during the year 18 18 Visits made to treat patients, visit doctors and clinics 288 320 EDUCATION ACT, 1944 SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE The general standard of health at the Sir John Cass's Foundation School is good and a high level of hygiene is maintained. During the year the following school medical inspections were carried out:- 49  1970 1971 Routine children inspected 73 51 Special children inspected 18 33 Re-inspection children inspected 62 86 Comprehensive Health Survey children inspected 217 171 Selective Survey children inspected 31 97 The Comprehensive and Selective Inspections are conducted by the School Nurse. The general standard of hygiene amongst the school children was good, and no head or body infestation occurred during the year. Home visits were made to the City parents to follow up matters arising from the medical inspections. School Dental Service.

Health Education in School For several years now Health Education as a class activity has been carried out by a Health and Welfare Officer as the School Nurse in Sir John Cass's Foundation School. The Comprehensive and Selective Health Inspections provide an opportunity for some individual instruction but the class situation gives the more enthusiastic response from the children. The senior class of the Junior School have discussed the mechanism of the body and the aids to maintain healthy body function. This approach certainly interested the boys as points raised sometimes were expressed in terms which conveyed their enthusiasm for motor cars and aeroplanes, whereas the girls seemed ♦o appreciate the aspect of the growth and development of small babies and their well-being with closer attention. Many types of visual aids were introduced and the children enjoyed keeping notebooks with pictures and leaflets and diagrams which they arranged themselves. 50 REPORT OF THE DENTAL OFFICER, 1971 The two factors occuring in the year under review tended to influence the normal day-to-day trend ot management of dental treatment, namely: (a) Introduction of increased charges for N.H.S. patients; and (b) The introduction of a scheme for painting the teeth of school-children with fluoride gel, which was foreshadowed in last year's report. The announcement in the Autumn of 19/0, that there would in an increase in the cost of N.H.S. dental treatment on 1st April, 1971, meant a big increase in the demand for treatment, from those seeking to obtain it before the charges were implemented. (In broad terms, the patient pays half the cost of treatment up to a maximum of £10.) The backlog of such treatment extended up to September, 1971, when there was a fall in demand for a period of about 3 weeks. Since that time demand for N.H.S. treatment has returned to the level obtaining, prior to the Autumn of 1970, when the incroased charges were announced. It is perhaps too early to draw any valid conclusions as to the longer term effects of these increased charges but perhaps one can sav hopefully, that people recognise that dental treatment is worth having, and paying for, and perhaps the day may come in the not too distant future, when we shall pay readily for regular preventive measures, rather than for remedial treatment. Pre-School Chitdren A slight improvement in the number of these children requiring treatment can be attributed to the fact that some of them had already received treatment during the previous year. The figure of 62% as compared with 66% last year shows a little progress. School Dental Service — Inner London Education Authority. School Entrants (5 year olds) The picture is brighter in this age group — only 20% needing treatment,not so much because there was less dental disease, but because it had already been treated. Infants and Juniors The position here was a little disappointing in that there was a 3% increase in the numbers requiring treatment, following inspection. The children actually resident in the City, as distinct from those living outside it, still seem to have the worst mouths. Dental Health Education Apart from individual chairside instruction there have been four visits during the year by the I.L.E.A. dental health educators giving group dental health education. Fluoridation As mentioned earlier in this report, the parents of the children at Sir John Cass's Foundation School have been offered the opportunity to have their children's teeth painted with fluoride gel. This has been introduced because it is felt that in the absence of water fluoridation, children were being deprived of the one really effective and proven dental preventive measure that could help them. This form of fluoride treatment, though no substitute for water fluoridation, offers them some small redress for our generation's failure to help them more. There are various ways in which fluoride can be used to benefit teeth. At the time of its introduction, painting with fluoride gel seemed to be the most effective and least disruptive of school-time. At the time of writing it would still appear to be so. It is used considerably in the U.S.A. and is now increasing in use in this country. 85% of parents opted for their children to receive it, and it will be given twice a year at school inspections. The instruction in oral hygiene given at the same time will, it is hoped, produce considerable benefits in time to come. St. Bartholomew's Hospital As in former years, great help has been received from the hospital, particularly in cases where general anaesthesia has been required, and in the field of orthodontics and oral surgery. Treatment given to patients referred there is painstaking and skilful, and invariably accompanied by a high degree of courtesy. 51 CORPORATION STAFF Ophthalmic Optician Service Since March, 1959, a firm of Ophthalmic Opticians have been operating an eye testing service for members of the staff. This service is operated under the National Health Service, and examinations are therefore free, although charges are made, in the usual way, for the dispensing of prescriptions. The sessions are held at fortnightly intervals. Examinations carried out during the year are shown in the following table:— Total examinations carried out 72 Number of staff who had not previously had an eye test 18 Visual defects found and corrected 15 Re-examinations of persons already using spectacles 54 Further correction needed and carried out 45 Medical Examinations During the year, 626 medical examinations have been carried out, as shown in the following table:— Reason for Examination Result Male Female Total Admission to Superannuation Scheme Fit 196 139 335 Unfit 2 0 2 Deferred 8 6 14 Referred for excessive sick absenteeism Fit for duty 23 3 26 Still unfit 15 3 18 Unfit for further service 10 2 12 Staff over 65 years of age continuing in employment Fit to continue 84 34 118 Unfit to continue 0 0 0 Special examinations 85 16 101 Exemption from parking meter fees Monument employees Temporary appointments Fitness to drive heavy goods vehicles (Cleansing Staff) TOTALS 423 203 626 STATISTICAL INFORMATION Area — 678 acres (including the Temple and foreshore) Population — Census 1961, 4,711; Estimated mid-year 1971, 4,340 Annual Rateable Value — as at 1st April, 1971, £49,413,021 Annual sum Received from Penny General Rate — £499,000 VITAL STATISTICS COMPILED FROM REGISTRAR GENERAL'S RETURN 1970 1971 Live Births Number 23 36 Rate per 1,000 population 4.8 8.3 Illegitimate Live Births Number 2 3 Illegitimate live births per cent of total live births 8.7 8 Still Births Number NIL NIL Rate per 1,000 total live and still births NIL NIL Total Live and Still Births 23 36 Infant Deaths (deaths under 1 year) NIL 2 Infant Mortality Rates Total infant deaths per 1,000 total live births NIL 28 Legitimate infant deaths per 1,000 legitimate live births NIL 30 Illegitimate infant deaths per 1,000 illegitimate live births NIL NIL Neo-Natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 4 weeks per 1,000 live births NIL 28 Early Neo-Natal Mortality Rate (deaths under 1 week per 1,000 total live births) NIL NIL Perinatal Mortality Rate (still births and deaths under 1 week combined per 1,000 total live and still births) NIL NIL Maternal Mortality (including abortion) Number NIL NIL Rate per 1,000 total live and still births NIL NIL Deaths (all ages) Number 50 56 Rate per 1,000 resident population 10.46 12.7 NUMBERS OF DEATHS BY CAUSE, SEX AND AGE GROUPS (Statistics supplied by the General Register Office on Form S.D.25) cause of death Sex All Ages Under 4 weeks 4 weeks & under 1 year AGE IN YEARS 1-4 5-14 15-24 25-34 35-44 45-54 55-64 65-74 75 and over B5 Tuberculosis of Respiratory System M. 2 - - - - - - - - 1 1 - f - - - - - - - - - - - - B19(3) Malignant Neoplasm, Stomach M 2 - - - - - - - 1 - - 1 f - - - - - - - - - - - - 819(4) Malignant Neoplasm, Intestine M 2 - - - - - - 1 - - 1 - f 1 - - - - - - - - - 1 - B19(6) Malignant Neoplasm, Lung, Bronchus M 2 - - - - - - - - - - 2 f - - - - - - - - - - - - B19(7) Malignant Neoplasm, Breast M - - - - - - - - - - - - f 2 - - - - - - - 1 1 - - B19(10) Leukaemia M 2 - - 1 - - 1 - - - - - f 1 - - - - - - 1 - - - - B19( 11) Other Mai i gnant Neoplasms M 2 - - - - - - - - 1 1 - f 4 - - - 2 - - - - 1 1 - B26 Chronic Rheumatic Heart Disease M 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - F - - - - - - - - - - - - B27 Hypertensive Disease M 1 - - - - - - - 1 - - - f - - - - - - - - - - - - B28 Ischaemic Heart Disease M 7 - - - - - - 1 1 1 4 - f 6 - - - - - - - - 1 1 4 B29 Other Forms of Heart Disease M 1 - - - - - - - - - - 1 F - - - - - - - - - - - - B30 Cerebrovascular Disease M 2 - - - - - - - - 1 - 1 F - - - - - - - - - - - - B46(6) Other Diseases of Circulatory System M 4 - - - - - - - - 1 1 2 F - - - - - - - - - - - - B32 Pneumonia M 2 - - - - - - - 1 - 1 - F - - - - - - - - - - - - B33(1) Bronchitis and Emphysema M 1 - - - - - - - - 1 - - F 3 - - - - - - - - 1 2 - B46(7) Other Diseases of Respiratory System M - - - - - - - - - - - - F 1 - - - - - - - - - - 1 B37 Cirrhosis of Liver M - - - - - - - - - - - - F 1 - - - - - - - - 1 - - B42 Congenital Anomalies M 1 1 - - - - - - - - - - f 1 - 1 - - - - - - - - - BE48 All other Accidents M - - - - - - - - - - - - F 2 - - - 1 - - - - - 1 - BE49 Suicide and Selfinflicted Injuries M 2 - - - - - - - 1 1 - - F - - - - - - - - - - - - TOTAL ALL CAUSES M 34 1 - 1 - - 1 2 6 7 9 7 F 22 - 1 - 3 - - 1 1 5 6 5 N.B.

FOOD STANDARDS The following article by Dr. H. Amphlett Williams, Ph.D., M.Chem.A., F.C.G.I., F.R.I.C., F.R.S.H., F.I.F.S.T., was published in the Journal of the Royal Institute of Public Health and Hygiene and is reproduced by permission of the Editor. The adulteration of food has been practised ever since the development of commerce made it profitable; and measures for its prevention by fining the offender are mentioned as early as the third century B.C. in the ancient Sanskrit text of the Arthasastra. According to Pliny2 and other historians,3 bakers and vintners appear to have been among the worst culprits in ancient times, bread being mixed with chalk, sand and a soft white earth, and wine with water, sulphuric acid, sugar, gums and artificial colouring. To the student of history, food adulteration may seem only a minor form of crime, when compared with some of the habits of our forefathers, whose favourite amusement in the time of the twelfth century is said to have been to sally forth by night in bands to attack the homes of their neighbours, killing every man who came their way with the utmost brutality. But our health depends upon a supply of wholesome food, and it was in that period when "no buyer of food could trust the word of a seller",4 that the first attempt in this country to control food by statute was made. 55 The method adopted in the "Assize of Bread", in King John's reign, was designed to control the profit made by the baker, the selling price of a loaf being related to the price of a quarter of wheat. The act proved ineffective and clauses to prevent adulteration were added and punishments made more severe. In 1634 meal was included, but the first Act that laid down a clearly defined standard for bread, specifying which ingredients could be used and prohibiting all others, was in 1836. A few other foods came under the supervision of the City Companies: spices, for instance, were "garbelled", i.e. subject to inspection, testing and confiscation if defective, by the Mistery of Grocers under an edict of Henry VI, and some protection against the sale of bad fish was afforded by the Fishmongers' Company, but such powers were mainly confined to the City of London and the penalties imposed proved insufficient deterrent when weighed against the profits of adulteration. Tea became subject to adulteration almost as soon as it reached the shops in about 1657, and in 1723/30 Acts were passed to prohibit dealers in tea from sophisticating, adulterating, counterfeiting or fabricating tea. But in spite of the comprehensive wording introduced in the later Acts, means of evasion were still found, e.g. by arranging that the persons fabricating the fictitious tea leaves were not "dealers in tea". The net was extended in the case of beer and porter by an Act in 1816, which made it an offence for any brewer, dealer or retailer of beer to have in his possession any article that could be used as a substitute for malt or hops. Coffee was also adulterated almost immediately after it was introduced and an Act was passed in 1803 to establish a standard for coffee and prohibit the addition of other vegetable substances, etc. The sale of adulterated wine and unwholesome meat were prohibited by early Acts, but many other foods that had become subject to adulteration were not covered, and to pass a separate Act for every kind of food was too much for any Parliament. The first attempt to secure the purity of all foods and drinks by one general Act was made in 1860s and the previous Acts, which had by then become operational within their limited fields, were revoked. The new Act prohibited the addition of any substance that rendered a food or drink injurious to health, and also prohibited the sale of adulterated food. Unfortunately it proved inadequate, although recast in 1872, owing to the difficulty of proving when food or drink is (a) injurious to health, or (b) adulterated. The legal meaning of "adulterated" in relation to a particular food or drink, particularly where a certain degree of admixture had become customary, led to interminable arguments between "expert witnesses" and, because of the financial considerations involved, the defence was not often lacking in expert advocacy. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act of 1875 replaced the offence of "adulteration" by a new offence of selling to his prejudice an article that was not of the nature, substance or quality demanded by the purchaser. This provision has proved a very great benefit to the general public, readily enforceable in any clear cut case of prejudice, and is retained to the present day. But unfortunately there arose a great many instances where doubt existed as to whether a purchaser was prejudiced, and as to precisely what degree of quality he was to be presumed to have demanded. The questions arose, for instance, whether it was injurious to health or otherwise prejudicial to put preservative into a perishable food; if not, which preservative was appropriate and how much? And at what concentration did arsenical or metallic contamination render food injurious to health? In more recent times similar questions have arisen about the use of artificial colouring matters, antioxidants, mineral hydrocarbons and other food additives. The multiplicity and technicality of the questions were beyond the capacity of the Law Courts; and, moreover, to bring legal proceedings in doubtful cases, particularly where a manufacturer might be trying to improve the quality and reduce the cost of his products, was to cause hardship and considerable expense and should not be necessary. What was needed to avoid such litigation was a specific Order or Regulation clarifying each point, not only to protect the public but to inform manufacturers and dealers in food and drinks what additives, if any, can properly be used without endangering health or impairing the product. Finally, in 1925, after considering reports from two Departmental Committees and some forty years after the introduction of preservatives into general use, detailed Preservatives Regulations® were published by the Minister of Health under powers conferred upon him by the Public Health Acts, 1875-1907. This was a new method of food control, by delegation of authority to a Department of State instead of by Acts of Parliament. And, being open to amendment in the light of future requirements, departmental regulations heralded a notable breakthrough from the previous difficulties. Eleven regulations limiting harmful additives and contaminants in food have now been made, and they have proved of the greatest value in reducing undesirable constituents without involving costly litigation. 56 The other aspect with which the purchaser is concerned, nature, substance and quality, is also gradually being resolved by means of food standards orders made by the Minister under powers delegated by the Food and Drugs Act; and from forty-five years' experience of trying to maintain food quality by means of the bare Food and Drugs Act I am convinced that a specific legal standard is necessary for each principal kind of food and drink. The point at which the Food and Drugs Act fails is when adulteration is only slight, too little to justify the legal process of prosecution and to have a reasonable chance of success in Court. Thus by insidious degrees the quality of any food can be reduced without interference by the Authorities appointed to enforce the Act. Attention was drawn to many traditional foods and drinks that had gradually become debased in this way in my address to the Royal Society of Health ten years ago.7 A single example, the story of Ice Cream, will be sufficient on this occasion to illustrate the need for and the potential benefit of specific legal standards. At the end of the nineteenth century, according to the recipe books, Ice Cream had a basis of around 25% of cream; and that was real cream, with about 40% milk fat, not the present day "cream" with only 18% milk fat. The resulting 10% fat content became gradually reduced to about 5% by commercial undertakings, and I well remember in the nineteen thirties trying to persuade Local Authorities to prosecute on samples that showed only about 2%. The lawyers refused, however, on the grounds that there was no minimum requirement and one could not say there was no cream in the product. In 1937 my former chief, Mr. Edward Hinks, persuaded Surrey County Council to prosecute on the grounds that a "Super Ice Cream" contained a mixture of margarine fat and milk fat.8 Three experts for the defence argued that the purchaser was not prejudiced, since he got something better than he had asked for. The Court held that the composition of Ice Cream was a matter for the legislature, not for them, and dismissed the case. Few, if any, other prosecutions of the kind were taken after that case and the "cream" became gradually replaced by vegetable fats, although the name "Ice Cream" was retained. Fourteen years later, when even the percentage of vegetable fat had become minimal in some makes, the Ministry of Food issued the first Food Standard Order for Ice Cream. This Order required a minimum of 5% fat of any edible variety. In 1952 the figure was reduced to 4% but it was raised again to 5% in 1953. In 1959 the fat was required to be milk fat if the product was described as "Dairy Ice Cream" or "Cream Ice", and in 1967 a labelling requirement was added — "Contains Non-Milk Fat" to be stated on the container of any Ice Cream containing fat other than milk fat. Out of hundreds of samples analysed recently I have found hardly any that failed to comply with the Standards Order, showing that by the simple publication of a specific Order the compositional quality of a food can not only be maintained but varied and improved so as to accord with whatever it is considered that the purchaser is entitled to expect. We now have 26 Food Standards Orders or Regulations. Similar histories of falling quality arrested by the Order could be written for each class of food, but once an Order has been made it is rare to find a food or drink manufactured in this country that does not comply with it. The recommendation of the present Food Standards Committee9 that Four Standards Orders, which have in fact been operating quite successfully, should be revoked is therefore regarded as a retrogressive step. The Orders in question are— (1) Baking Powder and Golden Raising Powder It was not uncommon before 1944, when the Standard was made requiring not less than 8% available carbon dioxide, to find baking powders, usually badly packed or old stock, which yielded less than 4% of carbon dioxide. These were still, legally, baking powder, but they spoiled a cake unless the cook used an extra large proportion. Should we go back to those days? (2) Edible Gelatine Should we revert to the position before 1949, when some gelatines were of such poor setting quality that one had to use 10-12% to make a jelly (at which concentration the taste of glue was revolting) instead of the normal 2-3%? Vou cannot tell whether it will set by looking at it when you buy it! (3) Mustard The argument for revocation seems to be that the only criterion is in the flavour, which can be judged directly, (but only after the purchase has been made) and that there is a wide variation in personal preferences. There is plenty of scope for varying the flavour in the compound mustard pastes, which are not controlled, but if the powdered mustard seed from which the pastes are made loses its aroma how can the desired pastes be made? If the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?10 Evidence from the analysis of exporters' samples shows that aroma deficient varieties of mustard flour are offered to British firms from time to time, and if no aroma were required bylaw these cheaper kinds could gradually replace the mustard of the present day. The position might even revert to that of a century ago, when it was argued on the Queen's Bench that since it was well known that mustard was mixed with flour and other things such a purchase could not be to the prejudice of the purchaser. 57 (4) Curry Powder The Committee recount that before the Standard Order was made in 1949 sub-standard products were on sale containing excessive amounts of salt or farinaceous material. They go on to say that most curry powders now on sale contain over 90% spices and that there is little point in retaining the statutory control. One would have thought the facts cited showed the need for the Order and the success achieved by it. On looking up my records I find that in the last six years nine consignments of curry powder reached the Port of London which on analysis showed up to 50% of diluents, such as pea meal, corn and ground pea hulls. How many consignments slipped through or were shipped to other ports I do not know, but there is ample evidence of continuing attempts to pass off adulterated curry powders. In recommending the revocation of these Orders the Committee conclude that they are prepared to rely on the general provisions of the Food and Drugs Act and, should necessity arise, on action by enforcement authorities, to see that the standards of these products do not fall below the present minima. The general provisions of the Food and Drugs Act were not sufficient to avoid the need for the Standards Orders and, as experience has shown, their force is vastly reduced when a standard is revoked. Would you blame a motorist for doing more than 30 m.p.h. on a road that had been derestricted? Two Appeal cases, only too well-known to public analysts, will be sufficient to iIlustrate the effect of revoking a standard. In 1953 the Meat Products (No.3) Order, which required the minimum meat content of pork sausages to be 65% and stipulated a maximum price, was revoked. In 1955 the Somerset County Council took a prosecution against a firm for selling pork sausages containing only 50-55% of meat, the analyst's opinion that pork sausages should contain at least 65% of meat being based upon (a) several years' experience of pork sausages analyses and (b) the fact that a standard of 65% had been in force from 1950-1953. The case was dismissed and on appeal the Court dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the analyst's standard was founded on an entirely false basis." In 1956 a prosecution concerning a pork sausage which contained 57.5% of meat was dismissed at Rye, and on appeal the Lord Chief Justice said, dismissing the appeal, "These cases will go on until some Minister issues an Order saying what a sausage is" and "The sooner it is seen that these cases lead to chaos and it is prescribed what a sausage is, the better."12 In other words, if the Government decides there should be no legal standard for a food, what right has a Public Analyst to attempt to establish one? It is not contended that there need be a Standards Order for every single food and certainly not for proprietary foods; but where a primary or traditional food or drink becomes subject to gradual debasement experience has shown that the Food and Drugs Act alone is inadequate to maintain its original nature and quality.

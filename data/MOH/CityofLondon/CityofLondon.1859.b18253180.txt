JOSEPH DAW, Principal Clerk. THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE CITY OF LONDON. THE TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Honorable Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, In the course of the year which has just expired there were 3,202 births, 2,747 deaths, and 1,735 marriages in the City of London. All of those numbers are below the averages of the last ten years, but they have not all been reduced in the same proportion. The deaths have declined from an annual average of 3,018 to 2,747: the births from 3,474 to 3,202; and the marriages from 1,745 to 1,735: while, therefore, the falling off in the proportion of marriages has been to the extent of less than 1 per cent., that of the births has been about 8 per cent., and of the deaths a little more than 9 per cent. These proportions show that 6 however great may have been the fluctuations of the population, the general health and vitality of the City during the year have been good. The distribution of the births and deaths and marriages among the people have been as follows:— there were 24.6 births per 1,000 of the inhabitants, 21.1 deaths, and 13.4 marriages. In the preceding ten years the annual averages were at the rate of 26.7 births per 1,000, 23.2 deaths, and 13.4 marriages. For the whole of London the proportions are 33.2 per 1,000 for the births, 24.4 for the deaths, and only 9.5 for the marriages. In all England the latter numbers are somewhat less; for while the births are at the rate of 34 per 1,000 of the population, the deaths are at the rate of 22.4, and the marriages but 8.2. If, therefore, the City presents an unfavourable appearance as regards the small number of births, and its power of sustaining the natural increase of the population, its aspect is remarkably good in the large proportion of marriages, which is the sign of its wealth and prosperity. Of the 3,202 births in the year, 1,357 were registered in the Eastern division of the City, 803 in the Western, and 1,042 in the Central. These are in the proportion cf 30.4 per 1,000 of the population of the first division, 28.1 of the second, and only 18.3 of the third. The last named distiict is the centre of the City proper, and being the locality of large trading establishments, it is 7 habited by the young of both sexes who have not yet settled in life, and therefore the small proportion of births. No where, however, except in the North-west division of the City Union have the births been less in number than the deaths. In the whole of the City the proportion has been 1,166 births to every 1,000 deaths, and in the several Unions it has ranged from 1,315 to 1,067 births to 1,000 deaths. The first is the proportion of the Eastern Union where the population is the poorest and the densest, and the second is that of the City proper, which is the centre of industry. The number of births among women between the ages of 15 and 45 is much less in the City than in the whole of England. Here, the proportions range from 67 in the 1,000 to 131, the average being 99 5, whereas in all England there are about 145 births to every 1,000 child-bearing women. The smallest proportions in the City are in the Central Union, where they average but 78 in the 1,000, and the largest are in the Eastern districts, where they range from 120 to 131 per 1,000. The number of illegitimate births registered in the City is remarkably small—it averages but 116 in the year—last year it was but 100. This is in the proportion of about 33 per 1,000 of all the births, whereas in the rest of London it amounts to rather moi*e than 40 per 1,000, and in all England it is about 65 per 1,000. In many of the rural 8 tricts of this country, as in Norfolk, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Nottinghamshire, Westmoreland, and Cumberland, it ranges from 92 to 120 per 1,000; and yet this high proportion is no proof of greater depravity or even of a larger number of children born out of wedlock; for in this City the opportunity of hiding the shame of illegitimacy, and even of falsifying the registration of birth is far greater than in the rural districts; besides which, the proportion of unmarried women to the married is much larger here than in the country. There are occasions, however, when the returns of illegitimate births are the true indications of the depravity of a district, as, for example, when in adjoining localities, with all the circumstances and conditions of the population equal, there is a marked difference in the number of returns. Such indications are unhappily too frequent in our large cities. Here in one of the subdivisions of the Western Union, with a population of hardly 12,500, there are annually about 42 illegitimate births, whereas, in the adjoining district of the same Union, with a population of 16,000, there are only 35 of such births. In the former case, the proportion is as 95 to 1,000 births, and in the latter it is only 16. Again, in the St. Botolph district of the Eastern Union, there is a proportion of 44 per 1,000, whereas in the adjoining district of Cripplegate, in the same Union, it is scarcely 29 per 1,000. These numbers point to 9 something more than a mere difference in the mode or custom of registration; they point to a difference in the state of society, and are the true exponents of its morality. A knowledge of the people, and close observation of their habits, confirm this; for it is here, where the returns of bastardy are so large, that Ave find the worst forms of over crowding, the indiscriminate association of the sexes, and the total disregard of all the decencies of life. It is here, also, that the death rate is largest, and the occurrence of zymotic disease most frequent. Of the 2,747 deaths which were registered in the year, 1,433 were males and 1,314 females. These are in the proportion of 109 of the former to 100 of the latter. In the Western Union the proportion was as 124 of the former to 100 of the latter, whereas in the City Union the proportions were equal. The mortality of males in the Western Union has, therefore, been excessively high: it has amounted to rather more than 28 per 1,000 of the male part of the population, while that of the female part has been only about 22 per 1,000. In all England the proportion of male to female deaths is about 103 to 100. Again, of the 2,747 deaths in the year, 1,032 occurred in the Eastern districts, 739 in the Western, and 976 in the Central. These are at the rate of 23.1 per 1,000 for the first named district, 25.8 for the second, and 17.2 for the third—the 10 average for the whole City being 21.1 per 1,000. In the course of the last ten years, the general averages for the three districts have been as follows:—26.2 for the Eastern, 26.5 for the Western, and 19.2 for the Central, the average for the whole City having been 23.2. A great improvement has therefore taken place in the death rate of the population; and at the present time the mortality of the City will bear comparison not merely with the deatli rate of the large cities of Europe, but even with that of the rural towns of England. In the whole of London the mortality is in the proportion of 24'5 per 1,000 of the population, and in the chief towns of England it is nearly 26 per 1,000. Even in the rural districts, it is at the rate of 19.8 per 1,000, and in the whole country it is 22.5. Could we, therefore, but abate the mischief which arises from overcrowding in the worst districts of the City— where the mortality ranges from 26 to 27 per 1,000, we might hope to make the City of London the healthiest City in the world, and the standard for a sanitary comparison. The ages at death are classified in Table IV. of the Appendix, and you will perceive that rather more than 37 per cent. of the deaths were among children of less than five years of age, and of these about half had not reached the first year of their age; in fact, about one in six of all the children born in the City die before they are a year 11 old. In the Western Union it is one in five, and in the City proper only one in seven. The mortality at from 5 to 15 years of age is but 4 per cent, of all the deaths; at from 15 to 45 it is nearly 20 per cent.; at from 45 to 65 it is nearly 21 per cent., and above that it is 19 per cent. At the middle periods of life, and at mature age, especially among males, these numbers are excessive; for while in all England the mortality of males at from 15 to 45 years of age is only about 17 per cent. of the total male mortality, and at from 45 to 65 it is a little less than 14 per cent., in the City of London at these periods it is nearly 22 per cent. This, together with the fact that there is an excess of male deaths at these ages over the female deaths, in the proportion of 129 to 100, shows in what way the population of the City is fed, and how great is the mortality of the most vigorous portion of the community. It is this high mortality of the young and able bodied which reduces the expectancy of a City life so largely; for while in England generally a man at 20 may expect to live to 60, in the City he will not reach to 52. This is the penalty of trade and industry, for those who are not engaged therein—the women—escape it. Home influences act on the infant and weaken its vitality, but it is the excitement of commerce which presses upon manhood and exhausts its vigour; and both of these agencies are largely concerned in the death rate of the City. 12 Among the principal causes of death during the year are diseases of the respiratory organs. Instead of an average of 508 deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis, there were 553; and this excess was distributed pretty evenly throughout all the districts of the City. The high mortality from lung diseases occurred chiefly in the spring and winter quarters of the year. In the spring of 1860 the number rose from an average of 92 to 127, and in the winter quarter from 194 to 231. This excess was undoubtedly due to the trying influence of the weather, for during both of those seasons the atmosphere was cold, and damp, and changeable. It is remarkable, however, that the mortality from phthisis and other diseases of a tubercular kind was not excessive: in fact, the deaths from these affections during the year have been greatly below the average—phthisis declined from 366 to 341, tabes and scrofula from 175 to 139, and hydrocephalus from 95 to 71, making in all a diminution of nearly 14 per cent. This would indicate that the atmospheric conditions which aggravate or cause inflammatory affections of the lungs, have not so marked an influence on the tubercular forms of disease. Indeed, their influence seems to be not so much in affecting the processes of growth and nutrition, as in producing local congestions and paralysing nervous power. The action of cold is to drive the blood from the surface of the body to the internal organs; and by embarrassing the circulation, and 13 enfeebling nervism, it quickly extinguishes a flickering life. But its influence must also be felt, though not perhaps immediately, in the processes of growth and nutrition; for a tissue defectively formed, with errors of function as well as of structure, must, ere long, become the seat of disease, and must easily yield to the action of morbific agents. And then again it is unfortunate that seasons of great cold are also seasons of extreme want: it is not, therefore, to be wondered at, that with the stamina of the body reduced and the vital powers weakened, the mortality should be largely increased. At such times the struggle for existence is intense, and every day's defective nutrition and loss of power tell upon the general strength, until the starved and numbed body wastes away like a burning lamp. Those whose feeble powers and exhausted tissues are already weakened by disease or want, and those whose vital functions have hardly yet become developed, or are worn out by age and decay, are the first to succumb. When, therefore, the thermometer sinks to a few degrees below its usual range, the mortality of the young and old and ailing is excessive. At those times the deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis, as well as from brain and heart diseases, add fearfully to the death rate. It has happened thus in the course of the last year. In the month of October of 1859, for example, when the temperature fell to nearly 14 16 degrees below the average, the mortality rose from 46 to 58 in the week; and at the end of November, after a succession of cold and foggy days, the mortality was as high as 70 in the week; and in December, with an average cold of 37 degrees, it reached to 79. So also in the spring quarter of 1860, when the daily range of temperature was as much as 19 degrees of Fahrenheit, and the cold was likewise great, the death rate rose from a weekly average of 64 to upwards of 80. Truly, therefore, has it been said that if heat kills its thousands, cold kills its tens of thousands. But still it has its compensating action in the keeping down of zymotic diseases, for during the whole of the year these have been far less fatal than usual. They have declined from a general average of 631 in the year to 474, and this has been pretty uniform with all the common types of the disease. Diarrhoea has declined from 121 to 64; continued fever, including typhus and its congeners, from 118 to 74; scarlet fever, from 113 to 85; erysipelas, from 21 to 5; and the infantile maladies,— croup and whooping-cough, from 155 to 111. But two others, viz., measles and small-pox have not been so mild in their action; the former has advanced from 72 to 75, and the latter from 31 to 60. The chief increase of small-pox was in the spring quarter of 1860, when the number rose from 7 to 22. Up to that time it had been gradually 15 creasing, but since then it has as gradually declined, until it has reached to its usual proportions. There is but one other cause of death to which I have to refer, and that is the cause which includes every form of unnatural death, as privation, poison, violence, and premature birth; these have produced 126 deaths in the course of the year, the average being 162. The meteorology of the year is classified as usual from the observations at Guildhall, under the superintendence of Mr. Haywood, and the chief points of interest, in addition to those which I have already discussed, are, that the humidity of the atmosphere has been great, the rain-fall large, and the wet days numerous. The average proportion of moisture in the air has been from 83 to 84 degrees of saturation, which is excessive; and the rain-fall of the year has amounted to 29 inches, which is just 8 inches more than the rain-fall of the preceding year, and nearly 7 inches above the average of many years. Lastly, the number of wet days has been 195, or more than half the number of the whole year. This excess of wet has had a salutary influence on the soil and the river. It has washed out and has oxydised the putridities of the former, and has scoured the muddy shores of the latter. Besides which it has kept back the tidal wave, and has preserved the stream from oceanic impurities. During the whole of the year the water at high 16 tide at London Bridge lias never contained more than 60 grains of soluble matter per gallon, and of this but 5 grains were organic. Its average composition has been rather less than 32 grains per gallon, of which about 3 only were organic; and the suspended matter has been about 5 grains per gallon, of which 1¼ grain Avas organic. These were chiefly composed of the living organisms of the infusorial class, as bacillaria and navicula. Contrast this with the condition of the river during the summers of 1858 and 1859, when the quantity of soluble matter in the Thames amounted to from 140 to 410 grains per gallon, of which from 13 to 23 grains were organic. The rains of the last year have altogether prevented such a state of things; and at the present time the water of the river is but little different in its composition from that supplied to many of the towns of England, and it is not nearly so bad as that yielded by many of the pumps of this metropolis. This fact, I hope to submit to you more prominently in the course of the present year, for I am now occupied in analysing the water of the City pumps. The sanitary work of the year is shown in Table VII. of the appendix. Altogether, there have been 6,463 inspections of houses, and 2,985 visits to the common lodging-houses. These have resulted in the issuing of 2,472 orders for sanitary 17 merits. Many of these visits and inspections have been made, because of the occurrence of zymotic disease. In this way, there were 399 inspections on account of fever, and 552 because of diarrhcea. These numbers are less than the numbers of preceding years. In 1859, for example, there were 772 cases of fever visited, and 1,020 of diarrhœa; and in the year preceding, there were 1,140 of fever, and 883 of diarrhoea. The last year has therefore been a healthy year, whether we estimate it by the mortality returns, or by the returns of sickness attended among the poor; and the increase of marriages would show it to have been a prosperous year.

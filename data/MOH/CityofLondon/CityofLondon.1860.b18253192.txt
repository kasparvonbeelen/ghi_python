LETHEBY, M.B., M.A., Ph.D., &c., FELLOW OF THE LINNEAN, AND THE CHEMICAL SOCIETIES, medical officer of health fob the city of london, and professor of chemistry and medical jurisprudence in the college of the london hospital. LONDON: m. lownds, printer, 148½, fenchurch street, city. 1862. At a Meeting of the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, held at the Guildhall of the said City, on Tuesday, 29th April, 1862:— The Medical Officer of Health laid before the Court his Annual Report, which was ordered to be Printed and a Copy to be sent to every Member of this Court, and of the Court of Common Council. JOSEPH DAW, Principal Clerk. the SANITARY CONDITION of the CITY OF LONDON. THE THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Honorable Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, In accordance with the usual practice, I beg leave to submit the various Tables which exhibit the vital statistics and the sanitary work of the City for the last twelve months. In Table I. I have classified the births, deaths, and marriages for the year, according to the localities and seasons; and you will notice generally that there were 3,343 births in the year, 2,845 deaths, and 1,557 marriages. All these numbers are below the averages for the last ten years, but they are not all reduced in like proportion. The births, for example, have declined from 6 3,439 to 3,343, which is a little less than 28 per 1,000; the deaths from 3,018 to 2,845, which is nearly 58 in the 1,000; and the marriages from 1,750 to 1,557 which is nearly 111 in the 1,000. The distribution of the several numbers among the population is as follows:—There were 29 births, 24 deaths, and 14 marriages to every 1,000 of the inhabitants. In the whole of London there are about 33 births, 24.4 deaths, and hardly 10 marriages to the 1,000; and in all England the proportions are 34 births, 224 deaths, and only 8 marriages. That which is most remarkable, therefore, in the City is the large proportion of marriages and the small proportion of births. This would indicate either that there is a great defect in the registration of births, or that the married do not commonly remain in the City, or that marriages are not prolific. There is no other way of accounting for the remarkable fact, that while in all England there are annually rather more than four births to every marriage, in the City there are but two. Independently, therefore, of the excessive mortality of the City, there are fewer births to keep up the number of the population ; and if it were not for the constant importation or accession of adult life, the growth of this metropolis would be but slow. Its natural rate of increase, as estimated by the excess of births over deaths in the City for the last ten years, would be only about 7 3.4 per 1,000 of the inhabitants per annum, instead of about 18 per 1,000, which is its actual rate of growth: the natural increase for the whole country is about 12 per 1,000 of the population. Table I. also shows the influence of the seasons on the birth-rate, the death-rate, and the number of marriages. Winter is the season for the largest number of births and deaths, and summer for marriages; autumn being the zero for the two former, and winter for the latter. This does not accord entirely with the results for the rest of England; for commonly autumn is the season for the largest number of marriages, and summer for the smallest. In Table II. the births are classified in detail, and a comparison is made with the birth-rate, male and female, in each of the City districts for the last ten years; from which it will appear that while the birth-rate of the whole City has been about 29 2 per 1,000 of the inhabitants, that of the Eastern Union has been 35.5, that of the Western 303, and that of the Central or City proper only 22.9. Again: the proportion of male to female births is as 1784 to 1559, or as 114 to 100. This proportion is larger than the decennial average for this City (101 to 100), as well as for that of the whole country (105 to 100). In Table III. the deaths are classified in the same manner as the births. They are arranged to 8 show the mortality, male and female, for each season of the year, and for each district and subdistrict of the City. Of the 2,845 deaths in the year, 1,472 were males, and 1,373 females. These numbers are in the proportion of 107 of the former to 100 of the latter. In the Eastern Union they are as 97 to 100; in the Western, as 117 to 100 ; and in the City proper as 111 to 100. In all England the proportion is as 103 to 100. The actual death-rate of the two sexes can scarcely be estimated from these numbers, because they do not comprehend the proportions of the living: but if looked at from another point of view it will be seen that the mortality of the several districts of the City has ranged from 21.5 per 1,000 of the inhabitants to 28.9. The first is the death-rate of the Central district, and the last of the Western. In the Eastern Union the mortality was as 259 to the 1,000; and in the whole of the City it has been 24.8. It may be that the actual death-rate is not nearly so high as this, for the Census of 1861 was taken at a time when a very large proportion of the City population was employed beyond its boundaries; when, in fact, the demand for labour in the hop fields and market gardens of the adjoining counties had drawn the poorer part of the population from their homes. This has doubtless caused a smaller return of the population of the poorer districts than there should have 9 been; but still with every allowance for this, it is manifest that the death-rate is excessively high— that it is nearly double of what it should be, if measured by the standard of mortality which better circumstances have rendered attainable. I know that the conditions of a City life are hardly comparable to those which exist in a rural district; and that a penalty must always be paid for the privilege of civilization, and for the right of partaking of the greater luxuries of the metropolis ; but this penalty need not be the half of a life time. In fact, although there are inevitable disadvantages in such a kind of life as the City presents, there are also many compensating benefits. If indeed in the hard struggle for subsistence there is a greater strain upon both the mind and body, there are likewise more ample means for maintaining it; for every want which human necessity creates has here its supply; and the resources of curative science are almost unlimited. That which aggravates the conditions of a City life is altogether apart from this; it is the dense overcrowding of the population; the living in houses which are unfit for human habitation; the close and ill-ventilated state of the courts and alleys; the systematic neglect of cleanliness among the poor, and their living continually in an atmosphere of decomposition. Much of this has received your attention, and has been the subject of 10 sanitary improvement. But your efforts have been almost nullified by the passive resistance of landlords, and by the sullen indifference of the poor. Until, indeed, the latter can be made to feel the advantages of an improved social condition, and can be taught that human beings ought not to herd together like brute beasts, it will be hardly possible to lessen the death-rate of our large cities, or to keep down the unwholesome influences which are ever fostering endemic disease. This kind of teaching, however, is fast becoming an obligation of society; for it is perceived that the evils of such ignorance are not confined to the poor alone. They spread among the rich, and largely affect the interests of all. It would not become me to speak more fully of the way in which such a mission should be fulfilled, but I may venture to state, from a very large experience, that one of the prime means of accomplishing it will be by giving to the poor a better kind of house accommodation than they now possess ; by teaching them through practical lessons, the advantages of cleanliness; by showing them that filth is not a necessity; and by proving that decent and orderly habits are not only conducive to comfort and economy, but are also essential to health. It may be that all such teaching would be at first discouraging; for it could scarcely be expected that any immediate good would come 11 of it, in so far as the old habitues of vice and filth are concerned; but it would have its influence on the young, and would gradually accustom them to better habits of life, to a higher standard of sociality, and to the advantages as well as refinements of proper house accommodation. All this, too, might be accomplished without trespassing on the bounds of charity, or making it other than a common business transaction; for there is hardly any property out of the main thoroughfares of this City which pays better than the miserable houses inhabited by the poor. The substantial aid of the philanthropist may, it is true, do something for such a purpose; and we may rest our faith upon the probable results of so noble a gift as that of Mr. Peabody's; but to be a certain or even possible good, the results must flow not from a charitable exercise of the gift, but from a truly commercial management of it. It must be made, like the capital and influence of the merchant, to grow in its dimensions and importance, and not to dwindle into the mere nothingness of an abstract philanthropy. It should become the medium of education and social improvement, as well as the means of providing for the immediate wants of the destitute. All this must be accomplished without a show of charity, and without offence to the self respect and independence of the poor; for it is my experience, that whatsoever is 12 given to them unconditionally as a favour from the rich is but ill received, and is always abused. There must be the quid pro quo, the double interest in the matter, or it will not be valued. Table IV. contains a classification of the deaths according to age, to sex, and to the several districts of the City. You will also notice that it exhibits the annual averages in each of these respects for the last five years. One of the deductions from the Table is, that about 20 per cent., or just a fifth of all the deaths in the year, were among infants of less than a twelvemonth old. In the Eastern Union the proportion is much larger, it amounts to one-fourth of all the deaths. If these facts are examined from another point of view, it will be seen that in the Eastern and Western divisions of the City about one in five of all the children born die before they are a year old; whereas in the Central division the proportion is only one in seven. The first of these numbers is greatly above the average for this country, and the second is below it. Passing on to the next column of figures, you will observe that nearly 41 per cent, of all the deaths were among children of less than five years of age ; and as children up to this age constitute about one-tenth part of the population of the City, it is manifest that they die at the rate of about 10 per cent., instead of rather less than 7 per cent., 13 • which is the average for the whole country. In fact, in the Eastern division of the City the proportion is rather more than 11 per cent., and in the Western nearly 14. It is this large mortality of children which swells the death-rate, and it will be seen from Table V. what are the causes which determine it. In this table you will notice that 630, or rather more than one-fifth of all the deaths are from developmental diseases, as phthisis, scrofula, tabes, and hydrocephalus; 577, or nearly a like proportion, are from zymotic causes, of a more or less preventable character; and 543 are from acute affections of lungs, chiefly among infants, the results of exposure to cold. Here, then, is a group of maladies causing in all about three-fifths of the whole mortality for the year, which might, with due sanitary precautions, have been greatly mitigated. In some cases the effects of these precautions have been clearly manifested ; for instead of an average death-rate of 107 persons from continued fever, there have been but 70 deaths. Scarlet fever has also declined from 91 to 66, and small-pox from 32 to 4; but some other diseases of this class have been more than usually fatal—measles, for example, have risen from an average of 78 deaths in the year to 119, and the group of maladies characterised by special affections of the throat—as croup, diphtheria, and whooping 14 cough—have advanced from 144 to 202. Some of these diseases will doubtless occur under all circumstances, but their malignity is much influenced by external conditions ; and it is more than probable that defective sanitary arrangements invite their presence as well as favour their development. The chief facts connected with the meteorology of the quarter are classified in Table VI., and, as usual, they have been deduced from the observations at Guildhall, under the superintendence of Mr. Haywood. The range of temperature has been from 14.5 degrees of Fahrenheit to 85 degrees ; and the daily fluctuations of the thermometer have been from 8 to 15 degrees. The greatest cold was at the close of 1860, and the greatest heat in August 1861. The average humidity of the air has been from 83 to 84 degrees of saturation ; and the range for the year has been from 73 to 91 degrees of saturation. This is not above the usual amount; nor has the amount of rain-fall (19.85 inches) been above the average. In the preceding year the rain-fall was 29 inches, and in that of many years it has averaged 22 inches. Lastly, with regard to the state of the river: the soluble impurities have ranged from about 19 grains in the gallon to 216 grains. The former proportion was found in the month of October 1860, after a wet autumn, and the latter in September 1861, after a dry summer. The proportions of organic matter 15 have ranged from about 2 grains in the gallon to nearly 20 ; and under the last circumstance the river began to be offensive. Its temperature has never exceeded 68 degrees of Fahrenheit, and for the most part it has been from 40 to 60 degrees. Table VII. exhibits the amount of sanitary work in the quarter. The sum of it is, that 9,425 inspections of houses have been made by the Inspectors, and that 2,462 orders have been issued for sanitary improvement. Each of the 70 cases of fever, and the 93 of diarrhoea recorded in the death table, as well as the 154 cases of fever, and 800 of diarrhoea on the sick books of the Union Medical Officers, has been the subject of immediate inquiry, and in most cases of special sanitary measures. By this method of thorough inspection we became acquainted with the sanitary state of the City, and with the means which are necessary for its improvement. Finally, in the last Table of the Appendix, there are classified the facts which relate to the seizures of unsound and unwholesome meat, &c., in this City. You will notice that the officers have seized in the course of the year 143,934 lbs. or rather more than 64 tons of meat, and 1,578 head of game and poultry as unfit for human food. It consisted of 1,100 sheep, 42 calves, 139 pigs, 899 quarters of beef, and 659 joints of meat. The 16 game and poultry consisted of 394 fowls, 326 pigeons, 329 rabbits, 247 ducks, 121 water fowl, 24 geese, 3 turkeys, 50 hares, 54 quarters and haunches of venison, and 84 head of game, besides 24 lbs. of sausages, and 10 hams. About threefourths of all the meat was seized in Newgate Market; about one-fourth of it, and nearly all the game and poultry were seized in Leadenhall, and the rest in Aldgate and elsewhere. The causes of the seizure are thus tabulated:—90,354 lbs. of the meat were diseased; 16,666 lbs. and all the game and poultry were putrid; and 35,938 lbs. were from animals that had died from accident or disease: chiefly from disease. All of the meat was at once sprinkled with the creosote of coal tar, so as to render it unfit for food, and to check putrefaction, and was then sent to the boilers. I refrain from again opening the discussion of the injurious effect of such meat on the health of those who partake of it, for the whole subject has been very recently under your consideration, and I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HY.

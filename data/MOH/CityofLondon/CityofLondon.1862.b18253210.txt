At a Meeting of the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, held at the Guildhall, of the said City, on Tuesday, January 26th, 1864 :— The Medical Officer of Health laid before the Court his Aunual Report, which was ordered to be Printed, and a Copy to be sent to every Member of this Court, and of the Court of Common Council. JOSEPH DAW, Principal Clerk. THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE CITY OF LONDON, THE FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR 1862-63. To the Honourable Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, In the course of the last year there were 2,962 births, 2,870 deaths, and 1,701 marriages registered in the City of London. Each of these numbers is below the average for the last ten years. The births have declined from an annual proportion of 3,350 to 2,962; the deaths from 2,969 to 2,870; and the marriages from 1,712 to 1,701. I need scarcely tell you that the falling off in these numbers has been chiefly in the central division of the City, where the deaths have been reduced to the extent of 4 per cent. of the annual proportion, 6 and the births to nearly 15 per cent. It is remarkable, however, that the number of marriages in this division of the City has been larger than usual. It has increased from an average proportion of 582 in the year to 683—an increase that amounts to nearly 28 per cent., and, therefore, forcibly indicates the general prosperity of the people. Of the 2,962 births in the year, 1,561 were boys, and 1,401 girls. These numbers are in the proportion of 111 of the former to 100 of the latter; the average proportion elsewhere, as also in the City in former years, being 105 to 100. The birth-rate among the citizens has ranged from 2 per cent. of the population in the City proper, to 3 per cent. in the Eastern Union—the mean birth-rate for the whole City being but 2.6 per cent. of the population. This is a small proportion, for in the rest of London the births are at the rate of about 3.4 per cent. of the population, and, in the whole of England, it is nearly 3½ per cent. Considering, too, that the population of the City is made up of an unusually large proportion of males and females in the prime of life, it is remarkable that its birth-rate should be so small, it is smaller, in fact, than that of any county in England. If, indeed, the births for the year are distributed among the women of the City who are at an age to 7 bear children, as from 15 to 45 years of age, it will be found that only one woman in ten has given birth to a child during the year. In the Eastern Union the births have amounted to 12 per cent. of the women, but in the City proper they have been but 7 per cent. whereas in the rest of London, as in all England, they amount to 14 per cent. And again, if we distribute the births among the married women, who are at from 15 to 45 years of age, we find that only 23 per cent. of them have borne children in the year, the normal proportion being about 27 per cent. Lastly, as an illustration of the small proportion of births in the City, I may state that, for every 100 deaths, there have been but 103 births, whereas, in all England, there are 154: in fact, if it were not for the comparatively large proportion of births in the Eastern Union, where there are about 123 births to every 100 deaths, the natural increase of the City population would be extremely small. Last year, indeed, it would have declined, for, in the Central and Western Unions there were 1,789 deaths, and only 1,695 births. The 2,870 deaths in the City were thus distributed:—1,081 were in the Eastern Union, 784 in the Western, and 1,005 in the Central, or City proper. These are in the proportion of 26.1 per 1,000 of the population of the first-named district, 29.3 of the second, and 21.6 of the third, making a 8 general death-rate of 25.1 for the entire City. The average death-rate in the City, during the last ten years, is 24.3 per 1,000 of the inhabitants; and the death-rate of the chief towns and town districts of England is 24.4—that of the whole of England being 22 2, and of the country districts 19.8. Although, therefore, the aggregate mortality of the City has not been much larger than that of the town districts of this country, yet, in some localities of the City, the death-rate has been very high; in the Western Union, for example, it has reached to 29.3 per 1,000 of the population. You will observe, moreover, that the mortality of males has been much greater than that of females, for the former have died at the rate of 27 per 1,000, and the latter at only 24; the averages throughout the country being 23 and 216. As regards the ages at death, it will be noticed that about 39 per cent. of all the deaths were among children of less than five years of age. This does not seem, at first sight, to be a large infant mortality, for the proportion in the rest of London is about 44 per cent., and in England it is nearly 40; but when we consider that the number of young children in the City is comparatively small, that the births are far below the average, and that there is a constant importation of adult life, it will be evident that the infant mortality is excessive. 9 In fact, if the death-rate is estimated by the proportion to the living instead of to the dead, it will be seen that nearly 89 per 1,000 of all the children under five years of age have died in the year. The proportion in the several unions has varied from 72 to 98 per 1,000; and, as usual, the largest mortality has been in the Western division of the City. In all England the proportion is only 68 per 1,000, and in France it is 69. It is remarkable, however, that this high death-rate of children has not been caused by any excessive mortality of infants under one year of age, for in the different districts of the City, the death-rate of infants of less than a year old has ranged from 142 to 191 per 1,000 of the births; the average being but 167. In England the proportion is 180 per 1,000, and in France it is 212. But although the mean death-rate of infants is not so great as the average proportion for the whole country, yet there are districts in the City where this death-rate is very unequal; in the Western Union, for example, male infants die at the rate of 208 per 1,000, and females at 172, whereas, in the City proper, the proportions are but 132 per 1,000 of the former, and 154 of the latter. In other words, there are places in the City where one child in every five dies before it is a year old, and there are others where the mortality is only one in seven, showing us that however favourable may be the general conditions of a City 10 life for the very young, they are still very unequal, and are, therefore, capable of improvement. Locking again at the facts, we see that after the first year of existence the child suffers more in the City than elsewhere, for then its death-rate rises very rapidly until it is five years of age, and then there is another respite. Out of a thousand deaths of children under fifteen years of age, 415 occur in the first year, 460 at from one to five years of age, and at 125 at from five to fifteen years. Throughout all England the numbers are 467, 372 and 161 respectively: the most fatal period of childhood in the City is, therefore, between the ages of 1 and 5. But after this, and for the next 30 years with males, and nearly 50 years with females, the circumstances of a City life are not generally unfavourable; for the total mortality in those periods is not excessive. At from 15 to 35 years of age the death-rate of males is only about 8 per 1,000, and of females 6.6; that of England being 8.7 and 9.1. At from 35 to 65 years of age, the mortality of males is 29.6 per 1,000, and of females 20.2; the English death-rate at those periods being 18.1 for males, and 16.7 for females; and, lastly, at from 65 years and upwards, the males in the City die at the rate of 129.3 per 1,000, and the females at the rate of 116.7; the mortality in England 11 being 93.7 and 85.8. It would seem, therefore, that the chief strain on a City life is during childhood, at from 1 to 5 years of age, and in manhood after the meridian of life has been passed. It also appears that in the latter case, the strain comes from occupation and from habits, rather than from any local circumstances about the homes of the people; for not only is the mortality greater among men than women, but there is a large difference in the death-rate of different classes. Taking all the males in the City who are at twenty and upwards, the mean death-rate is 22.9 per 1,000; but with shopkeepers, merchants, and butchers, it is only about 16 per 1,000; with shoemakers, blacksmiths, carpenters, and watermen, it is from 23 to 24 per 1,000; with clerks, porters, messengers, tailors, and painters, it is 26 per 1,000; with policemen, cabmen, ostlers, and costermongers, it is 29 per 1,000; and with labourers, masons, and bricklayers, it is nearly 44 per 1,000 Among the women of the City, at 20 and upwards, the mortality is only 19.5 per 1,000. In all England the mortality of adult males is 20.3 per 1,000, and of females, 18.6. It is manifest, therefore, not only that the death-rate of men is proportionally greater than that of women, but also that the excessive mortality of the former occurs chiefly among the hard-working classes of the community; and as they constitute a large per centage of the population, they necessarily 12 tribute very largely to the aggregate mortality. Those indeed of the working classes whose deathrate is over 26 per 1,000, cause no less than 48 per cent. of the total mortality; and as they occupy for the most part the eastern and western divisions of the City they swell up the death-rate of those districts. In the Western Union, where they are chiefly located, the mortality of men at 20 and upwards is 25.3 per 1,000, and of women, is only 22 per 1,000, whereas, in the City proper, the death-rate of men is but 21.5 per 1,000, and of women 17.5. It would seem, too, that the habits of the people, as well as the occupations, affect the death-rate, for while in this City the death-rate of adult labourers is 43.5 per 1,000, in the rest of England it is but 22; so, also, while here the butchers die at the rate of only 16 in the 1,000, and wine merchants and tavern keepers at 18, in the whole country the mortality of these classes is 21 and 31 respectively. We may, therefore, conclude that although the circumstances of a City life are manifestly very unfavourable for the labouring classes, they are not so for the butcher and the shopkeeper. It may be that these conclusions are not altogether reliable, because the better classes, unlike the labourer and artisan, have the means of seeking health when they are ill, and thus, by dying from their home, they relieve the death-rate of their class in the City ; but still, with all 13 ance for this, the general indications are, that while the mortality of the better classes is not much higher than the average death-rate for the whole country, that of the labourer is excessive. And then, again, the story told by the Workhouse is very significant of the trying circumstances of a City life among the poor. The results of the last ten years show that of every 1,000 deaths in the City, 145 are paupers who die in the City workhouses. The classes that contribute most to this aggregate are labourers, porters, messengers, shoemakers, and tailors, among males; and domestic servants, nurses, charwomen, needlewomen, and the wives and widows of labourers and porters, among women. Of a thousand males who die in the workhouses, 232 are labourers, 85 porters and messengers, 71 shoemakers, 63 tailors and cap-makers, 60 carpenters, and 56 shopkeepers; and of a thousand females who die there, 250 are domestic servants, nurses, and charwomen, 100 are the wives and widows of labourers, and 67 are needlewomen. So that about half of all the workhouse deaths are among five classes of persons, namely :—labourers, servants and charwomen, porters and messengers, shoemakers, tailors, and needlewomen; and of these the first two contribute more than onefourth of the total mortality. It is not easy to determine in each of these cases the actual proportion 14 of deaths to the living; but enough is seen in the facts already exposed, to indicate the struggle for existence, and, perhaps, also the degrees of improvidence; for of all the deaths in the City among persons of more than 55 years of age, about 30 per cent. occur in the workhouses. It would almost seem that the workhouse is the natural asylum for the aged and infirm; and it might be added, that when they reach it, the powers of life are so husbanded, that a good old age is secured. Those who enter the workhouse at 55 and upwards, live to the mean age of 70. At 65 years of age and upwards, the average term of life is to 77, whereas in the whole City it is but 73, and in all England it is scarcely 77. The facts which are brought to light, by examining in detail the mean age at death of the different classes in the City are not without interest; for although they do not give us very accurate information of the probable lifetime of a citizen, yet they indicate sufficiently well the marked difference in the duration of a city and a country life. Among all classes of males in the City, at 20 and upwards, the mean age at death is scarcely 52 years, whereas in all England it is nearly 56. Among women at 20 and upwards, the mean age at death in the City is a little less than 50, though in the rest of England it is a little more. It would appear from this that 15 there is a general loss of about four years in the lifetime of every man in the City; but the different classes show remarkable variations in this respect. The merchant and shopkeeper, for instance, dies at the mean age of 57; the clerk at 54; the tailor, shoemaker, labourer, carpenter, and porter, at from 51 to 52; the cabman, ostler, and carman, at 50; the costermonger and hawker at 49; and the printer at 45. In every instance the wives in these classes have a much longer duration of life than their husbands, for it commonly reaches to about 56 years ; and, therefore, we may conclude that the circumstances which shorten existence in the City are not so much in the homes of the people as in their occupations and habits. It is true, that in forming an estimate of the duration of life from the mean age at death, considerable allowance must be made for the fact that in many occupations the young and active are almost alone employed, and although the occupations may be healthy, the deaths in them furnish a contrary indication; and so again there are trades, which, from the lightness of labour, engage an undue proportion of the sick and ailing. These, also, would give us untruthful indications. But with every consideration for this, there can be no doubt that there are large differences in the value of life among the different classes of this City, and that in no class is the mean duration of life as great as it should be. 16 The chief causes of death during the year are classified in Table VIII. of the Appendix. The leading facts may be thus expressed: of every 1,000 deaths, among all classes in the City, there were 164 from pneumonia and bronchitis, 113 from phthisis, 76 from tabes and scrofula, 25 from hydrocephalus, 55 from convulsions and teething, 27 from diarrhoea, 71 from scarlet-fever, 39 from continued fever, 15 from small-pox, 24 from measles, 9 from erysipelas, 50 from whoopingcough, croup, and diphtheria, 62 from violence, privation, and poison, and 270 from causes of a chronic nature—altogether, therefore, there were 214 deaths in every 1,000 from tubercular diseases, 164 from inflammatory affections of the lungs, and 235 from diseases of a zymotic character. The average numbers, for the last ten years, are 212 from the first-named maladies, 164 from the second, and 206 from the third. In all England the proportions are 160, 149, and 194 respectively. Each of these groups of diseases is thus seen to be more prevalent and fatal in the City than elsewhere. The miasmatic diseases, especially during the last year, have not only been in excess of the common average for the whole country, but have also been in excess of the average for the City. The chief increase has been caused by an excessive mortality from smallpox and scarlet-fever—both of which have been unusually prevalent during the last twelve months. 17 In distributing the deaths according to their causes, among the several classes in the City, we are struck with the fact that these causes have operated very unequally. Fever, for example, has had a general mortality, during the last nine years, of 38 per 1,000 of all the deaths among males at 15 and upwards; but among clerks, shoemakers, carpenters, and watermen, it has ranged from 40 to 43 per 1,000; among blacksmiths and butchers, from 47 to 49; and with male domestic servants and labourers it has been from 51 to 54. The average for the whole country among males being 50 per 1,000 of the deaths. Among females, the average mortality from fever is 43 per 1,000, but among the wives of cabmen it has been 55; and among needlewomen, nurses, charwomen, and domestic servants, it has been from 103 to 106 per 1,000; the average for England being 49. Diarrhœa, also, is a disease which has caused about 21 deaths in every 1,000; but with sailors, bargemen, watermen, costermongers, and hawkers, it has been fatal to the extent of from 36 to 52 per 1,000 of all the deaths. Again, phthisis has been developed, and has had a rare mortality, among particular classes. Its average death-rate in the City, among adult males, is 241 per 1,000 of the deaths; and among females it is 194; but with costermongers, tailors, and printers the mortality has been from 279 to 351 per 1,000; and with needlewomen it has been the B 18 cause of nearly half the deaths. Whether the disease is nurtured by these occupations, or whether the phthisical attach themselves to these trades, because of the comparatively light work, is yet to be determined; but there is great reason to fear that the occupations themselves are not altogether free from influence on the disease. Inflammatory affections of the lungs, as pneumonia and bronchitis, cause about one-fifth of the total mortality of adults; but with painters, costermongers, labourers, cabmen, and porters, it is fatal to the extent of from 225 to 264 per l,000of the deaths. And, lastly, the diseases which are most active with young children at from 1 to 5 years of age, are tabes, scrofula, and hydrocephalus—all diseases of a tubercular character. These together cause about 80 per 1,000 of all the deaths in the City, the average for the whole country being but 40. Under 15 years of age the mortality from these diseases is about 221 per 1,000 of the deaths, whereas in the rest of England it is but 67. This explains the remarkable fact of the large mortality of children in the City after the first year of their age. It points to the unhealthy influences at home, which, though they may not largely affect the well-being of the adult, are manifestly concerned in the destruction of the child. 19 And here, before I leave this part of the subject, I may mention that the preceding facts have been deduced from the mortality returns in the City during the last nine years. In 1864, when the decennial averages can be taken, I hope to have the opportunity of developing these facts more fully. I may also mention that the numbers taken for the population of the City, as well as for the different classes, is the mean of the census returns of 1851 and 1861; and on comparing those returns, I have found that the falling off in the population during the last ten years has not been so much by the migration of the better classes from the City as by the reduction of the number of the labouring classes. In 1851 there were about 15,383 labourers, masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, painters, tailors, and shoemakers in the City, whereas in 1861 there were but 12,196 of these classes; about one-fifth, therefore, of this section of the population has migrated from the city to other districts. The classes which have been stationary, or nearly so, are shopkeepers, porters, messengers, cabmen, ostlers, publicans, and those engaged in police duties. On the other hand, the number of sempstresses and needlewomen has increased to the extent of nearly 75 per cent. The sickness returns for the year are below the average of former years. Only 10,495 cases of b 2 20 illness were attended among the poor of the City by the Union Medical Officers, the average number being 11,819; and of these 742 were cases of fever, 672 of diarrhoea, and 236 of small-pox,—each of which was the subject of especial inquiry as regards the sanitary condition of the places where they occurred. The principal facts connected with the meteorology of the year are recorded in Table X. of the Appendix. They have been obtained, as usual, from observations at Guildhall, under the superintendence of Mr. Haywood; but they do not offer any remarkable points for consideration. The sanitary work of the year is also shown in the last tables of the Appendix ; and I may state that there have been 5,803 inspections of houses, and 3,186 visits to the common lodging-houses of the City ; and that these have resulted in the issuing of 2,443 orders for sanitary improvement. The markets and slaughter-houses have been daily inspected, and the officers have condemned 210,505 lbs., or nearly 100 tons of meat, as unfit for human food. It consisted of 870 sheep and lambs, 90 calves, 303 pigs, 1,178 quarters of beef 2,988 joints of meat; besides 22 quarters and haunches of venison, and 2,743 head of game and 21 poultry. About half of the whole amount was diseased, a tenth of it was from animals that had died from accident or disease, and the rest was putrid. Besides this, there have been condemned, by the officers at Billingsgate Market, 1,312,651 fish, 2,412 gallons of shrimps, 265 bushels of shellfish, 230 lbs. of eels, and many barrels and casks of anchovies and cods' sounds; all of which was at once destroyed. The law relating to the offence of exposing unsound and diseased meat and unwholesome food for sale in the markets, has been amended during the year, and the penalty for the offence is now more severe than it was ; besides which, the inquiry concerning it can be pursued more easily before the magistrate, who has summary powers to inflict a fine of £20 on the offender, and to imprison him for three months. We have, therefore, been able to bring many offenders to justice; and have, during the year, caused twenty persons to be fined or imprisoned. Their names and addresses are fully set forth in the Appendix. One thing, however, is yet wanted to put a final check on the practice of sending unwholesome food to the City markets: and that is, the cordial co-operation of the meat salesmen—many of whom, at present, will not give us the names of the persons who have sent the diseased meat to the markets. Until this is 22 accomplished, we shall still have much difficulty in pursuing offenders in a court of law. There are, indeed, numerous instances where the salesmen have either refused to give up the names of the senders, or have told us that the names were unknown to them. I hope soon to see this corrected. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HY. LETIIEBY. 41, Finsbury Square, January, 1864.

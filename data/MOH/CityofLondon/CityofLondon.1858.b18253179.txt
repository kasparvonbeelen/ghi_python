LONDON: m. lownds, printer, 148½, fenchurch street, city. 1860. At a Meeting of the Commissioners of hewers of the City of London, held at the Guildhall, of the said City, on Tuesday, 17th April, 1860:— The Medical Officer of Health laid before the Court his Annual Report, which was ordered to be Printed, and a Copy to be sent to every Member of this Court, and of the Court of Common Council. JOSEPH DAW, Principal Clerk. the SANITARY CONDITION of the CITY OF LONDON. THE ELEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Hon. the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, In submitting the tabulated returns of the sanitary statistics of the City for the last twelve months, I have the satisfaction to state that they indicate a favorable condition of the public health. The vital movements of the population may be expressed in very few words. There have been 1,843 marriages, 3,260 births, and 2,911 deaths— the mean proportions for the last ten years being 1,740, 3,504, and 3,102, respectively. The marriages, therefore, have risen above the average, and 6 the births and the deaths have fallen below it; and it is remarkable that the increase of marriages is entirely in the Central districts, where the births and the deaths have been so notably diminished. In the whole of the City the proportion of marriages in the year has been but as 1 to 20 adult males, and 1 to 22 adult females; and there have been 14 marriages to every 1,000 of the population: the proportion in England being but 8 to the 1,000, and in London about 9.7. The distribution of the births in the several districts has been as follows:—1,419 in the Eastern Union, the average being 1,467; 804 in the Western, to an average of 790; and 1,037 in the Central, to an average of 1,246. The proportion of males has been only a little above that of females, the number of the former being 1,632, and of the latter 1,628; which is as 100.2 is to 100. In England generally it is as 105 to 100. Again; the proportion of births in the City to that of childbearing women between the ages of 15 and 45 has been but as 9 to 100, whereas in the whole of England it is as 14 to 100. It is satisfactory to know that the number of deaths for the year is not only below the general average for the last decennial period, but it is even below the average for that time when the two 7 cholera years of 1849 and 1854 are excluded. Altogether the reduction of mortality has been to the extent of rather more than 61 in the 1,000; but the reduction has not been equal in the three districts, for it has amounted to only 13 per 1,000 in the Western divisions of the City, to 50 in the Eastern, and to 109 in the Central. A part of the large reduction in the last-named district is no doubt due to a falling off in the number of the resident population ; for if the death-rate is calculated according to the census returns of 1851, it will be found that while the mortality in the whole of the City has been at the rate of 22-4 per 1,000 of the population; in the Western division it has been as high as 27.3; in the Eastern, 26.5; and in the Central only 19.8. So that while 1 in 44 have died in the whole City; 1 in 36 have died in the Western districts; 1 in 39 in the Eastern; and only 1 in 56 in the Central. In all England the annual mortality is at the average rate of 22'3 per 1,000 of the population: in country districts it is only 20, and in the large towns it is nearly 26. If, therefore, the City mortality is measured by these standards it does not appear, on the whole, to be unsatisfactory; and it certainly presents a very favorable contrast to the high death-rate of our large towns. This indeed will be more apparent hereafter: but still, it cannot be denied that there are districts in the City where the mortality is excessive. These, 8 however, are the localities of the poor, where other influences, besides dirt and over-crowding, are at work; for, in spite of all our sanitary efforts, they still show—as well in the sickness as the mortality returns—an undue proportion of those unwholesome influences which act so severely on a city life; but this will be better seen when we examine the death-rate of the young, and the nature of the diseases which have caused it. In the course of the year the mortality of chil dren under 15 years of age, has been greater than usual:—it has risen from a general average of 1,351 to 1,408; and the increase has been chiefly among children of less than "five years of age. These indeed have died to the number of 1,230, instead of 1,182. Altogether it amounts to a little more than 42 per cent. of all the deaths. In the Metropolis generally, the proportion is somewhat less than 41 per cent.; and in all England, where the proportion of infants is much larger than in the City, it is but 42. I have no means of determining very accurately the death-rate of children in the City, for I have no knowledge of the number living; but if we take the number (13,663) which was given at the last census, and which is rather more than a tenth of the whole population, it will appear that the death-rate of children under five years of age has been a little more than 90 in the 9 1000: in the rest of London it is but 77; in all England it is about 68; and in the healthy districts of the country it is only 40. Again:—the mortality of children in the first year of their age has been very severe, for it has amounted to nearly one-fifth of all the births: in fact out of 3,260 children born in the year, 608 have died. This is somewhat more than the average (3,504 and 574) for the last ten years; and it amounts to nearly 19 per cent. of the infant life. In the Eastern and Western divisions of the City it has reached to 22 per cent.; whereas, in the rest of London, as in all England, it is only from 15 to 15.5 per cent. At more advanced periods of life, the death-rate diminishes, and the returns are more favorable. They are far better indeed than elsewhere,for at from 15 to 35 years of age, the mortality is greatly below the average for the whole country. In the first decennial period it amounts to only 51 per 1,000, and in the second to 7.3: the rates in England for the corresponding periods being 8.4, and 10.4. After this, however, they again decline; and from the ages of 35 to 45 they amount to 14.5 per 1,000; from 45 to 55, to 19.1; and from 55 to 65, to 35.5—the rates in England for those periods being but 13, 17 6, and 30 5. It is manifest, therefore, 10 that the greatest strain upon a city life is during childhood and mature age. Let us now examine the distribution of the deaths among the sexes. Of the 2,911 deaths in the year, 1,509 were males and 1,402 females. These are in the proportion of 1,075 of the former to 1,000 of the latter. In the rest of London it is only as 1,028 to 1,000; and in all England it is 1,033. At the ages of from 15 to 45, the City proportion of deaths is as 1,180 males to 1,000 females: in the whole of London it is but 1,108 to 1,000, and in England only 933. In the 20 years which follow (from 45 to 65) the males of the City die at the rate of 1,280 for every 1,000 females. In London, at these ages, the proportion is 1,077, and in England 1,087; and lastly, at 65 and upwards the male deaths in the City are only 650 to the 1,000 females, while in London they are 752, and in England 888. It thus appears that there is an undue proportion of males upon the death-roll, and that it swells the mortality at every age up to 65. In London the excess is arrested at 55, and in England it stops at 15, to rise again at from 45 to 65. The maximum mortality of males in the City is at from 35 to 55, and then it reaches to a proportion of about 1,400 males to a 1,000 females. In England the maximum is from 55 to 65, and it never exceeds 1,087 to the 1,000 females. 11 Lastly, if we look at the mean age at death in the City, the results are equally significant. In all England the expectancy of a man's life at 20 is to 60 years:—in the City it is only to 51.5. At the age of 45 the expectancy of life in England is to 68-3, but in the City it is only to 62; and at 65 years of age a man in the rest of England might expect to live to 76, whereas in the City he will reach to only 73. The mean life time of adult females in England is only about one year more than that of males, but in the City it is, at different periods of life, from 4 to 6 years greater, showing that the unwholesome influences operate most severely on the males: indeed, the conclusion from all this is, that the circumstances of a City life are peculiarly trying, for they increase the death-rate from a normal standard of about 17 in the 1,000 to nearly 23; they double the mortality of the infant population, and shorten the period of adult life from an average age of 60 to 51. Dark, however, as this picture may seem to be, it is far lighter than it once was, and is brighter than that which is still drawn of the chief towns of England and the large cities of Europe. Ten years ago the annual mortality of the City was rarely less than 25 in the 1,000; and we are told by the Registrar-General that the death-rate of our large 12 towns at the present time is little short of 26 in the 1,000. Our present condition is 19 percent. better than that; and we owe it to the sanitary labours of the last ten years. Even five years ago, the average mortality in the City was as high as 3,190 in the year; but in the course of the last four years, since the fruits of those labours have begun to ripen, the number has fallen to an average of 2,902; and it is no small thing to have brought about the saving of nearly 300 lives in the year, and that, too, in the midst of difficulties of no ordinary character. The chief towns of England, with their high mortality, are not subject as we are to the unwholesome influences of an excessive over-crowding. Here the inhabitants are so thronged together that from 131 to 291 must find room upon an acre. No such condition of things exists in the large towns of England—for the density of their population is rarely above 50 on the acre— and yet their mortality ranges from 24 to 36 in the 1.000. We have reason, therefore, for congratulation that the sanitary state of the City is as good as it is, and that the untoward circumstances which commerce and industry have forced upon us, are kept so largely in check. In Table IV of the appendix the chief causes of death are classified, and the returns are com- 13 pared with those of the last four years, during which time the particular causes have been duly registered. You will notice that the deaths from violence have fallen from an average of 163 to 158, and those from bronchitis and pneumonia from 521 to 457. Tubercular diseases have also diminished from a general average of 647 to 583; phthisis has fallen from 372 to 342; tabes and scrofula from 179 to 153; and hydrocephalus from 96 to 88. But there are other diseases which have advanced. Teething and the convulsions of infancy have risen from an average of 164 to 193; and the zymotic class of affections have increased from an average of 620 to 665. This has been caused by the general prevalence of eruptive disorders—measles for example have risen from 68 to 88, small-pox from 27 to 47, and scarlet fever from 110 to 127. The zymotic affections of the throat, as croup, whooping-cough, and diphtheria, have likewise been unusually fatal, in the proportion of 173 to 149. But the especial diseases of putridity, of filth, and of over-crowding have been notably diminished: continued fevers have fallen from an average of 121 to 107; alvine-flux from 45 to 31; and erysipelas from 22 to 10. The pathogenic tests, therefore, of the sanitary condition of this City, have not failed to show a marked improvement in the public 14 health; and it would be still more marked, if the tests were applied to the returns of a dozen years ago; for then the deaths from fever were rarely less than 160 in the year, and those from alvine-flux were not often below a hundred. I refrain from making any large comparison of the mortality from these diseases in the City, with that of England; but I may remark that fever and alvineflux, are less prevalent here than in the whole country; for while with us the former is fatal to only 1 in 1,214 of the population, and contributes but 36 per 1,000 of all the deaths, in England it is fatal to 1 in 1,136, and contributes about 41 per 1,000. Alvine-flux with us is fatal to only 1 in 1,150, and makes but 38 per 1,000 of the deaths, but in all England it annually kills 1 in 1,026 of the people, and furnishes about 45 per 1,000 of the deaths. Phthisis also is less prevalent, as a cause of death, in the City districts, but tabes and scrofula—the consumption of infancy—are far more so. All of which go to show that the great influences which are at work in shortening a city life are those which check the healthy nourishment of the body, and yet hurry forward the movement of the vital powers. These influences are remote as well as immediate in their action ; for not only do they at once produce a rich harvest of death, but they scatter the seeds for a future growth. In fact, 15 the conditions which tend to enfeeble the parent are perpetuated in the child, and the future generation becomes less able to bear up against the noxious influences which may have only weakened their progenitors. Something definite is wanted to meet these conditions, for they are independent of what is thought to be the common and preventable causes of disease. Hitherto our attention has been chiefly directed to what may be called the self-evident sources of disorder—as the crowding together of human beings, the collection of putrid refuse, and the insufficient supply of water; but nothing has been thought of the more latent influences—as those of habit and occupation and poverty, and many domestic ills, the effects of which are quite as serious as those which come from filth and the action of zymosis: indeed, the deaths from diseases of growth and constitutional development are far more numerous than those of the preventable class, as they are commonly called; and the time is not far off, when it will be thought necessary, for the extension of sanitary science beyond the domain of filth. The meteorology of the year, which is shown in Table V. of the appendix, has been fully discussed in the quarterly reports; and I have only to add that 7,233 inspections of houses have been made in the course of the year, of which 803 were 16 of the common lodging-houses, and that 935 orders have been issued for sanitary improvement in various particulars. The details of all this are shown in the last table of the Appendix. I have the honor, Gentlemen, To remain, your obedient Servant, HY. LETHEBY. Guildhall, April 1860.

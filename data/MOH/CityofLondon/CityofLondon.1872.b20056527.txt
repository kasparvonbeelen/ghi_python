To the Honourable Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen,—In accordance with the practice of the last twenty-five years, I submit to you the Statistical Tables relating to the sanitary condition of the City of London during the official year which expired on the 30th of September last. The first table shows that there were 1,262 marriages, 1,752 births, and 1,583 deaths registered in the City during the year. As might be expected from the diminished population of the City, all these numbers are below the averages for the last ten years; but they arc not largely different from the mean 8 annual proportions, as estimated from the number of the population. Looking, in fact, at the registered numbers of the last thirty years, it appears that the fluctuations in the average annual proportions of marriages, births, and deaths, in the City, during each of the successive quinquennial periods, have been as follows:— Averages per Annum. 1844 to 1818. Quinquennial Periods from 1869 to 1873. 184!) to 1853. 1854 to 1858. 1859 to 1863. 1864 to 1868. Population 127,553 129,922 122,197 114,472 95,538 76,604 Number of Marriages 1,789 1,743 1,722 1,675 1,456 1,249 Rate of do. per 1,000 of pop. 14.02 13.42 14.09 14.3 15.24 16.0 Number of Birtbs 3,579 3,582 3,426 3,163 2,467 1,04 Rate of do. per 1,000 of pop. 28.06 27.57 28.04 27.63 25.82 24.86 Number of Deaths 3,389 3,120 3,086 2,820 2,466 1,870 Hate of do. per 1.000 of pop. 26.57 24.01 25.25 24.63 25.81 24.41 So that the marriages have risen from an annual proportion of about 14 per 1,000 of the population in the first named period (1844 to 1848) to rather more than 16 per 1,000 in the last (1869 to 1873); while the births have declined from about 28 per 1,000 to 25 ; and the deaths from 26.6 to 24.4. MARRIAGES. Of the 1,262 marriages in the City during the past year, 331 were in the spring quarter, 342 in the summer, 332 in the autumn, and only 257 in the 9 winter. The marriage-rate was in the proportion of nearly 16.5 per 1,000 of the population. This is somewhat above the annual average (15.8) for the preceding ten years, and it is largely above the average (10.3) for the rest of London. In all England the marriage-rate is only 8.32 per 1,000 of the population, or just half that of the City of London. In Austria the rate is 8.75; in Prussia 8.43; in France 7.79; in Spain 7.55; and in Italy only 7.49. Compared, therefore, with the large capitals of Europe, it is manifest that the marriage-rate of the City is remarkably high, and it doubtless indicates a high state of prosperity. BIRTHS. The 1,752 births in the City were thus distributed: 823 were in the Eastern district, 436 in the Western, and 493 in the Central. These numbers are in the annual proportion of 29.5 per 1,000 of the population of the first named district, 23.2 of the second, and only 16.4 of the third. In the whole City the birthrate has been 22.9 per 1,000 of the people. This is below the average (25.3) for the preceding ten years, and it is a good deal below the average (35.4) for the rest of the Metropolis. In all England the birth-rate is 35.3 per 1,000 of the population; in Austria it is 39.9; in Prussia 39.3; in Italy 37.4; in Spain 37.2; and in France 26.3. The City, therefore, presents the anomaly of a large marriage-rate, with a small birth-rate, and this is due to the fact that a 10 large number of young persons, engaged in shops and warehouses, leave the City when they marry, and seek a residence elsewhere. Of the 1,752 births recorded in the year, 839 were females, and 913 males. These numbers are in the proportion of 108.8 males to 100 females. During the last twenty-five years the proportion has been 103.4 males to 100 females, and this is nearly the average for the rest of London, and for all England. DEATHS. The death-rate, like the birth-rate, has been highest in the Eastern division of the City, and lowest in the Central; for in the former it reached to 21.3 per 1,000 of the population, and in the latter to only 19.9. In the Western district it was intermediate, namely 20.83 per 1,000, and in the whole City it averaged 20.6. This is much below the annual death-rate (25.1) of the preceding ten years, and it is also below the average death-rate (24.6) for the rest of the Metropolis. In the towns and town-districts of England the average death-rate is 24.9 per 1,000, and in all England it is 22.6. Measured, therefore, by these standards, it would seem that the mortality in the City during the last year has been greatly below the average, and this may in some measure be due to the active sanitary operations of preceding years. It is not wise, however, to speak with confidence on 11 this point, as another year might falsify the conclusion. Looking, indeed, at the death-rate in the City during the last thirty years, as well as that of the Metropolis generally, where active sanitary measures have for many years past been constantly in operation, it does not appear that the mortality is notably affected; for in the first ten years of that period the death-rate in the City was 25.29 per 1,000 of the population, and in the last decade it was 25.11. So also in London— during the first period it was 24.48 per 1,000, and in the last 24.14—thus showing but little variation. The following, in fact, represents the death-rates in the City and in London generally at each quinquennial period of the last thirty years:— Death-rate per 1,000 of the Population. In Quinquennial Periods. In the City. In London 1844 to 1848 inclusive 26.57 24.66 1849 „ 1853 „ 24.01 24.30 1854 „ 1858 „ 25.25 24.42 1859 „ 1863 „ 24.63 23.30 1864 „ 1868 „ 25.81 . 24.86 1869 „ 1873 24.41 23.42 From which it is evident that little alteration has been effected in the death-rates of either the City or the Metropolis during the last thirty years. It is manifest, indeed, that the death-rates alone afford no reliable indication of the state of the public health, or of the value of sanitary measures, and that for any useful purpose they must be considered in connection with a variety of circumstances, as the birthrate, the mortality of children, the character of the 12 diseases which are the chief causes of death, &c. The common practice, therefore, of quoting the deathrate of a place irrespective of these considerations is singularly fallacious; and it is exemplified in the fact that the average death-rate in England has remained pretty constant during the last thirty years or more, notwithstanding the progress of sanitation, and the beneficial effects of it on the public health. MORTALITY OF MALES AND FEMALES. The relative mortality of males and females in the City is shown in the third table of the Appendix, from which it appears that in the Western district of the City 107 males die for every 100 females; in the Eastern, 115 for every 100; and in the City proper, 130. In the entire City the proportion is 118 males for every 100 females. This is a very large proportion, seeing that in all England it is only 101. It appears, too, that the proportion is gradually increasing, for 30 years ago the average number was but 107 males for every 100 females: even ten years ago it was but 110 to 100. The chief increase is in the Central district, which contains the largest proportion of males engaged in shops and warehouses. But taking the number of each sex in the population, it does not appear that the mortality is in either case excessive, for during the last five years the death-rate of males in the City has been 24.8 per 1,000, and of females 24.4; whereas last year it was only 21.8 for males, and 19.5 for females. In all 13 England the average mortality of males is 23.7 per 1,000, and of females 21.4. MORTALITY AT DIFFERENT AGES. The classification of deaths according to age is exhibited in the fourth table of the Appendix, the results being, that in every 1,000 deaths in the City, 173 were of infants of less than a year old, and 297 were of children under 5 years of age. At other ages there were 61 deaths of young persons at from 5 to 20 years of age, 123 at from 20 to 40 years of age, 231 at from 40 to 60, and 288 at 60 and upwards. These numbers are a little different from the averages of the last ten years, which show a much smaller proportion of deaths below 40 years of age, and a correspondingly larger proportion above. This will be evident from the following table, which exhibits— The average relative proportions of Deaths, per 1,000 Deaths, at different Ages, in the three districts of the City during the last Ten years. AGES. East District. West District. Central District. Entire City. Under 1 203.1 190.0 137.7 177.2 1 to 5 199.8 185.0 135.3 173.8 5 „ 20 74.8 74.7 77.8 75.8 20 ,, 40 127.2 141.2 136.5 134.2 40 ,, 60 175.2 188.3 209.2 190.3 219.9 220.8 303.5 248.7 Total all Ages 1,000.0 1,000.0 1,000.0 1,000.0 14 The mortality of infants of less than a year old is excessive, for it amounts to 17.52 per cent. of the births. In the Western district it averages 19 per cent., in the Eastern 18, and in the City proper only 15.5. In the whole of the Metropolis it is 15.71 per cent., and in all England 15.37. The death-rate, therefore, of the infant population of the Eastern and Western divisions of the City is remarkably high, and so it has been for the last thirty years, as will be seen from the following table:— Number of Deaths of Infants under 1 year of aye for every 1,000 Births in each Quinquennial of the last Thirty years. Years, inclusive. CITY DISTRICTS. Entire City. London. England. Eastern. Western. Central. 1844 to 1848 178.6 192.7 133.1 164.4 156.3 154.3 1849 to 1853 174.8 189.0 131.7 162.0 164.4 155.3 1854 to 1858 180.9 161.3 140.4 162.2 156.2 153.5 1859 to 1863 172.3 190.2 143.3 167.3 150.5 148.8 1864 to 1868 181.0 198.4 163.4 180.8 158.2 155.9 1869 to 1873 177.8 182.2 146.1 170.0 164.4 154.2 Average of 30 years 177.3 185.2 140.5 166.7 157.1 153.7 As measured, therefore, by the first and the last decades of this period, it would seem that the average death-rate of infants in the City during the 10 years, from 1844 to 1853, was only 163.2 per 1,000, whereas in the last 10 years it has been 175.2 per 1,000. In all London the relative proportions for these periods 15 are 155.3 and 161.3, and in the whole of England they are 154.8 and 155.1, thus showing a steady and general increase in the death-rate of infants. The same is the case with the mortality of children up to 5 years of age; for while in all England there are but 262.3 of such deaths to every 1,000 births, in the Metropolis there are 293.2, and in the City 348.9— the range being from 298.5 in the best districts to 392.7 in the worst. All this points to the existence of certain unwholesome influences that operate most seriously on infant life in the crowded localities of our large towns; and these influences are chiefly referable to the ill-conditioned houses of the poor— houses, which are not merely structurally defective and, therefore, unsuited for the use of such tenantry, but are also so dilapidated from age, and so filthy from constant occupation, as to be beyond the reach of sanitary improvement. And it is not alone that such places are in the highest degree unwholesome ; they are likewise from their brutal surroundings the prolific nurseries of crime—persistently forcing upon the young the worst examples of indecency and immorality ; and thus it is that the physical and social atmosphere of such places has its baneful influence upon the health and character of the inmates. Even the owners of such property are so influenced by it, as to be for the most part unwilling to make any sanitary improvement or to set before their tenantry any sort of laudable example. This condition of things has again and again been the subject of severe 16 comment by my predecessor and myself. Lately, however, it has been forced upon public attention by a memorial addressed by the Royal College of Physicians of London to the First Lord of the Treasury, in which it is declared that the overcrowding of the poor in unwholesome and ill-constructed houses originates disease, and leads to drunkenness and immorality; and as private enterprise appears to be incapable of dealing effectually with this evil, by providing better dwellings for the poor, they urge the necessity of its being inquired into by the Government as a question of national importance. Memorials of a like description have been submitted to the Prime Minister by other societies, and there is hope from the manner in which they have been entertained that the subject will receive immediate attention from the Government, who appear to be desirous of dealing with it in an earnest and practical manner. That which is really wanted to meet the difficulty is some easy and effective process by which, under proper restrictions, local sanitary authorities can purchase and obtain possession of waste spaces, vacant sites, and dilapidated buildings of large towns, with power to dispose of them to others who would be willing to re-purchase such property, and build thereon, in conformity with certain prescribed plans, a class of houses suited to the requirements and limited means of the labouring classes. There need be no show of eleemosynary relief in all this ; for the success of the Peabody Fund and of the 17 Waterlow Company afford abundant evidence of the pecuniary advantages to be derived from undertakings of this description when properly managed. There is, in fact, good reason for believing that, with increased facilities for obtaining possession of dilapidated and notoriously unwholesome property, as well as of property in which conflicting interests are concerned, there would soon arise a class of investors, actuated as much by sound commercial principles as by benevolent considerations, who would be willing to engage in judicious building schemes for the better housing of the poor. The beneficial effects of this would, no doubt, be speedily manifested in an improvement of the public health; for by removing or suppressing the endemic influences which are so hostile to infant life, and which likewise give intensity to epidemic desease, we should surely abate the pestiferous sickness which now haunts the dwellings of the labouring classes, and contributes so largely to the death-rate of the population ; besides which the functions of the Sanitary Officer would be more easily and satisfactorily exercised, for he would no longer have to encounter those inherent domestic difficulties which baffle, and to a large extent frustrate his best endeavours. EFFECTS OF SEASONS. In close connection with the subject of home influences are the effects of the different seasons of the year on the mortality of the people, for these effects, 18 when hurtful, are most marked in the crowded dwellings of the poor. In a general way it may be said that the largest proportional number of deaths occurs in the winter quarter, when the inclemency of the weather exerts its action against the aged and the infirm; for on taking the averages of the last ten years, as shown in the fifth table of the Appendix, it will be seen that of every 1,000 deaths in the year throughout the City, 280 occur in the winter season, and only 232 in the summer—the autumn proportion being 251, and the spring 237. This effect of winter cold is most marked in the healthy districts of the City, where the natural causes of death are not masked by the unnatural; for in the unhealthy districts the summer is the fatal season; and this was so remarkable in the time of my predecessor, that he referred to it as a test of defective sanitary conditions, its higher temperature giving to the several local causes of endemic disease an augmentation of activity and virulence. It is gratifying, however, to observe that this is abated to a large extent, and that it indicates improvement in the sanitary condition of the worst districts of the City. But even now there is sufficient to show that the heat of summer is peculiarly inimical to infant life; for of every 1,000 deaths of children during the year, 287 occur in the summer quarter, and only 214 in the winter. At from 15 to 40 years of age the death-rate is not much affected by the seasons, but after that age the mortality becomes larger and larger in the winter quarter as age 19 advances; so that of every 1,000 deaths in the year at GO and upwards, 330, or nearly a third of the whole number, occur in the winter, and only 200 in summer. These facts are fully illustrated by the following table:— Proportions of Deaths, per 1,000 Deaths, at different Ages, and at different Seasons of the year. AGES. Quarters ending in Entire Year. March, June. September. December. Under 5 298 350 393 338 342 5to 15 41 47 60 58 52 15 to 30 79 80 82 86 82 30 to 50 173 168 154 172 167 50 to 60 109 101 89 107 102 60 to 70 133 123 103 112 118 70 and over 167 131 119 127 137 Total at all Ages 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 CAUSES OF DEATH. The diseases which most contribute to the high mortality of old persons in the winter are inflammatory affections of the lungs; and the disorders which cause the large summer death-rate of children are tabes, marasmus, &c., and diarrhoea. Phthisis is most fatal in spring and autumn, and so are the convulsive affections of children; but zymotic maladies, with few exceptions, are most hostile to life in the summer time, for they then cause about 20 one-fourth of the total mortality. It so happens, however, that autumn is most favourable for the development of scarlet fever, and winter for smallpox. Judging from the averages of the last 10 years, it would seem that the following are the relative proportions of deaths from some of the most important diseases during each of the four quarters of the year:— Average Number of Deaths, per 1,000 Deaths, from different Diseases, in each of the four Quarters of the year, for Ten years. causes op death.

The mere empiricism of the influence of the seasons, or even of the periodic 21 visitations of these diseases, has not yet given us the least insight into their causal relations, or even into the laws which govern their manifestations. Looking back, for example, at the several epidemic visitations of these diseases during the last twenty years, we notice that alvine disorders (cholera) were extremely severe in 1855 and 1866; that continued fever was unusually fatal from 1855 to 1857, in 1859, and from 1862 to 1866; that scarlet fever has pursued a regular periodic course of two years of severity and two of intermission, beginning with 1855 and 1856, and ending with 1871 and 1872; that measles was epidemic in 1858 and 1859, in 1861 and 1862, in 1864, in 1866, and 1868; and that whooping cough, croup, and diphtheria were more than commonly active in 1855, in 1858 and 1859, in 1861 and 1862, in 1865 and 1866, in 1869 and in 1872; while the years which were most free from total epidemic influence were 1858, 1860, 1865, 1867, and from 1870 to the present time. But none of these periods, whether epidemic or otherwise, presented any such marked peculiarity of season, or other natural phenomena, as would enable us to interpret the actual causation of such diseases, or the so-called epidemic constitution of the period. With respect to the distribution of disease in the various districts of the City during the year, I have to direct your attention to the sixth table of the Appendix, as well as to the following, which 22 presents the comparative mortality from each important group of diseases in the City, as well as in London, and in the whole of England:— Average Proportion of Heaths from each cause, in every 1,000 Deaths from all causes, in each of the City Districts, as well as in London and England during the last Ten years. CITY DISTRICTS. Entire City. London. England. Eastern. Western. Central. Pneumonia and Bronchitis 160 166 167 164 172 148 Phthisis 127 130 136 131 115 109 Tabes and Scrofula 22 22 12 19 21 19 Marasmus and Debility 43 42 26 37 46 62 Hydrocephalus 19 17 11 16 19 15 Convulsions and Teething 63 62 50 57 45 62 Alvine Flux 50 38 31 41 57 48 Continued Fever 38 28 31 33 31 39 Scarlet Fever 32 31 26 30 35 45 Small-Pox 13 12 7 11 20 12 Measles 26 26 15 22 23 19 Whooping Cough 35 26 21 28 35 23 Croup and Diphtheria 18 16 13 16 14 18 Erysipelas 6 7 4 6 5 4 The deductions from this table are remarkably interesting, as they show the influence of local circumstances on the development of disease. You will observe, for example, that inflammatory affections of the lungs are most marked in the Central division of the City, where the population is largely composed of young persons engaged in shops and warehouses, and it is smallest in the Eastern division. Nowhere, 23 however, are they so large as in the rest of London, though they far exceed the average for all England. Phthisis, too, is most fatal in the Central district, where it contributes 13.6 per cent. of all the deaths. In the Eastern district it amounts to only 12.7 percent., and in the Western to 13; but everywhere within the City the mortality from this disease is larger than in the rest of London (11.5 per cent.), and much larger than the average (10.9) for the whole of England. It is manifest, therefore, that the circumstances which give activity to this affection are very prevalent within the City, especially in the central part of it. Tabes, scrofula, and hydrocephalus, which are the tubercular affections of children, are most marked in the Eastern and Western districts, where the birthrate is largest, and where unwholesome endemic influences are most active. The same is the case with other wasting disorders of infancy, as marasmus, atrophy, &c. Taking, in fact, the whole of these infantile maladies, it will be noticed that they contribute about 72 per 1,000 of all the deaths in the City—the range being from 49 per 1,000 in the Central district to 81 and 84 per 1,000 in the Eastern and Western. In the rest of London the proportion is 86 per 1,000, and in all England it is 96; but considering the comparatively small birth-rate of the City, it is evident that the mortality from tubercular and other wasting diseases of infancy is excessive—it being very apparent when we place it in juxtaposition with the number of births, for we then find 24 that of every 1,000 children born in the City, 55 die from these cachectic disorders. In the Western district it amounts to 64 per 1,000, in the Eastern to 57, and in the Central to only 46. These numbers are very characteristic of the sanitary conditions of the several districts, for they arc the exact exponents of home influences hostile to infant life. In the City proper, where these influences are least marked, the proportion (46 per 1,000) is the same as for all London, and it is much below (he proportion (52) for the whole of England. The mortality from convulsive diseases of children is also excessive in the City, forming, in the Eastern and Western districts, from 62 to 63 per 1,000 of all the deaths, whereas in the rest of London it is only 45 per 1,000. On the other hand zymotic diseases are less frequently the cause of death in the City than elsewhere, for during the last ten years they have contributed but 1S7 per 1,000 of all the deaths—the proportion for London being 220 per 1,000, and for England 208. And, moreover, it is gratifying to know that during the last twenty years there has been a, marked decrease in the proportion of deaths in the City from these disorders, the number having: declined from rather more than 5 per 1,000 of the population to less than 4. In the following; table 1 have represented the average annual proportion of deaths from the most important zymotic diseases during each of the four quinquennial periods of that time, 25 and you will notice that from a proportion of 200 per 1,000 of the deaths in the first of these periods, it has fallen to 160 per 1,000 in the last. Average Annual Number of Deaths from Zymotic Diseases in each of the four Quinquennial Periods of the last Twenty years.

Going back, however, to a later date, I find that the reduction has been still more marked; for in the seven years which preceded my term of office, the average number of deaths in the City from continued fever was 140 per 26 annum, whereas in the last seven years it has averaged but 53 per annum, and during the last three years only 28. In the first of these periods the proportion amounted to 44 per 1,000 of all the deaths, in the second it was hardly 27 per 1,000, and in the third it was only 16. Now, as fever is the invariable concomitant of defective sanitary conditions, occurring in those localities which arc stigmatised as unhealthy, it is manifest that the falling off in the mortality from it is the fruit of your sanitary labours, and so also is the notable reduction of the annual number of deaths from diarrhœa. SICKNESS AMONG THE POOR. The sickness returns of pauper practice are in like manner indicative of sanitary improvement; for instead of an average of about 9,800 cases attended annually by the Medical Officers of the City Unions, there were but 4,631 upon their books during the year which has lately expired; and the chief diminution has been in preventable zymotic disorders: fever, for example, has declined from an annual average of 604 to 78, diarrhoea from 884 to 175, and small-pox from 125 to 1. With every allowance for the diminished number of poor in the population of the City, there is nevertheless a great falling off in the intensity of zymotic diseases, especially of fever and diarrhœa; for during the last two years the proportion of fever 27 cases to the total cases of sickness of all kinds has been hardly 17 per 1,000, and of diarrhoea cases barely 44 per 1,000, whereas in the preceding ten years the averages were 64 and 88 per 1,000 respectively. This can have no other signification than a great improvement in the sanitary condition of the poor. METEOROLOGY. The chief facts connected with the meteorology of the year are shown in the eighth table of the Appendix, and, as usual, they have been deduced from the observations at Guildhall, under the superintendence of Mr. Haywood. The highest reading of the thermometer (87° Fahrenheit) was on the 26th of July, and the lowest (28° Fahrenheit) on the 15th of February of last y ear. The average temperature for the year has been 50.6 Fahrenheit, which is a little above the normal average (51*7 ) for the last ten years. The rainfall of the year has been excessive, amounting to 30T5 inches against an average of 23.25 inches. The chief increase was in the autumn quarter of 1872, when it amounted to 12.35 inches, or nearly double the usual quantity. The number of wet days in the year was 181, instead of 152—the average annual number for the last ten years; and the degree of humidity of the atmosphere was just 80 per cent. of saturation—the monthly ranges being from 72 per 28 cent, in May to 92 per cent. in March, 1872. All these facts are fully represented in the following table:— Bain fall, Humidity, Dew-point, and Temperature, in each Quarter of the Year 1873. Quarters Ending Entire Year. Dec. 1872. March, 1873.

The quality of the water supplied to the City has been the subject of monthly examinations, and the average results are expressed in the following tables— the analysis of the water supplied by all the Metropolitan Water Companies being added for comparison. 29 Average Chemical Composition of the Metropolitan Waters for the Year 1873.

The water of the New River Company has contained 19.13 grains of such matter per gallon; that of the East London Company, from the River Lea and the Thames, has averaged 19.55 grains; and that from the chalk wells of the Kent Company has been 28.25 grains. The saline matter has in all cases consisted for the most part of carbonate of lime, with a little carbonate of magnesia, sulphate of lime, nitrate of magnesia, and chloride of 30 sodium—the latter amounting to 2.62 grains per gallon of the chalk water, and to about 1¾ per gallon of the Thames and New River sources. The amount of organic matter has at all times been insignificant, for the quantity of oxygen required by every kind of oxydisable matter has not exceeded the 0'079 of a grain per gallon of water—the range has been from 0.007 of a grain for the chalk water to 0.079 of a grain for the worst description of Thames water. The nitrogen, as organic and saline ammonia, has also been remarkably small in quantity, amounting to only a trace in the Kent Company's water, and to less than the one-hundredth part of a grain in a gallon of Thames or New River water. The hardness of the water was generally about 15 degrees, and this was reduced to about 3½ degrees by boiling the water for a quarter of an hour. In the case of the Kent water from the chalk wells, the hardness was 21 degrees before boiling, and 5*8 degrees after. As regards turbidity, it was noticed that the water supplied by the West Middlesex, the New River, the East London, and the Kent Companies, was always bright and nearly colourless when examined in large volume, as in a glass tube two feet in length, but that of the other companies was at times slightly turbid from the presence of finely divided clay of a perfectly harmless character. The quantity of water daily supplied to the Metropolis by the several companies has ranged from 101 31 million gallons in February to rather more than 126 millions in August—the average for the whole year being 111,298,027 gallons per diem. This quantity has been supplied to 502,460 houses, and it averages 221 gallons per house per diem, or 334 gallons per head for the entire population of London. The particulars of the average daily supply in each month of the year are as follows:— Average Amounts of Water supplied daily to London by the Water Companies during each Month of the Year 1873.

According to Major Bolton, who is the Water Examiner appointed by the Board of Trade, the Kent Company have already provided a constant service in Deptford, and they are taking active measures for extending it into other districts. The East London Company have also furnished a like service in many of their districts, and have given notice to the Metropolitan Board of Works of their intention gradually to extend the supply until they have brought the whole of their districts, section by section, into the same condition. In like manner the West Middlesex and the Lambeth Companies are giving a constant supply of water to houses provided with the necessary fittings; and in the City of London the New River Company have for some time supplied water to the stand-pipes erected by the Commissioners of Sewers in certain of the courts and alleys of the City occupied by the poor, and they have consented to furnish a constant service to those blocks of buildings which I have certified as requiring such supply,—it being declared in the 14th section of "The Metropolis Water Act, 1871," 83 that when, on the representation of the Nuisance Authority, it appears to the Board of Trade that a constant supply of water is needed by any group or number of dwelling-houses in a court or passage, or otherwise in contiguity, and that such supply cannot be well or effectually given except by means of a stand-pipe or other apparatus placed outside the dwelling-houses, the Board of Trade may order such means of supply, and the expense thereof shall be borne by the owners. At your request, however, the New River Company have agreed to furnish the supply without the order of the Board of Trade. This is a liberal concession which cannot be too highly appreciated, for it affords the means whereby the poor may obtain cool and wholesome water at all times directly from the main, without the intervention of filthy butts or cisterns. It also prevents waste, and enables us to abolish the overflow pipes which communicate with the drain, and so bring foul gases from the sewers into the houses of the poor. I have given you a list of places in the City where this kind of service may be advantageously adopted, and I recommend it to your consideration, as it may be some time before the provisions of the Metropolis Water Act of 1871 are fully in operation within the City. SANITARY WORK. The details of the sanitary work performed in the City during each quarter of the year are tabulated in 34 the ninth table of the Appendix, and it will be remarked that in the course of the year there were 15,518 inspections of houses, and that 1,155 of them required amendment in certain particulars. The total number of notices or orders issued for sanitary improvements was 1,981, and of these 614 were for cleansing and limewhiting the interior of houses, 564 for cleansing and repairing privies, 412 for trapping and amending drains and sinks, 95 for improving the water-supply, 81 for paving yards and cellars, 71 for removing and preventing the discharge of waste water, 20 for repairing dust-bins, 7 for abolishing cesspools, 10 for abating smoke nuisance, 2 for removing animals improperly kept, and 105 for sundry other sanitary improvements. In addition to these, there have been 90 inspections of the bakehouses of the City, in accordance with the provisions of " The Bakehouse Regulation Act, 1863," and 10 orders have been issued for their amendment in various particulars. The Sanitary Inspector of Shipping has visited 1,535 ships within the district of the City, and has found 15 of them defective in ventilation, &c., in the forecastles. Each of the Inspectors has also delivered about 1,000 sanitary orders for cleansing and limewhiting the common lodging-houses of the City, in conformity with the regulations of "The Sanitary Act, 1866." Again, a large number of houses and ships have 35 been disinfected by your officers during the year, it being the practice to disinfect every room, as well as the articles contained therein, in which sick persons suffering from infectious or contagious diseases have been lodged. But besides this, as many as 434 miscellaneous articles of bedding and clothing have been removed to the disinfecting chambers in Golden Lane, and have either been destroyed or thoroughly disinfected, and restored to their owners. These articles consisted of 161 beds, 25 pillows, 16 blankets, 16 sheets, 14 mattresses, 10 quilts, 8 bolsters, 3 carpets, 81 articles of clothing, and 100 sundries. The beneficial results of these proceedings have been most conclusive, for in no case has there been a recurrence of disease from the use of any of the disinfected articles or of the rooms so treated. I have also to report to you, that during the year the Keeper of the Mortuary has received 92 dead bodies from the dwelling-rooms of the poor, and has kept them in decent custody until the time of burial. It is hardly necessary to say that this has been of the utmost advantage to those who would otherwise have had to retain their dead in the midst of the living, and thus to have encountered the danger of infection, as well as the noisome effects of putrefactive decomposition. 36 UNSOUND AND UNWHOLESOME FOOD. The Inspectors of Meat and of Markets have seized and condemned 178,626 lbs., or nearly 80 tons, of meat as unfit for human food. Most of this was obtained at the New Meat Market, and it consisted of 99,589 lbs. of diseased meat, 54,499 lbs. of putrid, and 24,538 lbs. from animals that had died from accident or disease. The particulars relating to these matters are shown in the tenth table of the Appendix, and you will observe that the seizures comprised 812 sheep and lambs, 168 calves, 327 pigs, 856 quarters of beef. 2,035 joints of meat, besides 2,022 plucks, 159 kidneys, 303 livers, 39 hearts and tongues, 130 hams, many hundred pounds of bacon, 30 lbs. of sausages, and a quantity of game and poultry, including 3 deer, 18 quarters and 2 haunches of venison, 17 hares, 382 rabbits, 649 head of game and poultry, and 8 goats. There were also condemned in the public streets 316 putrid cocoa nuts and 4 baskets of cherries; and in the bonded warehouses 896 boxes, 600 barrels, 30 hogsheads, 40 bags, and 69 cart-loads of figs, as well as 22 barrels and a great many boxes of currants, all of which were in a decomposed condition. At Billingsgate Market, the Fish Meters of the Fishmongers' Company condemned during the year considerably more than a million fish (weighing nearly 400 tons) on account of putridity; and for 37 the like reason they seized 9,425 gallons of shrimps, 882 bushels of sprats, oysters, periwinkles, whelks, mussels, and cockles, 4,278 lbs. of eels, rather more than 8 cwt. of salmon, and 716 lbs. of whitebait, lampreys, capelings, prawns, &c., all of which was destroyed. It is proper to mention that the whole of this, as well as the fish seized in Columbia Market, was brought to London by rail. Lastly, I have to report that there were 15 prosecutions and convictions during the year for sending diseased meat to the City Markets for sale as food. The penalties ranged from 5 to 20 pounds, and in several cases there was imprisonment for a period varying from one to two months. The particulars relating to this are shown in the twelfth table of the Appendix. RETROSPECT OF SANITARY WORK IN THE CITY. And now, in concluding my Report, I am desirous of drawing attention to the progress of sanitary work in the City during the time I have had the honour of discharging the duties of Medical Officer of Health. It is scarcely necessary to say that those duties have largely increased during the last nineteen years ; and this has come about not merely from an expansion of the ordinary routine work at that time in hand, but from the imposition of new sanitary obligations by successive legislative enactments. The work of house inspection, for example, has 38 grown up from an inspection of 3,147 houses in 1853 to an annual average of 17,524 during the last ten years; and the number of orders issued for sanitary improvement has risen from 983 in the year to an average of 3,624. During all this time, too, there has been a gradual diminution of the number of houses requiring inspection, but this circumstance has not, until lately, relieved your officers from any notable amount of sanitary work; for the act of demolition, which has reduced the number of lodging- houses, has necessarily caused an increased overcrowding of the poor, and thus added to the responsibility of our labours. At the time of my appointment in 1855, the work of inspection was performed by the six Inspectors of Pavements, who devoted only a small portion of their time every week to sanitary inspection; and this condition of things lasted until nearly the close of the year 1857, when I considered it necessary to have a systematic weekly inspection of the registered common lodging-houses of the City. These were the worst class of dwellings, and were at the time of my appointment so indecently and unwholesomely overcrowded, that I felt it to be my duty, after a personal inspection of them by night as well as by day, to cause them to be registered under the provisions of the 10th clause of your Act of 1851, and to be subject to the rules and regulations which, with your sanction, I drew up for their government. A special Sanitary 39 Inspector, called a Common Lodging-house Inspector, was also appointed to visit them weekly, and to see that the provisions for their proper management were strictly observed. Subsequently, in 1862, I obtained your sanction to the appointment of another Sanitary Inspector for the more effective performance of sanitary work, especially in regard of that ordered by the Court; and I drew up a detailed account of the duties of his office (December 9, 1862). Four years after this, when the passing of the Sanitary Act, 1866, imposed additional obligations upon the duties of my office, I recommended that the sanitary work of the City should be entirely remodelled, and to this end you gave me the assistance of four Sanitary Inspectors, who were thenceforward to devote all their time to a proper and systematic supervision of those houses and parts of houses which were let in lodgings or occupied by more than one family. You also appointed an Inspector of Shipping to examine and report, according to my instructions, as to the sanitary condition of the shipping within the City division of the Port of London. All this involved a good deal of new work, as well as a more circumstancial performance of old duties; and, therefore, it was necessary that I should draw up specific instructions for the business of the office. Those instructions met with your approval, and were confirmed by you in the month of January, 1867, from which time to the 40 present they have been the chief guide to our sanitary labours. It was also necessary that I should prepare, in accordance with the 35th section of "The Sanitary Act, 1866," regulations for the management of lodginghouses, as regards water-supply, privy accommodation, drainage, the paving of cellars and yards, the removal of dust and house-refuse, the periodic cleansing and limewhiting, &c., and the decent and wholesome occupation of the rooms. These regulations were likewise adopted by you, and they furthermore received the sanction of Her Majesty's Secretary of State on 1st of February, 1867. From that time to this the sanitary work of the City has been systematically and efficiently performed; and the rate at which it has increased during the twenty years may be judged of from the following table Number of Houses Inspected, and of Orders Issued for Sanitary Improvement in the City of London from the Year 1853 to the Year 1873 inclusive. Years. Houses Inspected. Orders Issued. Years. Houses Inspected. Orders Issued. 1853 3,147 983 1864 10,700 3,179 1854 No return kept No return kept 1865 11,008 2,331 1855 1866 12,213 3.086 1856 5,401 1,215 1867 22,447 6,057 1857 5,924 2,031 1868 25,737 5,739 1858 7,780 1,721 1869 25,579 5,873 1859 9,587 1,984 1870 18,305 2,388 1860 9,448 2,472 1871 20,380 2,103 1861 9,425 2,518 1872 19,784 1,958 1862 8,093 2,455 1873 15,518 1,981 1863 9,089 2,413 41 But besides the inspection of the lodging-houses of the City, your officers have had to direct their attention to the various trade, smoke, and other nuisances provided for in "The City of London Sewers Acts, 1848 and 1851," and in the several "Nuisance Removal Acts of 1855 and 1860," as well as in "The Sanitary Act, 1866."They have also had to make a periodical inspection of the bakehouses of the City, in accordance with the provisions of "The Bakehouse Regulation Act, 1863," and until recently they had likewise to inspect the workshops of the City, in conformity with the provisions of "The Workshop Regulation Act, 1867." All these duties have been performed in accordance with special instructions which I prepared, and submitted to you at the time of the passing of the several Acts of Parliament. Moreover, "The Artisans and Labourers Dwellings Act, 1868," has imposed on your officers the duty of inspecting the dwellings of the poor, in order that provision may be made for their repair or reconstruction when they are unfit for human habitation. This, likewise, was the subject of a special report to you at the time of the passing of the Act in 1868. Again, "The Sanitary Act of 1866" necessitated the erection of a mortuary chamber within the City of London for the reception of the dead bodies of 42 the poor. This has been in full operation for some time, and is governed by the regulations which I prepared for that purpose in the month of May, 1872. Processes of disinfection are also adopted in accordance with the provisions of the 22nd and 23rd sections of "The Sanitary Act, 1866," so that in all cases where, in my judgment and on my certificate, it has been thought necessary to cleanse and disinfect the rooms and articles contained therein, in which persons have suffered from infectious disease, your Inspectors have personally superintended the disinfection of such places ; and with a view to additional safety, the articles of clothing, bedding, &c., have been conveyed to the disinfecting chambers in Golden Lane, and have been further disinfected by heat and sulphurous acid. While the patient has occupied the sick room, the only processes of disinfection have been the free use of carbolic acid, and the treatment of the infected articles with boiling water saturated with carbolic acid. When, however, the patient has quitted the room, it has been immediately treated with the fumes of burning sulphur, using about an ounce and a half of sulphur for every 100 cubic feet of space; and as the articles of bedding, clothing, &c., have been allowed to remain in the room, they also have been disinfected by the vapours of sulphurous acid. The processes followed at the disinfecting chambers have been the total destruction in a furnace fire of all worthless articles, and the treatment of others with a • 43 still larger dose of sulphurous acid in a chamber properly constructed for the purpose. After this, the articles are exposed for several hours to a temperature of about 250° Fahrenheit, in a stove heated by gas. The beneficial effects of these operations were most apparent during the recent epidemic of small-pox, when nearly 3,000 articles were thus treated, without, as far as I know, a single instance of recurrence of the disease. In addition to all this, the sanitary work of the City comprises an inspection of meat, markets, slaughter-houses, and cow-houses. At the time of my taking office these duties were very imperfectly performed, and in 1860 I obtained your sanction to the appointment of two special Sanitary Officers for this duty. I have the satisfaction to say that the supervision of the markets and slaughter-houses of this City, in so far as the seizure of unsound meat is concerned, has been much facilitated by the conduct of the wholesale butchers. Considering, indeed, the enormously large amount of meat, poultry, &c., which arrives daily in the City markets, it would be almost impossible for the inspectors to perform their duties in an effective manner if it were not for the assistance afforded by the carcass butchers. The general results of this kind of work are shown in the following table, which exhibits the quantity of unsound meat condemned in the City markets during each of the last thirteen years. 44 Quantity of Unsound Meat Condemned in the City Markets during each of the last Thirteen years. Years. Amount Seizad and Condemned. WHY SEIZED AND CONDEMNED. Dead. Diseased.

At one time it was the practice to dispose of the bad meat to a contractor, who bore the expense of removing it from the markets, but as there was suspicion that the meat was not always destroyed, but 45 used for feeding pigs, another method of treatment has been adopted. As soon as the meat is seized it is conveyed to the lock-up sheds, where it is kept until the cart arrives for its conveyance to the depot at the Deptford Foreign Cattle Market, where it is destroyed. Immediately it is placed in the carts it is treated with a sufficient quantity of crude carbolic acid to taint it throughout its substance ; the carts are then covered and locked, and are weighed, so as to ascertain the weight of their contents. When they arrive at Deptford they are again weighed, and are unlocked by the proper officer. The meat is then put into a large iron vertical cylinder, which can be fastened so as to be air-tight, and it is submitted to the action of high-pressure steam, until it is thoroughly broken up into fat, muscular fibre, and bone. Each of these has its technical uses, and they are collectively of sufficient value to pay the expense of the operation. It will be seen from this that the sanitary duties of the City are very multifarious, and that they have largely increased since I had the honour of beingelected your Medical Officer of Health ; for it has devolved on me to co-ordinate the duties of my office, and to extend them as occasion arose. It has also been my duty to advise and report to you on a multitude of sanitary subjects, as the condition of the grave-yards and church vaults of the City; the imperfection of mortality returns; the state of the 46 water-supply and quality of the water drawn from the City pumps; the condition of the sewers, as regards the nature of sewage, sewer gases, &c., and the means of ventilation; the condition of the ter-houses and cow-houses of the City; and many other such cognate matters, all of which have been the subjects of special reports, which have in most cases had a wider application than was originally intended, from the circumstance that the sanitary practice and experience of the City have frequently been accepted as the standard for comparison. This is a gratifying recognition of the value of our sanitary labours, and I allude to it in order that I may, in this, the last act of my official connection with the City, thank you for the assistance and encouragement which you have for the most part afforded me in the discharge of my onerous and important duties. I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HY. LETHEBY. Guildhall, May, 1874.

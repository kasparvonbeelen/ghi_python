A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., F.R.S.H Jan. 1958 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1963. To the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commoners of the Corporation of London. Guildhall, E.C.2. Telephone: MONarch 3030. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit my first Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. As I took up my appointment on the 1st January 1964 all the work described was carried out under my predecessor, Dr. J. Greenwood Wilson, the first holder of the combined post of Medical Officer of Health for the Port and City of London. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W.G. SWANN, Medical Officer for the City of London. VITAL STATISTICS The resident population of the City according to the Registrar General's estimate at mid-year 1963 was 4,580. The birth rate rose to 9.39 per 1,000 resident population and the death rate rose to 12.01 per 1,000 resident population as compared with 6.29 and 8.46 respectively in 1962. There were 43 live births and 1 still birth. 7 of the live births were illegitimate. The total number of deaths of all ages was 55: 36 male and 19 female. There were 17 deaths due to cancer,7 of which were cancer of the lung; 17 deaths were due to coronary or other heart disease and 10 were due to bronchitis, pneumonia or other respiratory diseases. INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOTIFIED 26 notifications of infectious disease were received, namely 1 of acute primary pneumonia, (0), 1 of food poisoning (0), 10 of measles (4), 4 of puerperal pyrexia (3), 5 of pulmonary tuberculosis (4), 4 of scarlet fever (4) and 1 of whooping cough (0). (The figures in brackets denote the comparable numbers of cases in 1962). FOOD POISONING During the year only one outbreak of food poisoning occurred in the City. This was in the staff canteen of an insurance company where the catering arrangements were under the control of a large catering company. Approximately 30 people were taken ill, and an investigation indicated that roast turkey which had been subject to a re-heating process, and the gravy and soup made from the turkey, were the cause of the outbreak. The symptoms of those affected varied and as both staphylococcus aureus and a heat resistant Clostridium Welchii were isolated by the bacteriologist from the remnants of the turkey, it is probable that some of the patients suffered from two separate kinds of food poisoning. Although the precise origin of the outbreak was not traced on this occasion, the opportunity was taken to make a searching investigation of the practices of the caterer, and a detailed inspection of the premises and equipment was also made. As a result recommendations for a number of improvements were made to the catering firm in question and these improvements were subsequently carried out. 2 PIGEON NUISANCE A firm of pigeon catchers is employed under contract by the City Corporation whose policy is not to exterminate all pigeons but to control their numbers to such proportions as will ensure that the pleasure they give to residents and visitors is not out-weighed by the nuisance they cause. During the year 2,900 pigeons were humanely trapped and killed as compared with 3,850 in 1962. HOUSING Housing Act, 1957 1. Number of houses which on inspection were considered to be unfit for human habitation:— None 2. Number of houses in which defects were remedied in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers:— Four 3. Number of representations made to the Local Authority with a view to (a) the serving of notices requiring the execution of works or (b) the making of demolition or closing orders (a) None (b) None 4. Number of notices served during the execution of works: — None 5. Number of houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices :- None 6. Number of demolition or closing orders made:— None 7. Number of houses in respect of which an undertaking was accepted under subsection (4) of section 16 of the Housing Act, 1957:- None 8. Number of houses demolished:— None During the year 236 families were rehoused, leaving 531 families for whom accommodation was required at the end of December 1963. The Golden Lane Estate has been completed and the swimming pool, badminton court, tennis courts and club rooms have provided extra recreational facilities which are enjoyed by the tenants and, in the case of the swimming pool and badminton court, by many who are employed in the City. At Avondale Square, Old Kent Road, S.E.I, the 1st Stage of the development has been completed and the 380 flats occupied. Work is well advanced on the 2nd Stage comprising 48 flats for old people. The modernisation of Avondale House was completed at the end of 1963. Consultant Architects are now preparing plans for new flats as the first phase of replacement of the sub-standard houses to the north and west of the Metropolitan Cattle Market in Islington, and it is hoped to start work on this scheme in the near future. At the Holloway Estate, Islington, demolition of the old houses continues in preparation for further redevelopment. The model Old People's accommodation at Isleden House (31 flats) erected by the City Parochial Foundation and acquired by the Corporation, continues to be of interest to people in this country and from overseas who are concerned with the housing and welfare of the elderly. The ready availability of physical assistance, the provided mid-day meal with the other benefits at Isleden House is reflected in the well-being of the elderly residents and their longevity, and the infrequent use of the Sick Bay for their treatment. The Sick Bay continues to receive patients from St. Bartholomew's Hospital (a total of approximately 904 having been admitted since 1954) and elderly tenants from the Corporation's housing estates. During the year work proceeded on the building which will contain the fire station and civil defence centre in the Barbican Scheme. The diversion of the Metropolitan Railway between Moorgate and Aldersgate Stations commenced in conjunction with work on 629 flats and houses. 3 SEWERAGF AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Sewerage and sewage disposal in the City of London are the responsibility of the City Engineer who has supplied the following information "The sewerage system in the City is comprised mainly of ovoid shaped brick sewers, the average internal dimensions being 4 feet high x 2 feet 8 inches wide. This size being adopted only to provide access for sewermen, as the normal dry weather flow depth of effluent is only about 9 inches at an average velocity of 2 to 3 feet per second. The Corporation sewers discharge into the London County Council intercepting sewers, which flow eastwards across the City at a much lower depth, to their Northern Disposal and Outfall Works at Beckton. The system of sewerage in the City is adequate, with ample margin for diverting flows from sewers during reconstruction and maintenance works". WATER SUPPLY The City of London is supplied with water principally by the Metropolitan Water Board and the quantity and quality of the water has been satisfactory. The Metropolitan Water Board has supplied the following information: "The water supply is derived from two sources in varying and unpredictable proportions, namely, New River-derived water from the Board's works at Stoke Newington and River Thames-derived water from the Thames Valley filtration stations. The average analyses of the water supplied during 1963 is set out on the attached tables. New mains were laid in your area to the extent of 992 yards and included 154 yards of 15" diameter trunk main. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being brought into use or restored to service and samples of water from them are tested bacteriologically to ensure that its quality is up to that normally supplied. The Board's waters are not plumbo solvent. Samples are collected daily at each stage of purification and in the distribution system. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination or variation in quality." There are 1030 dwelling-homes (including house-keepers' flats) in the City the majority of which are supplied with water direct from the Board's mains. In addition to the Metropolitan Water Board supply there are approximately 135 wells in use in the City and these are kept under constant supervision. The estimated night population of the City is only 4.580 but the day population of City workers is estimated at approximately 500,000. The water supply in the City is adequate for both day and night population. 4 5 METROPOLITAN WATER BOARD — Water Examination Department BACTERIOLOGICAL RESULTS - YEARLY AVERAGES, 1963 CITY OF LONDON Source of Supply BEFORE TREATMENT AFTER TREATMENT Number of samples Agar plate count per ml.

By comparison the penalty for emitting smoke in' the City of London at the present time is very lenient. During the year, 57 complaints of smoke nuisances were received. On investigation it was found that in 3 (5.3%) of the complaints no nuisance existed. The remainder of the complaints emanated from the following sources : — (1) Oil-fired boilers 34 (59.6%) (2) Solid fuel fired boilers 5 (8.8%) (3) Domestic appliances 3 (5.3%) (4) Incinerators 2 (3.5%) (5) Bonfires 10 (17.5%) The main cause of nuisances from boilers in (1) and (2) was inefficient combustion which, in most cases, was due to mismanagement of otherwise efficient apparatus. Smoke nuisances occurred from domestic grates when unsuitable fuel was used or when suitable fuel was not available. Smoke and fly-ash emissions occurred from an industrial incinerator and these were mainly due to an obsolete appliance which has since been replaced together with a proper water bath to catch fly-ash. Of the total number of smoke complaints, 10 were of bonfire nuisances. Advice was obtained from the Comptroller and City Solicitor with regard to bonfires and he was of the opinion that these particular smoke nuisances could not be dealt with under Section 4 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1954 but would fall within the provisions of Section 16 of the Clean Air Act, 1956. Most bonfire nuisances occurred on demolition sites where the contractors had to dispose of timber, felt, bitumastic and painted materials, and a certain amount of co-operation had to be obtained with regard to destruction of infested and rotting timber as it is inadvisable to remove these from the site. Some contractors are very reluctant to remove any timber owing to high haulage costs. Co-operation was secured in all cases without recourse to further action. NOISE Since the introduction of the Noise Abatement Act, 1960, members of the public seem to be increasingly more "noise-conscious" and this is reflected in the general increase in the number of complaints received in the Department. Whilst it will be appreciated that that which is a nuisance to one person may be tolerated, or even accepted by another, it is of interest to note that of 39 complaints investigated during the year 31 (80%) were in respect of pneumatic drills on building sites which were confirmed to be causing a nuisance within the meaning of the Act and subsequently remedied without the need to resort to legal action, whilst only 1 (2%) was in respect of a comparatively trivial sound — from an office machine — which could not be considered to be a nuisance. The remaining 7 complaints representing 18% of the total, comprised 5 concerning general noise from building sites and 2 of noisy fans situated at roof level, all of which were remedied following a verbal request by the Public Health Inspector. It will be seen, therefore, that City workers and residents do not generally complain of noise without reasonable cause. Much has been achieved through informal meetings with builders representatives, resulting in the increased use of muffles to pneumatic drills, erection of temporary baffles to deflect noise away from office buildings and, in certain cases, double-glazing of windows to increase their insulative value. These measures, together with agreed restricted periods for noisy building operations, have resulted in substantial improvements. On 9th May, 1963, a noise meter was purchased for the Department and has since been in constant use in connection with noise complaints. In addition to its usefulness in assessing the noise level of the subjects of complaint it has been found that its presence on site is treated with respect, if with some resentment, by building personnel with the result that voluntary cooperation is even more readily forthcoming. 6 VAGRANTS AND CRUDE SPIRIT DRINKERS The problem of crude spirit drinkers was raised by the Southwark Borough Council at a Metropolitan Borough's Standing Joint Committee during the year and in November, Mr. E.F. St. John Lyburn M.B., B.Ch., B.A.O. (Med) B.A., T.C.D., of Tunbridge Wells communicated with the Town Clerk of Stepney enclosing an extract from an historical survey of the City of London about which he was apparently writing and in which he made reference to 'the lost souls of the City', some of whom were methylated spirit drinkers in the vicinity of Widegate Street and Artillery Lane and around the Salvation Army Hostel in Middlesex Street. During the year two surveys of the problems of vagrancy* and crude spirit drinking were carried out by groups of social workers which included representatives of the National Assistance Board, Salvation Army, Church Army and voluntary social workers from the London County Council. These two surveys were made on the nights of the 4th and 25th November and an endeavour was made to persuade the vagrants to go to hostels. The total number sleeping out in the London County Council area did not exceed 150. 80 persons were found to be sleeping on Waterloo and Liverpool Street Stations and only a very low percentage of these were methylated spirit drinkers. The Salvation Army Authorities at the Middlesex Street Hostel where approximately 420 beds are available, are unable to admit methylated spirit drinkers as their condition gives offence to the Salvation Army Authorities as well as to the inmates of the hostel. Charitable organisations endeavour to find accommodation for all types of vagrants and most of these organisations have a standing arrangement with the Salvation Army regarding the expenses for such persons accommodated at their request. In addition to the problem of finding shelter for these individuals at night efforts are made by various organisations to re-habilitate them and help them to take a proper place in society by day. Such an organisation exists at St. Botolph's Church, Aldgate. It was found on investigation that the vast majority of vagrants interviewed during the two surveys found means of support either — (a) from the Public Assistance (b) from casual employment (c) from a charitable or voluntary organisation. and could afford, if they so desired, the 6s.0d. required for bed and breakfast at Middlesex Street. The problem as far as this particular hostel is concerned are — (a) accommodation is restricted; for the winter months the hostel runs at full capacity, housing some 420 beds. (b) the methylated spirit drinker presents his own problems and is not allowed entry. (c) anti-social persons will not accept this means of accommodation. Facilities are provided by the London County Council at Long Grove and other establishments for the treatment of alcoholics and mental cases, but a difficulty arises in persuading these men to receive attention and, if this is attained often they discharge themselves before treatment is completed. During the surveys it was discovered that 18 men were found to be 'sleeping out' at Spitalfields Market and a similar number at Billingsgate Market. A few were found sleeping on benches on the Embankment and in packing cases in the Widegate Street area. Methylated spirit drinkers appear to obtain their supplies of crude spirit from chemists in the form of surgical spirit or from ironmongers and builders' merchants as coloured methylated spirit. The spirit is mixed with cheap eau-de-Cologne and sometimes milk is added. OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES ACT, 1963 The long overdue charter for office workers, giving a standard of working conditions in line with those already enjoyed by workers under the Factories Act, now 'comes into existence under the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963. Generally, the Act provides for the health, welfare and safety of employees in offices, shops, and certain railway premises, and except for a few sections, comes into force during 1964. A number of the provisions are re-enactments and extensions of Sections 37 and 38 of the Shops Act, 1950 which is repealed by the Act, i.e. seating accommodation, ventilation, temperature, sanitary conveniences, lighting, washing facilities, and facilities for taking meals, but the extended and additional provisions will now apply to offices and certain railway premises as well as to shops. 7 Although the word "registration" is not used, the effect of Section 49 requiring employers to serve upon the appropriate authority notice that persons will be employed by him and giving such other information as the Minister may prescribe, is to require registration of all premises to which the Act applies. The Act can be divided under two main headings:— (a) Health & Welfare Section 4 Cleanliness 5 Overcrowding 6 Temperature 7 Ventilation 8 Lighting 9 Sanitary conveniences 10 Washing facilities 11 Drinking water 12 Drying of clothing 13 Sitting facilities 14 Design and construction of seats 15 Facilities for meals 20 Risk of bodily injury or injury to health from machinery, plant, process, etc. 21 Risk of bodily injury or injury to health from noise or vibration 23 Carrying a load likely to cause injury 24 First aid equipment (b) Safety Section 16 Prohibition of obstructions and slippery substances — guards to openings and staircases 17 Fencing or guarding of dangerous machinery 18 Protection of young persons when cleaning machinery 19 Instruction and training of persons working at machines There are estimated to be some 14,000 premises in the City of London to which the Act applies, 86% being offices, 8% restaurants and 6% shops. In addition to the approximate 14,000 initial inspections, in many cases it will be necessary to make further visits particularly to premises which do not comply with certain provisions of the Act, and to cope with these additional duties which will be placed upon the Corporation of London, the appointment in the first instance of five additional Public Health Inspectors and additional administrative staff has been approved. NURSING HOMES ACT, 1963 THE CONDUCT OF NURSING HOMES REGULATIONS 1963 The Ministry of Health made the above-mentioned regulations under the Nursing Homes Act 1963. These regulations make provision governing the conduct of nursing homes, require accommodation care and staff of a satisfactory standard and limit the number of persons who may be received into the home. The Corporation of London is the registration authority for the City of London under the Act but at the present time there are no Nursing Homes in the City. WELFARE I am indebted to Mrs. Rita Cohen, M.B.E., Honorary Welfare Officer and Honorary Secretary of the City of London Old People's Welfare Association for the following report:- "The Association is grateful to the many volunteers who render valuable assistance by carrying out visits; doing shopping; and other miscellaneous chores, but with the increasing number of old folk it is hoped that more volunteers will be forthcoming. There are no special new features of the activities carried out by this Association for the people of pensionable age in and of the City, but it is very evident that, although the main needs of these people are at present being satisfied, the demand for suitable services is increasing; accordingly the demand for special facilities such as Home Help Service, Night Attendance; Wireless and T.V. sets is growing. T.V. sets have been supplied by a sympathetic benefactor; the installation charges and the cost of licences is met through the City of London & East London Dispensary Fund. T.V. and Wireless sets have been especially welcomed by the homebound, and have undoubtedly relieved much of their loneliness. 8 The Association has purchased suitable medical equipment, which is available on loan to the City's old folk, as, although the provision of these facilities is not necessarily the responsibility of a Voluntary Organization, so much of the equipment normally available through Hospitals etc. is too cumbersome for modern flats. The equipment includes easily propelled wheelchairs and armchair commodes. Convalescent Holidays and Mid-day Meals have been provided throughout the year, and unquestionably these amenities are of great benefit to the well-being of the old folk. Amongst other services provided are Laundry; Hairdressing; Shoe Repairing. Handicraft Classes are being extended; and the Employment Scheme is continuing. Possihly the most important single service provided is Chiropody. The Association has established five Chiropody Clinics on various Corporation Estates, and the services of the Chiropodist are well utilised....it is expected that a further two Clinics will be required to be opened in 1964. The new Over 60's Club on the Golden Lane Estate was opened by Sir Ralph Perring during this year, and it is evident that the Club Rooms are used extensively, and have provided a very delightful meeting place for the old folk on this Estate. The foregoing general facilities are provided for those Over 60's who are able to remain in their own homes. This Association realises however that 'adding years to life' is insufficient unless adequate care and attention can be provided when the need arises, and the Association is very concerned that, although there is an increasing demand for suitable accommodation with care and attention, the provision of such accommodation continues to present a very real problem. It is the responsibility of the Local Authority to provide 'Part HI' accommodation when necessary, but all too often there are long waiting lists and Local Authorities cannot cope with the demand. Until such time as one can honestly say that there is adequate provision of Part III accommodation for those of pensionable age whose need is urgent, no effort must be spared to find a solution to this problem. One cannot legislate for every eventuality, but it seems to this Association that it should be possible to introduce legislation which would ensure that the right kind of accommodation with care and attention is readily available for those who can no longer look after themselves in their own homes. If only we could remind ourselves daily of Milton's words in 'Paradise Lost': "That serene which men call old age. So mayst thou live, till like ripe fruit thou drop into thy mother's lap or be with ease gathered not harshly plucked, for death mature. This is Old Age." the problems confronting old age would surely lessen. This is a brief report and summary of the activities provided for the over 60's in and of the City for the year ending December 31st 1963." MASS RADIOGRAPHY Dr. W.D.R. Thompson, Medical Director of the Mass Radiography Unit at present housed at the City Mortuary Building 20 Golden Lane, E.C.2. reports that 67,836 persons were x-rayed during 1963 . 47,545 persons were x-rayed at 20 Golden Lane and 20,291 persons were x-rayed at various business premises in or near to the City whilst the unit was 'mobile' from 6th August to 1st November. Thirty-six cases with a significant tuberculous lesion and sixteen cases of carcinoma of the bronchus were discovered during the year. The unit has continued to approach, and encourage, new firms to use the services offered and a considerable number of new firms have been added to the unit's register. CANCER DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC When the Clinic was established at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1958, financed by the Corporation of London, it was intended for the diagnosis of certain forms of cancer peculiar to women. During the year the Corporation of London made a further contribution towards the expenses of the Clinic so that the scope of the scheme could be extended to include the tests to assist in the detection of some forms of cancer common to both sexes, such as cancer of the lung. 9 During 1963, 448 patients attended who either worked or lived in the City. 3 cases of preinvasive carcinoma were detected which should virtually produce a cure. As well as the taking of smears for the cancer test a general examination was also carried out and as a result 17 cases were admitted to hospital for treatment of benign conditions, nothing to do with cancer. PLAN FOR AN OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE IN THE CITY OF LONDON On 7th December, 1962, it was resolved by the Port and City of London Health Committee that Dr. A. Robinson, Assistant Medical Officer, be instructed to prepare a detailed plan of an Occupational Health Service in the City of London which was to include an estimate of the cost. The first draft was laid before the Committee on 5th April, 1963. In general the plan followed the lines of the group industrial health services at Slough and Harlow, but although certain features of these units were incorporated care was taken to orient the services which it offered towards commerce and not to industry. Eventually the plan was submitted to the Court of Common Council on 10th October, 1963, but was referred back for further consideration and report. RODENT CONTROL In compliance with the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, it is the duty of every Local Authority to take such steps as may be necessary to secure as far as practicable that their district is kept free from rats and mice. For the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act, organisation and procedure were similar to previous years comprising inspection of properties to ascertain the presence of rats and/or mice, treatment of properties found to be infested, recommendation and supervision of structural and incidental proofing, and periodical control measures for the destruction of rats in sewers. No difficulty has arisen necessitating statutory action to resolve the problem and the cooperation of owners and occupiers received in the past has been maintained. A major proportion of the work comprised inspection of defined areas for the purpose of instituting collective action if necessary. A total of 3,168 occupancies and properties were inspected under the Act, these properties varying from comprehensive re-developments in the course of construction, riverside food wharves and warehouses, public and private catering establishments, blocks of offices, shops and factories to domestic dwellings. Altogether 522 complaints were received, either by notification or as the result of inspection and of this total 482 infestations were subject of control measures. In 40 instances no action other than advice was necessary. These were mainly cases where an odd transient mouse had been seen by office cleaners in the early morning, but the often long procedure of investigation still had to be applied, not only to satisfy the occupier who had co-operated by notifying, but to ensure that the occurrence was not a fringe of a heavier infestation elsewhere in the property. Such complaints do, however, indicate the awareness of employers and employees of even minor nuisances and their readiness to seek advice and assistance to resolve a problem. From the rodent aspect alone, this is an attitude to be encouraged as in the past many infestations of rats and mice, some approaching a major degree have been traced as the result of a complaint of a minor or even frivolous nature. Continued routine inspection has fostered this attitude, encouraged the public and strengthened their co-operation. The total of 482 infestations subject to control measures comprised 3 major and 62 minor infestations of rats and 4 major and 413 minor infestations of mice. Of the rat infestations, 3 major (21-200) and 47 minor (1-20) were of common rat (Rattus norvegicus) character and the remainder 15 minor infestations came under the Ship (Black) rat (Rattus Rattus) classification. The three major infestations of common rat were of sufficient numerical density as to be excluded from the minor scale, although low in the major category. Treatment of these infestations entailed 4,590 visits for operational purposes, and in the application of control measures 11,812 initial baiting sites were selected for both rats and mice. In the control of rats, 4,970 pre-baits and 516 poison baits were laid. Such measures resulted in a minimum estimated kill of 524 rats, and of this number 217 bodies were removed from the sites of the operations. Others were found on elimination of structural harbourage, or removal of incidental harbourage providing nesting facilities, but no cognizance is taken of these unless vouched for by a member of the Rodent Staff. The use of anti-coagulant rodenticides and other poisons entailed the application of 10,281 baiting points for the control of mice and 795 bodies were recovered. 10 In the year 1944, the comparable figures were 320 infestations treated. This number comprised 261 major (21-200) and 39 minor infestations of rats and 13 major and 7 minor infestations of mice. A total of 62,336 pre-baits and 8,452 poison baits were laid. These measures resulted in an estimated kill of 11,388 rats of which 2,558 bodies were recovered. In addition, 423 rats were destroyed by traps. The low level of Ship (Black) rat infestation manifest in recent years has been maintained and the 15 minor infestations of this nature subject to control measures during the year under review was the lowest yet recorded. To illustrate further the diminished status of this species within the City, the comparable figure recorded in 1948 was 698 rat infestations treated, comprising 668 Ship and 30 common rat infestations and of the Ship rat total 249 were in the major classification. In reviewing the present position of this species of infestation there are many contributory factors. Foremost of these is the diminution of re-infestation from outside sources, the great improvement in general hygiene, progressive demolition of old properties and redevelopment, systematic inspection, and advance techniques of control. The importance of hygiene in relation to rodent control, embracing effective food storage, proper waste disposal, and the elimination of structural and incidental harbourage providing nesting facilities must be emphasized. Rats and mice are commensal creatures, i.e. dependant on man for their food and housing, and therefore, the maintenance of good general conditions, whatever the usage of the property, is essential, and control measures should be regarded as supplementary to hygiene. The relatively low status of common rat infestation was confined to the comprehensive redevelopment sites in their varying stages of construction. Such environments offer every facility and in every way are conducive to this type of infestation. The temporary canteens provided for the workmen are, in the main,well kept, but under such circumstances, inevitably create an attraction. On the comprehensive development sites where several blocks are erected simultaneously, it is neither reasonable nor practicable for the labour force numbering several hundred to leave the sites of production to adjourn to the main canteen for their short tea breaks, and in such instances the tea is taken to the men with the result that waste and unwanted food is discarded over the entire site. On one particular site where this nuisance was very rife, representations were made to the contracting management, and trade union representatives, with the result that the contractors installed, at considerable expense, replaceable paper bags on wall-mounted stands for the disposal of unwanted waste food and containers. All building sites were periodically inspected, and the fullest co-operation of the various contractors was received as far as possible having regard to the conditions and labour involved. A major contributory factor in the control of common rat is the systematic periodical treats ments applied in the City sewers. The sewer system comprises approximately 34 miles of traversable sewers and about 5 miles of 9 inch pipe sewers. The accessible sewers are in the main 3-4 feet in diameter but certain sections are 11 and 17 feet. The entrances providing access number about 400 and vary in depth from 10 to 35 feet. It is the purpose of these periodical control measures to check the build-up of the rat population in the sewers and thereby assist in preventing infestation of surface properties from this source via defective drainage. During the period under review, four 'Direct' poison treatments with Fluoracetamide as the toxic agent were applied. These were carried out in March, June, September and December respectively and an average of 390 sewer manholes distributed over the sewer system were poison baited. The annual overall test baiting of all available manholes, which provides an indication of the result of the treatments was applied prior to the June control and a total of 391 manholes were test baited. These non-poison baits, which in effect act as pre-baits were left down two days and where on examination were found to be taken, replaced by poison bait. The test bait result on examination was 8.9% complete 'takes'. The comparable test result in 1962 was 11.6% and that of 1961, 17.6%. To attempt to arrive at an estimate of the number of rats destroyed in the City sewers over the past twenty years would be mere conjecture, but taking into account the number found dead at the base of the manholes where the poison baits were sited, analysis of the poison bait acceptance of the 63 controls completed and bearing in mind the limited range of vision from the base of the manholes, a minimum estimate would be approximately 10,000. The extensive experimental control measures with Mono Sodium Fluoracetate (1080) and Fluoracetamide (1081) and intermediate tests conducted during the period 1950 — 1960 produced the results it was believed could be achieved by the continuation of the 'Direct' poison method and the use of these two highly toxic rodenticides and this technique of control is now standard 11 practice as laid down in the official Handbook of Rodent Control, and circular P.D.P. 63/3 issued by the Infestation Control Division, Ministry Of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and since adapted by commercial Pest Control firms offering their services to Local Authorities. In a similar respect, these rodenticides have been the major factor in the position now obtained as regards to surface rat infestations. Their use over the last fourteen years has shown that when controlled and dispensed by a responsible person and with strict observance of the schedule of safety precautions in the handling and laying of the made-up baits in suitable and safe environments (which applies equally with less toxic poisons) a complete clearance can often be made in one night with perfect safety to both man and domestic animals with the possible exception on rare occasions of the death of a stray wild and half-starved cat from secondary poisoning which could also occur with the use of less toxic rodenticides. It is the essence of good practice in rodent control and indeed should be the aim of every responsible person engaged on this facet of public health work to destroy the highest percentage of a given infestation quickly and surely and where possible avoid the often slow painful results by the less toxic rodenticides. THE ANIMALS (CRUEL POISONS) ACT, 1962 This legislation which came into operation on the 12th January, 1963 empowers the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland to prohibit or to restrict the use of the poisons for the purpose of killing animals "where the use ofsuch poisons would be cruel and unnecessary". Under the Protection of Animals Acts 1911-27 it is an offence to put or place in or upon any land or building any poison but, subject to certain limitations and requirements, it is a defence that the poison was placed for the purpose of destroying insects or other invertebrates, rats, mice or other small ground vermin. The Act empowers the Secretary of State for Home Affairs to make regulations prohibiting or restricting the use of cruel poisons for the purpose of destroying animals, and provides that the defence under the 1911-27 Act will not be available in respect of poisons the use of which is prohibited or restricted under such regulations. The Animals (Cruel Poisons) Regulations, 1963, made under Section 2 (1) of the Act came into operation on the 26th October, 1963, and prohibits the use of yellow phosphorus and red squill for the purpose of destroying any mammals, and also prohibits the use of strychnine except for moles. The use of red squill and yellow phosphorus as rodenticides is not necessary in the conduct of modern rodent control by competent organisations and the purchase of such in compound form from hardware stores by the public is no longer possible, thus eliminating haphazard use by the layman and danger to domestic animals. MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION - SMITHFIELD MARKET During the year 385,337 tons of meat, poultry, etc., were delivered into Smithfield Market, an increase of 11,831 tons over 1962. Again it will be noticed from the attached summary that the tonnage for home-killed diseased meat has increased by approximately 9¼ tons. Consignments from Yugoslavia during the year were less than the previous year, and owing to the cool summer season it resulted in less seizures for bacterial spoilage by 194¼ tons. The new Meat Regulations, which came into force on 1st October 1963, require that all meat shall be examined and if passed, be stamped by the Local Authority. It will be noticed from the figures that incidence of diseased home-killed meat has not decreased as was expected but it is hoped that after the next two years, the period allowed, there should be a definite improvement. Fresh New Zealand Lambs. In April 1963, the first fresh lambs to be flown from New Zealand to Smithfield, took thirty-five hours by B.O.A.C. Jet Comet. The lambs were grazing in Auckland on the 5th April, were slaughtered, dressed and cooled, and arrived in perfect condition on the 7th April. The object of the exercise was to prove that in the near future fresh New Zealand lambs could be sent to Smithfield Market at the most difficult time of the year when English and Scotch lamb is out of season (the New Zealand spring is in October and their Christmas time is high summer). These lambs weigh approximately 32 lbs. each. It is not a commercial proposition at the moment, but in the succeeding years it is anticipated that the fast charter freight planes will bring a continuous flow during the winter months. 12 The new poultry market has been open for six months and appears to be running quite smoothly. One great feature is the absence of trucks on the market, making it much easier for buyers to do their business. Although the area is the same as the old market, there is less waste of space allowing for a greater volume of meat, etc. to be pitched. FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS I960 and 1962 Transport and Handling of Meat The following report has been received from Mr. D.R. Bernhardt the officer appointed to enforce the provisions of these Regulations in regard to transport and handling of meat. "STALLS-The standard of cleanliness has been maintained throughout the year. MEAT TRANSPORT - The carrier companies' vans have maintained a good standard of cleanliness, but meat arriving in Smithfield Market from British Railways is not so satisfactory. The containers have been found to be insufficiently cleansed and some consignments of meat have arrived in a dirty condition. In every case found the railway representative has been notified and asked to check empty containers and ensure that steps are taken to cleanse the container before it is put into use again. TRUCKS — The general standard is good and no prosecutions have been necessary. When trucks have beer, found to require cleaning they have immediately been withdrawn and the truck washed. SMOKING — Three prosecutions for smoking whilst handling meat were taken and all were successful. VANS — The standard of cleanliness of private butchers vans has been good. HATS AND CLOTHING — Improvement has been maintained. A number of warning letters have been sent but no prosecutions have been necessary. 13 14 Table showing the amount of meat surrendered to or seized by Meat Inspectors in the City of London for DISEASED condition, 1963 Country January February March April May June July August September October November December Total 1963 Total 1962 lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs. lbs.

Thompson and Flynn, the two Public Health Inspectors who specialise in the hygiene of catering establishments, report as follows "At the end of the year, when one attempts to assess the achievements of the preceding twelve months, seldom is there a sense of satisfaction at the extent and degree of improvements which have been effected in the standard of hygiene, structure and equipment in restaurants and licensed premises. The work can be compared to the painting of the Forth Bridge; it is a continuous task which can never be completed. Undoubtedly, in many instances, we have been successful in persuading caterers to improve their premises and to install better equipment, but it is questionable whether, in spite of our efforts, we have succeeded in inducing some caterers and their employees to adopt a more responsible attitude in their approach to the necessity and importance of hygiene in the preparation and service of food. Unless it is possible to alter radically the mental approach of food handlers to this vital problem of food hygiene and make them realize that hygiene is a basic necessity and not a luxury, the large capital which is being constantly expended upon improvements to premises and equipment cannot secure the desired results. Unfortunately, it is often very difficult to convince people who are engaged upon repetitive routine duties, of the persistent care which must be taken at all times in order to prevent food becoming unnecessarily contaminated. We have again stressed the great advantages to be derived from preparing, cooking and serving food the same day. Not only does this procedure minimize any possibility of food poisoning but it ensures a more attractive and palatable meal. Such a practise, coupled with the observance of scrupulous personal hygiene, would provide a commendable "guiding light" for the whole of the catering industry. Whilst the necessity for frequent hand-washing is, in these days of enlightenment, appreciated by all responsible catering workers and their employers, it is difficult to impose the requisite degree of discipline upon the many ordinary rank and file workers whom it must be reluctantly recognised simply do not or cannot understand the grave implications of failing to wash their hands after using the water closet. During the course of the year extensive improvements have been secured in the equipment and structural condition of kitchens and ancillary rooms in many restaurants throughout the City, but again it is an unfortunate fact that these improvements have not always resulted in the maintenance of that high standard of cleanliness which it is reasonable to expect. On the contrary, some kitchens structurally sound, have been found upon inspection to be in a deplorable condition, and the filth which has been allowed to accumulate as a result of the absence of regular and thorough cleaning has been a source of disappointment and serious concern. We feel that even though a caterer may not have ideal premises or equipment, the existence of such extremely dirty conditions as we have seen are absolutely inexcusable. Often, when appropriate representations have been made, the caterer has attempted to justify his failure to maintain a reasonable standard of cleanliness by drawing attention to his difficulty of obtaining and retaining a full complement of staff. Whilst staff shortages naturally cannot be accepted as an excuse for the existence of dirty conditions, one must adopt a realistic approach to all such problems, and it is unfortunately true that staff recruitment is the predominant difficulty in City catering today and is a source of constant worry and frustration to both managers and proprietors. The continued shortage of competent and conscientious staff is the limiting factor which retards the speedy advance, not only in standards of hygiene but also in standards of service to customers. Because of the overloading of the building industry, caterers are experiencing lengthy delays in carrying out structural improvements, and few builders are today prepared to undertake quickly the execution of small but essential works of maintenance. Generally, therefore, it will be seen that City caterers are passing through a very difficult period, and whilst as Public Health Officers we cannot relax our endeavours to maintain and improve conditions in catering establishments, it would be unfair to ignore the genuine difficulties of the caterers which cannot, as in many other industries, be solved by mechanisation. It is seriously suggested, however, that efficiency could be increased and essential cleaning made easier if greater skill were exercised in the design and structure not only of premises but of catering equipment. Sound and reliable advice is not always readily available to many would be restauranteurs. If, in such cases, they would approach us at an early stage, we would be in a better position to assist and guide them in making the best use of the space available. As every one knows, space is at a premium in the City of London and the restricted floor area available in the kitchen renders expert planning and sound construction even more essential than if one were not constantly struggling to accommodate a "quart in a pint pot". So far as equipment is concerned, it cannot be disputed that there is much room for improvement In this respect caterers generally do not appear to be sufficiently selective. If they refused to accept badly designed equipment, the manufacturers would have no alternative but to give urgent attention to their criticisms. Potato peeling machines illustrate this point. Invariably the makers of these machines conveniently forget that they have to be connected to an internal drainage system and that labour would be saved if these machines were so designed and constructed as to be self cleansing. Channels for the sliding doors of hot cupboards which cannot be effectively cleaned; handles of ladles, etc. which are rivetted and soon come loose, thereby providing harbourage for the multiplication of bacteria, are other examples of unsatisfactory 17 design which come readily to mind. We wonder how often the manufacturers of such articles return to premises where their products are in use to ascertain the existence of any shortcomings. Presumably there is a modicum of co-operation between the caterers and the manufacturers but obviously it is not sufficient to prevent the continued marketing of equipment which has always had inherent defects. Furthermore, with the wide range of materials now available, one would have thought that the time has come finally to abandon the use of galvanised iron in the manufacture of any article which is intended for use in a restaurant kitchen. Ventilation is the most difficult technical problem with which we have to contend, and the efficient ventilation of dining rooms and kitchens, particularly in basement restaurants, continues to be a somewhat intractable problem, the solution of which seems to baffle many of the experts. As a result, unfortunately, one is seldom successful in achieving optimum conditions. Undoubtedly this deficiency is caused in many instances by ventilating engineers basing their calculations on standards which experience of working conditions in a multitude of catering establishments has proved to be too low. A further difficulty arises from the fact that frequently ventilating engineers are requested to submit their proposals before the design of the kitchen has been completed. Obviously, unless accurate information is available as to the siting and quantity and type of cooking equipment to be installed, it is impossible to design an efficient ventilating system. A further limiting factor in the constant quest for good ventilation is the general reluctance on the part of caterers and their advisers to expend more than an absolute minimum on the installation of mechanical ventilating plant. We would suggest for the consideration of the higher executives of the large catering companies that inadequate, inefficient, ventilating plants are wasteful and that expenditure on first class plant would secure a good return on capital outlay by reducing staff costs. It has been found that staff work better where they are provided with good working conditions, and furthermore there is a reduction in the rate of staff turnover which is a common source of worry, expense and frustration to most City caterers. In addition, comfortable conditions in the dining rooms and other parts of the premises frequented by members of the public would eliminate the dissatisfaction often expressed by customers at the present time. On a number of occasions we have had to investigate complaints regarding pieces of glass in food. Not every instance has resulted in injury to the complainant but these incidents raise the problem as to how far such accidents can be avoided as in every case the trouble arose from some accidental circumstance. Glassware is an excellent material for many purposes connected with catering but great care is necessary in its use and the circumstances under which it is used. Ideally, operations such as washing-up should be effectively separated from food preparation, and electric light fittings should be so positioned that in the event of damage the shattered pieces would not fall into food containers or on to exposed food. It would seem that a little thought on this problem on the part of caterers would eliminate the cause of most of the complaints which have been made to us. In our efforts to discharge our duties efficiently it is inevitable that we should be critical of many things, but nevertheless we would like to commend some of the established caterers in the City who have become aware of the advantages to be derived from securing first class conditions in their premises and who spare no effort to obtain the best advice and to ensure that as they extend their activities and open new premises, the kitchens, staff amenities and arrangements generally are such that they, and we also, can be justly proud of their restaurants. It is also fair to point out that notwithstanding the numerous verbal and written representations which have been made during the course of the year regarding a multitude of unsatisfactory conditions, it has not been found necessary to institute legal proceedings in a single instance, although sometimes, probably because of circumstances and difficulties beyond the control of the caterer, action to effect necessary improvements or to carry out essential works of maintenance has not always been taken as swiftly as we would have wished. We are also glad to be able to say that generally we have not experienced any opposition on the part of City caterers to the opinions we have expressed as to what we consider necessary and desirable to comply with statutory requirements, and we think that most City caterers are willing to conform even though at times their good intentions are not matched with comparative resolute action." THE BREAD AND FLOUR REGULATIONS, 1963 These Regulations re-enact with amendments the Flour (Composition) Regulations, 1956, prescribing requirements as to the composition of flour. They also amend the Arsenic in Food Regulations, 1959 as amended, by providing that the maximum amount of arsenic permitted in reduced iron intended for use in the preparation of flour shall be 5 ppm. The following is a summary of the new provisions incorporated in these Regulations - (1) Permitted ingredients are prescribed for different kinds of bread. (2) Labelling and advertising is controlled. (3) Restrictions are imposed on claims that any bread, biscuits or cereal foods are starch reduced or can aid slimming. Claims that such foods have specific weight reducing properties are prohibited. 18 (4) Requirements are prescribed for the composition of wheatmeal or brown flour and wholemeal. (5) The sale of flour or bread containing any added colouring matter is prohibited save that flour and bread other than white bread or soda bread may contain caramel. (6) The sale of flour containing any bleaching agent or improving agent not specified in the Regulations is prohibited. (7) The sale of wholemeal containing any bleaching agent or improving agent whatsoever is prohibited. (8) Where bread or flour is certified by a public analyst as containing any colouring matter not permitted by the Regulations or where the flour is so certified as containing any bleaching agent or improving agent otherwise than in accordance with the Regulations, that bread or flour may be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Section 9 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 as being unfit for human consumption. The Regulations come into operation on the 1st September, 1964. THE LIQUID EGG (PASTEURISATIONREGULATIONS, 1963 These Regulations come into operation on the 1st January 1964 and are designed to secure that all liquid egg used in the manufacture of any food product is efficiently pasteurised. The Regulations prescribe a routine to be followed in sampling, the method of pasteurisation as well as the test which must be satisfied. These are completely new Regulations and Food and Drugs Authorities and Port Health Authorities will therefore for the first time have statutory powers to ensure that liquid egg is safe for human consumption. Egg broken out on the manufacturers' own premises and used within twenty four hours is exempt from the provisions of the Regulations. THE MILK (SPECIAL DESIGNATIONS) REGULATIONS, 1963 These Regulations re-enact The Milk (Special Designations) Regulations, 1960 and at the same time incorporate certain amendments. The principle changes are as follows — (1)The designation "tuberculin tested" is replaced by "untreated" as the special designation for raw milk, i.e. milk which has not been pasteurised. (2) The clot on boiling test for untreated milk is replaced by the half hour methylene blue test as the test for milk to which the producers licence relates. (3) The provision is made for the issue of a temporary producers licence, valid for one month only, to cover certain special circumstances. The Regulations come into operation at varying times; some on the 29th September, 1963, some on the 1st June, 1964 and the remainder on the 1st October, 1964. THE SOFT DRINKS REGULATIONS, 1963 These Regulations come into operation on the 10th July, 1964, and re-enact with amendments the Food Standards (Soft Drinks) Order, 1953, as amended. The most important changes are as follows — (a) The standards of composition for soft drinks made from citrus fruits have been revised. (b) The minimum sugar content has been increased and the maximum quantity of saccharin which may be used has been reduced. Where saccharin is used its presence must be declared on the label. (c) The acids which may be used in the manufacture of soft drinks are specified. (d) There are definite and specific requirements regarding labelling. It is interesting to note that the Regulations do not apply to soft drinks which are not sold in a container. SAMPLING OF TEA Sampling of tea by local authorities is of recent origin. Before 1959, the duties with resject to the sampling and control of unsound tea were carried out by Officers of H.M. Customs and Excise, under permissive powers contained in the Customs and Excise Act, 1952. By a departmental circular of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, dated 28.11.58 it was notified that these functions would cease to be carried out by H.M. Customs and Excise, and it would fall to local and port health authorities as from 1st January 1959 to assume responsibility under the Food and Drugs Act. 19 During the year approximately 2,900 samples were drawn and examined from the six City warehouses and wharves at which tea is received, of which number 1,640 samples were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. He made adverse reports upon approximately 0.6% of these, i.e. 0.37% of the aggregate. The past year has been noteworthy in this field by chiefly underlining the success which has attended the working of the Lead in Food Regulations, 1961, when a fair assessment of the first year's operations in so far as the City is concerned became possible. It can be stated that the enforcement of the Regulations which came into operation in April, 1962 has had a salutary effect on the imports of lead contaminated tea entering the City wharves during the year, since there has been a marked decrease in the number of instances where the limit set by them, i.e. 10 p.p.m., has been exceeded. In fact, compared with the three years prior to that date when there was only a provisional limit, and the average number was nine, there has been only one case this year where the present statutory limit has been exceeded. This absence of excessive lead contamination can be ascribed to a more stringent attitude adopted by importers to the importation of such teas than hitherto. Whereas, formerly, there was a tendency to rely on a less rigid application of standards which enabled importers to blend the tea to within reasonable limits, the new Regulations which have come into force, of course, strictly preclude this, and thereby afford the consumer more effective means of protection against this insidious and cumulative poison. It is evident that foreign suppliers have been made fully cognisant of the position with the result that the matter is being dealt with satisfactorily at source. In the one instance above-mentioned the importer was allowed to dispose of the tea for chemical and fertiliser manufacture. Another source of adulteration of tea rather prevalent during the past year, and affecting mostly Argentine and African teas, has been contamination by minute particles of magnetic mineral matter coupled in some instances with other extraneous substances including sand. In many cases the contamination was not serious (the acceptable limit being 0.10%) and the consignments were released with a warning, but in six instances the Public Analyst reported adversely upon the amount of contamination, which ranged from 0.11% to 0.16%, rejecting the tea for human consumption. Consequently they were placed under detention, but, at the request of the owners, all were allowed to be re-exported except one, where on extensive re-examination the proportion of mineral matter was found to average within acceptable limits and it was decided in the circumstances to permit it to be blended under supervision. It is thought that this type of contamination emanates from plantations being cultivated on very dusty ore-bearing soils from which particles become implanted on the leaves. IMPORTED FROZEN COOKED AND PEELED PRAWNS It was apparent during the year that with the considerably increased importation of this commodity there was a correspondingly great improvement in the bacteriological standards being attained in its preparation, and it was therefore decided at a meeting of the representatives of the Riparian Authorities of the Port of London that the time was opportune for a revision of the criteria then generally recognised. The City Representative who had much experience in the sampling of this type of food, and who had been deeply impressed with the remarkably good results being received by him, especially those relating to Japanese Prawns, was constantly advocating the adoption of a uniformly higher set of standards in conformity with this upward trend. The Government Laboratory intimated that it was thought these high standards were achieved by cooking the prawns both before and after the process of peeling, thus doubly sterilising them prior to their being hygienically packed. The new provisional standards adopted by the Riparian Authorities, which became effective from June, were as follows:— Plate counts of up to 100,000 per gr. at 35°C. warranted unconditional release. Plate counts between 100,000 and 1 million to be released with a warning to use as soon as possible upon thawing. Plate count of over 1 million per gr. warranted detention. The presence of pathogens warranted further consideration irrespective of plate count. Subsequently, it was decided to supplement the above with a set of provisional standards for "Uncooked Prawns" which were to become effective from 1st January, 1964, and wereas follows Provided each package for retail is clearly marked "Uncooked", the fitness of the consignment is to be judged on the presence or absence of pathogenic organisms and not on plate counts. They will also be subjected to the normal inspection of appearance, smell and taste. Further, to avoid any future confusion, exporters to this country should clearly mark packages "Uncooked". The Medical Officer of Health retains the right to decide whether any particular consignment should or should not be admitted. 20 ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION There are established in the City of London four stations for the measurement of atmospheric pollution by the volumetric method; one at the City Mortuary which is attended by the Superintendent of the Mortuary and Disinfecting Station and three at Police Stations which are operated with the kind assistance of the City Police. Daily readings are taken at these stations and the information is collated at the central office in Guildhall where the smoke stains are 'read' on a photo-electric reflectometer and forms are completed and returns made to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research who collate similar information from all over the country. The success of atmospheric pollution measurements relies upon the keenness and efficiency of the operators of the volumetric apparatus. In order to give the operators a further interest in the measurement of atmospheric pollution, Mr. J.W. Campbell, the Public Health Inspector responsible for measurement in the City, arranged for a visit to the Air Pollution Research Unit at St. Bartholomew's Medical College and a further visit was made to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Laboratories at Warren Spring where a technical officer explained the various types of equipment which are used all over the country and explained the object of and the necessity for the measurement of atmospheric pollution. Both these visits were much appreciated by the City operators and they asked many searching and pertinent questions which reflects their keenness. In the winter months when 'smog' is likely to occur, more frequent readings are required to get an accurate reading as to the extent of atmospheric pollution. The resident Superintendent of the City Mortuary and Disinfecting Station has frequently carried out four-hourly readings during such periods in the past and if the 'smog' is prolonged this duty could be quite onerous. With this in mind it was recommended that a semi-automatic sequential smoke and SO2 sampling instrument be purchased. This machine can be set to take readings at either three or twenty-four hour intervals. Delivery of the machine was too late for it to be put into operation for the winter period of this year but it is hoped that it will be in use for any 'smog' occurring in the winter of 1964/65. There are two deposit gauges in the City one on the roof of the Guildhall Office Block and one at the City Mortuary. The rainwater and deposited matter are collected during the month by means of a bowl which has been scientifically measured. On the 1st of the month it is taken to the Public Analyst for general analysis and the results are forwarded to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. A similar procedure is carried out. in connection with lead peroxide method. The lead peroxide candles are exposed to the atmosphere for 1 month and then analysed by the Public Analyst. The results of these investigations are set out in the tables which follow. TABLE I — Deposit Gauge The rainwater collected was slightly less than the average for the previous five years. There was a considerable increase in the amount of soluble matter in the rainwater collected at Golden Lane during the year. Dr. H.A. Williams, Public Analyst reported on the March analysis that 'the deposit contained an abnormal amount of dissolved organic matter and salt, and a considerable growth of micro organisms'. TABLE II — Smoke concentrations by the volumetric method The concentration of smoke recorded in 1963 was above the average for the past five years at three of the stations but recordings at Bishopsgate showed a slight decrease. TABLE III — Sulphur measurement by the volumetric and lead peroxide methods The concentrations of sulphur recorded in 1963 was above the average for the past five years at three of the stations but recordings at Bishopsgate showed a slight decrease. Recordings of sulphur pollution by the lead peroxide method were slightly below the average for the past five years. 21 TABLE I - Results obtained in 1963 of the monthly observations of rainfall and deposited matter by means of the deposit gauges.

CORPORATION STAFF Mass Miniature Radiography A permanent Mass Radiography Unit is operated by the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in premises in the City which are owned by the Corporation. Members of the Staff are encouraged to take voluntary advantage of the facilities provided thus for biennial X-ray of the chest. For obvious reasons no attempt is made to compile official statistics but it is known that a large percentage of Corporation employees take advantage of this opportunity for a regular "check-up". Medical Emergencies The arrangement which has been made with a firm of medical practitioners in the City to be on call for emergencies at Guildhall was implemented twice during the year. This emergency service was instituted because the Medical Officer of Health from the nature of his duties may often be unavailable to answer urgent calls. Ophthalmic Optician Service Since the beginning of March 1959, a firm of Ophthalmic Opticians have been operating an eye testing service for members of the staff. A weekly session is held in the Medical suite of the Guildhall Office Block. This service is operated under the National Health Service, and examinations are free although charges are made for the dispensing of prescriptions. During the year 79 members of the staff had their eyes tested, 18 of these had not previously had an eye test under the National Health Service, and 11 were found to have visual defects which required correction and were supplied with spectacles. 23 61 had been examined previously and were already using spectacles. Of these 56 needed further correction and appropriate lenses were fitted to existing frames or to new frames of the patient's choice. Medical Examinations During the year 560 persons were medically examined. The distribution by Departments and the reason for medical examinations are shown in Table 3. 316 persons were medically examined for admission to the Superannuation Scheme; 14 were rejected as unfit and 10 were deferred. The clinical conditions causing rejection are shown in Table 1. 47 persons were medically examined owing to prolonged absence on sick leave. At the time of examination, 20 were reported as fit for duty, 15 were reported unfit for duty, and 12 were reported unfit for further service. The clinical conditions causing unfitness are shown in Table 2. 91 persons who had reached retirement age were medically examined and all were reported as fit to continue in the Corporation's service for a further 12 months. 3 persons were medically examined for temporary appointments 4 were examined to verify the nature of a disability and 7 medical examinations were carried out in respect of employees at the Monument. In addition 102 persons were examined in connection with applications for exemption from parking fees. 15 candidates for teaching and canteen posts were X-rayed and all were reported as showing no abnormality of the lungs.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1915, To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., 25th .June, 1916. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit herewith my Report as Medical Officer of Health of the City of London for the year 1915. In accordance with the suggestion of the Local Government Board, contained in a Circular Letter of date December, 1915, this Report is submitted in a much more condensed form than usual. It refers only to work which has been carried out during the year, and includes only such comments and comparative tables as, in the circumstances, seem essential. No new policies have been inaugurated, neither has any new public health work been started. It has been considered sufficient to maintain existing machinery in a satisfactory state of efficiency. With a much depleted staff consequent upon the departure of many members to join His Majesty’s Forces, it has been found necessary to restrict activities in certain directions, and even to approve variations from standard requirements. Such variations have been in respect of works of a temporary character which have been rendered necessary to meet present exigencies. In other words the Department has shown greater elasticity in matters of detail without displaying diminished vigilance in connection with subjects which might prejudice the public health as a whole. The following members of my staff have joined His Majesty’s Forces and are serving in different parts of the world in the capacities indicated:— Name. Civil Office. Naval or Military Status. T. Dunlop Young, M.R.C.V.S. Veterinary Surgeon Captain, R.A.V.C. R. E. Galloway Clerk Lieut., Army Ordnance Dept. •J. Dunworth Sanitary Inspector Staff Sergeant, 1st City of London Sanitary Company, R.A.M.C. C. E. Bintcliffe Meat Inspector Petty Officer, R.N.A.S. C. M. Gray Clerk Private, 1st City of London Sanitary Company, R.A.M.C. G. King Assistant Meat Inspector Seaman, R.N.V.R. R. S. McDonnell Disinfector Corporal, R.A.M.C. C.

Stanley Ditto Quarter Master Farrier Sergeant, Westminster Dragoon Guards. F. Stephenson Clerk Rifleman 3rd Battalion 9th County of London (Queen Victoria’s Rifles). 10 The undermentioned members have attested under Lord Derby’s Scheme, and I do not know of any permanent Officer, whether married or single, who is of military age and is not included in the following list or the one preceding. Name. Civil Appointment Held. Married or Single. George Lowe Sanitary Clerk Married. W. S. Matson Meat Inspector Ditto. W. E Mitchener Ditto Ditto. J. Jones Ditto Ditto. G. Ludgate Labourer Ditto. †R. Potter Ditto Ditto. †S. R. Strong Ditto Ditto. The special work necessitated by the War, which was detailed in the Report for 1915, has been continued, and I have again to bring to your favourable notice the efforts of those who remain on duty to ensure that the work of their colleagues on Active Service shall not be neglected. AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 675.2 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.051 square miles, equal to a square of 1.0252 miles to a side. The area of “Registration London” is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 10.81 miles to a side. DENSITY (1915). City of London, Registration District, at night 24.2 persons to an acre. „ „ „ „ during the day 549.6 „ Registration London, at night 60.4 „ „ ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London (excluding the City) was £39,536,721 on 6th April, 1915—whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London was £5,798,001, or about one-eighth of the whole County. POPULATION. The undermentioned figures are abstracted from the report of the Registrar-General on the Census of England and Wales, 1911 (County of London). Area. Statute Acres. Inhabited Homes. Population. 1901. 1911. 1901. 1911. City of London 672.7 3,865 2,784 26,923 19,657 These figures represent the population on the nights of the 1st April, 1901, and 3rd April, 1911, respectively. For Registration, Parliamentary and Municipal purposes the boundaries of the City are co-terminous. This figure refers only to persons “actively engaged in the City during the daytime,” and is based upon a Census taken in May, 1911. †Since writing this Report, these two men have been called up for Military duty. 11 The following table shows the progressive decline which has taken place since 1861 in the number of inhabitants who reside within the City boundaries, and the progressive increase in the number of workers who are daily employed in the City:— Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population. 1861 112,063 - 1866 — 170,133 1871 75,983 — 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 — 1911 19,657 364,061 For statistical purposes, in the following pages the “Registration” District is referred to when speaking of the “City.” This consists of two sub-districts, together containing a population of 16,334 at the middle of 1915, calculated on the last Census Returns:— St. Botolph 6,804 * St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 9,530 16,334 The Night population, therefore, of the City of London Registration District at the middle of 1915, is assumed to be 16,334, and it is upon this figure that all vital statistics in this Report have been calculated. The Day Census taken in May, 1911, showed that the Day population was 364,061 persons, and also that 1,077,155 persons and 94,095 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the count was made. BIRTHS. During the year 1915, 414 births were registered in the City, 277 of which, however, did not belong thereto. To the remaining 137 must be added 12 children born to Citizens temporarily residing outside the City boundary. The number of births, therefore, on which the rate should be calculated is 149. The annual birth rate was 9.2 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 10.6 per 1,000. In the Metropolis the birth rate in 1915 was 22.6 per 1,000. This decline in the birth rate has been in operation in this country sinc3 1876 and is common to nearly all European countries. VACCINATION. Of the 412 births notified to the Vaccination Officers during 1915, 137 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 33 had died before the age for vaccination, and in no case was a child reported as insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 1 case, 178 parents had removed into other districts, and 15 vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 48 instances of conscientious objection. * On the 1st April, 1901, the Middle Temple was transferred from the Strand Sub-District to St. Sepulchre and Allhallows Sub-District. 12 The Public Vaccinators performed 23 re-vaccinations during the year.

During the year under review, 805 deaths were registered in the District, including those of 674 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table, p. 18, for details. Deducting these latter, 131 deaths remain, to which must be added those of 153 persons who died in Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered; the total, therefore, on which the City death-rate is calculated is 284. The death rate for 1915 was 17’4 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 13.5), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 16.1. Death Rates, per 1,000 per Annum. Year.

The deaths from phthisis correspond to a rate of 1.2 per thousand of the population, as compared with 1.6 in the Metropolis, 13 Infantile Mortality. The deaths of children under one year of age were at the rate of 121 per 1,000 births, as against 112 for the whole of London. The Table of infantile mortality on p. 15 shows the deaths of children under one year arranged according to monthly age periods. From this it will be seen that no less than 44.5 per cent. of these deaths occurred in the first month, 77.5 per cent. within the first three months, and 88.9 per cent. within the first six months of existence. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. The work under the Notification of Births Act has been continued. During the year, 114 births, which total includes six still-births, were notified as belonging to the City. 261 other notifications not belonging to the City were received, and these were forwarded to the Medical Officers of Health of the respective districts. Of the 114 City Births:— 72 were notified by Medical Practitioners. 17 ,, ,, by Hospital Authorities, &c. 18 ,, „ by Midwives. 7 „ „ by Parents. During the year, 222 visits were paid to homes to give instruction in the care and feeding of infants, and 455 attendances were made by the mothers at the City Shelter. Of the babies visited:— 80 per cent, were breast-fed. 11 „ were hand-fed. 9 ,, were partly breast-fed and partly hand-fed. The Infant Welfare work was continued on the lines indicated in previous Ann u Reports. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS (EXTENSION) ACT, 1915. The above-mentioned Act was placed upon the Statute Book with the object of (i.) extending to the whole Country the system of the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and (ii.) enabling Local Authorities to make arrangements for the care of nursing mothers, expectant mothers, and young children. The parent Act, which has been in operation in the City since July, 1908, makes it obligatory upon the father of the child, if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, or of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours of the birth, to give notice in writing to your Medical Officer of Health. 14 It will be seen, therefore, that the provisions of the new Act only affect the City of London to the extent of enabling the Corporation, if they deem it desirable, to make additional arrangements in respect of the care of expectant mothers, nursing mothers, and young children. Whilst fully appreciating the urgent necessity for taking all possible steps to secure the health of mothers and children, and diminishing ante-natal and post-natal infant mortality, it did not appear necessary for the Corporation to take advantage of these new powers. The City have always taken a considerable interest in Infant Welfare, and the scheme which has been adopted to secure a reduction in the infantile mortality rate adequately meets the need of the small resident population of the City. Deaths in City Institutions. During 1915, 149 citizens died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 52.5 per cent. of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis being 43.6 per cent.

For years before 1911 some of the corrected rates probably will not be available. The rates should be calculated per 1,000 of the estimated gross population. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5 and 13 may be calculated on a nett population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. * In Column 6 are to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is to be entered the number in Column 6, corrected by“subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. † The Medical Officer of Health will be able from the returns made to him by the local Registrar of Deaths, as well as from the quarterly lists furnished by the Registrar-General, to All in Column 8 in accordance with the rule in the next paragraph below. The Registrar-General, either directly or through the County Medical Officer of Health, will supply the Medical Officer of Health with the particulars of deaths to be entered in Column 9; and all such deaths must be included in this Column, unless an error is detected, and its correction has been accepted by the Registrar-General. For Column 4 the Registrar-General will furnish to the Medical Officer of Health a Statement of the number of births needing to be added to or subtracted from the total supplied by the local Registrar. † “Transferable Deaths” are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence, e.g. casuals, must not be included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The Medical Officer of Health wills state in Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of “non-residents” which are to be deducted, and will state in Column 9 the number of deaths of “residents” registered outside the district which are to be added in calculating the nett death-rate of his district. The following special cages arise as to Transferable Deaths:— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) must be regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such Institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement should be referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are to be referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule; (b) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known ; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

It will be seen from the foregoing that during the year, excluding Chicken-pox, 136 Certificates were received, including 18 “duplicates,” and six in which the diagnosis was subsequently found to be incorrect. The total number of cases of “notifiable” infectious diseases was, therefore, 112, as compared with 128 for the previous year. The total number of cases of Scarlet Fever reported was 55, as compared with 80 last year. The following is a Return of infectious diseases notified, exclusive of Chicken-pox, in the City of London, with the percentages of such cases removed to hospitals for treatment or nursed at home during 1915, compared with the figures for the previous five years— Year.

One case of Cerebro-spinal Meningitis has been notified, and in compliance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, the details of the case are appended. *Metropolitan Asylums Board Hospitals, London Fever Hospital, City of London Infirmary, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, City Police Hospital, &c. 21 Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis. 17th July, 1915, Male, aged 29 years. Extract from the Notes on this case:— A barman, has acted as manager. Illness commenced 8th July, 1915. First symptoms. Vomiting 8th July (?). Coma on admission to Hospital. Delirious at intervals. Retraction of head. Kernig’s sign; also knee jerk. Operation for nasal trouble about two months previously. Has not been away from London during the past month. Eruption mainly on limbs. Eleven persons in house occupying seven rooms, patient had a room to himself. The household consisted of one female housekeeper, aged 40 years, and ten males, ages varying from 22 to 40 years. The house was in fair condition, was not verminous. One cat was kept. Disinfection was carried out. Other inmates of the house were all well. Nothing can be ascertained as to association of the patient with any other suspicious cases of illness. The patient was admitted to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 10th July, 1915. The result of examination of the blood—diplococcus was found in fresh films of cerebro-spinal fluid, which grew in cultures. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1912. From the accompanying table it will be gathered that 33 new cases of Tuberculosis were reported, and that of these 27 were of the pulmonary variety and 6 non-pulmonary. These cases have been visited as in the past, and assistance has been rendered where practicable. The chief new work has been the establishment of a Dispensary at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and in addition to the treatment at the Dispensary the Nurse attached to that Institution visits the patients at their homes by arrangement with the medical practitioner in charge of the case. On the whole it will be seen that the Dispensary has been of considerable utility, and I append hereto a Report which has been prepared by Dr. Gibbins, the Tuberculosis Officer in charge of the work, which gives full details in the form required by the Local Government Board. 22 PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1912.

All notifications on Form D have been disregarded in preparing this return. *Primary notifications relate to patients who have not previously been notified in this or former years, either on Form A or on Form B, in the area to which the return relates. Any additional notification of a case which has been previously notified in the area is regarded as duplicate. (Note.—No primary notifications should be made on Form C.) †A School Medical Inspector, or the Medical Officer of Health of a county, county borough, or other district, if acting as a School Medical Inspector, is required to notify on Form B cases of tuberculosis discovered in the course of inspection of children attending public elementary schools whether or not these have previously been notified. Cols. 2.13. Only those cases which have been notified for the first time during the year on Form A in the area concerned, and which have never previously been notified in the area, either on Form A or on Form B, have been included in these columns. Col. 14. The object of this column is to show the extent to which duplicate notification of the same case occurs on Form A, and all notifications on Form A, whether duplicate or not, are included in this column. Cols. 15.18. Only those cases which have been notified for the first time during the year on Form B in the area concerned, and which have never previously been notified in the area, either on Form A or on Form B, have been included in these columns. Col. 19. All notifications which have been made during the year on Form B in the area concerned, whether the cases have previously been notified in the area, or not, either on Form A or on Form B, have been included in this column. Col. 21. Only notifications on Form C made by the Medical Officers of Sanatoria, as defined in the Tuberculosis Regulations, have been entered in this column. 23 TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. The Tuberculosis Dispensary has been open for the reception of new patients and for the attendance of old cases on Tuesdays and Fridays from 12.30 to 2.30, and on Thursdays from 6 to 7. In the early part of the year the number attending on Thursday evenings was too large for the highest standard of efficiency to be maintained; this was rectified by opening on a second evening each week, and since J une 28th old cases, who are unable to attend at mid.day, have been seen on Mondays between 5 and 7; this arrangement has worked very satisfactorily. In all, the Dispensary has been open 181 times during the year. New Patients. The number of persons, including contacts, who were examined for the first time at or in connection with the Dispensary, was 392, divided thus:— Diagnosed as Suffering from Tuberculosis. Diagnosed as Not Suffering from Tuberculosis. Undiagnosed. Total Number Examined. Still under Observation. Not still under Observation. Insured. Uninsured. Residents 21 30 5 2 26 32 Non.Residents 94 201 17 22 261 73 115 231 22 24 287 105 392 392 Persons diagnosed as suffering from Tuberculosis may be thus classified:— Residents. Non.residents. Totals. Disease of the Lungs 18 87 105 Disease of other organs (Lungs not apparently affected) 3 7 10 115 That is 105 cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (in some of which other organs were affected), and 10 cases of "Surgical Tuberculosis." Many of the persons diagnosed as not suffering from Tuberculosis were found to be suffering from other diseases, for which they were advised to seek treatment elsewhere. The undiagnosed cases are thus accounted for:— Residents— 5 are still under observation. 1 attended once only and then left the City. 1 cannot be found at the address he gave. Non.residents— 17 are still under observation. 3 are ill at home from non.tuberculous disease. 1 has emigrated. 18 have ceased to attend in spite of letter requesting them to do so. 24 Ineligible Applicants. 227 persons applied at the Dispensary for advice who were found to be ineligible to receive it; they were not examined, but were advised to apply elsewhere as seemed most suitable in each case. Persons Treated, &c. The number of persons diagnosed to be suffering from Tuberculosis, who were treated or supervised at or in connection with the Dispensary, was 125, divided thus:— Insured. Uninsured. Totals. Residents 15 10 25 Non.residents 71 29 100 86 39 125 Of these, 115 were new patients this year, while 10 attended for the first time in 1914. Total Attendances. The number of attendances of patients at the Dispensary, including first attendances, was 2,322, divided thus:— Insured. Uninsured. Totals. Residents 306 170 376 Non.residents 1,544 402 1,946 1,750 572 2,322 Persons being treated, &c., at end of year. The number of persons who were under treatment, supervision or observation at or in connection with the Dispensary on December 31st, 1915, was 92, divided thus:— Insured. Uninsured. Totals. Residents 9 13 22 Non.residents 56 14 70 65 27 92 Persons referred to the Hospital. The number of persons who were referred to various departments of St. Bartholomew's Hospital for diagnosis or treatment was 32, divided thus:— Insured. Uninsured. Totals. Residents 3 5 8 Non.residents 17 7 24 20 12 32 Included in the above are 13 persons who were examined by X.rays and 3 who were operated upon. In addition to this a considerable number of persons were seen by Physicians to the Hospital. Pathological Examinations. Specimens of Sputum examined for the Tubercle Bacillus:— Positive 91 Negative 283 Total 374 The blood of two persons was examined for the Wassermann reaction; it was negative in both cases. 25 Treatment in Sanatoria. The number of patients who have been recommended for admission to Sanatoria is 39. In regard to non.residents the result is not always known, so that for them the figures are approximate only; they can be thus classified:— Residents recommended to— London Insurance Committee 12, of whom 11 were admitted. London County Council 3, all of whom were admitted. Charitable Agencies 2, both of whom were admitted. Total recommended—17, of whom 16 were admitted. Non.residents recommended to— Various Insurance Committees 16, of whom at least 14 were admitted. London County Council 2, of whom 1 was admitted. A County Borough Council 1, for whom the Authority had no suitable accommodation. Various Charitable Agencies 3, of whom 2 at least were admitted. Total recommended—32, of whom at least 17 were admitted. In addition to the above many non.residents were very strongly advised to apply for admission to Sanatoria, and would have been recommended had they consented to do so; they objected to apply on various grounds, chiefly the difficulty of maintaining the home during the absence of the bread.winner, 10s. per week received as "Sickness Benefit" under the National Insurance Act being quite insufficient for this. Five children under 16 years of age, and therefore uninsured, were found to be suffering from tuberculosis, two being residents; for one of these institutional treatment was obtained by charitable help, and arrangements are on hand for the other to be admitted to Lord Mayor Treloar's Hospital at Alton. Tuberculosis in children, especially surgical, is very amenable to treatment when this is begun in an early stage; residence in an institution is often necessary, but the accommodation is at present very limited, so that considerable delay is liable to occur with unfavourable consequences; an increase in the number of beds seems necessary. The Tuberculosis Nurse. The work of the Tuberculosis Nurse has developed considerably during the year; it is confined entirely to residents. Of patients attending the Dispensary 26 homes have been visited, and 81 visits made; in some cases the patients were under observation only, no diagnosis having been made, this especially applies to children. The services of the Nurse have been offered to practitioners attending patients not under treatment at the Dispensary (and who may never have been); in three cases the practitioner has availed himself of this offer; all these patients are in an advanced stage of the disease, and very ill, one has a wound requiring frequent dressing. 26 THE PUBLIC HEALTH (MEASLES AND GERMAN MEASLES) REGULATIONS, 1915. The above Regulations apply a system of notification of Measles and German Measles to the whole of England and Wales, and enable Local Authorities to adopt preventive measures, and to arrange for the care of patients suffering from these diseases. The Regulations only affect the City so far as the latter provision is concerned, and in this connection the Corporation have approved an initial annual expenditure of £25 per annum to provide nursing assistance in necessitous cases. This should be sufficient having regard to the small needs of the City in this respect. SMALL.POX. Special attention was given in the early part of the year to the possibility of the spread of Small.pox through the medium of any of the large number of refugees arriving in this country from the Continent and infected ports. A number of these refugees were housed in the Manchester Hotel, Aldersgate Street, and as a precautionary measure 1 recommended that every unvaccinated person and those who had not been vaccinated during the past ten years should avail themselves of the protection afforded by vaccination. No case of Small.pox occurred in the City. Fuller particulars on this subject appeared in the Monthly Report, No. 187. NOTIFICATION OF CHICKEN.POX. As from the 17th March Chicken.pox was made a notifiable Infectious Disease within the administrative County of London until 30th June. CEREBRO.SPINAL FEVER. Memorandum from the Local Government Board. In view of the epidemic of Cerebro.Spinal Fever which prevailed in this country in the early part of this year, an instructive Memorandum prepared by Dr. Newsholme, the Principal Medical Officer, was issued by order of the Local Government Board to all the Medical Officers of Health and Sanitary Authorities throughout the Kingdom. The Memorandum discussed the prevalence, the symptoms, the infectivity, precautionary measures, and administrative action. Due observance of all the suggestions contained in the Memorandum doubtless assisted in arresting the spread of the disease. (See Monthly Report of Medical Officer of Health, No. 187). CONTAMINATED SHELL.FISH. During the year various instances of infectious disease, which may have been attributable to the consumption of contaminated shell.fish, were reported. The usual enquiries were made, but in no case was definite evidence obtained in support of the suspicion. 27 GLANDERS. In accordance with Article 3 (3) of the Glanders and Farcy Order, the Veterinary Inspector under the Diseases of Animals Acts, notified during the year one case of Glanders. The animal was slaughtered, and the carcase was disposed of in the usual manner, every precaution being taken to prevent contagion. HUMAN ANTHRAX. In August the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council brought to my notice a case of human Anthrax, with regard to which enquirv elicited such facts as justified the presumption that the vehicle of infection was a shaving brush used by the patient. Pathological examination of this brush had revealed the presence of Anthrax spores, and several other brushes purchased at the same shop were found to be similarly infected. (This work was conducted by officers of the County Council.) Two of the Firms who had been supplied with these brushes by the wholesale dealer carried on business within the City boundaries, and, when approached, gladly afforded every facility for tracing their ultimate destination. Both Firms had shipped their entire consignments to New Zealand and Australia, and having regard to the serious consequences that might arise should they be passed into circulation, they cabled instructions for their destruction. All the available information was brought to the notice of the High Commissioners for Australia and New Zealand. EXAMINATION OF MILK FOR TUBERCULOSIS AND CONDITION AS TO CLEANLINESS. The sampling of milk on arrival at the several railway termini in the City was continued during the present year. The objects were to ascertain:— (i.) Whether the milk was clean. (ii.) Whether it was free from Tubercle Bacillus or other pathogenic bacteria; and (iii.) Whether water had been added or fat abstracted. Thirty.six samples in all were examined, and of these four were found to contain marked traces of dirt. Three samples contained the Tubercle Bacillus. The usual administrative action was taken with regard to these samples. With regard to the chemical constitution of this milk it was found that with one exception the samples complied with the official requirements. (Full particulars were given in the Monthly Report of the Medical Officer of Health, No. 195.) THE FLY NUISANCE. A Report was presented in April with a view of bringing to the notice of the Corporation the various precautionary measures which might be adopted to minimise the nuisance from flies during the summer season. Certain recommendations were made, and it was decided to distribute broadcast circulars containing suggestions as to suitable methods which might be adopted tor minimising the nuisance. 28 All occupiers of public kitchens were likewise written to, and their co.operation on lines set out invited. The usual precautionary methods adopted in the City during the summer months were continued. These were as follows:— Inspection of dwellings. Inquiries as to the provision of proper covered dust bins. Flushing of Courts. Street Scavenging. Flushing of Gullies. Cleansing operations at Wharves. Inspection of Kitchens. The supervision of bins where horse refuse is known to be stored; and Attempts to disinfect the streets outside Billingsgate Market. Cleansing at the Central Markets, Leadenhall, Farringdon and Billingsgate Markets is undertaken by special Committees, which doubtless gave due consideration to the subject, as did also the Streets Committee to the refuse shoot at Hornchurch. EXAMINATION FOR PATHOGENIC BACTERIA. Any medical practitioner desiring examinations of specimens for Pathogenic Bacteria in cases of suspected infectious disease occurring amongst their patients residing in the City, should forward them to the Medical Officer of Health at the Guildhall. Arrangements have been made for free examination, and the results obtained are communicated as speedily as possible. During the year, the following specimens were so dealt with. It will be seen that positive results were obtained in 50 per cent. of these cases. Specimen. Disease suspected. Result— Positive. Negative. 14 Swabbings from Throat Diphtheria 6 8 9 Sputum Tuberculosis 5 4 3 Blood Typhoid Fever 2 1 CREMATIONS. The total number of Cremations carried out at the Corporation Crematorium at Ilford last year was 45 as compared with 42 in 1914, and reference to the Table on page 29 shows that an increase is recorded at several other Crematoria, the total number in the United Kingdom during 1915 being 1,379, as compared with 1,279 in 1914. The prejudice against this form of disposal of the dead appears to be only slowly losing its hold upon the community. Cremation, with what some regard as its Pagan associations, offends the susceptibilities of many, but apart from sentiment there can be no question that the most hygienic and best method of disposing of the bodies of our dead, is the speedy reduction of them to harmless ashes in specially constructed furnaces. 29 CREMATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, 31 Years—1885.1915.

During the year the bodies of four persons buried at the City of London Cemetery at Ilford have been exhumed. These were all immediately re.interred in other parts of the same Cemetery. In accordance with the terms of the Licences issued by the Home Secretary in respect of these cases the work of removal and re.interment was carried out in the early morning under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS, STONEY LANE, HOUNDSDITCH. These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There* are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's—Queen's— Prince's—North—and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class; some of the ground floors being let as shops. The buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 801* persons, compared with 827 in 1914. 68.7 per cent. are adults, and 31.3 per cent. children (under 14 years). The number of births was 23, viz.: 14 males and 9 females. The birth rate was 28.8 per 1,000, which is 3.6 per 1,000 below the average tor the previous five years. The death rate for 1915 was 6.25 per 1,000 per annum. The number of deaths of children under one year, per 1,000 births, was 87, as against 121 lor the City generally.

DISINFECTION, &c., AT CITY MORTUARY. 361,879 articles of bedding, clothing, furniture, &c., were received at Golden Lane and disinfected. Of these 347,349 were disinfected at the request of City firms engaged in exporting second.hand clothing to South Africa, where the authorities will not allow such articles to enter the country unless accompanied by a certificate duly signed by a medical officer of health, vouching for the proper disinfection of each consignment. In all, 1,185 certificates were issued during the year. 10,656 articles were from premises in the City where infectious disease had occurred, and he remainder, 3,874, were articles of clothing disinfected at the request of the Management of the Belgian War Refugees Home, Manchester Hotel. 199 bodies were received at the Mortuary pending interment, and 85 post.mortem examinations were made. 176 inquests were held on bodies, and 9 inquests on fires.

DISINFECTANTS. As heretofore, all the disinfectants used in the Public Health Department were obtained through your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for the following purposes:— A. Deodorising and "denaturalizing" condemned meat, disinfecting public conveniences (urinals, &c.), B. Disinfecting roadways, street gullies, &c. C. Disinfecting premises, &c., after infectious disease, drain testing and sundries. The amounts paid during the past 12 months under the several headings were:— £ s. d. A 18 2 9 B 453 0 3 C 14 17 2 Total £486 0 2 The above amounts only relate to materials purchased for the use of the Public Health Department. Arrangements have been made with the heads of other departments whereby any disinfectants required by them can be obtained direct from the Contractor supplying the Public Health Department. PRESERVATION OF BODIES OF UNKNOWN DEAD. The De Rechter apparatus for the preservation of the dead, installed at the City Mortuary in March, 1909, was fully described in the Annual Report for that year. Some portion of human remains found in the river Thames, and four bodies of unknown persons were placed in the apparatus during the year. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1915. The above Act as introduced into Parliament contained inter alia a Clause which required premises newly built or re.built to be drained by gravitation or some efficient pumping arrangement. As a result of opposition this Clause was withdrawn, and the Act as placed on the Statute Book contains no Clause directly affecting the Public Health. 33 SANITARY INSPECTIONS.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 94. The Corporation, as the Sanitary Authority in the City, are required, under the provisions of Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to make and enforce Bye.laws applying to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family for the following purposes:— For regulating the number of persons and separation of the sexes. For the registration and inspection of such houses. For enforcing drainage, and promoting cleanliness and ventilation. For the cleansing and limewashing of the premises at stated times. For the taking of precautions in any case of infectious disease. The Bye.laws now in force in the City for this class of property were made by the Court of Common Council on 24th November, 1904, and confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 20th January, 1905. Unfurnished lodgings, when the rent is not less than 10s. a week, and furnished lodgings when the rent is not less than 12s. 6d. a week, are exempt from the operations of the Bye.laws. Particulars relating to the registered Lodging.houses in the City now on the Register are given in the accompanying table, together with the corresponding figures for 1900:— Registered Lodging.houses.

This necessitated the service of 180 Notices during 1915. 36 In addition to the foregoing, there are eleven Blocks of Dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is "self.contained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that in these circumstances they are not subject to the Bye.laws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family:— WEST DISTRICT.

COMMON LODGING.HOUSE, 116, Middlesex Street. These premises are now used as a Soldiers' Hostel. NEGLECT TO COMPLY WITH WATER.CLOSET BYE.LAWS. In accordance with the Bye.laws with respect to water.closets, &c., made under Section 54 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1900, every person who shall intend to construct a water.closet, or to connect or disconnect any water.closet from any soil pipe or drain, shall, at least seven days before the work is to be commenced, deliver or send to the Corporation at the Guildhall, a plan showing the situation of such water.closet, drawn to scale, together with a section showing the proposed mean;; of ventilation. Only two instances of disregard of this Bye.law have been reported. DRAINAGE PLANS. In the course of the year, 323 plans were submitted with regard to proposed reconstruction of water.closets or drains in the City. Of these, 285 were approved, 20 revised and approved, and 18 not approved. 38 STREET GULLIES. The gradual substitution of properly trapped gullies for those formerly existing, has greatly reduced the number of complaints received of offensive smells arising from those appliances, especially in warm weather. In some cases this nuisance was doubtless due to want of flushing, but in the majority faulty construction was the cause of the trouble. The City Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past, and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more up.to.date design will, I hope, eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil. OVERCROWDING. Overcrowding is a nuisance to be dealt with summarily under Section 2, Sub.section 1 (e), of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and during the year 2 cases were reported by your officers. On the service of the statutory notice of abatement the overcrowding was discontinued in each instance. SANITARY DEFECTS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE. In every case of notification of infectious disease, the premises involved were inspected with regard to the drainage system, water supply, ventilation, &c.; and of the 127 cases so investigated in 1915, it was found necessary to reconstruct the sanitary system in 4 instances, and to make amendments to soil and waste pipes, water.closets, &c., in 49 others. HOUSE, TRADE AND OTHER REFUSE REMOVAL. The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1915 consisted of 20,618 cartloads of street sweepings and slops, and 58,441 loads of house and trade refuse, a total of 79,059 loads. The total for the year 1914 was 75,960. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Lett's Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. The horse manure collected from the street orderly bins is not included in the above, but is dealt with by a contractor, who sells it to market gardeners and others. RAILWAY STATIONS. Periodical inspections were made of the sanitary accommodation provided at the twenty.six Railway Stations in the City. 39 In 10 instances, the Companies owning them have been called upon to effect sanitary improvements. The defects, for the most part, have been due to the lack of proper cleaning and to defective drains and sanitary fittings. In all eases the necessary works have been satisfactorily carried out. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. During the year 925 notices have been served by the District Inspectors at the order of the Sanitary Committee, and in 3 cases it was found necessary, in consequence of non.compliance therewith, to refer the matters to the City Solicitor with a view to such steps being taken as he deemed necessary to ensure the required sanitary improvements being effected. In one of these cases only was it found necessary to institute Police Court proceedings. The offender was fined 1l. and 3l. 3s. costs. SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS. There are 279 courts and narrow passages throughout the City which were regularly flushed during the summer months under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service and the flushing of the main streets, no less than 53,482,800 gallons of water were used. Of these courts and alleys, 20 were flushed six times a week, 10 five times a week, 2 four times a week, 27 three times a week, 126 twice a week, and 94 once a week. Disinfectants are also freely applied where desirable. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Customs House, as heretofore, required special attention. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the immediate vicinity of these places free from the nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially during hot weather. LIMEWASHING OF COURTS. There are 89 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed frequently, become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of passengers or vehicles, together with the action of the smoke.laden atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. Of the places so dealt with during 1915, 24 were situated in the East District, 33 in the Middle District, and 32 in the West District. 40 HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. The Registered Hairdressers' establishments throughout the City remain under the supervision of your officers. One change of proprietorship has occurred. The usual list of registered premises is not included here as in some instances the yearly renewal of the licences granted by the Corporation, has not been completed in view of the circumstances of the War and the question of the employment of alien enemy assistants. SMOKE AND ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Nineteen instances of smoke nuisance or annoyance from chimneys were dealt with during the year. Some of these were of a temporary character and did not recur, others were abated upon the service of the usual form of notice upon the offenders and there has been no occasion to take further action. As mentioned in previous reports the annoyance and the evil from coal smoke cannot satisfactorily be dealt with by law until the enactments at present in force are strengthened or amended. The accompanying dirt and discomfort continues, although doubtless in a lesser degree than in former years, and for which the enormous number of the chimneys in surrounding Greater London are partly largely responsible. During the year 1914, with the concurrence of your Sanitary Committee—in conjunction with the Committee for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, appointed by the International Exhibition and Conference in London, 1912—a critical examination of the air in the City was commenced. An apparatus consisting of a large rain gauge, was placed in a convenient position upon the roof of the shelter in Golden Lane, and the rainwater from a known area of surface is collected monthly. This rainwater containing the soot, grit and dust washed from the air has been submitted for examination to the Public Analyst and the results tabulated. For comparison the results obtained from similar observations made upon the Thames Embankment by the London County Council are added. 41 Summary of Observations and Reports for the Months of January to December, 1915.

The results as given by the Public Analyst have been re.calculated into metric tons per square kilometre during each month. One metric ton per square kilometre is equivalent to approximately 9 lbs. per acre or 2.56 tons per square mile. Although the presence of much impurity in the atmosphere has been long known, the above is the first definite record extending over a complete year, obtained by your Officers of the fact. In examining the foregoing table it will be appreciated that in the month of November only, the amount of deposit registered as falling in the City amounted to 21.48 metric tons per square kilometre, which is equal (estimating the City as an area of one square mile) to no less than 55 tons avoirdupois. Of this mass of dirt nearly 35 tons were soluble and included the chemicals mentioned, and 20 tons were insoluble and consisted of tar, carbon and grit. In addition to the foregoing a daily observation has been made at mid-day at the Guildhall of the purity of the air by a new dry method by which the suspended matter can be readily demonstrated. Since the 1st January until the 31st December, the amount of the impurity at noon has varied from a trace to three milligrams per cubic metre of air. This includes times when there has been a slight fog, but no dense fog has yet been tested at the Guildhall. The exigencies of space will not permit here a comparison with similar observations at other places, as for example, Malvern and Sheffield, where results are widely divergent. The value of the work commenced is evident and is an indication of the necessity of its continuation during the ensuing year. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES.

SANITARY DEFECTS IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS NOTIFIED IN 1915 BY H.M, INSPECTOR OF FACTORIES. Complaints were received from H.M. Inspector in respect of 25 matters which were all disposed of before the end of the year or early in the year 1916. As previously mentioned, when dirty conditions or want of ventilation, &c., in Factories are observed, H.M. Inspector is at once notified of the fact—any necessary work being carried out under his immediate supervision. 48 OUTWORKERS AND "HOME" WORKERS. The provisions of the Act relating to Outworkers were carried out as heretofore, and the lists of the names and addresses of Outworkers receiving work from the City firms were duly received without the necessity of legal proceedings. Employers of Outworkers in the City of London were provided with a copy of the "prescribed" form which is required to be used in connection with the transmission of the names and addresses, &c. In a number of cases employers neglect to keep lists at their premises and to send copies of the same to the Corporation as required by the Act. Notice in each case was served upon the offender and in all cases complied with. No case of infectious disease was reported in connection with premises occupied by Outworkers in the City. In 13 cases "contacts" were notified as follows:— Chicken-pox, 1; Scarlet Fever, 12. The necessary enquiries were made in each case and all precautions taken. The following figures show the steady increase in the number of Outworkers notified:— Year. Number of Lists received. Outworkers Employed in City. Outworkers Employed outside City.

The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 4.—REGISTERED WORKSHOPS. 5.—OTHER MATTERS.

HOWABTH, Medical Officer of Health, note.—The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (S. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the administration of that act in workshops and workplaces, and to send a copy of his Annual Report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State (Home Office). If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to including in the copy sent to the Home Office the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Memorandum of March, 1912. 52 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON MEAT INSPECTION. The Meat Inspection Staff has been considerably depleted owing to the officers, both inspectorial and clerical, leaving to join the forces. It has not been found possible to obtain men, either outside the military age or unfitted for service, who can carry on this work, but three temporary assistants have been trained, two of whom possess meat inspection certificates, and they are being utilised as far as would appear to be desirable. As a whole the staff has met the difficulties by working overtime; this being necessary since food inspection work cannot be delayed in the expectation of a slacker day. In general it may be assumed that each day's requirements have been invariably met, and I desire to bring to your favourable notice the exertions which have been displayed by every member of the staff and which enable me to report thus satisfactorily. Among the various matters which have received consideration during the year I need only mention the following:— Importation of Frozen Meat from Brazil. (See printed Report No. 191). The conclusions at which I arrived in connection with Brazilian Beef were as follows:—"The dressing in the first consignments was poor, but in later "deliveries was much improved. The quality was good as regards the chilled, "but less satisfactory in the case of the frozen part of the consignment, and I "think it is desirable, if any considerable trade is to be established in this "country, that supervision should be exercised at the time of slaughter." Importation of Foreign Beef from Rhodesia. (See printed Report No. 191). The importation of Rhodesian Beef received brief notice, and observations were made that "there have been about 11,000 carcases received during the past "six months. The condition has been good, but the quality shows this meat to "be very mixed and improperly graded. No cattle under six years are supposed "to be slaughtered." An instruction class in meat inspection was held at the Central Markets each Tuesday morning. Lectures and demonstrations were given to men of the 2nd City of London Sanitary Company. The lectures were delivered by your Medical Officer of Health, and demonstrations were given, chiefly by Mr. Sharp, Senior Inspector, and at times by Mr. Kelland, who is acting as Mr. Sharp's chief assistant at the present time. Your Medical Officer of Health also lectured on five or six occasions at the Royal Sanitary Institute to the members of the No. 1 City of London Sanitary Company. Altogether about 500 men attended the first course of lectures, and perhaps 300 the second. On the instructions of the Central Markets Committee I reported from the sanitary standpoint as to the reception and sale of live poultry in the London Central Markets. I expressed the opinion that it was desirable that there should not be close association between the stalls on which cut sections of meat were exposed for sale and those at which a trade in live and dead poultry was carried on. It would appear desirable that there should be a sharp line of demarcation between the areas allocated to the sale of these respective foods. 53 A Report was also presented to the Sanitary Committee respecting the importation of boneless beef from America. This followed in consequence of the inspection of certain parcels of boneless beef which were transferred from the area of another local authority to the City for examination. The Report, which was subsequently forwarded to the Local Government Board, contained a statement by your Medical Officer of Health, that he was of opinion that the importation of sectioned meat was undesirable as a general rule, owing to the fact that the inspection of carcass meat is very difficult, and requires more than ordinary skill, as the organs are unavailable. This difficulty is considerably increased when carcases are split up into joints. In the particular case under consideration the joints had been so cut that the lymphatic glands had been removed, a fact that further increased the difficulty. A somewhat important seizure of unsound bacon from three different places, but all belonging to the same consignment, was reported during the year. Proceedings were taken, which resulted in fines being inflicted of £150 and costs and £30 and costs. It is unnecessary to enter more fully into details. In a Report which was presented on the action which should be taken in the City to minimise the nuisance from flies and dust, the question of the handling of meat at the Central Markets was raised, and certain recommendations were made. The suggestions are receiving consideration at the present time, and a fuller Report will be submitted at a later date. Mr. Sharp, the Senior Inspector of Meat, informs me that during the year 1915, 373,331 tons of meat, &c., were deposited for sale in the Central Markets, Smithfield, being a decrease of 51,773 tons compared with the total for 1914. We are indebted to the Superintendent of the Central Markets for the following table:— Comparison—Supplies 1915 and 1914. Source of Supply or Classification. 1915. 1914. Difference. Ratio per cent.

The total supply of fresh meat from all sources weighed 132,804 tons, as against 161,549 tons in 1914, a decrease of 28,745 tons. The decline is attributable to the cessation of the usual heavy shipments from Holland. The proximity of Germany to the Dutch frontier and her need of meat, has for the time deflected Dutch produce from Smithfield. It is interesting to note, despite the war and its far-reaching effects, the productions of the United Kingdom available for London's market aggregated 129,637 tons, which show an increase of 13,362 tons on the year 1914. A new source of supply is being developed in South Africa; some 2,000 tons of beef was marketed during the year, a general improvement being apparent both in quality and handling. Two or three consignments of beef came to hand from Brazil, some of which was of useful quality and in fair condition, but between 16th and 24th of June, 608 hind and fore quarters of beef were delivered to the Central Markets which were very much out of condition, apparently due to defective refrigeration; as a result 14 tons 11 cwts. 0 qrs. 13 lbs. was seized as unfit for human food. I understand the whole consignment, viz., 1,438 hind-quarters and 1,590 forequarters, was destined for the London markets, but the vessel conveying the meat namely, s.s. "Carmarthenshire," was put in at Havre, and the beef commandeered by the French Authorities, the rejected quarters being sent on to the original consignees. South American Beef. Supplies from South America to the Central Markets for the year 1915 aggregated 92,212 tons, which show a decrease of 51,698 tons as compared with 1914. The quality and condition of the meat arriving from this source to the Central Markets, generally speaking, is satisfactory, although occasionally diseased quarters are observed; but considering the large quantities of meat arriving, the percentage of disease found is small, as shown by the following figures:— Article. Disease. 26 hind-quarters of beef Tuberculosis. 5 fore-quarters of beef ,, 2 pieces of beef ,, 55 South American Tongues. A five per cent. examination of all consignments of Argentine ox-tongues is still being carried out.

FISH SUPPLIES. 142,973 tons of fish, of which 125,031 were land-borne and 17,942 water-borne, were received at or near Billingsgate Market during the year. This was a decrease of 40,348 tons in the land deliveries, and 25,702 tons in the deliveries by water. MONTHLY FISH RETURNS, 1915.

Appended hereto is a table which gives some insight into the responsibilities which devolve upon the Public Health Department in respect of food inspection other than meat and offal—which subjects have been dealt with separately. The principal items are set out, and the number of packages in respect of each is stated. It would be impossible to state definitely the tonnage as the size of the different packages varies. The range of weight of each group is indicated. The amount of condemned foods also is shown in a separate table. SUMMARY OF FOOD INSPECTED AT RIVERSIDE WHARVES FOR THE YEAR 1915. Article.

CONDEMNATION OF FOOD INSPECTED AT RIVERSIDE WHARVES, &c. As a result of the daily inspection of the City Wharves, 98 loads of Unsound Food were removed from these places during the year 1915 by the Cleansing Department. The material so disposed of comprised:— Tons. Cwts. Qrs.

The number of samples examined by the Public Analyst was 1,023 which total may be divided as follows:— Formal. Informal. Total. Taken under Food and Drugs Acts 815 183 998 „ „ Milk and Cream Regulations 6 19 25 Total 821 202 1,023 Of the above the samples taken under the Milk and Cream Regulations are separately mentioned on page 70. Of the samples purchased under the Food and Drugs Acts, 37 were found adulterated, which equals a percentage of 4.6. The adulterated articles were Milk, 24 out of 322 or a percentage of 7.5 ; Butter 5 out of 359, a percentage of 1.5 ; Coffee 1 in 19 ; Whiskey 2 in 7 ; Gin 2 in 7 ; Rum 1 in 6 ; and Drugs 2 in 22. All other samples purchased formally were free from adulteration ; the full list is given on pages 76 and 77. As regards informal samples 35 out of 183 were found to be adulterated. No deductions of importance can be drawn from the adulterations noted in this group. In several instances duplicate samples, which were expected to be adulterated, were purchased for special reasons, e.g. preserved shrimps, 19 out of 20 samples of which were reported as containing preservatives. In the case of Milk 6 out of 44 informal samples were adulterated or a percentage of 13.6 compared with a percentage of 7.5 taken formally. When Milk is suspected of being continuously adulterated two or more samples are sometimes taken before a formal purchase is made. The comparative figures for recent years as regards milk adulteration are shown in the following table:— MILK. Samples Purchased under the Act. Informal Samples. Year. Number of Samples taken. Adulterated. Percentage of Adulteration. Number of Samples taken. Adulterated. Percentage of Adulteration. 1910 474 20 4.3 52 13 25.0 1911 453 15 3.4 75 3 4.0 1912 432 17 4.0 49 2 4.1 1913 350 9 2.6 48 4 8.4 1914 298 21 7.1 77 9 11.7 1915 322 24 7.5 44 6 13.6 From the above table it will be recognised that during the last two years the percentage of adulterated milk shows a marked increase ; some part of this is undoubtedly real, but a proportion must be attributed to greater judgment displayed in sampling. 70 It would be possible were it thought desirable to reduce the above percentage of adulteration considerably by sampling without discrimination. The increase which is taking place is prompted in great measure by the demand exceeding the present supply. Prosecutions have been instituted in cases where such seemed desirable, and these are set out on page 73. The usual difficulties have arisen in respect of "Warranty" and display of " Notices." The present is hardly a suitable time to draw attention to these matters with any hope of effecting alteration, and further, the Milk and Dairies Act, which will come into operation after the conclusion of the war, deals in some measure with the warranty question, and doubtless it will be the desire of the Central Authorities that the powers of the Act shall be adequately tested. THE PUBLIC HEALTH (MILK AND CREAM) REGULATIONS, 1912. The following is a summary of action taken and results in the form required by the Local Government Board. 1. Milk and Cream not sold as Preserved Cream. Number of samples examined for the presence of a preservative. Number in which a preservative was reported to be present. Milk 366 0 Cream 11 4 (Boric Acid in each case). 2. Cream sold as Preserved Cream. (а) Instances in which samples have been submitted for analysis to ascertain if the statement on the label as to preservative were correct. i. Correct statement 14 (All were purchased informally except one). ii. Incorrect statement 0 Total 14 (б) Determination made of milk fat in cream sold as preserved cream :— i. Above 35 per cent. 14 ii. Below 35 „ 0 Total 14 (c) Instances where (apart from analysis) the requirements as to labelling or declaration of preserved cream have not been observed None. (d) Particulars of each case in which the Regulations have not been complied with and action taken. 71 As regards the 14 samples of "Cream" which, on examination, were found to contain preservative, two were prosecuted and two were cautioned. The results of the prosecution are shown on page 73. During the year I drew attention to the fact that in respect of Cream sold as Cream without preservative no standard is adopted respecting the milk fat content. No preserved, Cream may contain less than 35 per cent, of milk fat. In certain instances Cream sterilised, but not containing preservatives, which thickens as a result of the process and therefore takes on an appearance of undue richness, was found by the Analyst to contain respectively only 26.9 and 30.5 per cent, of milk fat. In two instances of Restaurant Cream, not sold as preserved Cream, the percentages of milk fat showed the low figures of 12.8 and 19.0 respectively. In unsterilized Cream the average percentage of milk fat in 13 samples was 45.44, the highest being 51.0, and the lowest 40.2. The difference is striking, and where terms such as "double thick" or "pure rich" are used one would at least expect the milk fat to approximate the average found in fresh Cream—certainly the amount should equal the minimum officially authorised in preserved Cream. BUTTER. Very little butter adulteration is discovered. No cases were noted at retail shops, the whole of the defaults being reported from Coffee Houses and the like where bread and butter was asked for. Figures for preceding years are appended.

Several samples were purchased. No infringements were reported. 72 SPIRITS. Samples of Whisky, Gin and Rum were taken in the June quarter ; of these, five were found to be diluted below the legal limit. Prosecutions were taken in these cases, and a fine inflicted in each case. In the December quarter 15 samples of Gin, Rum and Brandy were informally purchased, and in 14 the limit of the Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) for the London Area was not exceeded. In one instance it was, but no proceedings were taken. DRUGS. A considerable number and variety of Drugs were purchased. These totalled 76, of which six were reported against, but it should be noted that four samples found to be wanting when taken informally, furnished two of the sophisticated samples when purchased formally. In the two other instances in which default was observed on informal sampling, the articles were found to be correct when a formal purchase was made. In all cases the defects were due to changes in the new Pharmacopoeia not having been observed. With the exception of the fact that picked Shrimps contained preservatives no other matters require observation. The Shrimp question was dealt with in the printed monthly report of your Medical Officer of Health, and I have only to state that as the shrimps chiefly came from Holland I communicated the circumstances to the representative of the Netherlands Government, and action is being taken to bring about improvement. 73 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875-1907. 1915.

In July three samples of tinned sterilised cream were submitted to bacteriological examination, with a view to ascertaining whether the process had resulted in efficient sterilisation. Duplicate samples were submitted to the Public Analyst in order that the percentage of milk fat present might also be determined. The bacteriologist's report justified the claim. The result of the chemical analysis showed that No. 1, which was preserved cream, contained milk fat in the proportion of 37.3 per cent., an amount somewhat in excess of the minimum requirement. Samples Nos. 2 and 3 contained respectively 30.5 and 26.9 per cent, of milk fat. These samples were labelled "Pure, thick, rich cream" and "Pure, rich, thick cream." As regards the term "rich," the claim seems somewhat exaggerated, as the average percentage of 13 samples of fresh cream was 45.44, the figures varying between 40.2 and 51.00. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT-WARRANTY CLAUSES. The Warranty Clauses of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts were again the subject of discussion during the year, and the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney asked the Corporation to support their appeal to the Local Government Board for the abolition of these means of defence. In view, however, of the fact that powers dealing with this matter are included in the Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, 1915, the Corporation were unable to adopt the suggestion. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS ORDERS. At the end of the year there were 612 Dairymen and Purveyors of Milk, as compared with 639 in 1914, a decrease of 27. Twenty-two new Registrations have been reported, 11 of which were consequent upon the establishment of new businesses, and 11 as a result of change of ownership. The condition of Registered Shops and Dairies has been generally satisfactory. BUTTER AND MARGARINE ACT, 1907. No application for Registration in respect to a Butter Factory has been received during the year. ICE CREAM. In 1915 there were 186 premises in the City where Ice Cream was sold as compared with 191 in 1914, and 28 Itinerant Vendors sold from barrows in the streets as against 26 in 1914, an increase of 2. Regular inspection of premises and barrows as reported in previous reports was maintained, and where the manufacture took place outside the City of London the usual letter of inquiry was sent. One Itinerant Vendor was prosecuted for not complying with the Regulations and ordered to pay the costs of the summons 3s. 77 PICKED SHRIMPS. Samples of picked shrimps were obtained during the year, with the object of ascertaining to what extent Boric Acid was used as a preservative. In all cases it was present, the lowest percentage being 0.12 and the highest 1.14. Action has been taken which will, I hope, result in a diminished amount of Boric Acid being used in picked shrimps. These shrimps are mainly exported from Holland, and the preservative is obviously used to retard decomposition changes. (See Monthly Report of the Medical Officer of Health, No. 191.) PUBLIC HEALTH (SHELLFISH) REGULATIONS, 1915. The above Regulations, which have as their object the prohibition of the sale of shell-fish likely to cause danger to the public health, empower the Corporation of London in the event of any case of infectious disease attributable to the consumption of shell-fish occurring within the City, to take the necessary steps to ascertain the layings from which the suspected shell-fish were obtained, and to require any fishmonger supplying shell-fish within the City to furnish a list of the names of persons from whom he has obtained his supplies during the last six weeks preceding the date of the requirement. (Further details are given in the printed Monthly Report of the Medical Officer of Health, No. 187.) MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognizance of the appointment, 26 persons were examined by the Medical Officer of Health during 1915, and all were reported as physically fit for office. Eight officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement, and of these 7, or 88 percent., were reported to be unfit for duty. In addition to the foregoing, medical examinations were made of persons accepted by the Central (Unemployed) Body, on the recommendation of the City of London Distress Committee, for employment on the Labour Colony at Hollesley Bay, established by the Central Body under the Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. Public Health Department Guildhall, E.C.

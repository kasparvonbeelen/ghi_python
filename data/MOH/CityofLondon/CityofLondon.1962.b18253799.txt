A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., F.R.S.H Jan. 1958 REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1962 To the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commoners of the Corporation of London. Guildhall, E.C.2. ( Telephone: MONarch 3030 My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, "Gentlemen", wrote the City's first and greatest Medical Officer of Health,* Sir Joh Simon, in his first Annual Report, (71 pages), which he read to the Court of Common Council on November 6th, 1849, "the history of the City of London is full of great examples of public service. It records many a generous struggle for the Country and for the Constitution; it records a noble patronage of arts and letters; but never within the scope of the annals, has the Corporation had so grand an opportunity as now for the achievement of unlimited good." Almost the same words could be written by the City's 8th Medical Officer of Health in presenting to the Corporation for their consideration the principle of an occupational health service for the City. At the meeting of the Court of Common Council on 17th December, 1959, the late Mr. Deputy F.A. Homer asked whether anything was being done by the Port and City of London Health Committee with regard to the health of office workers, a matter which was then receiving wide publicity because of debates in Parliament of a private member's bill which was being introduced as the Offices Bill. The Chairman of the Port and City of London Health Committee in reply to the late Mr. Deputy Horner, promised that the Committee at the first opportunity would consider a report from their Medical Officer of Health. This report, which was presented at their meeting on 22nd January, I960, recommended a research survey into the environment of office workers in the City. Following a number of further investigations and reports which were considered by the appropriate Committees, it was finally agreed by the Court of Common Council on 30th June, 1961, that the Corporation should appoint a specialist in that field to undertake a sample survey of occupational health conditions in the City in order to obtain a broad picture of the extent to which these would be likely to comply with the requirements of the proposed bill when it had acquired the force of law; this broad picture he should present in the form of a report which should be ready, at least in interim form, within a year of his appointment. The report should include an appraisal of the desire by City firms to co-operate in the setting up and maintenance of an occupational health service. On the 8th January, 1962, Dr. Alan Robinson commenced work. His first report (presented on 13th December 1962), not only brought to light interesting features about City workers' environment but also revealed a substantial proportion of City firms that wanted to enjoy the benefits of an occupational health service particularly the many smaller firms that had no service of that kind at all nor any access to medical advice for their workers, most of whom 'commute' long distances daily, arriving home at an hour when it is difficult to get in time to the surgeries of their family doctors. Before another Annual Report is published, it is hoped that the Court of Common Council will have approved a detailed plan for setting up an occupational health service for City workers to be financed by the Corporation "City's Cash" in the first instance thus adding another "great example" to the City of London's history of public service, so rightly extolled by Sir John Simon. Another example, though on a smaller scale, is afforded by the City of London Cancer Diagnosis Centre at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. This also originated in a question asked in the Court of Common Council. This time it was Mr. Hardcastle Sanders (happily still with us) who asked why we couldn't have a cancer diagnosis scheme analogous to the Mass Radiography Unit for chest diseases. Here again the Chairman of the Public Health Committee (as it then was) referred the matter for a report to Committee by the Medical Office of Health. The result was the establishment at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in July 1959 of arrangements for cancer diagnosis in females by means of the Papanicolaou histological test. The scheme was financed outof "City's Cash". Latterly the service has been extended to include also diagnosis of cancer by the use of a spectrophotometer and of a specialised x-ray technique known as mammography. This has meant further co-operation between the Authorities of St. Bartholomew's Hospital and the City Corporation with additional grants from City's Cash. • With acknowledgement to "Sir John Simon", by Royston Lambert, published by MacGibbon and Kee, Ltd. London 2 Thus in the twentieth as in the nineteenth and in many centuries before that, the City Corporation continues to have opportunities to be perceptive and receptive of all new ideas for the betterment of mankind and it can be a rewarding experience to work in that atmosphere. The report that follows is a record of the many and varied activities of the City Health Service during 1962. Success in our work has been facilitated by the active encouragement of the Chairman and members of the Committee as well as of other members of the Corporation who take a special interest and by the co-operation of business firms, trade interests, the general public, and where appropriate of other Departments of the Corporation. Special thanks are due to the Public Health Laboratory Service and the Public Analyst, Dr. H. Amphlett Williams. This is a welcome opportunity of expressin g appreciation to everyone concerned. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, J. GREENWOOD WILSON, M.D., F.R.C.P. Medical Officer of Health Port and City of London. VITAL STATISTICS The resident population of the City according to the Registrar General's estimate at mid-year 1962 was 4,610. The birth rate rose to 6.29 per 1,000 resident population and the death rate fell to 8.46 per 1,000 resident population compared with 5.80 and 10.01 respectively in 1961. 29 babies were born alive. 2 births were illegitimate. The total number of deaths of all ages was 39; 30 male and 9 female. 13 deaths were due to cancer, 6 of which were cancer of the lung. 8 deaths were due to pneumonia and 3 from bronchitis. One was due to a motor accident. INFECTIOUS DISEASES NOTIFIED 19 notifications of infectious disease were received, namely 1 of acute influenzal pneumonia (0), 2 of erysipelas (2), 4 of measles (23), 3 of puerperal pyrexia (0), 4 of scarlet fever (2), 1 of tuberculosis (non-pulmonary) (0), 4 of tuberculosis (pulmonary) (5). (The figures in brackets denote the comparable numbers of cases in 1961). FOOD POISONING During the year one outbreak of food poisoning occurred as a result of the consumption of midday meals taken in the staff canteen of a City Office. The firm notified that 19 members of their staff had been affected with abdominal pain and diarrhoea during the night of the 19th/20th November. From the inquiries made and the information gained the outbreak appeared to be due to a heat resistant strain of Clostridium welchii; the time of onset i.e. average of 14.2 hours after the taking of the meals, the symptoms and the course of the illness seemed to indicate a classical outbreak due to this organism. "Roast beef", i.e. beef which had been cooked one day, carved cold and reheated the following day was the only item on the menu taken in common by the people concerned. Portions of this beef were submitted for bacteriological examination but no pathogenic organisms were isolated. Endeavours were made to persuade some members of the firm to submit faecal specimens but without success. It was not possible, therefore, to establish the cause of this trouble conclusively. This outbreak is just another indication of the risks involved in adopting reheating procedures in the preparation of food. Unless the officers investigating such outbreaks receive the fullest co-operation from everyone concerned, much of the usefulness of the effort involved is lost. PIGEON NUISANCE A firm of pigeon catchers is employed under contract by the City Corporation whose policy is not to exterminate all pigeons but to control their numbers to such proportions as will ensure that the pleasure they give to residents and visitors is not out-weighed by the nuisance they cause. During the year 3,850 pigeons were humanely trapped and killed as compared with 2,100 in 1961. 3 TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (CHURCHES, PLACES OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP AND BURIAL GROUNDS) REGULATIONS, 1950 The Common Council of the City of London in January, in accordance with the requirements of the above-mentioned Regulations, publicised their intention to remove from the disused burial ground of St. Alban, Wood Street, which is vested in the Common Council, all human remains in order that the land might be used for the comprehensive development of the area in which the land is situated. The Regulations require that the removal of such remains should be effected and the remains re-interred in accordance with the direction of the Medical Officer of Health. Arrangements were therefore made for the bones which were all aged to be taken to the City of London Cemetery, Manor Park, and there reverently re-interred. During March, April and May 132 boxes of remains were collected and transported to the Cemetery. THE NOISE ABATEMENT ACT, 1960 During the year twenty-one complaints of excessive noise were received. Most of these were in respect of the use of pneumatic drills and associated compressors on demolition and reconstruction work. Contractors were persuaded to fit muffles to the drills and as far as possible to restrict the periods during which they were in use. In one case a private firm secured an injunction restricting the hours during which "sheet piling" could be carried on. HOUSING Housing Act, 1957 1. Number of houses which on inspection were considered to be unfit for human habitation: — Six 2. Number of houses in which the defects wert remedied in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers :— Six 3. Number of representations made to the Local Authority with a view to (a) the serving of notices requiring the execution of works or (b) the making of demolition or closing orders :— (a) None (b) None 4.

Number of houses in respect of which an undertaking was accepted under subsection (4) of section 16 of the Housing Act, 1957 :— None 8. Number of houses demolished None Housing Act, 1961 Part II of the Housing Act, 1961, extends the powers of local authorities under the Housing Act, 1957, to deal with houses in multiple occupation. The Housing (Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation) Regulations, 1962, which came into operation on 22nd May 1962, provide a code of management which a local authority may apply by order under Section 12 of the Act to any house in multiple occupation which is in an unsatisfactory condition in consequence of defective management. It has not been necessary to take any action under the Act during the year. During the year 447 families were rehoused, leaving 605 families for whom accommodation was required at the end of December 1962. Work on the extension to the Corporation's estate at Golden Lane continued, the last 219 flats were completed and let bringing the total to 559. The shops, swimming pool, badminton court, tennis courts and club rooms are nearing completion and should soon be available. 4 The redevelopment of the Corporation's other main estate in Avondale Square, Old Kent Road, continues to progress well and 236 of the 380 flats in the first stage have been completed. The remaining 144 are in an advanced stage of construction and will be available for letting in the near future. A contract for the erection of an old People's Unit of 48 flats has been made. Improvement of an old block of 48 flats is progressing well. At the Holloway Estate, Islington, Hilton House containing 24 flats has been completed as the first stage of redevelopment. These flats have been let to families who were occupying old houses on an adjacent part of the Estate, which will enable a further section of the work to proceed. Consultant Architects are now preparing plans for new flats as the first phase of replacement of the sub-standard houses to the north and west of the Metropolitan Cattle Market in Islington, outline planning permission having now been obtained. The modernisation of the 104 flats at Windsor House, Shoreditch, was completed. The model Old People's accommodation at Isleden House (31 flats) erected by the City Parochial Foundation and acquired by the Corporation, continues to be of interest to people in this country and from overseas who are concerned with the housing and welfare of the elderly. The ready availability of physical assistance, the provided mid-day meal with the other benefits at Isleden House is reflected in the well-being of the elderly residents and their longevity, and the infrequent use of the Sick Bay for their treatment. The Sick Bay continues to receive patients from St. Bartholomew's Hospital (a total of approximately 845 having been admitted since 1954) and elderly tenants from the Corporation's housing estates. WELFARE I am indebted to Mrs. Rita Cohen, M.B.E., Honorary Welfare Officer and Honorary Secretary of the City of London Old People's Welfare Association for the following report:— The activities of the Association during 1962 have been concentrated on the provision of extra domiciliary facilities for those rather sick elderly folk who continue to remain in their own homes. This has entailed the strengthening of the personal services such as Visiting, Domestic assistance, Chiropody and Hairdressing. In so many instances this work has been carried out by voluntary workers, and to all who have co-operated and by so doing made these essential facilities possible this Association is most grateful. During the very cold spell, the Over 60's, for whom this Association accepts responsibility, encountered extra difficulties in regard to heating, water and cooking ; arrangements were satisfactorily carried out to ensure that those old people who could burn coal or coke were kept adequately supplied, and that for those who could not burn such fuel, extra heating facilities from either gas or electricity were made available. Alternative arrangements were made when supplies of these public services were restricted. During this period, additional mid-day meals were made available and the frozen packed meal was indeed a boon. It was the Association's first experience of this type of meal, and those who received them were warm in their praise of both the quality and the quantity of the food supplied. Accommodation for old people is still the most urgent problem. A large proportion of those seeking admission to Homes would, in my opinion, be able to live an independent life if they could be provided with small self-contained units of accommodation within blocks of flats with a warden in charge to give the necessary supervision and, possibly, a little care and attention if required. The Association has continued to provide Convalescent Holidays, Handicraft Classes, Chiropody Treatment at Clinics, Outings, and other general facilities which assist in making the lives of those over 60's,for whom the Association is responsible more cheerful. Employment has been provided for 102 people during the period under review, and if it were not for the fact that the earnings of the pensioners affected their pensions by reason of the 'earnings rule', many more of the over 60's,and 65's in the case of the men, would have been placed in suitable employment. Many applications for assistance are received by the Lord Mayor from old people in distress who live in places far removed from the City of London. The majority of such applicants appear to have failed to obtain from local sources the assistance required, and as a last resort, seek the aid of the Lord Mayor. Such applications are handled by the Honorary Secretary of the Association in her capacity as Honorary Welfare Officer to the Corporation of London, and there is much evidence to support the need of a more comprehensive scheme for the provision of welfare services for the elderly. This is a brief report and summary of the activities provided for the over 60's in and of the City for the year ending December 31st 1962. 5 RODENT CONTROL In compliance with the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, it is the duty of every Local Authority to take such steps as may be necessary to secure as far as may be practicable that their district is kept free from rats and mice and in particular — (a) from time to time carry out such inspections as may be necessary for the purpose aforsaid; (b) to destroy rats and mice on land of which they are the occupier, and otherwise to keep such land so far as practicable free from rats and mice; (c) to enforce the duties of owners and occupiers of land under Part 1 of this Act, and to carry out such operations as are authorised by those provisions; (d) to keep such records and make such reports relating to their functions under this part of this Act as may be required by any directions given by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. For the purpose of implementing the aforementioned provisions, organisation and procedure of the Rodent Control Department were similar to those of previous years, comprising inspection of properties to ascertain the presence of infestation by rats and mice, treatment of any such properties found to be infested, recommendation and supervision of structural and incidental proofing and periodical maintenance control measures for the destruction of rats in the City sewers. No difficulty has arisen necessitating statutory action to resolve the problem and the cooperation of occupiers and owners received in the past has been maintained. A total of 2,133 occupancies and properties were inspected,such properties ranging from new developments in the course of construction, riverside food warehouses and adjoining premises public and private catering establishments, blocks of offices, shops and factories to domestic dwellings. In instances of individual notification of infestation or request for applied control measures the remaining occupancies and adjoining properties were inspected and where necessary combined action taken. Altogether 572 complaints were received, either by notification or as the result of inspection and of the total, 508 infestatiohs were subject to control measures. In 64 instances no action other than advice was necessary. These were mainly where an odd mouse was suspected, and in most instances reported by the office cleaner. Nevertheless, the often long procedure of investigation still had to be applied, if only for the reassurance of the office staffs. Such cases do however, indicate the increasing awareness of employers and employees of even minor nuisances and their readiness to seek advice and apply remedial measures. It is inevitable that from time to time complaints of offensive odours due to decomposing mice are received and where accessible the cause was removed or the odour diminished by a masking agent. The total of 508 infestations subject to control measures comprised 8 major and 76 minor infestations of rats, and 8 major and 416 minor infestations of mice. Of the rat infestations, 4 major and 52 minor were of common rat (Rattus Norvegicus) character and the remainder, 4 major and 24 minor infestations,came under the Ship (Black) rat (Rattus Rattus) classification. Treatment of these infestations entailed 3,994 visits for operational purposes, and in the application of control measures for rats 7,036 pre-baits and 669 poison baits were laid. Such measures resulted in a minimum estimated kill of 989 rats and of that number 535 bodies were removed from the sites of the operations. Many others were found on elimination of structural harbourage or removal of incidental harbourage providing nesting facilities, but no cognizance is taken of these unless vouched for by a member of the Rodent staff. The use of anti-coagulant rodenticides for the control of mice entailed the application of 9,403 initial baiting points and 795 bodies were recovered. In 1945, the comparable figures were 399 rat infestations treated, 241 major (20-200 rats)and 158 minor infestations. Control measures then applied resulted in a minimum estimated kill of 10,038 rats of which 2,410 bodies were recovered. At that period 90% of rat infestation was of Ship (Black Rat) character. In 31 instances structural ratproofing was carried out by owners or occupiers following control measures. Incidental rat and mouse proofing in the nature of removal of harbourage provided by unnecessary and undisturbed accumulations has received detailed attention and the assistance provided in this respect by the Director of Public Cleansing and his Inspectors has been invaluable. In addition 8 instances of defective drainage resulting in common rat infestation were remedied. In respect of the demolition of properties for re-development, it is generally accepted by occupiers of adjoining premises that they would as a result be subject to rat infestation, but their fears have been unfounded, and so far no known infestations of Ship or Common rat have occurred from this source. 6 The common rat infestations were in the main confined to building sites which provided every facility and are conducive to infestation by both species, but taking into consideration the vast amount of re-development completed since 1950, and that now in progress, rat infestation has not in any instance reached the degree visualized and expected at the onset of reconstruction. From the time the footings of the sites are completed inspections are made and any action necessary taken, and the fullest co-operation has been received from the various contractors. The low level of common rat infestation in surface properties is in no small measure due to the systematic control measures periodically applied in the City sewers in compliance with the legislation. It is the purpose of these control measures to keep the rat population of the sewers down to the lowest possible level, and thereby assist in preventing infestation of surface properties from this source via defective drainage. During the period under review, four "Direct" poisons treatments with Fluoracetamide were applied in March, June, September and December, respectively and an average of 390 sewer manholes distributed over 34 miles of traversable sewers were poison baited. The annual overall test baiting which provides an indication of the results achieved by the Direct Poison Method of control was applied prior to the June treatment, a total of 388 manholes were baited and the test baits left down two days. These baits in effect act as pre-baits. Each bait was then examined and where taken replaced by poison bait. The test bait result on examination was 58 takes (45 complete, 3 x lA and 10 x !4) each bait being 4 ozs. Ignoring the partial "takes" which are doubtful acceptances, and recorded for technical reasons only, the summarised result is 11.6% complete "takes" of the total number baited. The comparative annual overall test bait in 1961 produced 85 "takes" (71 complete, 5 x% and 9 x Vi) which is 17.6% complete "takes" of the total baited. There is therefore a reduction of 6% on the previous year. A comprehensive and detailed report on the "Direct" Poison system and the use of Sodium Fluoroacetate and Fluoracetamide, compiled since 1951 when first instituted in the City, was included in the I960 Annual Report, and the information collated therein has assisted a number of Local Authorities to adopt this technique of control. MASS RADIOGRAPHY Dr. W.D.R. Thompson, Medical Director of the Mass Radiography Unit at the City Mortuary Building, 20 Golden Lane, E.C.2., reports that 67,762 persons were X-rayed during 1962, an increase of 1,189 over the 1961 figure. During the year nearly 600 new firms were approached and circular letters were sent to 2,200 firms who had been written to on several occasions in the past without success or which had not used the services of the Unit regularly. The response was reasonably satisfactory. ANTI-POLIOMYELITIS CLINIC From 10th November 1958 until 4th July, 1962 the L.C.C. Divisional Medical Officer had the occasional use of the Civil Defence Control accommodation in the sub-basement of the Guildhall Office Block, by courtesy of the Chairman of the Civil Defence Committee and with the co-operation of the Civil Defence Department, for use as an anti- poliomyelitis clinic. During this period approximately 36,000 persons received inoculations. In 1959 the demand for anti-poliomyelitis inoculations increased considerably and there is little doubt that the death of a well known professional footballer in April 1959 encouraged many people to seek protection from the disease who might not have done so otherwise. After 1959 attendances at the clinic fell gradually until by July 1962 attendances at the clinr.c no longer justified its continuance. CANCER DIAGNOSTIC CLINIC The City of London Diagnostic Clinic at St. Bartholomew's Hospital continued during the year 1962; 227 women were seen during the year. As reported by Mr. Brian Measday, Resident Gynaecological and Obstetric Surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, in his article in The Lancet, 25th August, 1962, entitled "A WellWomen's Clinic", patients attend the clinic after telephoning for an appointment; this they do in response to a leaflet which has been distributed in the rest rooms of business houses and companies in the City. This notice invites any woman over thirty-five, who works or lives within the City boundaries, to attend a clinic where, by means of a simple test, her positive health in respect of cancer of the genital tract can be assured. 7 At the clinic, patients are invited to give their reasons for attending; this is to distinguish those with symptoms from those attending solely because it is a good idea. The menstrual history is briefly reviewed, and marital status and parity are recorded. The breasts, abdomen, and genital tract are then examined, and cytological smears are made with material scraped from the cervix and posterior fornix. Finally, if no clinical abnormality has been found, the patient is informed and told that she will hear by post within a fortnight whether her tests are satisfactory.She is also told that, with her permission, a similar letter giving the results of the smears will be dispatched to her family doctor by the same post. When some abnormality has been detected which will explain a symptom troubling the patient the matter is explained to her and she is told that the clinic will write, on her behalf, to her doctor and discuss treatment with him. All further treatment will be at the discretion of her own doctor, although if he wishes he may refer her to a gynaecological clinic. Where operation would ordinarily be advised, the patient is told of this and asked to talk matters over with her family doctor. The general practitioner is given details by letter and told what procedure or investigation would be carried out if the patient were in the ordinary practice of the hospital. He is offered the hospitality of St. Bartholomew's, but it is made clear that we understand he may prefer to seek elsewhere for advice or treatment on his patient's behalf. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH In the autumn of 1961 Dr. A. Robinson was appointed to carry out a sample survey of occupational health conditions in the City of London, and took up his duties on 8th January 1962. During the year Dr. Robinson not only carried out the sample survey but also produced an excellent interim report "Working in the City" which was well received and commented on in some length in the press and professional journals. In order to obtain a fair average, every 27th firm rated as an office, shop or restaurant was listed and the field work of the survey, which was carried out entirely by Dr. Robinson, was commenced in March after a small pilot survey had been tried. From March to September Dr. Robinson visited 186 offices, 55 shops and 26 restaurants; he completed a punch card, which contained 50 questions, for each firm and a pro forma for each room he visited, in all 1823. In carrying out the survey he recorded that he walked 574% miles ( many of which would have been up and down stairs). A full appraisal of the useful work cannot be made in this report but to summarise the main features of the survey a few brief paragraphs on items mentioned in Dr. Robinson's report are appended. Space Only 7.5% of office rooms were overcrowded on the Gowers Standard of 400 c.f. per person. Lighting Inadequate lighting was the major environmental fault in City Offices. More than half the working points measured by daylight and 92% of the working points measured in artificial light were below the latest recommendations of the Illuminating Engineering Society. Noise In 3 in 10 offices work suffered because of external and/or internal noise. Shops were quite by comparison and restaurants noisier. Heating In the colder months the room temperatures of 62% of offices ranged between 70°F. and 75^. which is high compared to temperatures recorded in studies of workers in other occupations. City shops tended to be rather too cold in winter and too hot in summer. Cooling Generally offices, shops and restaurants were not effectively cooled. Ventilation In 60% of the offices visited during the cold months all windows were shut and 54% of the shops depended on the door for ventilation and few, if any, restaurants achieved adequate ventilation. Most offices employed less than 50 persons and were engaged in various occupations. Only 17.6% of offices, shops and restaurants provided any medical care. Sanitary accommodation was good in offices but not so good in shops and restaurants. Very few offices or shops were provided with cloak-rooms or rest rooms but three-quarters of the restaurants provided cloak-rooms for outdoor clothing and half had rooms used alternatively as rest rooms or for meals. 8 MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION - SMITHFIELD MARKET The deliveries of meat, poultry etc., into Smithfield Market was 373,506 tons, approximately the same as last year. The tonnage of food condemned showed a slight drop of approximately 80 tons to 790 tons. It will be noted from the attached summary that the tonnage for home-killed diseased meat has increased by approximately 11% tons. Protein Beef This is a new type of meat now coming on to the market and it is most interesting as the culmination of many years of research into the problems connected with tenderness in beef. This scientific process for developing tenderness is by inj ecting natural vegetable proteins into the meat tissue of the live animal just before slaughter. These added proteins (emzymes) produce increased tenderness during cooking, which means that any part of the carcase can now be roasted, resulting in equal tenderness and thereby making the carcase of greater value. Samples of this meat have been submitted to the Public Analyst and all have given satisfactory results. During the year 706 samples from 864 tons of horsemeat imported for animal feeding purposes have been taken (Argentine & Uruguay) resulting in 497 tons only being passed, and 367 tons having to be sterilised on account of salmonella infection. This horsemeat is not allowed on the market, but is kept in one of the riverside cold stores. FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 & 1962 Transport and Handling of Meat The following report has been received from Mr. D.R. Bernhardt the officer appointed to enforce the provisions of these Regulations in regard to transport and handling of meat. Stalls — The standard of cleanliness in the stalls has been maintained. Meat Transport — The standard of cleanliness of the vehicles is still satisfactory. Trucks — Truck cleanliness still shows improvement. A new type of meat truck has been designed which has proved quite satisfactory from the hygienic point of view. It is easier to clean and there is less chance of small cuts of meat falling off. Certain modifications have still to be made but it is hoped that future trucks will be constructed in accordance with the improved design. Hats and Clothing — The general standard is good and no prosecutions were necessary during the year. Smoking — A marked improvement has been observed, and only one prosecution for smoking whilst handling meat was taken at the Guildhall Police Court and this was successful. Vans — The standard of cleanliness of private butchers vans has been good. Taxis and Private Cars — The conveyance of meat in private cars is still practiced and where there is risk of contamination the owners are notified by warning letter and the meat loaded onto market transport. The use of taxi-cabs for conveying meat has now practically ceased, and any isolated cases found have been suitably dealt with. POULTRY Examination of a consignment of approximately 100 tons of chickens at Smithfield Market showed them to have an abnormal odour. This odour was traced to a technical fault in the manufacture of the glue used in the making of the cartons in which the birds were packed. The owners consulted the Chief Meat Inspector, who stated that in their present condition the birds were unsatisfactory, but that in his opinion if they were immediately removed from the cartons and aired the odour might disappear. Samples of the chickens were sent by the owners to an analyst, who reported to the effect that the birds were sound apart from the odour, which however might cause mild internal upsets if they were eaten. In the circumstances, rather than risk damage to the trade's good name, the owners surrendered the entire consignment for destruction. 0 Table showing the amount of meat surrendered to or seized by Meat Inspectors in the City of London for DISEASED condition, 1962.

Emulsifiers and Stabilisers in Food Regulations The Emulsifiers and Stabilisers in Food Regulations prescribe a list of permitted emulsifiers and stabilisers. They prohibit the importation or sale of food containing emulsifiers or stabilisers not on the permitted list. The regulations further prohibit the sale or importation of flour containing any emulsifier or stabiliser, of bread containing any emulsifier or stabiliser except stearyl tartrate or partial glycerol esters and of cream or reconstituted cream containing any thickening substance. The regulations provide that the above prohibitions shall not apply as respects a food containing an emulsifier or stabiliser if that emulsifier or stabiliser is naturally present in the food or is present by reason only of the use of the emulsifier or stabliser in a tin greasing emulsion. The regulations prohibit the sale or advertisement of any emulsifier or stabilisier for use in food which is not a permitted emulsifier or stabiliser and impose requirements as to the labelling and advertising of permitted emulsifiers and stabilisers. The regulations provide that where any food is certified by a public analyst as being food which it is an offence against regulation 3 to sell, consign or deliver, or import into England or Wales, that food may be treated for the purpose of Section 9 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 (under which food may be seized and destroyed on the order of a justice of the peace) as being unfit for human consumption. The regulations came into operation on 16th July, 1962, save that the provisions relating to the labelling and advertisement of permitted emulsifiers and stabilisers will come into operation on 14th January, 1963. Milk and Dairies (Emulsifiers and Stabilisers) Regulations The Milk and Dairies (Emulsifiers and Stabilisers) Regulations prohibit the sale of any liquid milk to which any emulsifier or stabiliser has been added. The Regulations came into operation on 11 April, 1962. FOOD ADDITIVES In view of discussion and apparently a good deal of public concern about this matter, it is thought appropriate to quote from the conclusion of an address under the title "Are we being poisoned?" by Professor Alastair C. Frazer, C.B.E., M.D., D.Sc., F.R. C.P., at the Annual General Meeting of the British Food Manufacturing Industries Reasearch Association held on May 8th, 1963. Dr. Frazer, who has an international reputation as a nutritionist, is professor of medical biochemistry and pharmacology at Birmingham University, and he concludes his address as follows:— "To summarise, therefore, extensive measures are taken to ensure, as far as possible, that food is not contaminated with poisonous substances and that chemicals added to food are acceptable and safe-in-use; there is no well-documented evidence that anyone, other than those concerned in their manufacture, distribution, or use, has been poisoned by the chemicals used in agriculture or food technology. To all general appearances the people of this country today seem to be as healthy as at any time in their history. Therefore, to the question: "Are we being poisoned?" all reasonable people, who are prepared to examine the facts impartially, will, in my opinion, say "NO". This does not, in any way, decrease the need for adequate control, and continued vigilance. It is, however, the answer to the ill-informed and irresponsible attacks that have been made upon those who produce and distribute the nation's food and those that safeguard the public health." This extract is reproduced by courtesy of the Food Trades Journal. HYGIENE IN FOOD Reappraisal of the form of action to be taken by local authorities when foreign bodies are found in foodstuffs has been advocated by the British Food Journal and Hygiene Review. 12 Accidental contamination of foodstuffs can almost always be put down to either the human element or faulty equipment or some other failure in the organisation. These can be remedied by expert advice should the firm be willing to co-operate. In place of prosecutions, therefore, the journal advocates treating deficiencies as mismanagement with proceedings instituted only in proven cases of malpractice. In practice, local authorities already use their discretion more often than is supposed. Where foreign bodies have been found in food the causes are considered and action taken accordingly. Whether the firm or individual is to be warned or prosecuted would depend on circumstances, but a great deal depends on the co-operation between the defaulter and the authority. If a firm will not co-operate in an investigation and will not sensibly consider waysof avoiding any repetition prosecution might be the only course left. Usually, however, the local authority is not called upon to consider any action until the public health inspector has exhausted all the possibilities of advice and warning. There is no doubt that court cases have their effect. Local authorities do not prosecute to be vindictive; they are not interested in the penalty. It is the publicity from the case and the corrective measures taken afterwards to protect the consumer that are more important. CATERING AND FOOD HYGIENE Messrs. Thompson and Flynn, the two Public Health Inspectors who specialise in the hygiene of catering establishments, report as follows When we are asked at the end of the year to comment on our work in connection with catering establishments, we sometimes wonder how many workers, wending their various ways in their thousands to the City each day, give any thought to the vast organisation which is necessary to meet their need for a mid-day meal and to satisfy their insatiable demand for countless cups of tea and coffee, or glasses of perhaps stronger beverages. During the war and immediately afterwards a minor social revolution occurred in our feeding habits and undoubtedly people now eat out on a scale never before experienced in this country. The advent and development of the luncheon voucher has assisted this trend and is in fact at the present time the basis of most of the popular catering in the City. Unfortunately, the average price of these luncheon vouchers is now so low that many caterers, faced with rising costs in every direction, find their ingenuity increasingly taxed to provide a meal within the limits of the value of these vouchers. Overtheyears profit margins have been gradually whittled away, and if this process continues it is doubtful if catering will continue to be an economic proposition in the City. Inevitably, therefore, the City workers must be reconciled to higher prices if they wish the existing facilities to remain unimpaired. Of course, as Public Health Officers, our main concern is to ensure that food is prepared and served under cleanly conditions, but hygienic premises and modern equipment cost money, and we cannot divorce ourselves from the realities of the hard economic facts of life. The price of labour looms large in the budgeting of all restaurateurs, even though catering continues to be a Cinderella of industries and notwithstanding the fact that, in comparison with other trades, the reward of the workers is somewhat meagre. Actually the recruitment of efficient staff is the principal headache of the City caterer, and it is an unfortunate but inescapable fact that the disinterested low calibre worker is the main obstacle to any improvement in the general standard of hygiene and service. It is unlikely that many employees in the catering industry are there because they have exercised a deliberate choice, and it is only the unbalanced state of the labour market which enables some of them to hold down and retain their job. Important as the design and construction of premises may be, a satisfactory standard of hygiene can be obtained only by effectively educating and training the food worker. Experience indicates, however, that the attainment of this worthy objective is a slow process fraught with many disappointments. Perhaps here lies a further challenge for the future ! Washing up is, of course, one of the eternal problems of the catering trade, and one of the most monotonous and least rewarding of occupations. We have, therefore, spent much time discussing with architects, manufacturers of washing-up machines, as well as with caterers themselves what we consider to be ideal facilities for the execution of this important and essential operation, and considerable thought has been devoted to the consideration of the best practicable means of reducing the drudgery attached to this thankless task. The extent to which our endeavours have succeeded is a matter of conjecture. Sometimes, perhaps, there is a tendency to place too great a reliance upon gadgets as the solution to all washing-up problems. Undoubtedly some machines on the market at the present time are comparatively useless and their installation is the direct result of the exercise of high pressure salesmanship. People may become mesmerized by a machine, and the disillusionment is greater when it fails to be the panacea of all their troubles and difficulties. 13 There have been times during the year when there was conflict between planning requirements and public health considerations. One may ask how and why such a predicament arises. Unfortunately the root cause of all the trouble is the absence of any powers for the prior approval of catering establishments. All the would be caterer need do is obtain planning approval for the establishment of a new restaurant, but in arriving at a decision, planning authorities do not, and of course cannot, give consideration to the suitability or otherwise of the premises in question. Later, when our requirements are made known regarding such items as ventilating plants and the position of exhaust ducts, etc. the caterer complains bitterly amongst other things of the limitations imposed regarding the termination of exhaust ducts which, in our opinion, should always be carried to the highest point of the building in order to avoid nuisance from cooking smells. Most certainly it does seem illogical that planning approval can be given in isolation, without regard to other equally important considerations. However, there is also a brighter side to the picture, and some considerable success has been achieved in our efforts to persuade architects, catering advisers and intending caterers to devote more time and attention to the design and construction of kitchens and ancillary rooms. Unfortunately, because of the very high rents in the City, space is always at a premium and seldom do we achieve ideal arrangements, as invariably the space available for the functionable part of the restaurant is severely limited. Unlikely though it may appear to the uninitiated, the finances of many caterers are so finely balanced that a couple of tables more or less may determine the difference between a profit and a loss. It will be recalled that the new Licensing Act came into operation during the year under review. In accordance with the provisions of this Act it was necessary for clubs of all kinds, including staff luncheon clubs which sell intoxicating liquor, to apply to the Licensing Justices for registration, and it was our duty to inspect each of these clubs to ensure that conditions were satisfactory from a public health point of view. Whilst certain facilities such as additional sanitary accommodation and improved washing-up arrangements were required in some cases, it was not found necessary to lodge an official objection to the registration of any club. It is only fair to say that the secretaries and other responsible officers were generally very co-operative in carrying out our recommendations and in arranging for the execution of such works as were necessary to secure reasonable standards in their premises. Eating is one of the few human activities that can be enjoyed from the cradle to the grave but at times we wonder if some of the City caterers, especially those in staff canteens, are perhaps too enthusiastic in their attempt to convince their customers that one should not "Live to Eat" but should be content with eating to live. Judging from the amount of food which finds its way into the pig-swill bin it would appear that there is room for improvement in die exercise of the culinary skills in some of the thousand catering establishments situated within the City. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION The routine measurement of atmospheric pollution at the stations in the City of London continued during the year. The results are set out in the Tables which follow. TABLE I — Deposit gauge: The rainfall collected was much the same as 1961, and was less than the average for the previous five years. During the year the total amount of soluble and insoluble matter deposited in the collecting bowl was generally below the average for the previous years although a slight rise in soluble deposits was noted at Guildhall. TABLE II —Smoke concentrations by the volumetric method In 1962 the average concentrations of smoke at two stations—Golden Lane and Cloak Lane — were below those recorded for the average of the previous five years. At Bishopsgate and Snow Hill there was a slight increase. TABLE III—Sulphur measurement by the volumetric and lead peroxide methods. During 1962 there was a slight increase over the average of the previous five years in concentrations of sulphur pollution at all four stations measured by the vplumetric method. 14 Note: A — Golden Lane.

CORPORATION STAFF Occupational Health Service Mass Miniature Radiography A permanent Mass Radiography Unit is operated by the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board in premises in the City which are owned by the Corporation. Members of the Staff are encouraged to take voluntary advantage of the facilities provided thus for biennial X-ray of the chest. For obvious reasons no attempt is made to compile official statistics but it is known that a large percentage of Corporation employees take advantage of this opportunity for a regular "check-up". Medical Emergencies The arrangement which has been made with a firm of medical practitioners in the City to be on call for emergencies at Guildhall was not implemented during the year. This emergency service was instituted because the Medical Officer of Health from the nature of his duties may often be unavailable to answer urgent calls, and even if he were, he would not have with him the doctor's "black bag" the contents of which are essential for effective treatment of many medical emergencies. Ophthalmic Optician Service Since the beginning of March 1959, a firm of Ophthalmic Opticians have been operating an eye testing service for members of the staff. A weekly session is held in the Medical suite of the Guildhall Office Block. This service is operated under the National Health Service, and examinations are free although charges are made for the dispensing of prescriptions. During the year 82 members of the staff had their eyes tested, 17 of these had not previously had an eye test under the National Health Service, and 11 were found to have visual defects which required correction and were supplied with spectacles. 65 had been examined previously and were already using spectacles. Of these 51 needed further correction and appropriate lenses were fitted to ex isting frames or to new frames of the patient's choice. 16 Medical Examinations During the year 510 persons were medically examined. The distribution by Departments and the reason for medical examinations are shown in Table 3. 338 persons were medically examined for admission to the Superannuation Scheme ; 9 were rejected as unfit and 11 were deferred. The clinical conditions causing rejection are shown in Table 1. 30 persons were medically examined owing to prolonged absence on sick leave. At the time of examination, 7 were reported as fit for duty, 12 were reported unfit for duty, and 11 were reported unfit for further service. The clinical conditions causing unfitness are shown in Table 2. 86 persons who had reached retirement age were medically examined and all were reported as fit to continue in the Corporation's service for a further 12 months. 5 persons were medically examined for temporary appointments and 11 were examined to verify the nature of a disability. In addition 40 persons were examined in connection with applications for exemption from parking fees. 27 candidates for teaching and canteen posts were x-rayed and all were reported as showing no abnormality of the lungs. There has been a further increase in the number of medical examinations (510 — 1962, 444 — 1961, and 365 — I960), which was mainly due to the recently instituted medical examination of applicants for exemption from parking meter charges. Investigation of cases referred owing to sickness has involved a considerable amount of documentary research, correspondence and telephone calls as well as physical examination.

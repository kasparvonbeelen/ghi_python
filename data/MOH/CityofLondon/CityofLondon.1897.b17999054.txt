To the Honourable the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present the following record of the proceedings of the Sanitary Staff during the year 1897, with the usual preliminary statistical information. AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises 672T acres, excluding tidal water or foreshore. POPULATION. The first Imperial Quinquennial Census was taken in the City of London on the night of the 29th March, 1896, under the provisions of the London (Equalization of Rates) Act, 1894, 57 and 58 Vic., Cap 53, Sec. 8. 8 In the Returns prepared by the RegistrarGeneral, dated 13th August, 1896, presented to Parliament, the population on the night of the enumeration was found to be 31,711, whilst in the previous decennial Imperial Census of 1891 it was 38,320, shewing a decrease of 6,609 persons in the 5 years (1891-6). Assuming that the annual rate of decrease between 1896 and 1897 corresponded to the rate of decrease in the decennial period 1891 and 1896, the estimated population of the City at the end of June, 1897, would be 30,245. City population in 1861 112,068 " 1871 75,983 " 1881 51,405 " 1891 38,320 " 1896 31,711 The population of the City, as ascertained by the Day-census taken by the Corporation at its own expense, was found to be in 1866— 170,133; in 1881—261,061; and in 1891— 301,384, shewing an increase between 1866 and 1881 of 90,928, and between 1881 and 9 1891 of 40,323, so that if this progressive augmentation has been maintained since 1891, a Day-census at June, 1897, would have shewn a population of about 329,290. The Day-census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. MORTALITY. During 1897 1,046 deaths were registered, including *608 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. Deducting the latter we have to deal with 438 deaths, to which we must add 146 persons who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where, of course, they were registered. The mortality therefore upon which our death rate is calculated is 584. The details of the deaths occurring in the City will be found in Table Appendix A., *In St. Bartholomew's Hospital alone 606 deaths of non-residents occurred. 10 compiled in accordance with requirements of Local Government Board. Of the City deaths registered, 91 per cent, were caused by injuries or violence, as compared with 9.5 in 1896. The death rate for 1897 was 19.3 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 17.8), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis for 1897 was 17.7. These figures are not corrected for sex and age distribution. In comparing the above with the RegistrarGeneral's returns, slight discrepancies will be observed, due to the fact that I have not been furnished with the number of citizens who died in Institutions other than those with which the City is connected. The number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases was 41, or 1.35 per 1,000, against 2.56 for the Metropolis. The deaths of children under 1 year of age 11 to 1,000 births comes out 109, against 158 for the whole of London. BIRTHS. The number of children born in the City (see table B) was 493. The birth rate therefore was 16.2 per 1,000. The birth rate for the whole of London is given as 30 0. This wide variation is due to the differences in the sex and age distribution of their populations. VACCINATION. Of the births, 291 were successfully vaccinated, 1 was insusceptible, 34 died before the age for vaccination, 27 were postponed by medical certificate, 60 removed into other districts, and 78 were pending at the end of the year. During the same period only 300 adults, etc., were re-vaccinated, a number far below the necessities of our population, it being clearly proved that infant vaccination does not confer a life-long immunity from Small-pox, and requires renewal at ages between 7 and 10, and again in the presence of an epidemic invasion. 12 CITY OF LONDON.

City of London. England and Wales. Successfully vaccinated Per cent. 59.3 Per cent. 70.4 Insusceptible .20 .03 Had small pox Nil .003 Died before vaccination 6.9 10.1 Postponed by medical certificate 5.5 1.7 Removed into other districts 12.2 17.5 14 and water with vaccine lymph, and it has been proved microscopically that such admixture has the effect of destroying pathogenic and other micro-organisms existing therein; it is, therefore, impossible that hereditary, specific, or indeed any form of disease can be conveyed by means of vaccination to the system of an infant through the medium of lymph so prepared. There is nothing very new in the practice of diluting animal or human virus by adding water or glycerine, or both combined, in times of Small-pox epidemics or when sufficient lymph per se could not be obtained from arm to arm, should that method of operating be required, but it has been reserved to the more exact processes of modern investigation to shew, upon bacteriological grounds, that a far more significant and beneficial advantage is obtained from glycerinated lymph than the mere increase of bulk of the inoculating material. Science has thus once again come to the aid 15 of common sense, and those very clever persons who, by the possession of a "peculiar reasoning faculty, which has enabled them to believe things that are not true," and impelled them with much obstinacy and no little ingenuity to resist the teachings of experience and the evidence of the highest exponents of medical thought in this and all civilized countries, must henceforth devote their obstructive and mischievous faddism to other subjects. The modern innovation of substituting calf for human lymph has been forced upon the Legislature chiefly by platform agitators, and is purely and simply a question of political exigency. I am, however, convinced that it has in no way modified the predilection of experienced medical practitioners in favour of arm-to-arm vaccination, and, personally, I much prefer that method, provided the operation is skilfully performed with antiseptic precautions from a healthy child, and that not an atom of the vaccinifer's blood is inserted with the lymph employed, which should be as colourless and pellucid as distilled water. 16 In many parts of the Continent the Legislature has insisted upon the re-vaccination of children entering school at the age of seven years, and again at the age of fourteen, the result being a diminution in the death rate from Small-pox which should convince the most obdurate sceptic; thus it is recorded that in Germany alone, where the State requirements are most stringent, only twentyseven deaths took place from Small-pox out of a population of over fifty millions of people, during the year 1895. The long drawn-out proceedings of the Royal Commission will probably eventuate in some compromise by which the blessings conferred upon humanity by the discovery of Jenner, at the end of the last century, may content its opponents, and the present generation will live to see Small-pox as extinct as the Dodo. 17 AUTIZANS' DWELLINGS, HOUNDSDITCH. These buildings accommodate a population of 1,066 persons, about 53 per cent, being adults, and 47 per cent, children. The death rate was 16.9 per 1,000 per annum [of which 27.8 per cent, were children under 5 years of age] as compared with 15.4 in Peabody Buildings. Deaths of children under one year to 1,000 births was 93, as against 109 for the City generally and 137.3 in Peabody Buildings. [Table C in Appendix.] The number of births was 43, viz: 23 males and 20 females. The Birth Rate is high in our dwellings, viz.: 40.3 per 1,000, as against 16.3 for the whole of the City, and 349 in Peabody Buildings. For the fourth year in succession no illegitimate children were registered as born in these dwellings, which should be regarded as highly satisfactory. 18 I find from examinations made from time to time that the supply from the Artesian Well in Stoney Lane, sunk by the Commissioners of Sewers in 1891, maintains the excellent qualities detailed in my special Reports upon the subject in 1891-2, and as the output of the water is far in excess of the local requirements it seems a pity that its use cannot be extended. The following Table represents its general chemical condition: ANALYSIS OF STONEY LANE WELL WATER. (Expressed in Grains per Gallon. One Imperial Gallon contains 70,000 Grains). Grains Per Gallon. Suspended Matter None.

It will be seen by reference to Table B that of 208 persons attacked during 1897, 133 or 63.9 per cent, were removed for medical treatment. Two cases only of erysipelas out of 26 were so treated, but of small-pox, scarlet fever, diphtheria, membranous croup, and typhoid, 73.6 per cent, were taken to an isolation hospital, the figures for the preceding three years being 78.5, 83.9, and 77.5 per cent. This diminution is owing to the occasional overcrowding of the Hospitals of the Metropolitan Asylums Bo;ird, which necessitates patients being treated at home. Of Scarlet Fever and Diphtheria, no less than 77.9 and 73.2 per cent respectively were removed. Following these Notifications, 202 premises were disinfected. The difference between the number of notifications received and the 20 number of premises disinfected is accounted for by the fact that in some instances several cases occurred in one house; whilst in others notifications were received in duplicate. SHELTER FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION HIRING DISINFECTION. Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 60 (Sub-Sec. 4). The establishment at No. 6, Cotton Street, Aldersgate Street, continues in active operation. Nineteen families, comprising 36 adults and 36 children, total 72 persons, were provided with lodging, food and attendance during the disinfection of their houses after the following diseases:— Scarlet fever 9 Diphtheria 9 Small-pox 1 19 Of the above, 10 families came from homes consisting of three rooms, 8 two rooms, and 1 one room. 21 The recipients, without exception, appeared contented with the consideration shewn them, and gave no trouble to the caretaker. The following Return shows approximately the expense of the Shelter, to which is added the. proportionate charges incident to the temporary offices of the Sanitary Inspectors (7) on ground floor, with lavatory convenience in basement.

CORONER'S COURT. 68 Inquests were held on bodies, against 67, 59, and 61 in the years 1894, 5, and 6. Three Fire inquests were held, compared with 3, 3, and 2 in the three preceding years respectively. SANITARY INSPECTIONS. 8,733 Inspections were made. These include the original defects discovered by the Inspectors in the discharge of their daily duty, as well as the re-inspection of the same property during the execution of the works required to remedy the same. 23 Improvements were effected at 1,109 places, including the adoption of entirely new schemes of internal drainage and re-arrangement of lavatory conveniences from plans prepared by the Sanitary Inspectors and approved by me. Some of the largest establishments in the City have been so dealt with ; the drawings connected with these improvements are carefully preserved at Cotton Street for future reference. 944 "Orders" were made to abate nuisances arising from defective drains, noxious trades, neglect of dung-pits, fried-fish shops, dirty bakehouses, indecent overcrowding, underground dwellings, &c., &c. The above figures are lower than in former years, owing to the large amount of time given in the latter portion of the year to the registration of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, a work necessitated by the requirements of your recent Bye-Laws for the regulation of this class of property (see Report, 1896). 24 Full details of this work are laid before you in the returns submitted at every meeting. Special attention has also been bestowed upon cases of foul emanations from sewer ventilators in road-ways, and during 1897 7 shafts were fixed in front of adjacent buildings, making in all 301 spread over the City. Additional ventilating shafts have been erected in various parts of the City, and the gratings in the public roads in connection with them closed, to the great relief of neighbouring premises. We are informed by the Engineer that during 1897 192 premises were drained, but no mention is made of the fact that, so far as relates to the interior of buildings, much of this work was initiated by my Department from plans prepared by myself or the Sanitary Inspectors, or submitted for my approval by architects, builders, owners, &c., &c. Underground conveniences are now to be 25 found in 19 places in the City, containing 206 compartments as urinals, and 131 water-closets; it may be hoped that ultimately public urinals above ground will be entirely removed. 18 water-closets with lavatory appliances are now provided for women, and further accommodation is in contemplation. HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The Superintendent of Cleansing reports that the refuse removed from the City in 1897 consisted of 30,065 cart-loads of street sweepings and slop, and 43,725 loads of house and trade refuse; total, 73,790. SKIPS. The skip system for the removal of refuse was adopted experimentally in 1892, and has been gradually extended until at the end of 1897 no less than 747 had been supplied at the public expense. So far the system has been confined almost exclusively to property of the 26 tenement classes, to the great comfort, convenience and cleanliness of the occupants, who are spared the nuisance of having either to go to a public dust-bin, which was generally a public abomination, or to have their rooms and passages littered with dust for want of proper receptacles. It would be a great advantage from a public health point of view if the adoption of this plan could be extended to the whole of the City, which would ensure a more prompt and regular removal of refuse by the scavengers, but as this would involve considerable expense, some arrangement should be made with the occupiers for the hire or purchase of skips in houses above a given rating ; the responsibility of keeping the things in a cleanly condition and proper state of repair being undertaken by the Superintendent of Cleansing. If this suggestion should not commend itself to the Public Health Department it may be worth while to consider whether the list of streets included in the order of the Commissioner of Police in the following terms might not be added to with advantage:— 27 CITY OF LONDON POLICE. 30 and 31 Vict., Chap. 134. "In compliance with the requirements of the 5th "Clause of the Metropolitan Streets Act, 1867, I, the "Commissioner of the Police Force of the City of "London and the liberties thereof, do hereby name "the several streets in which no person shall, after "the 1st day of August, 1892, between the hours of "ten in the morning and seven in the evening, "remove any ashes, dust, or refuse from any house "in any such street, that is to say:— "Addle Street. Coleman Street. "Aldermanbury. Cornhill. "Aldersgate Street. Duke Street. "Aldgate. Eastcheap. "Barbican. Fenchurch Street. "Basinghall Street. Fetter Lane. "Beech Street. Finsbury Pavement.

"City Police Office, "26, Old Jewry, E.C., "July 22nd, 1892." I would only remark upon this Order that it would be an improvement if the hours of removal were fixed at between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., because in the winter months 7 p.m. is rather too late, it being quite dark at that time 29 of day. The powers of the Commission of Police are conferred by the City Police Act, 1827, Sec. 41 (4). The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 16, gives power to the London County Council to make bye-laws as to the removal of refuse through the streets, but no such power is possessed by the Public Health Department of the Corporation of London. In the same connection, and with a view of reminding you that this subject is not now introduced for the first time, I repeat below the substance of Report of mine on the removal of house refuse, which will be found in the printed minutes of the Commissioners of Sewers of the 27th September, 1892. "PUBLIC DUSTBINS. "These receptables are a standing nuisance, and, in spite of "the constant attention given them by your Cleansing Depart"ment, a source of danger to the public health. "This arises, not so much from the legitimate use of these "dustbins, as from the practice of shopkeepers and others "depositing in them large masses of trade refuse; nor is this "abuse confined to occupiers of premises in the immediate 30 "vicinity of the bins, but from traders in districts outside. "On many occasions I have had the places watched, and the "police have rendered assistance in the matter with a view to "prosecution, but no practical outcome has resulted. "To give some idea of the extent to which this illegal pro"cedure is carried, I may state that only yesterday I observed "that the large public iron dustbin in Windsor Street, "Bishopsgate, was crammed full of straw and sweepings of "some shop or factory. Whilst I was on the spot the cart "arrived to empty this bin, and upon asking the driver when "he was there last, he replied at seven o'clock the same "morning, adding that the bin was frequently emptied twice a "day, and never less than eight times a week. "The remedy for this evil will be found in the extension "of the skip system, and the entire removal of all the public "dustbins throughout the City. "The skip system is largely used in many of the Metropolitan "sanitary districts at the public expense; thus, in Poplar, "22,000 are in use; in Bermondsey, 15,000; and an immense "number in Bethnal Green, &c., &c. The pattern chiefly "preferred is smaller and lighter (weighing only gj lbs.) than "those now in use in some of our own districts, and are "therefore more easily moved about by women and children. "They can be so constructed as to be useless for other "domestic purposes, and their misappropriation thereby "prevented." SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS, ETC. The customary flushing of the crowded and poorest parts of the City during the hot months was carried out, followed by the use of 31 deodorants in the channels running through the courts and alleys, etc. Fifty-two places were so treated in the East District; sixty in the Middle District; and sixty-two in the West District. Total 174. The entrances to forty-nine courts were cleansed and lime-washed at the public expense, viz.: thirteen in the East District; eighteen in the Middle District; and eighteen in the West District. The details of this work will be found in Appendix DEODORISING PUBLIC ROADWAYS, CATCHPITS AND GULLIES. During the summer months the public roadways, catch-pits, and gullies have been thoroughly deodorised, particular attention being given as heretofore to streets paved with wood, and to the granite pavement in the neighbourhood of Billingsgate Market, which is peculiarly exposed to nuisance from the droppings of the fish carts, and from loose offal. 32 DISINFECTANTS. The special disinfectant mentioned in my last Annual Report, resulting from a series of experiments of mine conducted at the City Laboratory, Golden Lane, in 1894, has continued to furnish a powerful deodorant—and germicide—at a fractional cost as compared with proprietary articles supplied by contractors in previous years. By its use we have been enabled to cope with nuisances arising from the public roadways (especially those laid with wood)—the catch-pits—gullies—ventilators in connection with the public sewers—and foul drains, on a very much larger scale and with better results than in former years. The relief to the ratepayers by its adoption has been certainly not less than from ,£1,500 to £1,600 a year, after all charges incidental to the erection of the requisite plant, interest upon cost of the same, provision for depreciation, &c., have been considered. In 1897 alone we effected an economy of no 33 less than 93 per cent. as compared with 1893, in spite of large additional demands by reason of the extension of the Underground Latrine system, and other places. The initial cost of the machinery erected in Golden Lane in connection with this matter may be taken at £250. COST OF DISINFECTANTS. Old Method. 1891 Paid to Contractors £981 1892 „ „ £1,231 1893 „ „ £1,800 In 1894 the cost for the first six months was £783. New Method. 1895 Cost of Chemicals £112 1896 „ „ £195 1897 „ „ £139 In 1894 the cost of materials for the last six months was £85. These figures shew an average advantage in favour of the public purse of 89 per cent. per annum in the outlay for disinfectants, or in other words in 3½ years the Commissioners of Sewers under the old method paid £4,745 against £531 under the new method for the last 3½ years, a saving of £4,213 or 89 per cent. as above stated. 34 HOUSE-TO-HOUSE INSPECTION. The progress made in the house-to-house inspection throughout the City, as ordered by the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891," will be seen at a glance by reference to the map shewn in Appendix. The work in the three sanitary districts during 1897 is displayed in the following Tables:— WEST DISTRICT. House-to-House Inspections, 1897. Name of street. No. of Houses. Defects found.

The Bye-laws for the regulation of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family, confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 8th May, 1896, are now in operation. With a view of expediting the registration of places under the 5th Bye-law (referred to in page 25 of my Annual Report for 1896), the Commissioners of Sewers ordered the printed form, in the Appendix, to be served upon the owner of every house in the City coming within the scope of the regulations. With few exceptions a ready response was given, and from the information thus afforded, checked by the District Sanitary Inspectors, a proper system of registration has been inaugurated. The 5th Bye-law requires that the landlord of a lodging-house, within 14 days after he shall have been required by a notice in writing, 40 signed by the Clerk to the Sanitary Authority and duly served upon or delivered to such landlord, to supply the information necessary for the registration of such house by the Sanitary Authority, shall, himself, or by his agent duly authorized in that behalf, sign and furnish to the Sanitary Authority a true statement of the following particulars with respect to such house, viz.:— (a) The total number of rooms in the house; (b) The total number of rooms let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family; (c) The manner of use of each room; (d) The number, age, and sex of the occupants of each room used for sleeping; (e) The first name and surname of the lodger of each room; and (/) The amount of rent or charge per week payable by each lodger. For Schedule see Appendix. 41 FACTORY AND WORKSHOPS ACTS. Her Majesty's Home Office Inspectors, working under the above Acts, notified 104 cases; of these, 51 related to premises about to be occupied as workshops, 37 changes of premises. Special attention in the middle of the year was given to work-places in Wood Street, it having been alleged by a writer in the public press that in that neighbourhood would be found one or two places where the interference of the Sanitary Authority was desirable. Upon enquiry as to the probability of identifying the places referred to, H.M. Inspector gave instructions for the whole of the factories, work-rooms and work-places in Wood Street to be visited by the Government Inspectors, who alone are possessed of an official list of such places, with the result that these gentlemen discovered several houses which were in their opinion below the standard required by the later Factory Acts. 42 Your own Inspectors were thereupon instructed to visit the premises in question, notices were served, and eventually the defects discovered in the following list were remedied: Situation of Premises.

The Corporation of London is the Local Authority in the City for the purpose of regulating the sanitary condition of Dairies and Milk Shops, under the Dairies, Cow Sheds, and Milk Shops Order of 1885, and the work of inspection is at present carried out by Officers appointed by the County Purposes Committee, supplemented by visits from the District Sanitary Inspectors. As remarked in my last Annual Report, this duty should belong to the Public Health Department, as the Sanitary Authority for the City. 45 The Chief Inspector of Weights and Measures, A. J. Street, reports that during the year 1897 350 Dairies and Milk Shops were dealt with, being 26 more than in 1896. Of the total number, 294 were registered at Guildhall, 40 were unregistered, and 16 were either closed or demolished. These places are also visited periodically by your Inspectors, with a view of discovering and remedying any defects found in the general sanitary arrangements of the premises. The regulations made by the Corporation in respect of Dairies and Milk Shops were printed in my Report for 1895, and need not be repeated here. BAKEHOUSES. The Public Health Department is the Local Authority in respect to bakehouses which are workshops under Sections 34, 35 and 81 of the 46 Factory and Workshops Act of 1878. The law requires:— 1. The walls and ceilings of the bakehouse must be painted in oil or varnished every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap every six months, or be lime-whited every six months. 2. No sleeping place to be allowed on a level with a bakehouse. 3. No water-closet may be within or municate directly with a bakehouse. 4. No drain shall have any opening within a bakehouse. 5. After the 1st January, 1896, no bakehouse shall be established anew below the level of the ground. There are 43 bakehouses in the City of London, viz.:—18 in the East Sanitary District, 12 in the Middle, and 13 in the West District, located as shown in the following table:— 47 WEST DISTRICT.

On the 30th March a case was reported in which the basement of premises occupied by a baker and confectioner doing an extensive business, in Gracechurch Street, had a W.C., common to a large number of employes, opening directly into the bakehouse. This being in contravention of the Act above quoted, Mr. Solicitor was instructed to take legal proceedings, and accordingly the defendant was summoned at the Mansion House, before the sitting Alderman. It appearing that some informality had occurred in the serving of certain notices, 49 the case was dismissed upon technical grounds, the Alderman stating that he regretted feeling compelled to take this course, being of opinion that the existence of an abominable nuisance had been clearly proved. Fresh summons were about to issue, but the occupier consented to the entire removal from the basement of the W.C., and the construction of a similar convenience in adjoining premises, outside the walls of the bakehouse, for the accommodation of his workpeople. The necessary works were at once commenced, and completed in due course to my satisfaction. Further legal proceedings were abandoned, the offender having been put to considerable expense. SMOKE NUISANCE. Attempt has been made to grapple with the evil arising from the above; the Special Inspector appointed for the purpose has been 50 constantly on the alert. The police have given their aid. Photography has been employed to fix upon the exact source of the nuisance, and offenders have been prosecuted, but the result cannot be regarded as encouraging. In Sixtythree cases the Inspector served official notices or warnings. Forty-six have been reported to the Sanitary Committee, and six prosecutions instituted to enforce the law, but the convictions have been unimportant, and certainly not prohibitory. In the succeeding table it will be noted that out of Six cases heard before a magistrate Five were dismissed with an "abatement" order, and no fine inflicted, although some of them were old offenders, and had been previously convicted, and in the face of the clearest evidence that the nuisance was a recurring one in spite of many warnings from the Smoke Inspector, before legal measures were resorted to. 51 The following table will bear out this conclusion:— SMOKE PROSECUTIONS. 1897 Nature of Business.

The substitution of gas stoves for the present clumsy way of firing with soft bituminous coal would, under proper regulations as to ventilation, etc., render the escape of black smoke into the atmosphere impossible, and ensure greater cleanliness and economy. Appliances now in the market are provided with "Bunsen" burners, by which a quantity of air is burnt mixed with the ordinary carburetted hydrogen gas, and the oxygen thus derived from the atmosphere produces increased heat and more perfect combustion. The employment of asbestos for creating a larger surface of radiation in connection 54 with these stoves adds much to their attractiveness, and is unobjectionable from a sanitary point of view; this, however, is only applicable for domestic fires. Then, again, we have the "Siemens" method of burning coke with ordinary coal gas, of which I have had personal experience in a large kitchener for household cooking of all kinds. The cooking arrangements in the restaurants, &c., vary very much with the extent ot the trade carried on, the convenience of the premises, and the pecuniary circumstances of the proprietors. It is found upon inspection that in the great majority of cases black smoke is only emitted from the chimneys in the earlier periods of the day, viz., when the fires are first lighted, and in restaurants when cooking is most active, As a rule, very little smoke is given off after the middle day from small establishments, but in larger buildings, such as the General 55 Post Office, Bank of England, Clubs, principal Hotels, Printing Offices, Factories, &c., volumes of smoke are observed at all hours. Respecting restaurants, etc., the intermittent character of, and the brief time during which the smoke emission is in progress, constitute special difficulties in dealing with this evil, not the least of which is the disinclination of magistrates to interfere in any arbitrary spirit with long-established ways of conducting business. Objection may be taken to this view on the ground that no operations of trade can legally be carried on in such a way as to create a public nuisance, and that every person responsible for the conduct of such a business is bound by law to adopt the best-known mechanical appliances to ensure perfect combustion of the fuel used. Again, the discretionary power invested in justices affords considerable facilities for offenders to escape. Thus the "Public 56 Health (London) Act, 1891 (Sec. 24)," provides:— "That the Court hearing a complaint against "a person in respect of a nuisance arising from "a fireplace or furnace which does not consume "the smoke arising from the combustible used "in such fireplace or f urnace shall hold that no "nuisance is created, and dismiss the complaint, "if satisfied that such fireplace or furnace is "constructed in such a manner as to consume "as far as practicable, having regard to the "nature of the manufacture or trade, all smoke "arising therefrom, and that such fireplace or "furnace has been carefully attended by the "person having the charge thereof." I am quite aware that by Sub-Section (b) of the same section— "Any chimney (not being the chimney of a "private dwelling-house) sending forth black "smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance "shall be liable to be dealt with summarily under 57 "this Act, and the provisions of this Act relating "to those nuisances shall apply accordingly It will be observed that the above qualification, "such quantity as to be a nuisance," affords a loophole for forensic ingenuity, and it is this ambiguity of language which constitutes the chief obstacle in entering upon a sanitary crusade for the annihilation of smoke by the prosecution of offenders. The exemption of dwelling-houses from the operation of the Act is manifestly unjust to small traders, many of whom, and particularly restaurant keepers, do all the cooking they require in stoves no larger than are found in private houses. In large buildings in which steam boilers are used the smoke nuisance can be dealt with in a different spirit, and no rational excuse can be found for any infraction of the law, which directs that the owners shall avail themselves of the best engineering skill, in combination with the most suitable fuel, as the best means of preventing the vomiting 58 forth into the atmosphere of volumes of dense smoke to the annoyance of their neighbours, the obstruction of daylight, and injury to property. In apportioning the amount of responsibility attaching to persons contributing to the smoke nuisance, we should, in fairness to traders, consider the effect produced by the enormous number of coal fires existing in the City in the thousands of offices therein where soft coal only is consumed. These must very largely outnumber the fireplaces used by restaurant keepers. The assistance of the Police has also been invoked and courteously accorded by the Commissioner (in the forms shewn in A and B attached hereto). 59 Form A. "13, Queen Street, "Cheapside, E.C., 189 "Dear Sir, "Re SMOKE. "I beg to ask the assistance of the Police "to watch a chimney upon the premises of "M "at "Should you be able to render this aid, it "will be convenient if your officer will give me "notice of the time at which he can meet our "special Smoke Inspector on the spot, in order to "point out the premises which require watching. "A form is enclosed which indicates the "particulars desired. "Yours truly, "Wm. SEDGWICK SAUNDERS, "Medical Officer of Health for the "City of London. "To the "Commissioner of Police "for the City of London, "Old Jewry, E.C." 60 Form B. "ALLEGED SMOKE NUISANCE. "At "Occupied by "Observations of P.C. Date. Smoke occurred. From. To. Remarks. "Dated this day of 189. "Signed "P.C." With a view of mitigating the nuisance, a carefully prepared notice was issued to all parties concerned in its occurrence, pointing out their liability to interference in the event of action being taken against them, and offering some practical and simple suggestions for their guidance. 61 I append hereto a copy of the printed Notice now in force, which may show how far we have hitherto dealt with the matter. "CITY OF LONDON COMMISSIONERS "OF SEWERS. "Public Health (London) Act, 1891. "To "To the occupier or owner of "in the City of London. "Take Notice that under the provisions of "the 'Public Health (London) Act, 1891,' the "Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, "being satisfied of the existence at "in the said City, of a Nuisance, being a Chimney "sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to "be a Nuisance, do hereby require you forthwith to "abate the same and to execute such works and "do such things as may be necessary for that "purpose. "And the said Commissioners of Sewers do "hereby require you within the said period to do "what is necessary for preventing the recurrence "of the said Nuisance. 62 By order of the Court of Sewers of the 19th of February, 1897, notices were served upon the proprietors of hotels, taverns, restaurants and confectioners, vegetarian restaurants, &c., calling their attention to the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which relate to smoke nuisance. Accordingly the following printed Notice was delivered by hand at each of the 614 establishments : "NOTICE. "SMOKE NUISANCE. "Public Health (London) Act, 1891." "To Proprietors of Restaurants, Dining Rooms, "Eating Houses, Taverns, &c. "With a view of preventing as much "as possible Nuisance from Smoke in the "City of London, the Commissioners of Sewers "have directed their officers to take summary "proceedings against all persons offending herein, "and call attention of all concerned to Section "24 (b) of the 'Public Health (London) Act, "1891,' which provides that: " 'Any chimney (not being the chimney " 'of a private dwelling-house) sending forth 63 " 'black smoke in such quantity as to be a " 'nuisance shall be liable to be dealt with " 'summarily under this Act, and the pro" 'visions of this Act relating to those " 'nuisances shall apply accordingly.' " "Proceedings have already been instituted against offenders, and penalties imposed under the above Act." 64 UNSOUND FOOD. During the year 325 cartloads of unsound food were removed by the Cleansing Department and destroyed as trade refuse at Lett's Wharf at the written request and expense of the owners. The material so disposed of consisted of 315 loads of wet and dried fruit, and 10 loads of vegetables. The procedure prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 47 (8) is as follows: "Where a person has in his possession any "article which is unsound or unwholesome, or "unfit for the food of man, he may, by written "notice to the Sanitary Authority, specifying such "article and containing a sufficient identification "of it, request its removal, and the Sanitary "Authority shall cause it to be removed as if it "were trade refuse." And Section 33 of the same Act directs that the owner shall pay a reasonable sum for such removal, and such sum in case of dispute shall be settled by the order of a Petty Sessional Court. 65 MEAT SUPPLIES. Probably there is no branch of social economy more intimately associated with the well-being, vigour, and contentment of the people than the wholesomeness, inspection, and control of the meat supply. The enormous quantities of material dealt with at the Central Markets alone must far exceed in weight and bulk the deliveries in an area so circumscribed as Smithfield in any other part of the civilised world. No apology, therefore, is needed in submitting for the consideration of the rulers of the City of London some statistical facts in connection with the subject of such paramount importance to the health of the multitudes in greater and lesser London who rely upon our City Markets for their consumption of animal food, particularly on Saturdays, when prices fall within the reach of the poorer classes, to save meat from getting tainted. Again, the retail butchers from a radius of twenty miles round the Metropolis, i.e., 66 Windsor and other places equi-distant, are large purchasers, finding it more to their pecuniary advantage to buy dead meat ready for retail distribution than to prepare the carcases themselves in their own private slaughterhouses. During the year 1897 there has been a further increase in the quantity of meat delivered at the Central Markets, the weight representing 12,763 tons 10 cwts. 3½ qrs., or, say 3.3 per cent. in excess of 1896. This will be seen by the following figures, collated mainly from the reports of the Market Superintendent, Mr. N. Stephens, to which I have added the ratio of sound to unsound meat, including in both instances the 24 years I have held my present office. 67 MEAT SUPPLIES, 1870 to 1897. Year. General Supply.

In the S.S. "Celtic" alone, no less than one hundred tons became putrid in a single voyage, and were removed by the Inspectors. 68 As a useful appendage to the above, the following table shews the deliveries monthly for 1897 and preceding year.

In February the difference is accounted for by 1896 being Leap Year, and therefore containing one day more than 1897. Again, as the month of May commenced on a Friday, when the quantities are always heavier than any other day in the week, there were five Fridays included in the return for 1896 as against four Fridays in 1897, which alone would represent a difference of from 1,200 to 1,400 tons. The unique experience of last year, mentioned in my Annual Report for 1896 [page 53], when 4,159 tons passed the weighbridges on the 21st December, has not been repeated. Christmas this year being a day later than in 1896, the principal supplies were spread over three days, Monday, 20th; Tuesday, 21st; and Wednesday, 22nd; the weights being:— Dec. 20 3,389 tons. „ 21 2,206 „ „ 22 2,248 „ 70 consisting of Country Killed (including American beef killed at Birkenhead) Town Killed (includes all meat slaughtered at Deptford), Foreign (consists largely of poultry from France, Italy, and Hungary), American, Australian and New Zealand (including frozen meat).

Going back to 1870, only 56 tons, 3 cwts., 1 qr., were reported,so that the weight recorded in 1897,viz., 918 tons, 3 cwts., 3 qrs.—was upwards of fourteen times larger than in that year [1870], a fact of some interest and significance in relation to the growth of the meat deliveries at Smithfield. It would be futile to pretend that a work of this magnitude could be performed by five Meat Inspectors in a way to satisfy scientific critics, and the time will assuredly come when considerable additions to our present staff of officers will be forced upon the attention of the Public Health Department; nevertheless, as I explained in my evidence given before " The Royal Commission on Tuberculosis," we have to deal with meat slaughtered and dressed for 78 domestic consumption, in fact "dead" meat only, with the advantage that by far the greater portion is from sound and healthy animals; the interests of the consignors being to send only such to the Markets. It will, therefore, be readily understood that the ratio of diseased to unsound meat is very small, and the following table may be a revelation to many who think that all meat seized and condemned as unfit for food should be classed in the first named category. As heretofore, the proportion of diseased meat was very small; of the 918 tons seized as unfit for food, the results were as follows, viz.:— Tons. Percent. Putrid Meat 768 83'7 Diseased ,, ... ... 102 11*0 Unsound from accident or causes other than above 45 5*0 Offal 3 0-3 Total 918 100-0 This table may be of interest to some and dispel many illusions. 74 The Inspectors of Meat and Slaughter-houses in the City of London are recruited exclusively from men who have had experience as butchers, and are well acquainted with the slaughtering of animals in its various phases. When a vacancy occurs no candidate for appointment is presented to the Committee of Selection who has not previously passed a satisfactory examination before me, showing that he possesses at least a rudimentary knowledge of the more ordinary diseases of animals used for the food of man, and the common appearances of wholesome and sound meat, as distinguished from those produced by disease during life, and after slaughtering. It is thought desirable to mention this because in some districts the inspection of Meat and Slaughter-houses is tacked on to the general duties of the Sanitary Inspectors, who, however well qualified they may be in the routine work of general sanitary organisation, have had but little knowledge of meat or market requirements. This anomaly has been alluded to in and 75 out of Parliament, and formed a special subject of enquiry by the Royal Commission during their sittings last year; it would be well, therefore, that the City of London should be exempt from all reproach in the matter. Officers qualified as described on the preceding page soon acquire a facility in conducting their business by which they can cover more ground in a given time than men of less technical training, and the same advantage enables them to defeat the machinations of the dishonest butcher who sends to London meat he dare not sell in his own neighbourhood, resorting to all kinds of tricks to conceal the evidences of disease in the beast he wants to dispose of: such as pleural adhesions — pelvic lesions— morbid products, etc., etc., which are carefully cut away with a knife, the new surfaces rubbed over with suet, and then well smothered with wheaten flour to hide, as he hopes, morbid appearances, a delusion which sometimes lands him in Holloway Gaol. The experienced and well-trained Inspector finds defects where the ordinary observer would 76 never think of looking for them, and deals with them with a rapidity and accuracy which would be astonishing to some of the learned persons who sit in judgment upon him. A calculation relating to inspection of meat at a port of entry has recently been placed before the Court of Common Council, which reduces it all to the standard of sheep weighing 56 lbs. each, and suggests 1,000 sheep as being the maximum an Inspector can examine in a day. Treating the 1,285 tons we receive daily at Smithfield in the same way, it will give the assumed number of sheep awaiting the examination of the five Inspectors who are engaged at the Central Market [the sixth being on daily duty at Leadenhall and Aldgate] as 51,400 daily, or say 10,280 to each Inspector. It is by no means unlikely that something like that number of heads do pass under their observation, as, although the carcases of oxen and cows weigh more than 56 lbs., there are many lambs and pigs of much less weight, in addition to cut pieces of meat, of poultry, and game, in great variety. 77 This subject is referred to as shewing that, although the staff of Inspectors was increased in 1896 from three to six, their supervision of so much material would be impossible of accomplishment if they had not the co-operation of the salesmen. There will, of course, be exceptions cropping up from time to time, but, generally speaking, there is very little friction with the trade in the conduct of this important duty. During the year the plan has been adopted of giving with each weekly return submitted to the Sanitary Committee the percentage of instances in which the attention of the Inspector has been called to the article in doubt by the salesman, and apparently with a good result, for whereas at one time the proportion of calls was 18 per cent., it had risen in the month of December to over 40 per cent. From experiments conducted recently by an exceptionally well-qualified expert we learn that the critical inspection of every carcase, which some authorities consider necessary, and is in 78 fact made in many places, occupies, on an average, the following time, viz.:— Carcase of Beef 7 minutes. Carcase of Pork 5 ,, Carcase of Sheep 4 „ This trial, made at the shops of different salesmen, of a large number of carcases, was devoid of result, except as defining the time required for the work in question. That is, such an examination as would enable the officer to take the sole responsibility of the meat being sold, and on which he would feel justified in going into the witness-box and stating on oath that it was absolutely free from any sign of disease visible to the naked eye. Longer time would, of course, be required should it be necessary to dismember or cut into the carcases, which the law does not authorise the Inspector to do before seizure. A microscopical exploration for the detection of parasites, or morbid deposits, in the flesh would necessarily occupy a much longer time, and could not be made on the premises of the seller. 79 Following, therefore, the plan at present in operation, and calculating the total daily supply of 1,285 tons as sheep of 56 lbs, each, we find that in a day of nine hours an Inspector would be able to examine 135 sheep, while for the closer observation of every carcase deposited for sale daily at the Central Markets, as determined by the experiment above detailed, no less than 380 Inspectors would be required. This estimate might be dismissed as a reductio ad absurdum if we omit from consideration the methods adopted in some Continental Cities for the inspection of meat. Thus, at Berlin, we are informed in the journal of Comparative Pathology for June, 1890, that over 250 persons are employed in the business at the Central Abattoir, comprising a Directorin-Chief, 19 Veterinary Surgeons, and 6 Assistant Veterinary Surgeons, irrespective of 15 additional Veterinary Surgeons, whose duty it is to inspect carcases slaughtered outside the City and deposited at the markets for sale:—so that if Berlin, with a population of 1,677,135, 80 requires 250 skilled Inspectors, exclusive of the 15 employed outside the Public Market, it follows the Metropolis, with a population of 4,411,710 [as shewn by the last census], would require 657 Inspectors, the size of London being 2.63 times larger than Berlin. It is manifest, therefore, that with our existing methods the five Officers on duty at Smithfield cannot make a minute survey of every carcase and piece of meat passing through the Central Markets. One great disadvantage with which our Inspectors have to contend in distinguishing between meat from diseased animals and that which has become unwholesome from commencing putrefaction, arises from the fact that at our Central Markets they only see dead meat, i.e., carcases quartered and dressed for sale, from which all the viscera have been removed, for although there are distinctive characters pertaining to both conditions it is sometimes very embarrassing to differentiate the one from the other, and especially so when 81 animals have been slaughtered in the earlier stages of the ailments they suffer from. This difficulty applies with more force to tuberculosis than most other diseases, since we know that the materies morbi may be circumscribed and localised to some extent before the animal begins to waste, or there is much change in the appearance of the meat when prepared for market. The remedy for this evil is the stricter and more immediate connection between the slaughter-house and the Market, and points to the great superiority of the Continental system, which insists upon a skilled surveillance over every branch of the business. Thus the points at which disease would be indicated are not always available for the assistance of the Inspector, who has in all such cases the minimum on which to base his judgment. There is no comparison between the work of a Sanitary Inspector at the docks, 82 dealing almost exclusively with frozen meat imported from the Colonies, where it was slaughtered under the eye of a veterinary surgeon, which should guarantee its soundness, and at which the merest glance is generally sufficient to determine its fitness or otherwise for human food, and the daily work of a Meat Inspector at the Central Markets, who follows as closely as circumstances permit the daily arrivals, examining them as to their freedom from disease, absence of putrefaction, and general soundness. The circumstances are distinctly different. On the one hand, the inspection is little more than a promenade through lines of well nourished, healthy animals, and none other would pay the importer; on the other, every individual carcase must be overlooked, and the character and antecedents of the sender, some of whom have an evil reputation, considered in doubtful cases. We therefore protest against the work of Meat Inspectors being estimated by the law of average. We might as well attempt to 83 calculate the number of clients a solicitor could see in a day, since one may take five minutes, but the next two hours. The variation in the daily supply of meat serves to illustrate this; thus at the time of writing the returns posted in the Central Markets for the past week shew:— Monday 1,512 tons. Thursday 1,268 tons Tuesday 956 ,, Friday 2,307 ,, Wednesday 999 ,, Saturday 483 ,, The average is 1,254 tons; yet we learn from the above that on only one day (Thursday) was the supply anything like the average for the week. PROSECUTIONS AGAINST SENDERS OF BAD MEAT. There have been no less than 17 prosecutions instituted against senders of bad meat during the year, a conviction being obtained in 16 cases. In one the defendant was sent for three months' hard labour, without the option of a fine; in the other 15 fines amounting to £335, exclusive of costs, were inflicted; the defendant, however, in three instances, accepted the alternative of imprisonment, which reduces the amount of fines recovered to £205. 84 One of the above prosecutions calls for special remark. Two pieces of beef sent from Woolwich were seized at the Central Market. This place being within the Metropolitan Police area, the usual plan of investigation through the local police could not be adopted, and your officers went to Woolwich to serve the notice of seizure and make enquiries. The owner of the beef kept a butcher's shop in a quiet street, and, on the Inspectors calling there, they saw another badly-diseased carcase of beef hanging in the shop, and at once informed the local Sanitary Authority, whose officers seized the meat. The owner was summoned at the Justice Room, Guildhall, and sentenced by Alderman Samuel Green to three months' hard labour without the option of a fine. On the next day the defendant was summoned at Woolwich Police Court, where he could not appear, being in prison; the case was heard in his absence, and he was fined 30s. DISEASED MEAT PROSECUTIONS.

This additional Section imposes further demands upon the care and attention of the Meat Inspectors. LEADENHALL MARKET. There has been no change during the year at Leadenhall Market, the daily inspection of which is undertaken in rotation by one of your officers. I am informed that the staple trades of the Market have been uniformly and increasingly prosperous during the past year, but as no tolls are taken the deliveries are not weighed, consequently no figures are available. This is to be regretted, as the enormous trade carried on in the Section might furnish some interesting comparative statistics in relation to similar trade operations at the Western establishments in Smithfield and Farringdon. 87 DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED MEAT. The 918 tons 3 cwts. 3 qrs. of meat considered unfit for human food has been disposed of to the same firm that has held the contract for some years. The amount received under its provisions was £2,392 3s. 6d. in 1897, as against £2,352 4s. 4d. in 1896, and £1,572 7s. 6d. in 1895, against which must be placed the expenses incurred by the Commissioners of Sewers in the execution of their responsibility, to wit: Salaries of Inspectors; chemicals for disinfecting baths; cost on horses, vans and haulage; rentals of condemned meat sheds; repairs; a daily heavy outlay for porterage to convey the condemned stock from the shops of the salesmen to the sheds for disinfection before removal to the factory of the contractor at West Ham, etc., and incidentals, etc. SLAUGHTER HOUSES. The slaughter-houses at Aldgate continue in the same general condition mentioned in 88 last year's report, with one exception, which will be duly reported to you. There are some in which no slaughtering has been done during the year, and the dead meat portion of the trade seems to be slowly gravitating towards the Central Market, at which several of the Aldgate butchers have holdings. The proceedings taken by the Sanitary Committee for the abolition of a large receptacle for dung and of[???]al at the rear of the slaughter-houses and lairs in Harrow Alley, common to the public, which for many years had stood on the roadway and been a public scandal, and the substitution, at the public cost, of asphalte pavement for old uneven and ragged granite cubes have put an end to many of the disagreeable features of the place, and the roadway is now regularly flushed and cleansed by the scavengers, so that the general surroundings are much more wholesome and decent than was formerly the case. 89 FISH. 175,251 tons of fish [of which 130,975 were land-borne and 44,276 water-borne] were received at Billingsgate Market during the year, as against 138,162 tons in 1896, 127,291 tons in 1895 and 128,361 tons in 1894. Of the 175,251 tons delivered at Billingsgate, 959 tons, or .547 per cent. were condemned and destroyed by the "Fish Meters" at the expense of the Fishmongers' Company. In addition to the above, 894 tons were received at the Central Markets, Smithfield, as against 951 tons in 1896. So that the total quantity delivered at the Markets within the City, exclusive of Leadenhall, was 176,145 tons. The following figures are interesting: Year. Tons.

Fish so dealt with by your own Inspectors is detailed in their weekly sheets, and included in my reports laid before every meeting of the Sanitary Committee. 91 The monthly seizures of fish is shown as under:— Fish Condemned at or near Billingsgate Market, for the Year, 1897 :— 1897.

To one and all I beg, with the utmost respect, to tender my warmest thanks for the consideration uniformly shown towards me, and for the generous and unfailing support you have given to the many reforms and changes that have been inaugurated by continuous and progressive legislation in general, and our own sanitary organisation in particular, during that long period of time, and with which the credit of the Department I have had the honour to direct has been so intimately associated. It will ever remain a source of pride and satisfaction to feel that any part I may 94 have taken in sharing the burden of yearly-increasing obligations cast upon the Commissioners of Sewers in common with all other sanitary authorities, I have been sustained and supported by your repeated indulgencies in overlooking my shortcomings. In conclusion, I venture to express the hope that in the field of action to which your functions have been transferred, the same enlightened sense of responsibility may be perpetuated that has characterised the proceedings of the Commissioners of Sewers, which, whilst it has secured the most assured confidence of the citizens of London in its administration of their sanitary requirements, has earned the gratitude and applause of every thinking man within the sphere of their influence. 95 I have now laid before you the details of a somewhat busy year, and have not hesitated to point out some of the difficulties met with in the discharge of multifarious and onerous duties. In doing so I have been guided by the instructions laid down by the Local Government Board for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health, in a departmental memorandum dated December, 1897, the salient features of which are as follows, viz.: "Every Medical Officer of Health is required "to make an annual report for the year ending "the 31st December. The report is to be made "to the Sanitary Authority, and the Medical "Officer of Health himself should send a copy "of it to the Local Government Board and to "the London County Council. The Board's "copy of the report should be forwarded to them "when the original is sent to the Sanitary "Authority, except where the report is likely "to be printed by order of the Authority, when "the Board need only be supplied with a "printed copy. It is very desirable that the "Annual Report should be printed, in order 96 " that a supply of copies may be available for " distribution among the members of the " Sanitary Authority and other persons in" teres ted. " The sanitary history of the year under " review should include a record alike of the " proceedings of the Medical Officer of Health " himself and of the proceedings taken under " his direction or advice. " What has been said above with regard " to the information which an annual report " should contain must be understood, not as " suggesting that the report should be limited " to these subjects, or that more detailed or " differently arranged tabular statements may " not be added, but as indicating the sort of " information required by the Board's Order. " Many Medical Officers of Health will doubt" less, with great advantage to the administra" tion of their districts, furnish much more " detailed information respecting particular " questions to which they have been led by the " circumstances of the foregoing years to devote 97 " attention, or in the investigation of which " they may have arrived at valuable con" elusions. Any information of this kind will " be appreciated by the Local Government " Board." I append hereto copy of my Annual Report as Public Analyst.

I regret to say no practical outcome has resulted from this action, and public analysts throughout the kingdom have not been relieved from the difficulties experienced since 1875,—a neglect which has naturally engendered much indifference on the part of the persons most interested in the successful suppression of the adulteration of food and drugs. It is not for me to say whether these observations apply to the Legislature or the public generally. No such reproach, however, can be levelled against Public Analysts, who have, all over the country, spared neither time nor money in formulating reforms which their practical experience of the working of the Acts convinces them are indispensably necessary for the protection of the community against fraudulent traders. Two prosecutions were instituted under the 105 Sale of Food and Drugs Act, with fines of twenty shillings and ten shillings, the costs in each case being two shillings. The New River Company's and the East London Company's water supply to the City of London have been examined from time to time. I have again to acknowledge the assistance rendered in this part of my duty by Mr. Howard B. Turner, F.I.C., Sanitary Clerk. I have the honour to be, Your obedient servant, Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland. Public Analyst for the City of London, &k., &c., &-c.

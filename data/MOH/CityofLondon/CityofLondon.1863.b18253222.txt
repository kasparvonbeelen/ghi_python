LONDON: M. Lownds, printer, 148½, fenchurch street, city. 1865. At a Meeting of the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, held at the Guildhall of the said City, on Tuesday, January 24th, 1865:— The Medical Officer of Health laid before the Court his Annual Report, which was ordered to be Printed, and a Copy to be sent to every Member of this Court, and of the Court of Common Council. JOSEPH DAW, Principal Clerk. THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE CITY OF LONDON. THE SIXTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. FOR THE YEAR 1863-64. To the Honourable the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, I beg leave to submit to you the Statistical Tables of the principal facts relating to the sanitary condition of the City, during the last twelve months; and you will observe that there have been 2,780 births, 2,900 deaths, and 1,575 marriages in the City during the year. For the first time in the last sixteen years, or as far back as my records extend, the number of deaths has this year exceeded the births; and all the numbers are greatly below the annual average for that time. In fact, the mean 6 annual proportion of births for the last ten years, has been 3,295, the deaths 2,955, and the marriages 1,698. And with respect to the marriages, it is remarkable that while the number in the Eastern division of the City has declined from an average of 549 in the year to 510, and that in the Western from 554 to 421, the proportion in the City proper has advanced from 595 to 644. The explanation of this is not apparent; but it may be said that the number of marriages in the City during the year has been in the proportion of 12.3 per 1,000 of the population in the first-named district, 15.7 in the second, and 13.9 in the third—making a general average of 13.8 for the whole City. This is but little below the common proportion (14) for the last ten years; but it is a good deal below the proportion (16.6) for the whole of England; although it should not be, considering the large excess of marriageable persons in the City population. The birth-rate also has declined from a general average of 27 per 1,000 of the population to 24.3 —the numbers for the several districts of the City being 28.3 for the Eastern Union, instead of 32.9; 27.8 for the Western, instead of 28.4; and 18.6 for the Central or City Union, instead of 21.2. In the rest of London the birth-rate is about 34 7 per 1,000 of the population, and in all England it is nearly 35 per 1,000. The birth-rate in the City, therefore, during the last year, has not only been far below the normal proportion for the country generally, but it has also been below its own proportion. The distribution of the 2,900 deaths for the year has been as follows:—1,094 were in the Eastern district, 795 in the Western, and 1,011 in the Central. These are in the proportion of 26.5 per 1,000 of the population of the first-named district, 29.7 of the second, and 21.7 of the third —making together a mean proportion of 25.3 for the whole City. In the preceding ten years the average annual mortality in the City has been only 24.2 per 1,000, and in the several unions it has ranged from 20 per 1,000 to nearly 28. In all England the proportion is but 22.1 per 1,000 of the population, and in the districts of the chief towns it is 24.3 But last year was unusually unhealthy, for the mortality in the whole of England rose from an average of 22 per 1,000 to 23.5; and in the winter quarter of the year it reached to nearly 28 per 1,000—that of the chief towns being 29.7, and of the Metropolis, 30.9. "Seldom, indeed," said the Registrar-General, in his comments on this fact, " has a winter been more fatal." Taking a retrospect of the past, I find that in 8 the case of the City, there have been but three occasions during the last ten years, when the mortality has been so high. The cause of this remarkable increase of the death-rate is only to be found in the singularly dry condition of the atmosphere during many months of the year; for not only has there been less rain than usual, in the proportion of 17.24 inches instead of 23.27 for the whole year, but the average degree of atmospheric humidity has been but 77 instead of 80, and the number of wet days has been only 147 instead of 169. And besides this, the temperature of the air has been fully a degree below the average. It would seem, therefore, that frequent showers of rain are beneficial in clearing the atmosphere of impurities, and in keeping it in a normal state of humidity. As regards the ages at death, the principal facts are recorded in Table IV. of the Appendix; and it will be noticed that 37 per cent, of all the deaths in the year have been among children of less than five years of age, and of these about half have died in the first year of infancy. In other words, there have been 2,780 births in the City during the year, and there have been 517 deaths of children less than a year old; so that rather more than 18 per cent., or about 1 in 6 of all the children born have died in the first year of their 9 existence. The average proportion during the last ten years has been about 17 per cent., and in all England it is just 18 per cent., and in France it is rather more than 21 per cent. The infant mortality in the City, therefore, although large, is not in excess of the common proportion elsewhere, and it is much below the mortality in France. One of the most striking facts in the table of deaths according to age, is the increase in the mortality of persons at from 55 to 75 years of age. In the preceding ten years, with nearly the same total mortality at all ages, the annual number of deaths among persons at from 55 to 65 years of age has been but 289, whereas in the last year it was 815; and at from 65 to 75 the number has advanced from 282 to 292. This increase has been almost entirely among males; and the mortality at the first ages has been 57 per 1,000 of the living, and at the last 110. In former years the mortality of males in the City at from 55 to 65 years of age has been only 48 per 1,000, and at from 65 to 75, 99 per 1,000 In all England the death-rate at these ages is 32 per 1,000, and 66; and in France it is but 29 and 65: so that the strain upon a City life is very unmistakably manifested at the ages of from 55 to 75. It would seem too, from the gradual increase in the mortality at these ages, that the strain is becoming more 10 severe, year by year; and it is probably the result of that intensity of mental labour which the growing activity of commerce demands. Among the females at those ages, the death-rate is not remarkably excessive, for it ranges from 37 per 1,000 at the first period to 80 at the last—the averages for England and France being about 28 and 60. With respect to the causes of death, there has been a slight increase in the mortality from phthisis, and a decrease in that from tabes and hydrocephalus. Inflammatory affections of the lungs have also declined from a general average of 503 in the year to 452; and with regard to the zymotic class of disease, although they have advanced from 624 to 612, yet some of them, as continued fever, whooping-cough, and the diarrhoea of adults, have been less severe than usual, while scarlet-fever, measles, and the diarrhœa of children have been more than commonly fatal; and here I may remark that the chief increase in the mortality from phthisis has been in the winter quarter, that of measles in spring and summer, that of infantile diarrhoea in summer, and that of scarlet-fever in autumn. Looking at the principal facts on record during the last ten years, it would seem that these diseases are more prevalent and fatal at certain seasons of the year than at others. Thus, the largest mortality from phthisis and hydrocephalus is during the cold and 11 changeable weather of winter and spring; while the period for the greatest activity of tabes and scrofula, the other members of the tubercular class, is summer and autumn. And so also of zymotic diseases, there is the greatest difference in their manifestations of power at different seasons: scarlatina, for example, is most virulent in autumn, and least so in winter. The same is the case with continued fever, and with measles, and with the diarrhœa of adults. But the diarrhœa of infants is most fatal in summer—so much so, that of a total number of 80 deaths in the year, 65 occur in the summer quarter, and these mostly in the hot months of August and September. On the other hand, there are some forms of zymotic disease which are most virulent in the colder months of the year. This is so with small-pox, which is by far more fatal in the mild weather of spring and early summer than at any other time; and so also of whooping-cough, croup, and erysipelas, which arc especially the zymotics of winter. The explanation of this is not altogether clear; indeed, there is much to be done in the classification of these facts before any notion can be formed of the laws which govern the manifestations of these diseases. That, however, which we do perceive is, that whensoever the start is given to any one of them, it is more likely to run into an epidemic, 12 and to become seriously virulent at certain seasons than at others—phthisis, for example, is most fatal in winter, hydrocephalus in spring, and tabes and scrofula in summer; and each form of zymotic disease has its special season of activity. And lastly, with regard to the ages at which these diseases are most severe, it appears from the returns of the last ten years, that the greatest sufferers from small-pox, pneumonia, and diarrhoea, are infants of less than a year old—that in fact more than half of the total mortality from these diseases is among infants of that age. The deaths from measles are most numerous at from 1 to 2 years of age, and then from 2 to 5. Scarlatina shows the largest mortality at from 2 to 5 years of age, and the smallest at less than a year; but whooping-cough is almost equally fatal at each period of infant life. Some of these facts are easy of interpretation. The child is very susceptible of the morbific influences which hang about the filthy and overcrowded dwellings of the poor; and in summer time, when these influences are brought into a state of great activity by the putrefying action of warmth, the child falls a victim to diarrhœa; or its vital powers are so depressed that it succumbs to an attack of measles or scarlet-fever; or it more 13 slowly perishes by tabes or scrofula. It is manifest, too, that the young infant is very susceptible of an attack of small-pox; and this indicates the necessity for early vaccination. As to the greater mortality from scarlet-fever at the ages of from 2 to 5, it is evident that it arises from the circumstance that children are then first associated at play and in school, and are thus unusually exposed to infection. Lastly, the statistics show us that all the exanthematous diseases are most virulent in the haunts of the very poorest classes, where there is not merely a total disregard of the commonest decencies of life, but where the necessitous over-crowding of members of the same family encourages the spread of disease by intensifying the virus, by bringing the healthy into contact with the sick, and by so lowering the vital powers as to render the system very susceptible of attack, and less able to endure the effects of it. Nor is it alone in the manifestations of zymotic disease that this unwholesome state of things exhibits itself. The mephitic atmosphere of the dirty and over-crowded dwellings of the poor acts slowly on the nutritive functions of the body, and engenders a strumous condition, which ere long shows itself in scrofula, tabes—mesenterica, and hydrocephalus, or in the early symptoms of pulmonary consumption. All this is seen in the 14 pallid look of the child, and in the sickly condition of the parent, and in the longing for artificial stimulants. How to improve this, and to make the homes of the poor consistent with physical and moral wellbeing is one of the most serious questions of the day. Already, in the course of the last twenty years, much has been done for the improvement of the dwellings of the industrial classes; and the efforts of many societies, as the Labourers' Friend Society, the Metropolitan Association, the Marylebone Association, the Parochial Association, the Strand Building Company, the Improved Industrial Dwellings Company, as well as the labours of the late Prince Consort, Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Kinnaird, Miss Burdett Coutts, Mr. Barry, Mr.Newson, Mr. Gibbs, Mr. Hilliard, and more recently those of Mr. Alderman Waterlow, the Trustees of the Peabody Gift, and the Corporation of London, have been devoted either to the improvement of existing houses occupied by the industrial poor, or in the construction of model dwellings, with every appliance for health and convenience. But although about 2,500 tenements have, in this way, been provided, capable of accommodating as many families, and also nearly 1,000 lodgings for single men, yet the result is insignificant in comparison with the work which is yet to be done. Besides which, the houses in question are only suited for the better and the decent class of 15 sans; they are not fitted for the accommodation of the very poorest of unskilled labourers. And here there is work of no ordinary difficulty for the philanthropist; for at present the denizens of the worst districts of the City are so little accustomed to the comforts of a decent home, that their habits are but little removed from those of the untutored savage, and all our efforts at sanitary improvement are frustrated by ignorance and carelessness. Every sanitary appliance is abused, water butts and cisterns are broken, pipes and taps stolen, drains purposely stopped up, closets intentionally fouled, and the dust and refuse of the house cast into every out of the way corner. It is, indeed, almost impossible to deal with this condition of things; and there is little or no hope for any permanent improvement, until there is an education of this class of tenantry, to a better use of sanitary appliances; and this can only be done through the example of better homes and more considerate landlords. The sickness returns among the poor have not been so numerous as usual during the year. Altogether, there have been 10,187 cases of illness attended by the medical officers of the City unions, the average number per annum for the last four years being 11,486. The most important ailments 16 have been—fever, 795; diarrhoea, 530; and smallpox, 110—all of which have been the subjects of special sanitary investigation. The meteorology of the year is shown in Table VII. of the Appendix; and, as usual, the facts have been deduced from observations at Guildhall by Mr. Haywood. The mean temperature of the year has been 50 8 degrees Fahr., which is about one degree below the average; and the range has been from 22.1 degrees in January, to 78.5 degrees in July and August. While, too, the temperature has been less than usual, the humidity of the air has been under the average. The mean proportion of it for the whole year has been rather less than 77 degrees of saturation; the range having been from only 63 degrees in July, to 93 in November— in fact, the mean proportion of moisture in the atmosphere during the whole of the summer months, was barely 66 degrees of saturation, or scarcely 4 grains of aqueous vapour in a cubic foot of air. This was due to the remarkably small proportion of rain in these months—a proportion that amounted to only about 3.5 inches in the course of all the summer months; and so dry was the atmosphere that the rain gauges upon the roof of Guildhall showed a larger quantity of rain than those on the ground—the difference being 17 due to the evaporation of the rain in the act of falling. In consequence of this absence of wet, the river was charged during the summer and autumn with a large proportion of saline matter. As early as the end of May it contained as much as 124 grains of solid matter per gallon, the average proportion in a normal state of the river being but 24 grains; and by the end of August the quantity of impurity had risen to 386 grains per gallon; nearly the whole of this was saline matter from the ocean, the flow of the stream having being upwards instead of downwards; but with this saline matter there was also brought up a large proportion of sewage, the quantity of organic matter (chiefly of sewage) being 43 grains per gallon. It was fortunate that the weather was unusually cold during the whole of that time, and therefore the river did not become offensive from putrefactive decomposition, but if the temperature of the water had risen to 68 or 69 degrees, as it did in the summers of 1858 and 1859, the effects of it would no doubt have been seriously unpleasant. That which keeps down the offensiveness of the river during the summer time is either a low temperature or a copious rain-fall; and it is manifest, from the experience which has been gained from the regular examination of the water of the river during the c 18 last six years, that there are periods of many months duration in every year when, from the evaporation of the water and the small supply from above, the flow of the stream is not downwards, but upwards ; and that at such times the sewage discharged into the river, even so low down as the present out-falls, will flow upwards to a distance far above the City bridges. If at these times the temperature of the water rises above (36 degrees Fahr. and the rain-fall is less than usual, the river will undoubtedly become offensive, unless some means are taken for the defecation of the sewage before it is discharged into the river at the new out-falls. I have brought this under your notice on several occasions, because I believe it to be a matter of very great public importance. The last point to which I would direct your attention is, that during the year there have been 7,429 inspections of houses for sanitary purposes, and 3,301 visits to the common Lodging-houses of the City. These have resulted in the issuing of 3,091 orders for sanitary improvement. And with regard to the inspections of the Markets and Slaughter-houses, the officers have condemned 229,180 lbs., or upwards of 102 tons of meat as unfit for human food; and of this quantity 19 96,779 lbs. were diseased, and 43,497 lbs. were from animals that had died from natural causes. The quantity of meat condemned during the last year is greatly in excess of that of former years, the average quantity being but 154,003 lbs. yearly ; and this excess is chiefly in the proportion of meat from animals that have died of disease. The amount of this kind of meat has been nearly doubled during the year; and it indicates the necessity for the severest treatment of those who have consigned such meat to the City Markets. In the course of the year there have been twenty legal prosecutions and convictions of such offenders, namely, nine at the Old Bailey, and eleven before the Justices at Guildhall and the Mansion-house; and the penalty has ranged from a fine of ten shillings and costs, to fifty pounds and twelve months imprisonment. Besides the meat thus condemned in the City Markets, there have also been condemned at Billingsgate by the Meters of the Fishmonger's Company, upwards of 774,000 fish, chiefly whiting, plaice, herrings, haddocks, gurnets, dabs and dace; and 1,264 lbs. of eels, 9,572 gallons of shrimps, and 120 bushels of whelks and winkles; all of which have been destroyed. c 2 20 Finally, I have to state that the bakehouses of the City, 139 in number, have been periodically inspected; and that orders have been issued, when necessary, for their sanitary improvement in accordance with the provisions of the Bakehouses Regulation Act of 1860.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HE ALT F0R THE YEAR 1908. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., 16th March, 1909. Gentlemen, In conformity with the requirements of the Local Government Board, i have the honour to present my ninth Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. During four months of the year Dr. Herbert Williams acted as Medical Officer of Health, and I would specially direct attention to an investigation made by him into the danger of rat virus (see p. 24). The improvement that has taken place in the sanitary circumstances of the City of London during the last sixty years is remarkable. One has only to read of the deplorable conditions under which the poorer citizens lived in the day of the pioneer sanitary reformer, the late Sir John Simon— the first Medical Officer of Health of the City of London—and compare the state of things then obtaining with those now existing, to be able to appreciate the growth of reform. Thus, in .1849, reporting on house drainage, Sir John stated: "So far as I can calculate from very imperfect materials, I should "conjecture that some thousands of houses within the City still have "cesspools connected with them. It requires little medical knowledge to "understand that animals will scarcely thrive in an atmosphere of their "own decomposing excrements ; yet such, strictly and literally speaking, "is the air which a very large proportion of the inhabitants are "condemned to breathe." "In the City of London, the supply of water is a fraction of what it "should be. Thousands of the population have no supply of it to the "houses where they dwell. For their possession of the first necessity of "social life, such persons wholly depend on their power of attending at "some fixed hour of the day, pail in hand, beside the nearest stand.cock, "where, with their neighbours, they wait their turn—sometimes not "without a struggle, during the tedious dribbling of a single small "pipe." 10 Again, in referring to the conditions then prevailing in tenement houses, he wrote:— "It is no uncommon thing in a room 12 ft. square or less to find three "or four families styed together (perhaps with infectious diseases among "them) filling the same space night and day—men, women and children "in the promiscuous intimacy of cattle. Of these inmates, it is nearly "superfluous to observe that in all offices of nature they are gregarious "and public ; that every instinct of personal or sexual decency is stifled ; "that every nakedness of life is uncovered there. Who can wonder at "what becomes, physically or morally, of infants begotten and born in "these bestial crowds!" Happilv, with the advance of sanitary science and stricter supervision entailed by the passing of successive statutory measures for the protection of the public health, such a state of things as those referred to above is no longer possible, but there is little doubt that in years to come, sanitarians, in referring to the present time, will take those responsible for modern conditions seriously to task for not having made greater progress than they have in sanitary improvements. Fortunately, the old festina lente idea with regard to such matters is out of favour owing to increased knowledge and the pressure of public opinion, and almost every year the Statute Book is inscribed with fresh measures for the improvement of the public health. The citizens have willingly borne the enormous expense incurred in building new thoroughfares, widening streets, demolishing unhealthy areas, and the erection and maintenance of dwellings for the working classes. In no place at the present day is the public cleansing work more thoroughly carried out, or the wants of women with regard to sanitary accommodation better provided for. The year under review has been one of considerable activity, and has been marked by the introduction of several important statutory measures. The two most notable instances being the Regulations controlling imported food stuffs made under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, and the compulsory notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (Phthisis or Consumption) by Poor Law Medical Officers. Other new Statutory Powers that should be mentioned are the "Children Act," the "Notification of Births Act," the "London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908 "[giving the City additional Sanitary powers], and the "Old Age Pensions Act," the latter being of interest as indicating whether it will lead to increased longevity amongst aged persons or otherwise. With the exception of the last, all these measures throw increased responsibilities upon sanitary authorities and their staffs. In treating of sanitary legislation, the Bill promoted by the Corporation this Session will be much welcomed by the citizens and the general public, as 11 it will probably lead to the saving of many valuable lives due to the better regulation of street traffic, and therefore less danger to pedestrians in crossing the roadways. The discovery of the cause of a remarkable outbreak of illness referred to on page 24, as having been due to the use of a bacteriological preparation for destroying mice, is an excellent example of the utility of bacteriology in etiological investigations. No community can dwell under proper sanitary circumstances unless the water supply is satisfactory, but while the citizens have no reason to take exception to the quality of the water sold to them by the Metropolitan Water Board, they complain bitterly of the charges levied on them for an indispensable element. This feeling has stimulated many property owners to secure release from what they consider an unfair taxation by sinking wells. A considerable number of artesian wells have consequently recently been sunk in the City, and more are under construction. The matter is one of considerable importance. A great deal of information has therefore been collected during the year, and a summary of the same will be laid before you at a later date. At present I will confine myself to the statement that in every instance the supply from these wells has been certified by your Public Analyst as being of excellent quality. As in other years special attention has been given to the character of the food supplies in the City. The supervision of the quality of meat and other food products passing through the Corporation Markets entails very heavy responsibilities, and these have been further increased by the issue by the Local Government Board of the Regulations previously referred to. It is satisfactory to find that occasions for taking proceedings against persons for sending unwholesome meat to the markets and elsewhere in the City are becoming less frequent, the heavy penalties meted out to offenders doubtless acting as a deterrent. During my first year of office there were twelve such prosecutions, whilst there were only four and five during 1907 and 1908 respectively. It will be seen that the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts have been actively administered as heretofore, and any laxity in this respect would certainly lead to a great deal more adulteration than now obtains. The Contaminated Milk question as in previous years has been fully considered. It is clear, from the results of the examination of the series of samples referred to on page 29, that the matter is of the gravest importance. Legislation for dealing with this matter, of the kind promoted year after year by individual authorities, is costly, ill.contrived, and unsatisfactory. It behoves the Government, therefore, to fulfil their pledge to promote general legislation for dealing with the milk supply at the earliest possible moment. 12 AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 672.7 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1051 square miles, equal to a square of 1.0252 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 10.81 miles to a side. DENSITY (1908).

No Imperial Day Census has yet been taken. ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London was £44,332,025 on 6th April, 1908—whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London, including Temples, was £5,451,820, or nearly one.eighth of the whole County. POPULATION. The undermentioned figures are abstracted from the Registrar.General's Report, dated 30th December, 1901, on the Census of England and Wales, 1901 (County of London). Area. Statute Acres. Inhabited Houses. Population. 1891. 1901. 1891. 1901. City of London 672.7 5,340 3,865 37,702 26,923 For Registration, Parliamentary and Municipal purposes the boundaries of the City are co.terminous. These figures represent the population on the night of the 1st April, 1891 and 1901, exclusive of sub.district of Glasshouse Yard (see note on page 14). A Day Census—the number of persons actively engaged in the City during the daytime—has been taken on three occasions, viz., in 1866, 1881, and 1891. It is to be regretted that no Day enumeration was made in the City during the last Imperial Census year. *This figure refers only to persons "actively engaged in the City during the daytime." The actual number of people visiting the City daily is probably nearly 1,500,000. 13 It is a matter of considerable importance that during the next Census Year, viz., 1911, when the Imperial Night Census will be taken, the Corporation should follow the course adopted in the years 1866, 1881 and 1891, and have an enumeration made of the persons actively engaged in the City during the daytime. The City is frequently alluded to by those who desire to belittle its importance as one square mile only, with a decreasing and insignificant population. In this connection the following observations contained in the Report of your Committee, on the occasion of the taking of the Day Census in 1866, may be quoted :— "The Imperial Census taken decennially under the authority of "Parliament, affords no indication whatever of the actual population of "the City, and every recurring Census only leads further astray in this "respect. That Census is gathered for the sake of convenience while "the population is sleeping, and affords in almost every other district a "fair indication of the actual number of the inhabitants ; but owing to "the peculiar and exceptional nature of the City population, and the "circumstances of those who there carry on their business, it so happens "that the Census taken by the Imperial Government omits from enumeration in the City the very class of persons whose trade, wealth, "and enterprise make the City what in fact it is—the greatest, most "crowded, and wealthiest commercial emporium to be foupd in the " world." As your adviser in sanitary matters, I will go even further than this in advocating a Day Census. No one can fail to be impressed by the apparently ceaseless stream of persons, morning and evening, flowing and ebbing, to and from the precincts of the City like a human tide. When it is remembered that the Corporation as a Sanitary Authority are responsible for the hygienic environment of this multitude during their daily sojourn within the area under their charge, it will be seen that in comparing the value of their administration with other places—where the conditions are entirely different—it is essential that the number of persons for whose well.being during their working hours the Corporation takes such an active interest, should be officially ascertained. The matter is now referred to, as should the Corporation entertain the suggestion here made as to taking a Day Census in 1911, the consideration of the matter should not be deferred, as considerable time is required to make the necessary arrangements lor carrying out the undertaking in a reliable and tactful manner. I may add that the cost of taking the last Day Census in the City was £1,350. 14 CENSUS RETURNS. Tear. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population. 1861 112,063 . 1866 — 170,133 1871 75,983 — 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 . For statistical purposes, in the following pages the "Registration" District is referred to when speaking of the "City." This consists of two sub.districts, together containing a population of at the middle of 1908, calculated on the last Census Returns:— *St. Botolph 6,122 tSt. Sepulchre and Allhallows 13,130 Total 19,252 The Night population, therefore, of the City of London Registration District at the middle of 1908 is taken at 19,252, and it is upon this figure that all vital statistics in this Report have been calculated. The Day population at the middle of 1908 was estimated at 385,640‡ persons. A Day Census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. In 1903 it was ascertained that in the week ending 19th July no less than 347,463 vehicles passed to and from the four City bridges, viz.:—London, Southwark, Blackfriars and Tower, equivalent to upwards of 18,000,000 vehicles per annum. BIRTHS. During the year 1908, 277 births were registered in the City. The annual birth rate was at the rate of 14.4 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 14.2 per 1,000. The birth rates last year in the Sub.Districts were— St. Botolph 20.2 per 1,000. St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 11.6 „ In the Metropolis the birth rate in 1908 was 25.2 per 1,000. This decline in the birth rate has been in operation in this country since 1876, and is common to nearly all European countries. *At the date of the last Census, this District included the "civil parish" of Glasshouse Yard. The parish was transferred to the Holborn Union by the Local Government Board Order, No. 43156, which came into operation on 29th September, 1901, and to the Registration District of Holborn (Finsbury Sub.District) on 1st January, 1902, making the Registration District of London City co.extensive with the Municipal City of London. All the Registration Districts in London are co.extensive with the Poor.Law Parishes or Unions except the District of Folham. † On the 1st April, 1901, the Middle Temple was transferred from the Strand Sub.District to St. Sepulchre Sub.District. ‡ This figure is based upon the assumption that the number of persons residing, occupied or employed within the City during the active hours of the day has increased at the same rate since the last Day Census in 1891 that it did between that and the previous Day Census in 1881. 15 VACCINATION. Of the children born in 1908, 168 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 27 had died before the age for vaccination, and 2 were insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 11 cases, 36 had removed into other districts, and 24 vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 13 cases of conscientious objection. The Public Vaccinators performed 1,393 re.vaccinations during the year. Vaccination Statistics in the City or London. Year. Number of Births.

It will be seen that the number of conscientious objectors has largely increased. This is doubtless due to the Vaccination Act of 1907, which is a direct encouragement to persons not to protect their children from the risk attending an attack of small.pox. MORTALITY. During the year under review, 899 deaths were registered in the District, including *712 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table, p. 20, for details. Deducting the latter 187 deaths remain, to which must be added .56 persons who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered. The mortality, therefore, from which the City death rate is calculated is 243. The death rate for 1908 was 12.6 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 12.7), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 13.8. * These deaths occurred in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the Union Depôt, Thavies Inn. 16 Death Rates, per 1,000 per Annum.

The death rate from zymotic disease per 1,000 of the population was .15 compared with 1.35 in the Metropolis. Infantile Mortality. The deaths of children under one year of age to 1,000 births were 65, against 113 for the whole of London. The Table of infantile mortality on p. 17 shows the deaths of children under one year arranged according to monthly age periods. From this it will be seen that no less than 44 per cent. of these deaths occurred in the first month, 55 per cent. within the first three months, and 72 per cent. during the first six months of existence. Deaths in City Institutions. During 1908, 56 persons died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries, or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 23.0 per cent. of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis (1907) being 22.3 per cent.

The total number of cases of "dangerous infectious disease" was therefore 90, as compared with 140 for the previous year. The total number of cases of Scarlet Fever reported was less than half that of 1907.

In each case a detailed examination was made of the sanitary condition of the premises where infectious cases occurred, and a summary of defects found by the District Inspector is given on page 58. SHELTER FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION DURING DISINFECTION. The Shelter in Golden Lane, Barbican, provided in accordance with Sec. 60 (4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which enacts that "sanitary "authorities shall provide free of charge temporary shelter or house "accommodation with necessary attendants for the members of any family 23 "in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, for the purpose of "enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the sanitary authority," has been visited by eight families during the year. They numbered 19 persons, of whom 13 were adults and 6 were children, and who were housed during the disinfection of their houses after:— Scarlet Fever 5 families. Diphtheria 2 „ 7 families. Three families came from homes consisting of three rooms, and four of two rooms. One other family of three persons was also received at the Shelter during disinfection of their residence on account of vermin. 24 OUTBREAK OF ILLNESS CAUSED BY USE OF VERMIN-DESTROYING VIRUS. In July last an outbreak of illness occurred at a large business establishment where a considerable number of persons of both sexes are employed. Between the 18th and 22nd of that month twelve men became seriously ill, the symptoms being severe headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, cramp in the abdomen, giddiness, with severe collapse in many cases. These were accompanied with fever, with high temperature, and the patients looked, and were, extremely ill. The severe symptoms lasted about forty.eight hours, but each case recovered and was practically convalescent at the end of the week. The distinguishing features of the illness indicating infection by some bacteriological poison, portions of the stools of three of the patients were sent to Dr. Klein for examination, who found a bacillus predominating in each specimen, which he regarded as unquestionably the cause of the illness. Enquiries into the supply of food showed that the whole of the staff, mals and female, were supplied with similar food, cooked and prepared in a common kitchen. There was one noticeable fact, viz.: all the patients had dined in the same room, and no person that dined in either of the four other dining rooms was attacked. In the course of the investigation an offensive smell was noticed in the dining room used by the patients, and on the removal of some of the floor boards the dead bodies, more or less decomposed, of a large number of mice were found. It was then ascertained that a much-advertised virus for the destruction of rodents had been used in this room and in the pantry adjoining. The virus had been laid about on pieces of bread, and it is easy to conceive that mice eating the poison might carry the contagion about on their feet to the floors, shelves, chairs, tables and plates, and thus it could infect human beings dining in this room. The virus used was stated in the advertisement to cause a fatal contagious disease amongst rodents, but to be harmless to domestic animals and human beings. A tube of this material—the "Liverpool" Virus for Mice, Field Mice, &c., was purchased and submitted to Dr. Klein, who made an exhaustive series of experiments, which proved conclusively that the organisms found in the stools of the patients was identical with the organisms of the virus. 25 The following table shows the cultural character of the microbe, S. 1, found in the patients' stools, compared with other organisms:— Nature of Test.

Dr. Klein remarks that : "The culture of Liverpool virus was used for studying and comparing it with the "other microbes isolated from the stools and for agglutination test. As will be seen "from the Table, there is a distinct similarity in cultural respects between microbe "S. No. 1 and the Liverpool microbe. A difference between the two microbes, "viz., S. 1 and Liverpool virus appears in respect of agglutination, since the former "agglutinated in a marked manner with convalescent's blood, whereas the latter "showed under the same conditions a feeble reaction only. As a further important "point it ought to be stated that the microbe, isolated in great numbers from the "blood of an injected guinea-pig, proved, in cultural respects, as also in respect "of agglutination, the same as the microbe S. 1. "Subcutaneous injection of ¼ c.c. of broth culture (24 hours old) of the Liverpool "virus into a large guinea-pig caused extensive gelatinous necrotic swelling in "groin, abdomen and chest, the animal after 40 hours being quiet, off feed and very "ill. Exactly the same result was obtained in a companion large guinea-pig " injected with ¼ c.c. of broth culture of microbe S. 1." Dr. Klein made some further comparative experiments which he considered proved conclusively the identity of the two microbes (viz., S. 1, from a patient's stool, and the "Liverpool" virus). 26 With regard to another largely advertised virus, viz., the "Danysz," Dr. Klein has demonstrated its identity with the Bacillus enteritides Gaertner, and expressed the following opinion on the subject:— " The identity of the two microbes—B. Danysz and B. Gaertner—has been " confirmed also by the following experiments (Transactions, Pathological Society, " 1902, p. 243):—(a) Guinea-pigs immunised by B. Danysz were found immune " against B. Gaertner; (b) guinea-pigs immunised by B. Gaertner were found " immune against B. Danysz; (c) blood serum of guinea-pigs immunised by B. Danysz " agglutinates equally well an emulsion of B. Danysz and of B. Gaertner; (d) blood " serum of guinea-pigs immunised by B. Gaertner agglutinates equally well an " emulsion of B. Gaertner and of B. Danysz. Recently I have carried out the '' same experiments with rabbits. A rabbit was immunised by repeated injections of " sub-fatal doses of living B. Danysz, a second rabbit by repeated injections of sub" fatal doses of living B. Gaertner. The blood serum of both animals was then " tested on emulsions of B. Danysz and of B. Gaertner, and was found to " agglutinate emulsions of both microbes equally well. " I therefore consider that both microbes are identical. " Considering that acute gastro-enteritis or some forms of it have been shown to " have been caused by the eating of meat (beef, pork) contaminated with the B. " Gaertner, it seems rather a risky thing to follow the recommendation of the " Danysz Company, printed on their advertisements, viz., to spread about in meat " stores and the like, cultures of the B. Danysz, with the object of destroying rats : " for it might happen that while the intended rat destruction fails, the meat pollution " and subsequent human infection might succeed." Further samples of bacterial rat poisons sold in the City were purchased and sent to the City Bacteriologist for examination. These were:— (i) " Ratin No. 1."—Obtained from the Ratin Laboratory, No. 17, Gracechurch Street. Referred to in Report as Ratin No. 1. (ii) " Ratin No. 2."—Obtained from same source. Referred to in Report as Ratin No. 2. (iii) "Ready Rat Relief."—Obtained from the Ready Rat Relief Virus Co., No. 23, Paternoster Square. Referred to in Report as Rat Virus No. 3. As the result of his examination of these three samples, Dr. Klein came to the following conclusions :— " From these experiments it follows that all these viruses are culturally and " morphologically closely related and belong to the group of bacteria which are " included in the group of "Paratyphoid," to which belong the Paratyphoid bacteria 27 " proper, the Danysz bacillus, Gaertner bacillus, the two microbes reported on " recently, viz., Seeker microbe and Liverpool virus. The close relation of the rat " virus microbes Ratin 1, Ratin 2 and Rat Viras 3 is also indicated by the fact that " an emulsion in broth of a recent gelatine culture, or a twenty-four hours broth " culture of either microbes Ratin 1, Ratin 2 and Rat Virus 3 are readily agglutinated " —almost instantly—by blood serum of a rabbit immunised with Secker microbe " or with blood serum of a rabbit immunised with Liverpool virus. It is clear from " this that at least a "group relation" exists between all these. It should be pointed out that the makers and sellers of vermin-destroying virus themselves seem to be somewhat uncertain with regard to the action of these preparations upon the human subject. In the case of the "Ready Rat Relief Virus" the directions for use state: " There need be no hesitation in using the fingers when preparing the bait, but " they should be free from wounds or sores." (The words in italics being printed in heavy black type.) The tins of Ratin No. 1, Ratin No. 2, and a bottle of " Liquid Ratin," bear the following instructions:—" The bacteria is harmless to human beings and " to all domestic animals, but it should be placed out of the reach of children " and sucking calves. Wash your hands after use." Again, the directions for use issued with the Danysz Virus also contain the words: "There need be no hesitation in using the fingers when preparing " the bait, but they should be free from wounds or sores. The virus has a " great advantage in being absolutely harmless to other animals." A bottle containing "Liquid Ratin," purchased at the Ratin Laboratory of No. 17, Gracechurch Street, was also sent to Dr. Klein, who reported as under:— “ From all these facts the conclusion is justified that ' Liquid Ratin ' contains “ microbes belonging to the paratyphoid group, fatal for mice, and as might be “ expected, distinctly pathogenic also for another rodent (guinea-pig). “ I should like to draw your attention to a paragraph printed on the label of “ the bottle of the ' Liquid Ratin,' which runs thus :— ' By experiments (sic.) it has been shown that the bacteria is harmless to ' human beings and to all domestic animals, but it should be placed out of the ' reach of children and sucking calves. Wash your hands after use.' “ It is not quite clear what is meant ' By experiments it has been shown' that “ the stuff is harmless to human beings, but it is, on the other hand, clear that the “ sellers of the material are not sure that it is not harmful to children, or that “ by contaminating human hands may not cause mischief." 28 In presenting these facts to the Sanitary Committee your Medical Officer pointed out that it is claimed that the use of each of these viruses brings about the same result, viz., the destruction of rodents and also that they are innocuous to domestic animals and human beings. As these claims, however, cannot be substantiated, it is extremely undesirable and even dangerous that they should be allowed to be sold and purchased by any person. If they are to be used they should be placed about with the greatest precaution and under skilled supervision. The Sanitary Committee directed a copy of your Medical Officer's Report to be sent, together with the Report of Dr. Klein's bacteriological examination, to the Local Government Board urging the desirability—in the public interest—of putting restrictions upon the sale of such poisons to members of the general public. In view of the above it may be interesting to quote a statement made in the House of Commons on the 4th November last in reply to the following question:— Mr. Ridsdale asked the President of the Local Government Board “ If his “ attention had been called to the report of Dr. Collingridge, Medical Officer “ of Health for the City of London, to the effect that a vermin poison, “ advertised as harmless to human beings but as disseminating bacteriological “ diseases to rodents, has caused serious illness to many persons ; and whether, “ in view of the danger to the public of the unrestricted sale of such poisons, “ he will consider the desirability of placing restrictions upon their sale." The President of the Local Government Boardreplied that the administration of the Acts relating to the sale of poisons rested with the Privy Council, and he would communicate with the Lord President. Full details of Dr. Klein's analyses of these viruses are given in the Medical Officer of Health's Reports, Nos. 116, 117 and 118. 29 CONTAMINATED MILK. The investigation into the character of the milk arriving in London for delivery to dealers in the City, which was commenced in 1902, and repeated in the years 1904, 1905 and 1906, was continued during 1907. Notwithstanding the strong feeling that has been aroused amongst all classes with regard to the importance of milk supplies being delivered under such conditions as to ensure freedom from contamination, the result of the several investigations of the milk supply of the City shows, that unless it is made obligatory upon farmers and others sending milk to town to take reasonable precautionary measures for ensuring purity, little or no improvement in this direction is likely to take place. The following are the results of the analysis of the series referred to:— 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907 Per cent. Per cent. Per cent. Per cent. Fairly clean and pure 48.7 68.2 80 54.2 Unclean 43.6 22.7 12 37.5 Tuberculous 7.7 9.1 8 8.3 With regard to tuberculous milk found in the last series, it will be seen there has been little variation in the percentage found. As in former years, in each case where the milk was found to be tuberculous, action was taken to ascertain if there were any cows suffering from that disease in the herd from which the milk was derived, and in each instance the bacteriological result was confirmed. These results not only demonstrate the value of bacteriology as a medium for determining the presence or otherwise of disease in milk, but also show that practically no precautions are taken by either farmers or wholesale dealers in London to ensure that the milk they are responsible for is not a vehicle for the conveyance of tuberculosis. They further show that while the best method of dealing with the control of milk is at its actual source, viz., the farm, there is no real difficulty in getting this effectually carried out on the spot by the Local Authority, as in each of the milks reported against above, upon bringing the facts to the notice of the local medical officer of health, steps were at once taken to improve the sanitary conditions prevailing on the farm in question. This indicates that there is no necessity for any central authority wasting time and money in inspecting farms in the country where their intrusion would be resented, and when the necessary supervision of any required work would be difficult if not impossible. 30 All that is necessary is for each Urban Authority to determine the condition of milk supplied to their district, and if found unsatisfactory, to present a report forthwith to the Local Authority in which the farm is situated, and also to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. However thorough the supervision of the farm may be, there are other factors conducing to prejudicially affect the wholesomeness of milk during its journey to, and arrival at, London. These adverse conditions are brought about by:— 1.—The unsuitable type of churn generally used. 2.—The fact that in many instances the churns are returned to the farmers from London unscalded and without any effort being made by the Dairy Company to see that they are cleaned at all. 3.—The use of unlocked and unsealed churns which admit dust and other impurities; and 4.—The system of mixing at the railway stations that is adopted by the Dairy Companies. Respecting (1) the shape of the churn usually used is ill-adapted for the purpose, as it affords an easy resting place for all kinds of dirt, which can easily find its way through the ventilation holes in the lid and so into the contents of the churn, moreover it lends itself to pilfering and the addition of water. The large wholesale dealers are being urged to adopt a more rational form of railway can (of which there are several on the market), the use of which would greatly minimise the danger of contamination of milk in its journey from the cow to the consumer. With regard to (2), the Dairy Companies have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the direction of improving the existing state of things. As to (3), it is remarkable that so many farmers are under the impression that railway companies object to milk being consigned in locked churns. As a matter of fact it is clearly stated in a leaflet, No. 110, published by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, that railway companies do not object to the locking system, and make no difference in the charge for such conveyance. An erroneous impression also prevails amongst the uninformed that milk readily sours in a closely-covered receptacle, whereas it has been ascertained that milk—if properly cooled after being drawn—will keep better in a closely-covered receptacle. With regard to (4) unfortunately, after all due precautions are taken, the effects of such are often absolutely nullified by the filthy conditions under which the objectionable system of mixing is carried on at railway stations. 31 It would be difficult to find a more unsuitable place for storing or mixing milk, as now largely obtains, than a railway platform. Uncovered churns of milk are frequently seen standing at these places for hours at a time, in some cases for six hours. Under such conditions the contents are exposed to all the various contaminations present in the dust of a large city. Here the milk is treated with a “rouser," which has often been allowed to stand on the dirty platform, and the mixing is conducted by the operator, can in hand, plunging his naked arm in the churn and abstracting the requisite amount and transferring it to another vessel, the measure used being also placed, at intervals, on the ground. The whole process of mixing is conducted under most unsuitable surroundings, and should be prohibited. Further, it absolutely destroys the value of a warranty which can nevertheless be successfully used as a defence to any prosecution for adulteration. As the railway companies do a very large business as milk carriers, they might very fairly be expected to provide suitable accommodation at the stations, where milk can be handled under proper hygienic conditions. The London County Council (General Powers) Bill of 1908, conferred upon Local Authorities in the metropolis certain powers with regard to removing from the register or to refuse to register the names of dairymen or purveyors of milk whose premises are unsuitable for the sale of milk thereon. This is a most useful provision, it being evident that even if the strictest precautionary measures are taken in furtherance of securing milk from contamination, both on the farm and in transit to town, they will be useless unless steps are taken for ensuring that it is stored and vended under sanitary supervision. The London County Council are again (1909) seeking legislative powers to take samples of milk at railway stations in the metropolis, with a view to prevent the distribution of dirty milk. This is a doubtful method of dealing with the question. It is obvious that it would be far better to eliminate any risk of danger at the source of supply, than to adopt expedients for control after the milk has left the farm. Piecemeal legislation of this kind is not, and never will be, effective, and the only satisfactory way of dealing with the question is for the Government to proceed at once with the promised general measure, which should repeal all former legislation in respect to milk regulation, and consolidate existing statutes into one comprehensive measure dealing with the whole subject. The control of milk supplies is especially a matter that should be under the supreme authority of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, whose business it should be to see that the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders are effectively carried out by those responsible for their administration. 32 TUBERCULOUS MILK. In November last some details were published with regard to milk samples examined for tuberculosis at the Lister Institute for the London County Council, under the provisions of Part IV. of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, that became operative on 1st July, 1908. Two hundred and four samples were taken between 1st July, 1908, and 10th October, 1908, from milk carried by the following Railway Companies :— Samples taken. London and North-Western 60 Great Eastern 48 London and South-Western 60 Great Western 36 204 The examination of 92 of the above showed that 22, or 23.9 per cent., were tuberculous. Nineteen of the 22 cows supplying tuberculous milk were examined by a Veterinary Inspector, and 10 of them were reported to have tuberculous udders. These results are even more disturbing: than those found in the City. The danger of allowing such a state of things to exist is emphasised by the publication in January of this year of the Third Interim Report of the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the relation between human and animal tuberculosis, which states that: “ The presence of tubercle bacilli in the milk of cows clinically “ recognisable as tuberculous confirms the opinion we expressed in our “ Second Interim Report, that the milk of such cows must be considered “ dangerous for human beings. “ The experiments which we have carried out with regard to the “ infectivity of the faeces of tuberculous cows were dictated by knowledge “ of the fact that dirt of various kinds from cows and the cow-shed is “ almost constantly present in milk as it reaches the consumer. Cows suffering from extensive tuberculosis of the lungs must discharge “ considerable numbers of bacilli from the air passages in the act of “ coughing, and some of the bacilli thus expelled may find their way “ into the milk. But all experiments indicate that the excrement of “ cows, obviously suffering from tuberculosis of the lungs or alimentary “ canal, must be regarded as much more dangerous than the matter 33 “ discharged from the mouth or nostrils. We have found that even in “ the case of cows with slight tuberculous lesions, tubercle bacilli in “ small numbers are discharged in the faeces ; whilst as regards cows “ clinically tuberculous, our experiments show that the faeces contain “ large numbers of living and virulent tubercle bacilli." A typical case of contamination of milk with faecal matter in the manner referred to above was brought to my notice on the 6th April, 1908, when an examination of the contents of a churn of milk deposited in the doorway of a shop revealed an extraordinary quantity of filthy extraneous matter, and the general condition of the milk being so obviously unfit for human consumption, the Inspector at once seized it and conveyed it to the Guildhall, where, after examination by me, it was condemned by the sitting Magistrate. Samples of the milk were submitted to both your Bacteriologist and Public Analyst. The former reported that the sample contained a considerable amount of dirt (faeces and clumps of leucocytes), and that the result of the action of the milk upon the guineapigs injected was as follows :— " St. Bartholomew's Hospital, E.C., " April 30th, 1908. "Re MILK SAMPLE No. 4. " P. M. " Guineapig, peritoneal :— " Abscess in omentum and on Liver, pus crowded with staphylococci, " no tubercle. Guineapig, subcutaneous :— " Local abscess, pus contains, in almost pure culture, staphylococci '• pyogenes. Viscera normal. (signed) E. Klein." Dr. Teed's chemical analysis showed that the sample was that of a poor milk, but it complied with the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, although the sample was very dirty. It will be obvious that the results obtained by these experts fully justified the action of the Inspector in seizing the milk, and the Magistrate in condemning it. The wholesale dealer, as is customary in any question of dirty or unsound milk, was called upon to immediately furnish— i. A certificate from the Medical Officer of Health for the District in which the farm yielding the supply was situated as to the condition thereof, and ii. A certi6cate from a Veterinary Surgeon as to the health of the cows thereon. 34 After some delay these certificates were forthcoming, and proved conclusively that both the farm and the cows were in a perfectly satisfactory condition. It is possible that the filth found in the milk may have entered the churn during its journey from the farmer to the consumer, and this, I am sorry to say, is by no means an uncommon occurrence. If wholesale dealers would only realise the importance of safeguarding the purity of this article of diet, and the ease with which this can be accomplished by the adoption of sealed churns, then our hopes for a speedy reduction of the present rate of infantile mortality would be materialised. The summons was dismissed on technical grounds, the Magistrate holding that the milk was not in the possession of the man on whose doorway the churn was deposited. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1908. By an Order dated the 18th December, the Local Government Board, in pursuance of Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended and extended by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Public Health Act, 1896, have provided for the notification to the medical officer of sanitary authorities of pulmonary tuberculosis (phthisis or consumption) occurring amongst the inmates of Poor Law Institutions, or amongst persons under the care of district (Poor Law) medical officers. Hitherto in the City the notification of these cases by district medical officers has been voluntary, but the sanitary authorities were not armed with any powers for preventing the spread of this disease, which is, as pointed out in the Order, not only endemic, but also of an infectious character. The issue of this Order is unquestionably a step in the right direction, as it cannot fail to bring home to the public, and the poorer classes particularly, the knowledge that consumption is infectious, and that it can therefore be fought and suppressed. The following is an abstract of the main provisions of the Order which came into operation on the 1st January of this year. By Article IV the medical officer of a Poor Law Institution must, within 24 hours of recognising symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis in the case of a poor person who is an inmate of the Institution, notify the case to the medical officer of health of the sanitary district in which the person resided immediately before he enters the Institution. Article V directs similar notification is to be made in cases when a district medical officer recognises the disease in persons attended by him (i.e., outrelief patients), according to his agreement with the Guardians. 35 Under Article VI the superintending officer of a Poor Law Institution must notify the medical officer of health of the actual or intended place of destination and address at that place of any person leaving the Institution that has been the subject of notification. Article VII directs that a relieving officer must notify changes of patients' addresses to the medical officer of health of the district to which such person may move. By Article VIII notifications directed under the Order are to be paid for by the sanitary authority. The remuneration allowed to medical officers of a Poor Law Institution or a district medical officer will be at (he rate of one shilling, and in the case of a superintending officer of a Poor Law Institution or a relieving officer at the rate of threepence for every notification, but when in relation to one and the same case, two or more notifications have been sent by a Poor Law medical officer to one and the same medical officer of health, his remuneration will be sixpence for every notification after the first. Article IX provides that nothing in the regulations shall have effect so as to apply to, or to authorise anyone to put in force with respect to a person in relation to whom a notificat on has been made, any enactment which renders him, or any other person, liable to a penalty, or subject him to any restriction, prohibition, or disability affecting him or his employment, occupation, means of livelihood, or residence on the ground of his suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Subject to this qualification a sanitary authority, on the advice of their medical officer of health, may, in the case of a poor person notified as suffering from this disease:— i. “ Take all such measures or do all such things as are authorised, in “ any case of infectious disease, or of dangerous infectious disease, “ by any enactment relating to public health, and as have reference “ to the destruction and disinfection of infected articles, or to the “ cleansing or disinfecting of premises ; ii. “ Take all such measures or do all such things as are appropriate “ and necessary for the safe disposal or destruction of infectious “ material, produced and discharged, as a result of pulmonary “ tuberculosis ; and otherwise for the prevention of the spread “ of infection from any such material ; iii. “ Afford or supply all such assistance, facilities, or articles as, within “ such reasonable limits as the circumstances of the case require “ and allow, will obviate, or remove, or diminish the risk of 36 “ infection arising from the conditions affecting the use or “ occupation of any room, when used or occupied by the poor “ person as a sleeping apartment ; and iv. “ Furnish, for the use of the poor person, on loan, or otherwise, any “ appliance, apparatus, or utensil, which will be of assistance for “ the purpose of any precaution against the spread of infection." The sanitary authority, on the advice of their medical officer of health, is authorised to provide and publish or distribute in the form of placards, handbills, or leaflets, suitable summaries of information and instruction respecting pulmonary tuberculosis, and the precautions to be taken against spread of infection from that disease. The Board propose, in due course, to issue for the use of sanitary authorities and medical officers of health, a Memorandum by their medical officer, setting out the appropriate action that can be taken under the powers conferred under Article IX. referred to above. In these circumstances I advised that no action be taken by the Corporation in this direction until the receipt of the Board's Memorandum on the subject, and that in the meantime the precautionary measures for the prevention of phthisis now in operation in the City be observed as heretofore. THE SPITTING EVIL. In the Annual Report for 1907, in commenting on the nuisance created by spitting in railway carriages, attention was directed to the powers with which the railway companies are armed, under their bye-laws, for the repression of the evil. The fact that the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway Co., on 16th December last, took proceedings at Marylebone against a passenger who had been seen to spit three times upon the floor of a railway carriage, and was ordered to pay five shillings, will, it is hoped, not be without effect as a warning to those addicted to this dangerous and disgusting practice. “CARRIERS” OF ENTERIC FEVER. With a view of protecting the public from the danger arising from the discharge from hospital of patients who, although in other respects perfectly healthy, may be carriers of infection, by reason of their still passing the bacillus typhosus in their stools and urine, the following arrangements have been made by the Local Government Board in connection with cases of this kind discharged from a hospital of the Metropolitan Asylums Board. 37 PROCEDURE. Samples of stools or urine, or both, to be sent to the Lister Institute, as follows:— 1. In all cases a sample of stools, and a sample of urine, to be sent monthly daring the first six months after discharge, the first samples being sent one month after discharge from hospital. 2. If the results, on examination of the sample, all prove negative during those six months, cease sending monthly samples, but send a sample of both stools and urine at the end of the next period of six months. If these also prove negative, no more samples to be sent. 3. If, in any case, the results are positive, continue sending monthly samples of stools and urine until further notice. The necessary apparatus for taking and sending by post samples of faeces and urine have been supplied by the Lister Institute, with instructions as regards their use. 38 CREMATION. It will be interesting to note if the policy of reducing the charge made by the Corporation for cremation at Ilford, as advocated in my'Annual Report for 1907, will result in popularising in the eastern parts of the Metropolis this method of disposing of the dead. In spite of the argument so constantly advanced that cremation should become general on the ground that it is the most hygienic method of destroying a mass of corruptive material, and therefore the most rational, there is still a great deal of prejudice to be overcome from the working classes before it becomes general. The appeal to their pockets may have some effect in the desired direction. The total number of cremations in the United Kingdom is steadily increasing, and amounted to 795 during the past year. The establishments of the Cremation Society at Woking and Golders Green maintain their popularity, but a classification of the position in life of those cremated at these places, sent by the Secretary of the Society, shows that the support of the movement is chiefly on the part of the wealthier and more intellectual part of the community. No new Crematoria were established in the United Kingdom during the year, but the local authorities at Nottingham, Bournemouth and Bristol are said to be considering the question.* The Cardiff City Council is statedf to have recently discussed the question of establishing a crematorium, when it was decided to take no action in the matter, the opponents of the scheme stating that there is a deep-seated religious objection to cremation. It would be a good thing if burial clubs and benefit societies were asked to advocate cremation amongst their members, and I cannot help thinking that both the Church and the medical profession might take a more active interest than they do in forwarding the movement. The majority of crematoria have been established by municipal authorities and quasi philanthropic societies, who advocate cremation, and therefore the charges should be better adjusted so as to suit the pockets of everyone. As a rule the charges are too high to attract the bulk of the people, and it is for this reason that the Corporation have reduced the inclusive charge for cremation from 41. 4s. to 3/. 3s. This fee includes all attendance after the body is placed on the catafalque table by the undertakers, the services of a clergyman if required, a plain urn for the remains, storage of the latter for three months. Failing the removal of the remains by the relatives within three months, they will be decently interred in land adjoining the Crematorium reserved for this purpose. * " Transactions of the Cremation Society of England for 1908." f " Lancet" 13/2/09. 39 The Cremation Society of England, the pioneers of cremation in this country, have also found it advisable to modify their rules. There is no disguising the fact that the religious objection is very slow in dying out, in spite of the decline of materialistic interpretation of Christian teaching. Again, the general public are not aware that religious rites are applicable to the burning as well as to the burial of bodies, and it is well to make more widely known sec. 11 of the Cremation Act, 1902, which provides that in the case of refusal by "the incumbent of any ecclesiastical parish to perform a " funeral service before, at, or after cremation, any Clerk in Holy Orders of " the Established Church, not being prohibited under ecclesiastical censure, " may, with the permission of the Bishop, and at the request of the executor " of the deceased person, or of the burial authority or other person having " charge of the cremation or interment of the cremated remains, perform such " service within such ground." It will be seen, therefore, that cremation does not in any way interfere with the religious routine of Christian burial. In reply to a circular letter sent to the Superintendents of the several Crematoria in the United Kingdom inviting their views with regard to the progress cf cremation, the following observations may be quoted:— The Honorary Secretary of the Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society, Glasgow, referring to the diminishing number of cremations at some places, states that :— " In Scotland we have been at a loss to understand this, and some of " our Directors are inclined to attribute it to the diminished death-rate ; " others attribute it to the fact that we have not for some time been " holding public meetings or doing anything to advertise the movement, " having rested content with providing the apparatus for those who " desire to avail themselves of it." He also notes that the prejudice against cremation is steadily diminishing, but that many people who are advocates of it do not take means to ensure their wishes being carried out after their death—in many cases the reason being that they do not wish to wound the feelings of relatives who hold different views. The Honorary Secretary of the Darlington Cremation Society also suggests that a declining death rate may have influenced a falling-ofF in the number of cremations. The Secretary of the Cremation Society of England, referring to a classified list of the occupations of 483 persons cremated at Golders Green and Woking Crematoria during 1908, remarks :— " It will be seen that the poorer classes are entirely unrepresented in " the foregoing figures, and until the advantages of cremation are " recognised by this section of the population (in which the greatest 40 " percentage of deaths occur in proportion) the progress of cremation " must of necessity be slow. " It would undoubtedly be difficult to comply with the Home Office " regulations in their present form to any extent among the lower classes, " as the particular medical information necessary could seldom be given " or the statutory requirements fulfilled. The question of expense may " in a good many cases militate against the adoption of cremation by the " industrial class, but it does not entirely account for their absence from " the above figures, as it is a notorious fact that the poor spend com" paratively more upon their funerals than the wealthier classes, and the " cost of cremation already compares favourably with burial carried out " with any degree of decency. Also it is alleged that the funeral trade " are opposed to cremation. But it must be borne in mind that under" takers as a body are just ordinary business men, and will supply what " the public demand. If the public insist on cremation there is no " reason to suppose that undertakers would not carry it out as readily as " any other method of disposing of the dead. " The true explanation of the slow progress of cremation seems to lie, " as suggested in the following extract from the ' British Medical " Journal,' in the fact that— " ' Cremation in this country is almost wholly confined to persons of " ' some intellectual distinction. The average citizen is still held in the " ' bondage of custom, in which sentiment has taken root so deeply as to " ' make it hard to eradicate.' " It is constantly brought to our notice that the expressed wishes of " persons for cremation are ignored upon their decease, in some cases by " the deliberate intention of the survivors, but a far greater proportion " from the fact that no adequate means are taken during lifetime to place " the desire for cremation upon record. It must be obvious that in cases " of doubt preference is given to that which is, at present, most " customary, i.e., Burial. In order to insure cremation at death the " party desiring it should communicate his wishes to his executors and " friends. It is not sufficient merely to insert a direction in a will, " because the will is rarely looked at until after the funeral. " Unfortunately, the law gives a free hand to unwilling executors, and " the only way of making instructions binding is to make any gift or " bequest subject to the wish being complied with." The Manager of the Liverpool Crematorium states : — " My experience is that the Declaration Form A. acts very inimically " to the progress of cremation, that the persons take alarm at anything " regarding a visit to a Justice of the Peace, or a solicitor, also that the " necessity of appearing before a Magistrate conveys the idea that there " must be something wrong in a process that requires such an appearance, " and that they are safer in resorting to burial—in fact, that, has barred " the way in several cases." 41 The Registrar and Superintendent of the Bradford Corporation Crematorium remarks:— " With regard to the question of cremation not becoming so popular as " was anticipated a few years ago, I find that opposition to it is " becoming rare, but it is giving place to a cause which may be even " worse than active opposition, i.e., indifference. This appears to me to " be the main reason why cremation is not taken up. 1 hear many " people say ' Yes, cremation is no doubt a good thing and the best way " ' of disposing of the dead from a sanitary point of view, but I don't •' ' care, they can do as they like when I am gone.' " It is far worse to argue or try to make people understand that they " are neglecting their duty when in this frame of mind, than if they were " opposed to cremation. " From the experience I have had lately, I feel this is the cause why " cremation is not becoming as popular as one would wish, and it will " take more breaking down than the opposition of a few years ago." The Clerk of the Headingly-cum-Burley (Leeds) Burial Board considers that public sentiment is still against this method of disposal of the dead. The Honorary Secretary of the Birmingham Crematorium writes :— " With reference to the progress of cremation, we find in Birmingham " that there are various reasons why cremation does not make such " rapid strides as is expected. In the first instance there are still large " numbers of people who are not aware of the advantages of cremation, " and I am therefore proposing shortly to prepare and deliver here a " lecture on the subject, illustrated with lantern slides. In the second " place I find that undertakers are strongly against cremation on account " of the reduction of their profit if they undertake one. . . . " Another factor which is against the advance of cremation is the " tremendous amount of red 'tape' with regard to the filling of the “ necessary forms. We find that relatives are very much against having " to give so many details at a time when they are distressed. There is " again, of course, the great sentimental objection which, until it is " removed, will always be a great drawback to cremation." With regard to the formalities required under the Cremation Act, referred to by the Manager of the Liverpool Crematorium, and the reference made to " red tape " by the Honorary Secretary of the Birmingham Crematorium, I can only repeat the views I have already expressed on this point, viz.* :— " It has been said that the retention of these regulations tends in a " great measure to retard the spread of cremation, but I am quite unable " to endorse this opinion. " Opponents of cremation would be only too ready to make adverse " use of any attempts to relax the present regulations which, very " properly, have been made exceedingly stringent, and it would certainly " be most unwise to lend any countenance to the suggested alteration." * Annual Report, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, 1907. 42 CREMATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, 24 Years—1885-1908.

There are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's—Queen's— Prince's—North—and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class; some of the ground floors being let as shops. The buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 919* persons, compared with 941 in 1906. Sixty-two per cent, are adults, and thirty-eight per cent, children (under 14 years). This reduction in the number of inhabitants is owing to the steps taken to prevent overcrowding, which had been brought to my notice in the course of the year. It should be stated that where overcrowding was found to exist, it wasnot due to the abuse of sub-letting but mainly to the natural increase of families. The death rate for 1908 was 10.6 per 1,000 per annum [of which 40 per cent, was of children under 5 years of age]. The number of deaths per 1,000 births of children under one year was 103, as against 65 for the City generally.

Of these 60,709 were disinfected at the request of City firms engaged in exporting second-hand clothing to South Africa, where the authorities will not allow such articles to enter the country unless accompanied by a certificate duly signed by a medical officer of health, vouching for the proper disinfection of each consignment. 194 bodies were received at the Mortuary, pending interment, 173 inquests were held on bodies, and 3 inquests on fires.

Owing to the warmth and length of the summer it was necessary to use disinfectants more freely than usual in keeping the roadways free from nuisance. As heretofore, all the disinfectants used in the Public Health Department were obtained through your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for the following purposes :— A. Deodorizing and " denaturalizing " condemned meat, disinfecting public conveniences (urinals, &c.). B. Disinfecting roadways, street gullies, &c. C. Disinfecting premises, &c., after infectious disease, drain testing and sundries. The amounts spent during the past twelve months under these several headings were:— £ s. d. A. 20 6 3 B. 255 19 3 C. 34 14 5 Total £310 19 11 The above amounts only relate to materials purchased for the use of the Public Health Department. Arrangements have been made with the heads of other departments whereby in future any disinfectants required by them can be obtained direct from the Contractor supplying the Public Health Department. 47 SANITARY INSPECTIONS.

This necessitated the service of a total of 350 Notices during the year. A list of registered tenement houses is given in Appendix C (p. 172). The following are the corresponding figures for 1898, and show the reduction in this class of property in the City since that date:— Tenement Houses (1898). District. No. of Houses on Register.

COMMON LODGING HOUSE. 116, Middlesex Street. The "Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," No. 116, Middlesex Street, is the only Common Lodging House in the City. It was opened on the 7th February, 1906, and provides accommodation for 453 persons. The charge for the Hotel portion is 5d. per night, and the Shelter 2d. per night, which includes a "bath and a bake" (disinfection of clothing). Food can be purchased cheaply. The premises have been periodically inspected during the year, and always found to be well managed and kept in a cleanly condition. 52 DRAINAGE PLANS. In the course of the year 371 plans for the proposed reconstruction of water-closets or drains were submitted for approval. With modification in certain cases, these were agreed to and the works carried out. In all cases where, on revision, it was found that the plans were not in accordance with the Corporation Bye-laws, the matter was submitted to the judgment of the Sanitary Committee. STREET GULLIES. Fewer complaints than usual were received during the summer months of nuisance of smells from street gullies in the public thoroughfares. In dry weather this is sometimes due to want of flushing, but in some cases the nuisance arises through faulty construction. The City Engineer is still giving special attention to this matter, and a large number of these appliances have been reconstructed and trapped, greatly to the relief of passers by and persons living in the vicinity. OVERCROWDING. Overcrowding is a nuisance dealt with under Section 2, (1), (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1901, and 17 cases were reported during the year. Notices of abatement being served, the overcrowding was discontinued in each instance. OVERCROWDING, &c., AT THE CENTRAL TELEGRAPH OFFICE. In September last, in consequence of complaints that the tube switch room on the ground floor of the above premises was overcrowded and imperfectly ventilated, and that such conditions were prejudicial to the health of the employes, the Inspector of the District was instructed to visit and report thereon. Some objection was taken at first to the Inspector's right of entry, which was not agreed to until he was provided with a written request from the Medical Officer of Health. As a result of the Inspector's report your Medical Officer, by arrangement, visited the premises, accompanied by Dr. Wilson, the Chief Medical Officer, of the General Post Office, on the 5th October, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, 53 when the full staff were on duty. It was found on this occasion that there were some grounds for complaint, as the ventilation was defective, and there was also overcrowding. Complaints had also been made as to nuisance caused by the smell of cooking on the premises, and exaggerated charges made in the Press as to the conditions under which the staff were working; but although the conditions found certainly required amendment, the facts had been greatly overstated. It should be noted that the Postmaster-General claims that buildings of his Department are exempt from inspection by officers of Sanitary Authorities There can be no doubt that Government establishments should be subject to the same supervision by the Sanitary Authorities as other workplaces, and certainly Government employes should work under as healthy conditions as those of private individuals. Similar objection had been raised on previous occasions, but as the Postmaster-General stated that he is always disposed to meet the wishes of Local Authorities so far as they are reasonably practicable, and as it was understood that the Post Office Authorities were making arrangements for the transfer of this staff to better quarters, the question of right of entry in this instance was not of much importance. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. In 13 cases only, out of 1,191 Notices issued during the year by the District Inspectors, was it found necessary in consequence of non-compliance to refer the matter to the City Solicitor with a view to taking such steps as he deemed necessary to ensure the required sanitary improvement being carried out. With 5 exceptions—now being dealt with—the Notices were subsequently complied with without the matter being taken into Court. The following are the cases referred to:— Premises. 11, Grocers' Hall Court Drain defective New drains and W.C's 8-9, Philip Lane Improperly constructed water-closet. Water closet re-constructed. 17, Warwick Square Defective drain Notice complied with. 84, Fore Street Fumes from gas stove Ditto. 68, Aldermanbury Insufficient W.C. accommodation. Ditto. 28-29, Aldersgate Street Ditto In Solicitor's hands. 5, Billiter Street Ditto Premises closed. 2, Bow Lane Ditto Notice complied with. 153-5, Cannon Street Ditto In Solicitor's hands. 107, Fenchurch Street Ditto Notice complied with. 4, Ludgate Circus Buildings. Ditto In Solicitor's hands. 6, Paternoster Row Ditto Ditto. 7, Water Lane Ditto Ditto. 54 REMOVAL OF FISH OFFAL. The contract with Messrs. F. S. Hempleman and Co. for the removal of Fish Offal expired on the 21st May, 1908, and on the recommendation of the City Engineer and your Medical Officer of Health was renewed for a further period of twelve months. The conditions of the contract require that the Contractor collect and remove, free of charge, between the hours of 7 p.m. and 9 a.m., all fish offal from the Corporation Markets and Fishmongers' premises in the City, to the entire satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, in specially constructed galvanised iron bins, of a pattern approved by that officer, and to thoroughly cleanse and disinfect such bins before returning them to the markets and shops. DRAINAGE, ROYAL EXCHANGE. The whole of the drainage of this building has now been reconstructed, and new connections made to the main sewers in Threadneedle Street, Royal Exchange Buildings and Cornhill. The old brick drain which formerly surrounded the Royal Exchange has been cut off and filled in with concrete, pedestal water-closets fixed, and a new system of ventilation provided. Sanitary accommodation has been provided for women, and a key given to each of the firms where such are employed. RAILWAY STATIONS. Periodical inspections were made of the sanitary accommodation provided at the twenty-five Railway Stations in the City. In 12 of them, the Companies they belong to have been called upon to effect sanitary improvements thereat. The defects, for the most part, have been due to lack of proper cleaning and to defective drains and sanitary fittings. In each case the necessary works have been satisfactorily carried out. INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS. The undermentioned schools in the district have been inspected, various defects found, and the following works executed:— Greystoke Place Day Training College.—New branch drains, water-closets and lavatory basins have been constructed. Moorfields Day Training College.—New iron drains laid, trapped and ventilated, new water-closets and waste pipes fixed. 55 REMOVAL OF HUMAN REMAINS. St. Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside. An application was made by the Rector and Churchwardens for the removal of the bodies from the crypt of this church. The church and crypt were visited frequently, but at none of these visits was any actual nuisance detected, though on general principles the removal is advisable. The number of bodies is estimated to be about 700. IRON DRAINS. With reference to the paragraph in my report for the year 1906 respecting the use of iron pipes in the reconstruction of drains in the City, the owners of property are now more fully recognising the great advantages of iron over stoneware, inasmuch as it is at this date the rule rather than the exception to relay drains in iron. The experience of my department goes to prove that the slightly increased cost is more than justified by the additional soundness and efficiency. HOUSES INFESTED WITH VERMIN. Four cases occurred where rooms in tenement houses were found to be infested with vermin. Upon the owners' attention being directed to the powers conferred upon the Corporation by 4 Ed. 7, cap. 244, sec. 20, they at once carried out the necessary disinfection and cleansing. The section referred to enacts that upon receipt of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health, a Sanitary Authority is empowered to give notice in writing to the owner or occupier of verminous premises requiring him within a certain time, to be specified on the Notice, to cleanse the house, and if so required to remove the paper from the walls, and take such other steps for the destruction and removal of vermin as the case may require. Failing compliance with such Notice, the Sanitary Authority may do the work required themselves, and recover the expense as a civil debt from the person making the default. NUISANCE FROM WASHINGS FROM GAS PRODUCER PLANT. Of recent years the use of producer gas in the City for motive purposes has considerably extended, but this form of power is not without some disadvantage, as shown by several complaints of nuisance from gas washings inseparable from the process unless properly treated. 56 There can be no objection to this system of gas making for utilisation in engines instead of coal gas, provided no nuisance is created thereby, but the trouble in several cases has been caused by the abominable odour of the effluent which contains sulphuretted hydrogen. Further it is a direct contravention of the City of London Sewers Act, 1848, to discharge any gas washings into the public sewers. Section 76 is as under:— "And be it enacted, That if any Gas Company, or person making, "manufacturing, or supplying gas, shall at any time empty, drain, or "convey, or permit or suffer to be emptied, drained, or conveyed, or to run "or flow, any washings, or foul or waste water, or any noisome or "offensive liquid, substance, or thing which may arise or be produced in "the making of gas, into any public sewer or drain, every Gas Company "or person so offending, shall forfeit and pay the sum of Two hundred "Pounds for each and every day during which any such washing, or "foul or waste water or other noisome or offensive liquid, substance, or "thing, shall be permitted or suffered to flow into any public sewer "or drain." It has been found by experiment that the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen with which these gas washings are charged, can be practically eliminated by the use of' permanganate of potash, the addition of which to the washings in a settling tank producing an effluent to which little or no exception can be taken. Such treatment abated the nuisance in each of the cases reported last year, and on the advice of the City Engineer the discharge of the treated effluent was limited to the hours between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. Each case, however, of this kind will be dealt with on its merits, and the effluent examined from time to time. No further complaints have been received. REMOVAL OF CHEMICAL AND DRUG FACTORY. During the past year one of the largest of these firms have removed their factory to an outlying district. While they had taken precautions and carried out a number of works to prevent the emission of effluvia, the position of the factory, surrounded as time went on by new and higher buildings, the nature of the business rendered them very objectionable to, and caused much unpleasantness with, their neighbours. 57 OLD WALBROOK SEWER. The remaining portion of this sewer running under the premises known as Joiners' Hall Buildings, between Upper Thames Street and Greenwich Street, was found to be in a very bad condition upon some alterations to a drain which ran into it being taken in hand; it was practically an unventilated cesspool, with a considerable quantity of sewage lying in the bottom. The drain was connected to the sewer under the public way in Joiners' Hall Buildings, and the old sewer filled in and demolished. This completes the abolition of this sewer which formerly, for nearly the whole of its length, ran under private property. METROPOLITAN SEWERS AND DRAINS BILL, 1908. Combined Drainage. This Bill, referred to in my Report for 1907, was initiated by the St. Pancras Borough Council, and met with the general support of the Metropolitan Borough Councils and the City of London. It was introduced with a view of amending the law relating to combined drainage in the Metropolis which had been for many years in a most unsatisfactory state, and cast an unduly heavy burden on the ratepayers. The Bill, which was introduced by a private Member, was read a first time on 5th March, 1908, and on 30th January, 1908, the Court of Common Council adopted a recommendation of the Sanitary Committee that the draft Bill be approved and the City Members requested to support the same in Parliament. In a letter dated 13th August, 1908, it was pointed out by the promoters of the Bill that the experience of the previous Session showed that there was little prospect of a private Member's Bill dealing with the difficulties created by the definition of "sewer" and "drain" becoming law without the co-operation of the Government, and suggesting that representation should be made to the President of the Local Government Board urging him to take over the Bill on behalf of the Government. Both the Sanitary and Streets Committees, to whom this question had been referred, concurred therein, and Mr. Remembrancer was instructed to consider the advisability of adopting the suggestion. It ended, however, in the Bill being dropped before obtaining a second reading. 58 SANITARY DEFECTS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE. All premises where infectious disease was notified were inspected with reference to drainage, soil and waste pipes, water-closets, water supply, ventilation, &c., and of the 71 cases investigated in 1908, it has been necessary to entirely reconstruct the sanitary system in 8 instances, and to make amendments to soil, waste pipes, and W.C's in 34 others. HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1908 consisted of 28,712 cartloads of street sweepings and slop, and 52,758 loads of house and trade refuse. Total, 81,470 loads. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Letts' Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS. All courts and narrow passages throughout the City were regularly flushed during the summer months under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service and the washing of the main streets last year no less than 75,581,011 gallons of water were used. Disinfectants were also freely applied where necessary. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Custom House, as heretofore, required special attention, there having always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the neighbourhood of these places free from the nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially in hot weather. The following is a list of the 275 places that were flushed, so arranged as to show the number of times they were washed down weekly :— Flushed Six times a week. Cavendish Court French Ordinary Court Lower Thames Street Cobb's Court Harrow Alley Viaduct Steps Church Row (Fenchurch Street) Huggin Lane Church Row (Houndsditch) Flushed Five times a week.

There are ninety-seven courts and narrow passages in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed regularly, become dirty and unsightly through the traffic of passengers or vehicles and the action of a smoke-laden atmosphere.

Smoke nuisances were reported at fifteen premises during 1908. The number of observations recorded amounted to 542, as against 341 noted at twelve premises in 1907. The service of Notices upon offenders resulted in the abatement of the nuisances in all cases, and therefore there has been no occasion to take further action in the matter. 62 In a letter dated the 10th March, 1908, the London County Council invited the views of the Corporation with regard to proposals* for conferring additional powers upon the London County Council and the several Metropolitan Boroughs for the prevention and abatement of smoke nuisances. The following were the suggestions made by the Council, viz. (a) to (f), your Medical Officer's comments thereon being added thereto in each case:— (a) That dense smoke discharged from any building, vessel, stationary or locomotive engine, place or premises (other than a private dwelling house) within the area of the City and the County of London and the surrounding urban districts to a distance of twelve miles of Charing Cross, or upon the waters of the Port of London and its tributaries within such area, shall be a nuisance, for which a fine not exceeding £10 may be imposed, with cumulative penalties for subsequent offences at the discretion of the magistrate. The substitution of the word "dense" for "black" will enable local authorities to abate many smoke nuisances that under existing circumstances it is difficult to deal with on account of its not being "black." (b) That the Council shall have power to make Bye-laws, subject to the approval of the Home Office or the Local Government Board. i. To bring under the terms of the provision set out in conclusion (a) other instances of avoidable smoke nuisance. ii. To prescribe and revise from time to time a standard of smoke nuisance to further define emissions of smoke to be liable to penalties. iii. To prohibit the adoption in new or reconstructed factories, premises or buildings, or any furnace, or grate or other fuel consuming apparatus of a type which shall have been proved to the satisfaction of the Council to produce an unnecessary amount of smoke. iv. To prescribe any additional measures or requirements necessary for the suppression and prevention of smoke nuisance. v. To provide a penalty for the breach of any such Bye-law not exceeding the penalty specified in conclusion (a). The Bye-laws would cover such an extensive range of subjects for regulation that they might greatly affect the interests of manufacturers with regard to iii. and of owners of private dwellings. Although, in the main, Bye-laws for such purposes may be deemed desirable, they will have to be very carefully considered by the proposed confirming authorities. *On the 12th March this year some modification of these proposals were considered at a conference of the Public Control Committee of the London County Council with representatives of the Corporation of London and the Metropolitan Borough Councils, held at the County Hall, Spring Gardens. 63 (c) That exemption from liability to penalties implied or expressed in favour of Crown property or premises of electric power corporations be repealed. If such exemptions are repealed it will furnish a useful precedent. (d) That it shall be the duty of the several Sanitary Authorities to enforce the provisions of the law and any bye-laws made by the Council. The Local Sanitary Authority should be the only body, except in cases of default, to enforce the suggested provisions and bye-laws in their own district. (e) That the Council shall have joint authority with the several administrative bodies to enforce the law, and any bye-laws within the area as above defined, with power to recover from the Sanitary Authority when it has been in default, the expenses of proceedings not recovered by order of a Court and not incurred in unsuccessful proceedings. It is inadvisable that the County Council should have joint authority with Sanitary Authorities, but they might be authorised to act in case of default in Metropolitan Boroughs. (f) That the County Council shall be the paramount authority for the whole area above defined, and as such shall have power to expend money for the purposes of i. Promoting a knowledge of the principles of (a) Combustion of fuel. (b) Furnace and grate construction. (c) Stoking. ii. Encouraging the study of the scientific heating of houses or the use of smokeless fuels, with a view to the reduction of nuisances from the open fire grate. iii. Determining generally the best means for securing the prevention of smoke in the consumption of fuel. With regard to (f) your Medical Officer pointed out that this is rather a question for the Committee to exercise their judgment as to whether it would be judicious to authorise the expenditure of the ratepayers' money on experimental work in the direction indicated. 64 Further, whatever additional legislative powers are sought by the Council, the autonomy of the City should be reserved in every respect, and the County Council should have no jurisdiction in any circumstances within the City. It was further noted that the suggestion contained in the Council's proposals constitute another amendment of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the time had arrived when it should be amended and consolidated by the inclusion therein of the many sanitary enactments introduced from time to time in the County Councils (General Powers) Acts, and that in future any public health legislation connected with the Metropolis as a whole should be promoted by the Government of the day. The Committee concurred in the views expressed above, and a copy of these observations were directed to be forwarded for the information of the Council. HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. There has been some increase in the number of registered Hairdressers' establishments since the previous year. Five new firms have been placed upon the Register, one saloon has been closed, and at two there has been a change of proprietor. Only those Hairdressers who undertake to comply with the regulations of the Corporation are placed on the Register, which now includes the following establishments:— Morris Alper, 2, St. Andrew's Hill. The Army and Navy Toilet Club, 35, Bucklersbury. Chester and Co., 42, Old Broad Street. Civil Service Supply Association, 136-140, Queen Victoria Street. William Clarke, 5, Birchin Lane.

This Act, which in its progress through Parliament has been the subject of several reports by your Medical Officer, received the Royal Assent on the 1st August, 1908, and became immediately operative. The opposition of the Corporation to certain clauses was successful. At the second reading of the Bill in the Commons, upon the President of the Local Government Board giving an undertaking that on an early occasion he would bring in a general Bill dealing with the milk supply of the county, the Police and Sanitary Committees were instructed to strike out from what was then Part II. of the Bill all clauses dealing with the milk supply other than the "model clauses." This instruction resulted in the whole of Part II., which deals with dirty or unwholesome milk, being struck out, as the "model clauses" deal only with milk in relation to tuberculosis. Your Medical Officer reported at length on this Act in a report dated the 27th October, 1908. The Sanitary provision in Part II. of the Act confers the following additional powers upon the Corporation:— Section 5: To remove from or refuse to register names of dairymen whose premises are for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk thereon. Section 6: Power to appoint and pay the salaries of suitable women to be known as health visitors, for the purpose of giving advice to persons as to the proper nurture, care and management of young children and the promotion of cleanliness. 66 Section 7: To require the owners of premises let as tenement houses, after the passing of the Act, to provide suitable accommodation for the cooking of food for the use of each family occupying such house on the storey or one of the storeys in which are situate the rooms or lodgings in the separate occupation of such family. Section 8: To enforce the following sanitary regulations for premises used for sale, &c., of food for human consumption. (a) No urinal, water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ashpit or other like sanitary convenience shall be within such room, shop or other part of a building, or shall communicate therewith except through the open air or through an intervening ventilated space. (b) No cistern for supplying water to such room, shop or other part of a building shall be in direct communication with and directly discharge into any such sanitary convenience. (c) No drain or pipe for carrying off fæcal or sewage matter shall have any inlet or opening within such room, shop or other part of a building. (d) No such room, shop or other part of a building shall be used as a sleeping place, and so far as may be reasonably necessary to prevent risk of the infection or contamination of any such article as aforesaid, no sleeping place shall adjoin such room, shop or other part of a building and communicate therewith, except through the open air or through an intervening ventilated space. (e) Refuse and filth, whether solid or liquid, shall not be deposited or allowed to accumulate in any such room, shop or other part of a building, except so far as may be reasonably necessary for the proper carrying on of trade or business. (f) Due cleanliness shall be observed in regard to such room, shop or other part of a building, and all articles, apparatus and utensils therein, and shall be observed by persons engaged in such room, shop or other part of a building. Section 9 empowers the Corporation to make Bye-laws with respect to the businesses of A vendor of Fried Fish, A Fish Curer, A Rag and Bone Dealer, or any of them, and with respect to the premises in or upon which any such business is carried on, and the apparatus, utensils and appliances used for the purpose of or in connection with any such business. 67 Section 12 contains an extremely useful provision, as it gives sanitary authorities or any officer or person duly authorised by them the right to enter at all reasonable times any house, building, or premises in the district of such Sanitary Authority for the purpose of examining whether there is any contravention of the foregoing provisions of the Act, or of any Bye-law made thereunder, or any non-compliance with the requirements of any notice given thereunder respectively. This power to enter by a Sanitary Authority for the purpose of ascertaining if there is any contravention of the law was first introduced in the London County Council (General Powers) Act of 1904. It was then an entirely new departure, and one of great importance to Sanitary Authorities. Similar powers should be conferred upon Sanitary Authorities in relation to all nuisances. At present, under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, power of entry is only given in cases when there is reasonable cause to believe there is some contravention of that Act or of a Bye-law made thereunder. In pursuance of Section 5 of the Act, giving the Corporation power to remove from or to refuse to register the names of purveyors of milk whose premises are unsuitable for the sale of milk thereon, notice was given, upon the recommendation of your Medical Officer, to the proprietors of a number of such places in the City where milk was sold, that unless they carried out such arrangements as were necessary to enable them to comply with Sections 6 and 23 of the regulations made by the Corporation under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, and the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, 1885, their names would be removed from the Register, and the sale of milk on the premises prohibited. The places in question were small general shops crowded with miscellaneous goods under conditions that rendered them quite unfitted for the storage of milk. Up to the end of 1908 two of these were removed from the Register, five were retained upon the notice being complied with, and many others have since been dealt with. 68 NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFANTILE MORTALITY. This Conference was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, on the 24th and 25th March. 1908. It was attended by your Medical Officer and Miss Pole (one of your Women Inspectors) as delegates to represent the Corporation in accordance with the Resolution of the Court of Common Council of the 27th February, 1908. It was explained that the Conference was the outcome of meetings in London, Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, and various other places. During the Conference a number of interesting papers dealing with the question of Infantile Mortality were read and discussed. The following Resolutions were passed:— I. That this Conference expresses its appreciation of Parliament having passed the Notification of Births Act, 1907, and urges upon all local authorities the importance of adopting the Act and appointing qualified women to carry out its provisions. II. That, in order to combat the prevalent ignorance in wastage of infant life and injury to health of many survivors, the Conference urges upon the Board of Education, and upon educational authorities generally, the importance of securing to all girls in every grade of school a satisfactory training in domestic and personal hygiene and the duties of womanhood. III. That the Conference welcomes most gladly the Children Bill introduced into the House of Commons by Mr. Herbert Samuel, M.P., for the amendment of the Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, and recommends the Executive Committee to ask that the Bill be specially amended to include the case in which one child only is put out to nurse for reward, and that the Bill be further amended to empower local authorities to charge upon the rates the cost of carrying out the existing statutory provisions for the prevention of cruelty to children. IV. That the Conference, being convinced of the injury done to infant life and health through infants being taken into public-houses, urges upon Parliament the necessity of providing such legislation as will prevent this. V. That this Conference urges upon the Boards of Guardians the advisability of making greater use of their existing powers to adopt, under the Poor Law Act, the children of incorrigible parents. VI. That all preparations offered or sold as foods or drugs for infants should be certified by a Government Analyst as non-injurious, and that each packet should contain its analysis. 69 VII. That in view of the unsatisfactory conditions under which milk is produced and distributed, the Conference being of opinion that immediate amendment of the law is desirable, urges upon Parliament the necessity of at once taking such steps as are necessary to effect this. VIII. That the Conference re-affirm the resolution of the former Conference, that the Midwives Act, 1902, be extended to Scotland and Ireland. IX. That the Conference continue as a Committee to give effect to the foregoing Resolutions, with power to remit to an Executive Committee to carry out the same. With regard to Resolutions Nos. I., III., IV., VI. and VII.— I. The Corporation has adopted the Notification of Births Act, see p. 91. III. The suggested extension of the provisions of the Infant Life Protection Clauses was adopted in the Children Act, see p. 89. IV. This suggested provision was embodied in the Licensing Bill of last year. VI. There can be no question that the unrestricted sale of soothing syrups and similar preparations is a fruitful source of danger to infant life. Proprietary food preparations for infants are in many cases quite unfitted for infant use. It should be made an offence to sell either medicines or food for infants that are not labelled with a notice declaring the nature and constituents of such articles. The view of the Right Hon. Lord Robert Cecil on this point may be quoted here with advantage, as it shows very clearly the need for an alteration of the law. "It is forbidden to sell articles which are adulterated so as to be unfit for the use "for which they are sold. That applies to ordinary articles of food, it applies to "fertilisers and feeding stuffs; but there is one department to which, oddly enough, "it does not apply, and that is the sale of food for infants. That is really a matter "of enormous importance. I am told, and I believe on perfectly good authority, "that there are a mass of these infants foods which are little better than concentrated poison for the unhappy children who consume them. I do hope that if we "are prepared, as we are in the House of Commons, to protect the cattle, and even "to protect the fields which grow the food for the cattle, we might, at any rate, go "as far as to say that infant food which is poisonous to infant life should not be "sold in the markets of this country." (22nd November, 1907.) VII. With regard to the unsatisfactory conditions under which milk is produced and distributed, the Government is pledged to legislate for an improved milk supply at an early date. 70 On the '26th February of this year the Prime Minister received a deputation of Medical Officers and others who presented the resolutions referred to above, passed at the Conference on Infantile Mortality. It may be interesting to quote the observations thereon made by the President of the Local Government Board on this occasion:— "The President remarked on the fact that since the Conference had commenced "its labours two years ago there had been, in 1908, 15,000 more children's lives "saved to the State. That was a very cheering fact. At the Local Government "Board he had set up a special department to inquire into the quality of foods, "and the £2,000,000 worth of imports was claiming their attention at the moment. "He had referred to the question of the quality and character of baby foods to two "doctors at the Local Government Board. The deputation asked that all baby foods "should be certified by a Government analyst, but the great difficulty in this "connection was that food might be given to a child from one to five years of age "which, if given to an infant between birth and five and six months of age, would "mean death. It was a difficult subject, but he trusted a way out would be found. "They were getting more help than they had hoped from the Notification of "Tuberculosis Act, which came into operation this year. As they found infant "mortality in the smallest houses where there was the largest number of children in "one room, they trusted that two or three years' operation of the new Housing Bill, "which must become law this year, would make some considerable alteration. "Then, if the Milk Bill passed, as he hoped it would, the children of this country "would certainly have something to thank the Government for."—("Daily Telegraph," 26th February, 1909.) 71 ROYAL SANITARY INSTITUTE CONGRESS. This Congress was held at Cardiff from the 15th to 18th July, and was attended by Frederick Link, Esq., J.P., and Sigismund Pollitzer, Esq., respectively Chairman and late Chairman of the Sanitary Committee, and by Dr. Williams, Acting Medical Officer for the City, as delegates of the Corporation of London. A Conference of Municipal Representatives was held, at which a paper was read on the Notification of Births. This was of great interest, giving the experience gained at a large City like Glasgow. There they had originated a system of voluntary visitors, and had established five consultation rooms, at three of which milk was provided for the feeding of infants. The discussion which followed was strongly in favour of the efficiency of the Notification of Births Act, and it was pointed out that even if it had no other effect than the prevention of ophthalmia in children, owing to the want of early treatment, the passing of the Act would be fully justified. There was a discussion on the construction and management of Crematoria. Many details were given of the Crematorium at Leicester, and an opportunity was taken during the discussion by your Acting Medical Officer of giving some particulars with regard to the working of the City Crematorium at Ilford. In the section on Sanitary Science and Preventive Medicine some interesting papers were read—notably one on the examination of sausages and their hygienic preparation. The result of twelve bacteriological examinations showed that the sausages contained the bacillus coli in many instances, varying from 100 to 120,000 per gramme of sausage. Stress was laid on the condition of the premises where the sausages were prepared, and one of H.M. Inspectors of Factories read from a Blue Book an account of visits which he had paid to eight places in the Southern District where sausages were made. His inspections revealed an extremely unsatisfactory state of affairs. Sausages were made in cellars, which apparently had never been whitewashed, the walls were covered with dirt, and the floors uneven and studded with pools of stagnant, dirty water. Papers were also read at the Conference of Medical Officers of Health with regard to the necessity of establishing a standard of cleanliness in all milking competitions at Agricultural shows. At first sight it would appear that, if anywhere, a standard of cleanliness would be observed at such competitions. The writer of the paper had visited a large Agricultural Show, and gave the results of his observations, which showed that there was a great want of even ordinary methods of cleanliness, and in one instance he noted faecal matter falling into the pail, which added considerably to the weight of the pail of milk, and if this be the state of affairs at an agricultural show under the immediate observation of the public, it is not difficult to imagine the insanitary and unhygienic method of obtaining milk from cows in small dairy farms in the country. 72 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES. The work of inspection has continuously increased since the Act came into force in 1902. Under the Act, all Local Authorities are required to keep a Register of Workshops, and to transmit a copy of the Annual Report of their Medical Officer of Health upon the subject to the Home Office, this being in addition to the copy of the Annual Report required to be sent to the Local Government Board as heretofore. In addition to the Register of Workshops, Registers are also kept of Factories and Workplaces. Every Local Authority also has definite duties with regard to "Outworkers," and the work under this heading is bound to largely increase when the projected legislation respecting "Sweated Trades" is carried into effect.* The steady increase in the number of this class of workers dealt with is shown at page 79, under the heading of "Outworkers." The reference book for the year contains 5,049 entries of matters affecting Workshops, &c., referred to the staff specially engaged upon this work. The names and addresses of 16,909 Outworkers were sent to various Local Authorities; whilst over 2,900 notices were issued for various reasons. The figures for the year show an increase of 99 Premises registered, representing 405 separate Workrooms, &c. Under a General Powers Act, passed in 1908, affecting London generally, the Corporation possesses additional powers with respect to certain trades, including those of a Vendor of Fried Fish, a Fish Curer, and a Rag and Bone Dealer, which, however, are not numerous within the City. The number of Factories, Workshops, and Workplaces at present registered is as follows:— Premises. Workrooms, &c. Factories 619 2,356 Workshops 1,926 3,184 Workplaces:— Kitchens of Restaurants, &c. 628 839 Kitchens of Tea Rooms, &c. 211 Stables 35 35 Other places 71 71 Totals 3,490 6,485 *The "Sweated Industries Bill" and the "Trade Boards Bill" were read a first time in the House of Commons on the 19th February, 1909, and 24th March, 1909, respectively. 73 The following figures abstracted from the several Registers will be of interest. Of the 2,356 Factory Workrooms registered, 831 were occupied by men only, 25 by women only, and 1,500 by men and women. Of the 3,184 Workshops registered, 1,627 were occupied by men only, 518 by women only, 1,010 by men and women, and 29 were Domestic Workshops. The number of workers employed was as follows: — Men. Women.

There is an increase in the number of Factories registered, no fewer than 95 firms having had their premises inspected for the first time. The defects found are similar in all respects to those found in workshops. * Details of Factory Inspections, 1908.

As mentioned in previous Reports, the sanitary defects generally found in workshops may be classified under the following headings:— Want of cleansing. Insufficient ventilation. Overcrowding. The lack of separate and suitable water-closet accommodation for both sexes. Under the Factory Act, the occupier of a Workshop is bound to give notice to H.M Factory Department of the establishment of any Workshop, but no such notice is required to be given to the Local Authority, and the information subsequently reaches the Local Authority through the Factory Department. As Local Authorities have been made specially responsible for Workshops, it is desirable that notice of the existence of any new Workshop should also be given to them and so enable any sanitary defects to be remedied without unnecessary delay. The District Surveyor was notified of dangerous structures observed by the Inspectors in the course of their inspections. * Details of Workshop Inspections, 1908. New workshops notified by H.M.

With few exceptions, the whole of the premises registered were visited during the year, and there is but little to add to previous Reports. The principal difficulty now met with is the provision of separate and suitable water-closet accommodation for the sexes. When businesses change hands, or structural alterations are carried out—or both—this item is often lost sight of. The male members of the staff are said to be "paid to go out" to find accommodation at public conveniences, &c. Such arrangements are not satisfactory, and do not comply with the requirements of the Act. The occupiers of several restaurants, &c., submitted plans for approval, and it cannot be too widely known that this is the only proper course to adopt in the best interests of the parties concerned, who are thereby enabled to comply at once with the necessary requirements at a minimum of expense. The meat and other foods are inspected in the course of the ordinary visits of the Inspector. 77 * Details of Workplace Inspections, &c., 1908.

SUMMARY. Underground bakehouses 23 Aboveground bakehouses 7 Total number of bakehouses in the City 30 During the year, 88 inspections of Bakehouses were made, and they were found, generally, to be kept in a satisfactory manner, and up to the standard required. In seven cases, cleansing or whitewashing was necessary, and this was immediately carried out. The Bakehouse at No. 13, Widegate Street, probably the oldest in the City, has been discontinued to be used as such. * Established during 1903. † These have been established at least 23 years. 79 VOLUNTARY SANITARY CERTIFICATES FOR KITCHENS, &c. When the Corporation decided, in 1904, to grant Certificates, it was thought that many persons would avail themselves of the opportunity, but up to the present only three Certificates have been granted—two for Kitchens, and one for a Bakehouse. SANITARY DEFECTS IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS NOTIFIED IN 1908 BY H.M. INSPECTOR OF FACTORIES. In 19 cases, complaints were attended to and the necessary Sanitary alterations were carried out before the end of the year. % The Factory Inspector was notified of defects observed by the Workshop and Women Inspectors in the course of their Inspections. One case of alleged lead poisoning was reported. A comparison of the number of such notifications received in past years with the year under review shows as follows:— Year. No. of Complaints received. 1901 51 1902 54 1903 66 1904 31 1905 32 1906 39 1907 21 1908 19 Annual Average 39.1 OUTWORKERS AND "HOME" WORKERS. Every effort has been made to give effect to the clauses of the Act respecting Outworkers, and in no instance was a prosecution necessary. The Lists due on February 1st and August 1st respectively, were all obtained by March 2nd and August 22nd. This is satisfactory, more especially so, as the City has at present to deal with by far the largest number of outworkers' addresses of any Metropolitan District. 80 There are but few "Home" workers in the City. The total number of Outworkers' premises registered is 214, only 43 of which can in any way be described as occupied by "Home" workers. The remainder are ordinary workshops, and appear on the Register of Workshops. The "Home" workers are visited by your Women Inspectors periodically. See page 85. Much difficulty was at first experienced in procuring lists from employers, and it was only after printed notice was issued to each firm concerned a few days before the Lists became due that an improvement took place. The following figures will illustrate what has occurred: — Year. Number of Lists received. Outworkers Employed in City. Outworkers Employed outside City. Total number of Outworkers. 1902 — 17 3,752 3,769 1903 — 118 2,729 2,847 1904 272 123 3,334 3,457 (Note.—1st Notice issued to all employers at end of 1904 ) 1905 576 236 7,891 8,127 1906 1,112 229 14,376 14,605 1907 1,426 491 16,570 17,061 1908 1,506 624 16,909 17,533 In 96 instances it was found that no list of outworkers was kept in the prescribed form at the employers' premises as required by the Act. The offenders were warned of their neglect, and in no case was it necessary to take legal proceedings. During the year 27 notifications of infectious disease in connection with workers and outworkers have been received. In each case a special visit was made to the employer's place of business, and all necessary precautions taken to prevent a spread of the infection. The cases dealt with included 20 Scarlet Fever, 1 Enteric Fever, 4 Diphtheria, 1 Chicken-pox, and 1 Whooping Cough. 81 THIS TABLE WAS ISSUED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD BY REQUEST OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

A foornote should be added to show that this has been done. †The figures required in column 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of list (received from employers who sent them both in February and August as required by the Act) and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. They will, therefore, usually be double of the number of such employers and (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August and August list of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 4.—REGISTERED WORKSHOPS.

COL LING RIDGE, Medical Officer of Heal*. Note.—The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (s. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the administration of that Act in workshops and workplaces, and to send a copy of his Annual Reports to the District much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State (Home Office). If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, laundries workplaces or homework. The duties of Local Authorities and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Memorandumof December l904. A further Memorandum, on the Home Work Provisions of the Factory Act, was issued to all District 84 WOMEN SANITARY INSPECTORS. FACTORIES. The majority of women who work in factories in the City are employed in the Clothing Trades. Out of a total of 10,236 women workers, 5,500 are shown by the Factory Register to be employed in some branch of clothing work. Under this heading are included: Millinery, Blouse-making, Underclothing, Feather-dressing, &c. The number of workrooms in these trades on the Register is 399. In Printing, Bookbinding, and Envelope-making, 3,941 women are employed, and 662 women work in Tobacco factories. The other trades represented include Furniture and Upholstery, Tea-packing, Silk-winding, and two factory Laundries. In Factories the Sanitary Authorities deal chiefly with sanitary accommodation, other health questions being within the purview of H.M. Inspectors. 586 visits were paid by your Women Inspectors to factories in which women are employed. In many instances the sanitary accommodation was found to be dirty and defective, and a large number of cases of unsuitable or insufficient accommodation were reported, and where structural alterations were required were dealt with by the District Inspectors. WORKSHOPS. The workshops in which women are employed are nearly all places where clothing of some kind is made. The total number of these workshops (including Millinery, Blouses, Tailoring, Feathers, Artificial Flowers, Mantles, Underclothing, &c.), is 1,264; 764 being workshops in which men and women are employed, and in 500 women only are employed. The number of women employed in these trades is 8,041. Other trades represented are: Umbrellas, Leather goods, Stationery, Furniture and Upholstery, Florists, Perfumery, Druggists, &c., and two Laundries. The total number of women employed in all workshops (including domestic workshops) is 10,491. The number of inspections made during the year is as follows:— Initial Inspections 185 Periodical Inspections 1,550 Re-inspections 79 Total 1,814 85 The defects found were chiefly in relation to dirty walls and ceilings, dirty and defective sanitary arrangements, and insufficient ventilation. A few cases of absence of means of heating were discovered, and have been referred to H.M. Chief Lady Inspector of Factories. WORKPLACES—(Kitchens). Forty new Kitchens of Restaurants or Tea-rooms have been inspected and placed on the Register during the past year. The number of periodical inspections made was 285. As usual, many basement kitchens were found to be insufficiently ventilated. Other defects found were dirty walls and ceilings, defective kitchen floors, and unsuitable, dirty, and defective sanitary accommodation. 198 re-inspections were paid in connection with the work required. OUTWORKERS. The lists of outworkers sent in by employers during 1908 contain 624 entries of premises in the City where work is carried on. As one outworker may be employed by several employers, each of whom may send in his name twice in one year, it is not surprising to find that these 624 entries represent only 214 outworkers. Of this number 106 had been notified in previous years, and the remaining 108 were newly notified as outworkers, though the majority of them were already on the Workshop Register. In view of the fact that that part of the Home Office Return which deals with outworkers is headed "Home Work," it is necessary to point out that the actual number of outworkers carrying on work in their own homes is only 43, made up as follows:— Thirteen employ persons other than members of their own families, and appear on the Register of Workshops; twenty-five employ only members of their own families, and are classed as having " domestic workshops." Five are "occasional workers," i.e., those whose "labour is "exercised at irregular intervals and does not furnish the whole or "principal means of living to the family," and who are consequently exempt from the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act. There has been no occasion to take action under section 108 or sections 109 and 110 in Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, with regard to any outworker's premises during the past year. The following Table shows the number of premises in the City where work is carried on by "outworkers"— 86 Return showing the number of places in the City where work in carried on by "outworkers" in scheduled trades:— Factories.

The complaints which have been received during the past year with regard to insanitary conditions in offices in which women clerks are employed may be grouped under the following headings:— Absence of any sanitary accommodation. No separate sanitary accommodation. Unsuitable or defective sanitary accommodation. Offices overcrowded. Offices in dirty condition. These have all been investigated, and the defects found were, in every instance, remedied. One complaint which was received of absence of any means of heating in an office was, on enquiry, found to be unwarranted, the whole building being efficiently heated by hot-water pipes, and the rooms were well ventilated and in good sanitary condition generally. The inspection, however, was not without value, as in the course of it a condition of dampness (due to condensation) was discovered in the conveniences set apart for lady clerks. On the Manager's attention being called to this the necessary steps were taken to remedy the nuisance. In addition to the offices inspected an investigation has been made as to the sanitary accommodation provided for women serving in tobacconists' and other stalls at railway stations. It was found that in some instances these employes had free access to the Ladies' Waiting Rooms at the Stations. In the case of Stations where there is no Ladies' Waiting Room the firms concerned were communicated with, and after some correspondence a satisfactory arrangement was arrived at. Your Women Inspectors have also dealt with several complaints which have been made with regard to the sanitary accommodation provided for women employed as Shop Assistants. LADIES' WAITING ROOMS AT RAILWAY STATIONS. The usual inspections of Ladies' Waiting Rooms at Railway Stations have been carried out, involving one hundred and twenty-three visits. The defects found were all of a minor character, and were promptly remedied on being brought to the notice of the Railway Companies concerned. The marked improvement in the condition of these waiting rooms since they were first systematically inspected in 1902 has been well maintained. One Ladies' Waiting Room has been closed during this year, viz., the second class one at Holborn Viaduct Station. 89 UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES FOR WOMEN. The usual inspections of underground conveniences have been carried out. There are at present 13 of these conveniences for women in the City, situated at:— Aldersgate Street (North). Aldersgate Street (General Post Office). Aldgate Bishopsgate Street Without. Circus Place (Finsbury Circus). Farringdon Street (North). Farringdon Street (South), Ludgate Circus. Golden Lane. Guildhall Buildings. Holborn. Minories. Upper Thames Street (near London Bridge). West Smithfield. Any defects found have been reported to the Engineer. CHILDREN ACT, 1908. (8. EDW. 7. Ch. 67.) This Act received the Royal Assent on the 21st December, 1908, and will come into force on 1st April, 1909. The Corporation is the Authority within the City for carrying out Part I. of the Act dealing with Infant Life Protection, which provides: Section 1. That when a person undertakes for reward the nursing and maintenance of one or more infants under the age of seven years, apart from their parents, or having no parents, he shall, within 48 hours from the reception of any such infant, give notice in writing thereof to the Sanitary Authority. In cases when the period for which the infant is received is for 48 hours or less, this Section does not apply. Under Section 2, it is made the duty of the local authority to put this part of the Act into execution, and to make inquiry with regard to persons within their district undertaking the nursing and maintenance of infants coming within the scope of the Act. The local authority is further charged with the duty of seeing that such infants are visited from time to time by duly appointed inspectors of either sex. Provision is also made to afford such inspectors right of entry in cases where there is reason to believe there is a contravention of this part of the Act. 90 Section 3 prohibits the reception of infants by certain persons under certain circumstances. Under Section 4, the local authority may fix the number of infants which may be retained in any dwelling. Section 5 requires the removal of infants kept: in overcrowded, dangerous, or insanitary premises; by drunken, immoral, or other undesirable person; or by any person or in any premises in contravention of the Act. Section 6 directs that notice shall be given to the Coroner of the death of any infant notified as being maintained for reward. Section 7 enacts that no person in charge of an infant coming within the terms of the Act shall have an insurable interest in such infant, and the attempt to effect insurance is made a punishable offence. Sections 8 and 9 relate to notices given and penalties that may be imposed upon offenders, from whose custody any infant is to be removed to a place of safety. With regard to the supervision of these nurse-children, the Select Committee on Infant Life Protection strongly advocated that, so far as possible, their inspection should be deprived of any rigid or formal official character, and certainly carried out by women. It was desirable, therefore, that Women Inspectors should be appointed for the purposes of the Act in the City, and on the advice of your Medical Officer, on the representation of the Sanitary and General Purposes Committees, the Court of Common Council transferred the administration of Part I. of the Children Act, relating to Infant Life Protection to the Sanitary Committee, who have at their disposal Women Sanitary Inspectors possessing special qualifications for appointment under the Act as regards Infant Life Protection. At a meeting of the Common Council on the 4th February, Miss A. J. Safford and Miss M. M. Pole were duly appointed, on the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, Inspectors for the purpose of the Act, and the Committee authorised to take such steps as might be necessary to bring its provisions to the public notice. 91 NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. An abstract of this Act was given in your Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report for 1907. The Act is adoptive at the discretion of any Local Authority in the United Kingdom. Its object is to ensure early notification of births to the Medical Officer of Health in order, when the circumstances appear to require it, that the mother may be advised in the nurture and rearing of the child in the earlier stages of its existence. It provides that in the case of every child born within the area, it shall be the duty of the father of the child, if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, and of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within thirty-six hours of the birth, to give notice in writing of the birth to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the child is born. The Act also provides for the notification of still-births. This useful measure has been supplemented by the Children Act referred to on p. 89. Both these provisions are the result of the movement for the prevention of infantile mortality. The Notification of Births Act was formally adopted by the Corporation on 28th November, 1907, and having duly received the consent of the Local Government Board, came into force in the City on the 19th February, 1908. Lists of all notifications of births received by your Medical Officer are transmitted weekly to the London County Council in accordance with the provisions of Sub-section (5) of Section 2 of the Act in a form prescribed by the Local Government Board. When notification is made by a midwife, her name and address are also added, and care is taken to ascertain whether she is on the Midwives' Register. Copy of a circular letter sent on 4th February, 1908, to medical men and midwives practising in the City, is given in Appendix G, p. 209. During the whole year, 277 births were registered in the City, the parents being non-residents in 25 cases. Forty-nine of these births occurred in public Institutions in the City. In cases where the parents were non-residents, the births were reported to the Medical Officer of the district to which they belonged. Thirteen illegitimate births were registered during the year.* From the date of the Act coming into operation in the City, viz., 19th February, 1908, until the end of the year, 175 births of children whose parents resided in the City were notified, including six still-births. Forty-eight other notifications relating to children not belonging to the City were received during the same period and forwarded to the Medical Officers of their respective districts. * See footnote on p. 17. 92 Of the 175 City births, 138 were notified by Medical Men. 8 „ „ „ Parents. 23 „ „ „ Midwives. 6 ,, „ from Hospitals, Institutions, &c. In 50.9 per cent. of these, the notification was received within the Statutory limit of thirty-six hours, and the remaining 49.1 per cent. being sent at later periods. At the request of the Registrars of the two sub-districts in the City, a list of all notifications has been forwarded to them monthly. The routine visiting of infants has been conducted on the same lines as hitherto, except that in the case of those born since January, 1908, the three visits per case extending over the first 12 months of life have been, when necessary, increased to five during the first six months. The Woman Inspector engaged in making these visits has, almost without exception, been well received, and the mothers have expressed their willingness to supply any information dealing with the care of their children. Some cases have, unhappily, arisen when poverty has been the cause of the mother being physically incapable of nourishing her infant. In such circumstances, the attention of the Relieving Officer has been directed to the case, and, if necessary, letters of admission to Hospital obtained from the Justices sitting in the City, to whom I take this opportunity of conveying my thanks for their kindly offices in this respect. It should be mentioned that a considerable number of families have left the City during the year, and in cases where there was a child under one year of age, where possible, the Medical Officer of Health of the district into which the family removed has been notified. The same course has been adopted when infants born in the City have been put to nurse elsewhere. The mothers are, wherever possible, induced to suckle their children. The proportion of infants who have been breast fed for the first six months of life was 51 per cent. The first 10 months' working of the Act confirms what has long been more than suspected, viz., that there is a lack of accuracy in the registration of births, both as regards date and place, and it will be therefore a valuable check upon registration in those places where it has been adopted. 93 As a case in point, it was ascertained that in one instance a Jewish parent registered a birth as having occurred on the 19th August, whereas, as a fact, the child was born on the 6th May, as notified by the midwife who attended the parent. In another instance, a parent having business premises in the City and his home in Finsbury, registered the child as having been born in the City. There are some grounds for believing that many people are under the impression that children born in the City acquire thereby certain rights and privileges. I am informed that it is a common occurrence for persons born in the City, when making application for taking up the Freedom of the City at the Chamberlain's Court, to expect that they are entitled to it without any payment. Incorrect registrations, when discovered, were reported to the Registrars for the information of the Registrar-General. Delails are given on page 17 of mortality in the City of children under one year of age. The number of visits paid to infants during the year was 942. In the course of these visits, 47 sanitary defects found were remedied by the district Sanitary Inspectors. As it might be thought by some that the simplest method of ensuring early notification of births would have been to compel registration of births within five days, as is required in the case of deaths by the Births and Deaths Registration Acts, I submit the Registrar-General's opinion on the matter given before the Notification of Births Act was passed. "After serious consideration of the situation as it presents itself "to me, I have come to the conclusion that, whilst it would be unwise "at present to disturb the existing organisation of birth registration, "a well-devised system of early notification—legalized and worked in "conjunction with the present registration system on the one hand, "and with sanitary administration on the other—might, along with other "motive forces, serve as a most effective and lasting barrier with which "to stem the tide of infant mortality." From the experience already obtained in the working of the Notification of Births Act there is reason to believe this prediction will be in a great measure realized. 94 INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN. The Corporation, at the request of the Home Secretary, have undertaken to make an investigation into the industrial employment of women as far as it relates to the mothers of children born in the City, with a view of ascertaining whether there is sufficient justification for enforcing further restriction with regard to the employment of women in factories or workshops both before and after childbirth. The enquiry will extend over two years, and the results of the first year's investigation are now given. The proportion of women in industrial employment in the City during pregnancy is comparatively small, as many of them being wives of caretakers, are simply engaged in ordinary domestic duties, although in some cases where it is a part of their work to clean offices and many stairs, the work may be described as laborious. Further, there are many Jewish mothers residing in the City amongst whom it is unusual, after marriage, to do other than home work. The following summary relates to 122 children born during the year 1908 who had completed six months' existence during that year. PARENTAGE. British Fathers 76 or 62.3 per cent.

The alarm created in the public mind, owing to statements made in the Press and elsewhere as to the insanitary conditions prevailing in the canning factories in Chicago, and the seizure and condemnation of quantities of unsound tinned foods returned from South Africa after the war, has largely subsided, but the results of an investigation, conducted in the City on behalf of the Corporation, and of a further enquiry subsequently carried out in co-operation with the London Chamber of Commerce, showed there was great room for improvement in the methods of preparing tinned foods in other places than the United States of America. The circumstances were as follows: In June, 1906, I reported to the Sanitary Committee that, owing to the enormous quantities of tinned meat imported from abroad for consumption in this country, and the importance of the question both to the public health and to traders in the City, it was advisable to make a special investigation into the character of the tinned foods offered for sale to the public. The method of preserving food products in tins renders it difficult to rightly judge the nature and quality of the enclosed article, and no amount of inspection by external appearances can be sufficient to guarantee safety to the public health. "Blown" or damaged tins are readily detected, but the real danger lies in the difficulty of discovery of diseased or unsound meat after preservation. The only way in which the public can be adequately protected is to insist upon a strict inspection of the animals used, both before and after slaughter at the factory, coupled with the best sanitary surroundings through the whole process of manufacture. Thirteen samples of tinned meats from America were accordingly sent to Dr. Klein for bacteriological analysis, and 13 other samples of the same brands submitted to the Public Analyst, Dr. Teed, for chemical examination. The latter reported that all these samples were free from ptomaines, and that all except two (of which there was insufficient for examination) were free from boric acid and salicylic acid, and that no change had taken place in the constitution of the articles that would interfere with the analysis. The bacteriological examination showed that of these 13 samples, two were non-sterile—of which one was harmful to animals fed thereon. Five were sterile and proved themselves harmless to animals. Six were sterile, but injurious when eaten, as all the animals eating it, on being killed, showed signs of fatty degeneration of the liver, and the sample, although sterile and noninjurious. contained five human hairs (two of negro). 97 The results made it clear that some deleterious influence was exerted upon the animals subjected to the test in the six cases where the food was sterile, and in one case where it was non-sterile. In neither instance was any pathogenic organism identified, and Dr. Teed reported the absence of any ptomaines, boric and salicylic acids. The matter evidently required further investigation, and the Committee, at my suggestion, decided that further tests should be made, including British and Colonial goods as well as those from America. Forty-four samples were therefore obtained and submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported on them as under. Summarising the results of the bacteriological analysis, these samples may be grouped as follows :— "Group I. Samples which are sterile, and in mice caused no ill effects of any "kind. "Group II. Samples which are sterile, but caused in mice ill effects. "Group III. Samples which are not sterile, but caused in mice no ill effects. "Group I. comprises the majority of the samples analysed. Group II. could "have caused their ill effect, not owing to any microbe they contained—they "being sterile, but owing to some deleterious substance present in the material "before sterilisation, and which material was not affected by the subsequent "heating. Such are ptomaines and preservatives. "The samples of Group III. contained harmless microbes in the form of "spores, which are widely distributed in dust and in air, of which it is not known "whether, and under what conditions, they cause in animal food undesirable "changes. "As far as our present knowledge goes, they themselves do not cause "putrefactive changes, although they are occasionally found in association with "other more important microbes in decomposing materials. They themselves are "harmless to man and animals. "As has been mentioned in my Report, all the samples on opening were, to "the eye and nose, quite free from any change—fermentative and putrid—and "therefore the person opening them would not raise any objection to their being "fit for consuming. But the samples of Group II. would nevertheless be "objectionable on account of their ill effects, and those of Group III. would be "objectionable because not sterile. The principle that all preserved food should "be sterile is a good one, even if the microbes we find by our analyses are spores "and quite harmless; we do not know sufficient about their possible effects and "changes in course of long periods on the materials, such as are contained in "these tinned samples. (signed) "E. KLEIN." For convenience the results of the first series referred to in the foregoing are included With those of the second series. 98 The country of origin and number of samples examined were as under:— Prepared in Great Britain 12 „ ,, the Colonies 9 „ „ U.S.A. .34 „ „ South America 2 57 Of these the following 28, or only 49 per cent., were found to be in a wholly satisfactory condition, viz.:— Great Britain 6, or 50 per cent. Colonial 7 „ 77 „ U.S.A. 15 „ 44 „ South America None. 28 Summarising the results of the examination it was found that of the 57 samples— 28, or about 49 per cent, were good. 10 „ „ .18 „ were bad. 19 „ „ 33 „ were doubtful. The discovery of human hairs in four of the American preparations, and dirt and soot in another, is sufficient indication of a laxity of supervision in manufacture to give warrant for some of the charges made against the packing bouses in the United States. Dr. Klein's research showed clearly there was room for considerable improvement in the manner in which tinned meats were prepared both at home and abroad, and I advised the Committee that, having regard to the public health, it would be a wise precaution to institute further enquiries as to the quality of tinned food sold in the City. Both wholesale and retail traders in this country had already suffered seriously from the scare that had been created, and care had to be taken not to further prejudice them. In all cases where the results were found to be unsatisfactory, the retail firms were notified, and they withdrew the goods in question from sale. One English firm, being satisfied by their own experiments that their goods were unsatisfactory, ceased to manufacture, and the representatives in this country of foreign packers approached the Chamber of Commerce on the subject. This resulted in the Chamber endorsing an opinion expressed by their Canned Goods Trade Section that the Sanitary Committee should defer arriving at any decision until two or more men of the highest professional repute had examined and reported upon similar samples. 99 Upon the invitation of the Sanitary Committee a deputation of six members of the Chamber attended before the Committee to consider the correspondence that had passed in relation to this matter. Further correspondence ensued, and it was finally agreed that Dr. W. Bulloch, of the London Hospital, Professor R. T. Hewlett, of King's College, and Dr. Klein, of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, should make an investigation into a certain number of samples of tinned meat, the samples being taken by myself and supplied to the three bacteriologists. Samples were taken in triplicate, and examined independently by each analyst. Fifty samples were taken, which included all those found to be unsatisfactory in the previous examination, with the addition of certain others. In due course, the gentlemen engaged in this investigation presented their reports, copies of which were forwarded to the Chamber of Commerce, together with a copy of my interpretation of the results which were laid before the Chamber on the 7th March, 1907. Consideration of space prohibits their inclusion here, but it will be sufficient to say that the results in many cases were unsatisfactory, as all three investigators, two of whom had been selected by the Chamber of Commerce, who presumably represented the interests of the Home traders, reported that a considerable proportion of the samples were not sterile. The importance of this matter was directly pointed out to the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce at a Conference with the Sanitary Committee for the purpose of considering the reports, held at the Gnildhall on the 22nd March. On the 11th April, 1907, a copy of the following resolution was received from the Special Committee of the Canned Goods Trade Section of the Chamber of Commerce:— "That whilst believing that the sterilisation of Tinned Foods is desirable "whenever practicable, this Committee of the London Chamber of Commerce "is of opinion that the reports of the Bacteriological Experts employed to "examine samples of such foods are of so satisfactory a nature that there appears "no necessity for unduly alarming the public by publishing them, as on "account of their technical character there is always the risk of their being " misunderstood." It was impossible to accept this view of the matter, and in order that a clear understanding may be had of the situation, I submit the opinion expressed by the Experts referred to in the above resolution:— Dr. Klein.—"Although the microbes found in some of the samples were "few and of a harmless nature, it cannot be doubted that in course of time " physical and chemical changes might, and probably would, be caused by them, 100 "which would materially alter the character of the food, and make the latter "even harmful. "For these reasons I think it is most important that all preserved food intended " to be kept for an indefinite period should be absolutely sterile." Dr. Bulloch.—"In conclusion it is my opinion that all foods of the class "examined and intended to be kept if necessary for an indefinite period, should be "Sterile, and that sterilisation should be accomplished by heat alone, and in a " suitable vessel which can be hermetically sealed." Professor Hewlett.—"The B. subtilis and the B. mesentericus vulgatus seem to "be quite harmless organisms—guineapigs inoculated intraperitoneally and mice "fed with cultures being unaffected. Although this is the case, it must be a matter "of some concern that nearly two-thirds of the canned foods examined were not "sterile. If, for example, the sporing anaerobic Bacillus Botulinus of sausage "poisoning should by any chance be introduced into a sample, there is considerable "probability that it would survive and bring about changes in the food which would "result in the production of substances having a toxic action. It is of interest that "cocci and organisms of the B. coli and B. entertidis groups were not detected. "I hope also that I have made it clear in my Report that I view with " concern the fact that so many samples are not sterile. "I am in absolute agreement with Dr. Klein and Dr. Bulloch in considering that "these canned foods should be sterile." The verdict of these Experts must be accepted as final, and it only remained, lierefore, as a satisfactory solution of the difficulty, to induce the Chamber of "ommerce to fall into line with this view. Further correspondence ensued, and on the 14th May, 1907, a letter was eceived from the Chamber of Commerce enclosing a copy of the following ircular to Packers and Manufacturers of Tinned and Preserved Foods proposed 3 be issued by their Canned Trade Section. " London Chamber of Commerce, " lith May, 1907. "CANNED GOODS TRADE SECTION. "EXAMINATION OF TINNED FOODS. "In view of the action taken by the various Governmental and Local "Authorities in the United Kingdom, to enquire into the methods of manufacture "and packing of canned foods imported into this country, and their suitability "for human consumption, I am desired to state that in the opinion of the Canned "Goods Trade Section of the London Chamber of Commerce it is essential that "packers of such goods should adopt a process of manufacture which would result "in the complete sterilisation of those articles of food which, without detriment of u their nutritive value, can be so treated. "This opinion is expressed as a result of a careful bacteriological examination ot a large number of samples of such food, and as the outcome of the conferences "which have taken place between the Sanitary Committee of the Corporation of "London and this Chamber upon the subject." 101 This letter, while showing a desire on the part of the Chamber of Commerce to meet the wishes of the Sanitary Committee, fell short of the necessities of the situation. It was understood at the Conference held on the 22nd March, 1907, that there was a feeling that as sterilisation was not applicable to all classes of tinned goods equally alike, a schedule should be drawn up of those it was proposed to exempt. The Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce was therefore asked in a letter, dated 7th June, 1907, at the instance of the Sanitary Committee, to furnish them, for consideration at an early date, with a schedule of foods it was proposed to exempt, and with regard to other tinned articles that an undertaking be obtained from the Packers that they would adopt a process which would result in complete sterilisation. In reply thereto, in a letter dated 23rd July, 1907, the Committee was informed that the Canned Goods Section of the Chamber of Commerce had found it impracticable to make the Schedule of foods asked for, but that the packers would give every consideration to the Representatives of the Chamber. It was also stated that copies of the Reports of the three bacteriologists had been sent to the Local Government Board, who they considered should have it before them, for information only and not for publication, during the framing of any regulations the Board might make under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907. In this connection I submit for consideration the general conclusion arrived at by Major W. W. O. Beveridge, D.S.O., and Captain H. B. Fawcus of the Royal Army Medical Corps, as the result of a series of exhaustive experiments with preserved meat, contained in their Report to the Sub-Committee on Food of the War Office Committee on the Physiological Effects of Food, Training and Clothing on the Soldier. (Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps, March, 1908.) "(a) The bacillus under consideration, although non-pathogenic to animals, "decomposes tinned meats, and renders them quite unfit for consumption. There"fore processes of sterilisation of tins of meat must be used which will destroy the "spores of this bacillus. The optimum'temperature of growth of this bacillus is "blood heat (370 C.) 99° F. At this temperature inoculated tins of meat become "rapidly decomposed, but this decomposition is not necessarily made apparent at "once by the presence of gas in the tin. Blowing of the tins often does not take place within a fortnight, even at this temperature. Tins of meat contaminated uwith the spores of this bacillus could be kept at temperatures of 22° C. (72° F.) "and under for many months, without showing any signs of blowing. If, however, "such contaminated tins, although apparently sound when examined in this country, "were exposed to a temperature such as is likely to be met with in the Tropics, they "would rapidly become decomposed. 102 "(J) The rate of penetration of heat into the substance of the meat in tins during "sterilisation is extremely variable. We have based our conclusions on the average "of many experiments. To ensure complete sterilisation, the temperature of "the medium surrounding the tins must always be above 112° C. (234° F.). The "lowest temperature of the surrounding fluid which will completely sterilise "the tins within a reasonable time is 120° C. (248° F.), and this temperature must "act for not less than sixty minutes. From the two experiments recorded with a "fluid boiling at 130° C. (266° F.), it would appear that even then at least an hour "would be required to ensure the death of these very resistant spores. We are "aware that the above results do not tally with the usually accepted idea of tin " thermal death point of spore-bearing bacilli, but we would point out that experi"ments have not before, to our knowledge, been made with this particular bacillus. "The experiments were carried out with every available precaution against error "and repeated often enough to ensure accuracy." MARKING OF TINNED AND OTHER PRESERVED FOOD PRODUCTS. In June last I endeavoured to come to some arrangement with the New Zealand Authorities with regard to the marking of tinned foods in such a way as to indicate where and when they were packed. With this object in view the Chief Veterinarian to the New Zealand Government conferred with the Managers of some of the leading firms in New Zealand, who, while they pointed out some commercial objections to the idea as originally propounded, expressed themselves quite willing to do what was desired, provided it were done in such a manner as not to raise any objections on the part of the importers in this country. The following arrangement was suggested:— (1) That each tin bear a mark consisting of the initials of the packing company or individual, with perhaps the registered number of their premises (or the registered number alone, the New Zealand Veterinary Office supplying your Medical Officer with a list showing the premises to which each number applies). (2) That a cypher mark indicating approximately the date of packing be affixed to each tin. A schedule of cypher marks being sent to your Medical Officer. Each cypher mark to indicate a period of say two months—thus, one mark indicating January and February, 1909, the next mark March and April, 1909, and so on. In reply to a request to be furnished with our views hereon, I expressed my pleasure at hearing that the Managers of some of the leading firms in New Zealand realised the importance of the question, and were prepared to deal with it practically. 103 It was pointed out that the object was the protection of the public without interfering with commercial interests, and that it was clear that if a system of marking were adopted in any country such fact would be of great value as affecting a guarantee of age and condition. With regard to the first suggestion made with regard to a cypher mark indicating the names of the packers, I agreed this would meet the case. It is not necessary that the name of the packer should b e known to everyone, provided that the responsible authorities were in possession of the information, and a registered number or mark of some kind would well serve the purpose if a key were applied and kept up to date. As to suggestion (2) that the date should be indicated by a cypher, I was unable to concur, as in my view the figures of the year should be plainly shown upon the tin. If a cypher were used the information would be available for the protection of the trade only, while the object sought is to afford the purchaser as much protection as he is entitled to. There is a general consensus of opinion amongst health administrators that all tinned and potted meat and other food products should have the date or year of packing marked thereon, and it is to be hoped that the Local Government Board will bear this in mind when considering the framing of any regulation they may make with regard to this class of food under the provisions of the Public Health (Regulations to to Food) Act, 1907. In a Report by Dr. Buchanan on Tin in Canned Goods, dated 18th December, 1908, the following remarks are made: — "The enquiry illustrates the advantage which would be gained from the "administrative point of view if the person or firm by whom canned foods are "prepared were in a position to determine by marks, labels, or otherwise, the date "and place of preparation, and could be required to furnish such particulars, on "reason shown, to public health authorities concerned with food inspection and "wholesomeness of foods. Such a practice would have advantage from other points "of view, which need not here be gone into." 104 SODA WATER. In the course of an investigation into the cause of a case of diphtheria in May, 1907, it was found that suspicion attached to soda water, which the patient had been in the habit of purchasing from a City shop. A sample of this soda water was therefore taken and submitted to your Bacteriologist, who reported as follows:— "I received on May 2nd an unopened bottle of soda water for analysis qua " Diphtheria. "About 99 c.c. of the contents, after allowing to stand and to sediment, were "subjected to the centrifuge. With the deposit large plates and tubes were " inoculated and incubated at 37 deg. C. As a result the following was found: "The sediment contained an enormous number of microbes; they were (a) cocci, "(b) some sporing bacilli, and (c) the main mass were small grampositive non"mobile bacilli which in shape resembled diphtheroid microbes, but they gave no "Neisser staining, and injected in large doses into a guineapig's subcutaneous "tissue caused no change whatever, the animal developed no tumour and remained "quite normal. It is clear from these observations that the chief microbe present "in the sediment is not the Klebs-Loffler Diphtheria bacillus, although it most "probably—judged by the character and aspect of the colonies, the shape and "grampositive staining—belongs to the large tribe of 'diphtheroid bacilli.' "I was not a little surprised at the fact that this soda water contained such "abundance of living microbes capable of growing at body temperature. "The charging of the water with carbonic acid seemed to have left the water, "no doubt originally impure, in an unaltered state—unaltered, that is, as to its "abnormal bacterial nature." In consequence of the unsatisfactory condition of this sample, it seemed advisable that a general enquiry should be made into the character of the soda water sold throughout the City, and for this purpose thirty-six samples were collected from various shops and submitted to bacteriological analysis. The results of Dr. Klein's examinations may be shortly summarized as follows:— No. of Samples. Pure 10 or 27.7 per cent. Fairly pure 7 or 19.4 „ „ Impure 19 or 52.7 „ „ 36 These figures are sufficiently striking to call for further action with a view of effecting an improvement in the quality of soda water usually sold. 105 In all cases where impurity was found, the result was communicated to the manufacturers, and they at once expressed a desire to ascertain the cause of contamination and their intention of taking active steps to remove the same. A large number of factories were visited at the request of the owners. It was found, that in most cases the causes of contamination were defects in the system of bottle washing and exposure of water to risk of pollution in tanks constructed of wood (which it is practically impossible to keep at all times in a cleanly condition) and to the absence or imperfection of covers to the receptacles containing either the water or solution. In every case where the water was found to be unsatisfactory, some sufficient cause was found and pointed out to the manufacturers. The above facts were reported to the Sanitary Committee on the 24th June, and your Medical Officer of Health suggested that inasmuch as the makers were, up to this time, unaware of the condition of their water, and were anxious to do anything that was found necessary or advisable to improve the same, that rather than run the risk of seriously damaging an important industry, instead of at once publishing these results, he should be authorised to summon a conference of the trade and, after laying the position before them, ascertain their views as to the best course to adopt, both in their own and the public interest. This was agreed to, and a meeting of the Trade was held on the 18th July, 1907, which was attended by a large number of Mineral Water Manufacturers. A statement was made by your Medical Officer as to the result of the analyses, and the urgent need for immediate and effective action. A series of Regulations was also laid before the meeting which it wae suggested should be considered and adopted either in their entirety or with such modifications as might be suggested. SODA WATER FACTORIES. SUGGESTED REGULATIONS. Premises.—To be in good sanitary condition, Certificate from Medical Officer of Health, Sanitary Authority. Water.—Source of supply to be bacteriological ly examined at entrance to works. Filters.—If used, only Pasteur-Chamberland or Berkefeld filter. Storage Tanks.—To be of impervious material, viz., slate, glass or galvanized iron (not wood) and fitted with efficient, covers (glass or galvanized iron, with flanges) not wood. Tanks to be cleaned periodically. 106 Solution Tanks.—To be covered with impervious material (not wood) and cleaned after eachemptying. Bottle Washing.—All bottles to have preliminary soaking, and labels, &c., removed in separate tanks. Washing Tanks.—(1) If revolving trays are used, the water to be kept running in and out. Tanks to be of impervious material (not wood). The water to be entirely emptied, and the tanks cleansed several times during the day. The washing, brushing and rinsing tanks to be all fitted with an independent supply, water not to be allowed to run from one tank to another.

All water used for washing bottles, corks, rings and stoppers, and for rinsing bottles to be of the same standard of purity as the water used for making the mineral water. Unless this be the case the purity of the finished article is ruined. Patent Ball Stoppered Bottles to have the rings removed before washing. (The shape of these bottles prevents proper cleaning). For safety only corked bottles should be used. (Signed) W. COLLINGRIDGE, Medical Officer of Health, City of London. Guildhall, 9th July, 1907. 107 The Conference, after a long discussion, agreed to accept the suggestions of your Medical Officer, and it was further decided that a Register be kept by the Mineral Water Trade Protection Society of those makers who would undertake to carry out these Regulations in their works, and who were prepared to obtain the certificates as to the sanitation of the premises and the bacteriological purity of their products. On the 17th September, 1907, in accordance with this decision, the following circular letter was issued by the Society to the trade. "The London Bottle Exchange and Mineral Water Trade Protection Society, Ltd., " Riidler Place, "Holland Street, "Blackfriars, "London, S.E., "September 17th, 1907.

A separate Certificate will be required for each “ 'Factory where Mineral Waters are manufactured.' “A register will, therefore, be prepared for the purpose of recording the “names of those Firms desiring to be registered. “For Registration, it will be necessary for each owner of a Mineral Water “ Factory to produce : “(1) A Certificate from the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which “the Factory is situated, to the effect that the premises are in good sanitary “ condition. “(2) A bacteriological analysis of the water supply he uses. (N.B.—Where “the public water supply is used, the certificate of the authorities supplying “the water will be sufficient.) “(3) A bacteriological analysis of the finished goods. 108 "(4) To undertake to carry out the Regulations as shown on a form similar “to that attached hereto. “The Certificates will be submitted to the Medical Officer of Health of the City “of London, who will authorise registration. “It is suggested that the names of the Firms so registered shall be published “from time to time in the Trade Journal, and later, that a label may be issued to “those Members so registered, such publication to be deferred until sufficient time “has elapsed to allow of the completion of the necessary arrangements—say “six months. “This label would be accepted generally by the public as a guarantee under which “ the water was made, and would considerably enhance the value of the product. “ It is intended that the Certificate shall be for a period of one year from date, and “ shall be renewed from time to time provided the Regulations are carried out. “To ensure compliance with these Regulations, it is suggested that an independent “Inspector should, if necessary, be appointed. “When readjustment of Factories and replacement of plant is necessary, “reasonable time will be allowed. Yours faithfully, “W. DAVENPORT, “ Secretary.” “SODA WATER FACTORIES. “Regulations. “Water Supply.—The Water Supply used in the manufacture to be “bacteriologically examined. The standard of purity should not be lower than the “water supplied for drinking purposes in any district where the public water supply “is used. The authorities supplying such water will furnish free bacteriological “analysis of their water. “Analysis of Products.—Bacteriological analysis of the goods produced must “be furnished with the application for Registration. Bacteriologists have been “approved by the Medical Officer of Health of the City of London and by the “Society, and their certificates will be accepted. “Filters.—If the water is quite pure no filter is necessary, if impure no filter “is safe in practice. If filtration is considered advisable only special filters as “approved by the Medical Officer of Health should be used. “Rings and Stoppers.—The Medical Officer of Health of the City of London “calls attention to the impossibility of properly cleaning stoppers or patent bottles “having rings inserted in the bottles unless such rings are removed. In deference “however to the general views of the trade, and inasmuch as stoppers are used to “meet the demand of the public, he agrees that it will be sufficient if all bottles “containing rings and stoppers and rings and stoppers when separated from the “bottle are soaked in a solution of bi-sulphate of lime, (1 in 250, say¾ oz. to 1 gallon “of water), and before using washed in a stream of running water. 109 “Storage Tanks.—Storage Tanks should be constructed of some impervious “material, such as slate, glass, porcelain, galvanized iron or copper, not wood, and ''fitted with efficient covers, also of impervious material not wood. Tanks should “be cleaned at stated periods. “Solution Tanks.—Solution Tanks should be constructed of some impervious “material, such as slate, glass, porcelain, galvanized iron or copper, not wood, and “fitted with efficient covers, also of similar impervious material, not wood, and “cleaned after each emptying. “Bottle Washing.—All bottles to have preliminary soaking, and labels, &c., “removed before placing in washing tanks. This preliminary soaking may be “carried out in tanks of wood or other suitable material. “Washing Tanks.—If revolving trays are used, the water to be kept running “through. Washing Tanks to be of impervious material, viz.: slate, glass, “porcelain, galvanized iron or copper, not wood. The water to be entirely emptied “and the tanks cleansed several times during the day. “The washing, brushing and rinsing tanks to be all fitted with an independent “supply, water not to be allowed to run from one tank to another. The brushes “used for cleaning require constant attention, and are to be at once changed if “found defective or fouled. “It is most important that all water used for washing bottles, corks, rings and “stoppers, and for rinsing bottles, should be of the same standard of purity as the “water used for making the Mineral water. Unless this be the case the purity of “the finished article is uncertain.“ The result of this circular letter has been most encouraging. At the end of the year 1908, no less than 45 firms had registered with the Society, and others have announced their intention of doing so. The advantage of a Trade managing its own affairs requires no emphasizing, and the prompt response to the appeal is distinct evidence of the good faith and public spirit of the manufacturers. The effect has been that they have, in the interests of the Public Health as well as their own, voluntarily put themselves to very great expense in order to guarantee as pure a supply as is practically possible. The fact that this has been done should convey to the public a confidence in the purity of Mineral Waters which could be obtained in no other way. It is proposed to keep up the standard by systematic inspection, and publication of the names of those registered will be made by the Society. As to those who have not yet come into line, they will be dealt with in the usual way, samples being taken from time to time, and submitted for analysis, such action as is necessary being taken against the Vendors of any found to be impure. 110 ILLNESS FROM EATING CONTAMINATED FOOD. Two cases of illness occurred during the year in which the eating of questionable food was suspected of being the cause. The first was reported on the 10th January, 1908, when a customer, who had partaken of a meat pie at a licensed house in the City, was shortly after attacked with illness which necessitated his seeing a medical man. The unconsumed portion of the pie, which had been retained by the customer and brought by him to Guildhall, showed green colouration over the whole of the crust, penetrating to a depth of a quarter of an inch. This was submitted to your Public Analyst for examination, who reported that it contained .0053 per cent, of copper. The total amount of sulphate of copper present was .303 grains. Assuming that the pies were all approximately of the same weight as determined by weighing others, viz., 5¾ ounces, and that the copper was distributed uniformly over the undercrust, as was the case with the sample analysed, this is equivalent to *521 grains of sulphate of copper per pie, equal to 1.45 grains per pound. Every facility was rendered by the proprietor of the establishment where the pie was sold in an endeavour to ascertain how the copper gained access to it, but without result. The pies were made on the premises; the sample was one of a number eaten the same day, and was the only one of which any complaint was made. The premises were well kept, and a careful investigation, especially with regard to copper utensils used in cooking, failed to show any reason for the presence of the copper in the pie. It was noted that the pie submitted for examination was staler than the one unsold we found on the premises. No other case of the kind was reported. On the 21st February, 1908, a customer who had suffered severely after eating a fish rissole purchased in the City, was referred to me by the City Police. Samples of the food were submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported that it followed from his analysis and experiments that the material possessed no pathogenicity for the guineapig, but had all the bacterial characters of being polluted with filth. All the microbes found in the material were non-sporing, and therefore devitalized by a temperature of 70° C and over, and these results proved that the interior of the material could not have been heated to that temperature. Upon enquiry at the establishment where the food in question was prepared and sold, it was found that the fish employed in making rissoles was of the best quality, and the arrangements for the preparation and cooking left nothing to be desired. Ill This was an isolated case, no others being reported. It appeared therefore the cause of the evil was purely accidental. Although the cause of the mischief was not determined in either of the above cases, they illustrated the importance of ensuring that food should always be prepared under proper hygienic conditions. A systematic inspection of the kitchens and places where food is prepared in restaurants, &c., was instituted in 1902, when 155 were visited and placed on the register of workplaces. At the end of 1908 there were 839 of these places registered, viz.: 628 situated in restaurants, and 211 in tea rooms. 112 CONTAMINATED SHELLFISH. MUSSELS. On the 9th October, 1908, communications were received from the Medical Officers of Health of both Islington and Wandsworth relating to cases of enteric fever occurring in their districts, attributed in each instance to the patients having eaten mussels procured from salesmen in Billingsgate Market. The names were given of three dealers from whom the supplies in question were obtained, but in no case were they able to identify with certainty the source of origin of the mussels after a lapse of four weeks. Each of these firms dealt in Dutch mussels, and could produce certificates of the Netherland Government that their consignments came from unpolluted sources. One salesman suggested the possibility of South Dutch mussels being the produce of more than one firm, but sent in one consignment, and undertook in future to apply for certificates from each Dutch firm to whom they made payments. On the 23rd October I was informed of another case of enteric fever at Islington, in which mussels purchased from one of the salesman referred to in the previous case was supposed to be implicated, but upon enquiry it was found that this dealer had not supplied mussels to the local trader in Islington. On the 23rd November intimation was received that a woman, aged 36, residing in Wandsworth, who had eaten mussels procured from Billingsgate Market on the 5th November, was suffering from enteric fever, the first symptoms of the disease having appeared on the 14th November. It was found upon enquiry that the mussels in question were imported from Holland. A sample of these, marked (1), was taken at Billingsgate Market on the 23rd November, and submitted to Dr. Klein for analysis, who reported thereon as under:— “30th November, 1908. “I received, on 23rd November, a sample of mussels (South Dutch) which are “supposed to be similar to some that were connected with a case of enteric fever. “These mussels were dealt with in the following manner:— “After opening and draining the liquor, the bodies only of 12 mussels were cut “up finely in a sterile dish; the fluid resulting from this mince was turbid, and was “used for making the following cultures. I ought to state that the total amount of “this fluid was 18 c.c., and that each culture was charged with 1/10 c.c., that is, “1/15th part of the body of a mussel:— “(a). Surface of two large plates with Drigalski-Conradi medium. “(b) Two tubes containing Malachite green bile broth—mal. green, 1 :1,500. “(c) Two tubes containing Malachite green bile broth—mal. green, 1 : 1,600. 113 “The result of these cultures was as follows :— “(a) Drigalski plates—large number of colonies of the B. coli communis “type, calculated to amount to over 300 per body of one mussel; large numbers “of colonies of streptococci; few blue colonies, in general aspect not unlike “colonies of B. typhosus. “These blue colonies were sub-cultured in the usual media by which “B. typhosus is investigated ; agglutination tests with typhoid blood serum was “also made. The result was negative qua B. typhosus. “(b) Both Malachite green broth tubes, 1 : 1,500, were free of growth. “(c) Both Malachite green broth tubes had slight growth of cylindrical, very “motile bacilli. “These last tubes were used for sub-culture for further Drigalski plates; for “gelatine culture and for agglutination tests, with the result that the above bacilli “were not those of B. typhosus.“ These mussels were consigned to a firm of fish salesmen in the Market from a dealer at Bruinisse, in Holland, arriving vid the Batavia line of steamships. They were accompanied by a certificate, of which the following is a copy:— “KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS. “1908. “Valid only for the sending. “d.d. 21 November, 1908. “Certificate. “The Board of Fisheries on the Scheldt and Zealand streams after personal “investigation and personal knowledge, and also on the basis of the topographical “and bacillary investigations, carried on by its orders for considerable time at “fixed periods, both of the water and of the oysters/mussels, certifies that the “ponds and the breeding grounds of Mr. Jan Johns Wemmers, Bruinisse, situated “within the district of the Scheldt and Zealand streams, are free from noxious “microbes, and in consequence of their position, not exposed to any reasonable risk “of pollution by sewage, or objectionable filth. “The Board aforesaid. PRESIDENT LS “(Signatures of) and SECRETARY-TREASURER.” In view of the results of Dr. Klein's analysis, which showed that, although he was unable to identify the actual bacillus of enteric fever, the mussels were polluted with organisms of a fæcal character, a copy of his Report was forwarded to the Consul-General for the Netherlands, with the suggestion that it would be advisable that the local conditions at Bruinisse should be further investigated. 114 On the 25th November notification was received that a male, aged 28, residing in the Wandsworth district, who had eaten mussels supplied to a local dealer by a salesman in Billingsgate Market, was suffering from enteric fever, the first symptoms of the disease being observed on the 10th November. • In this instance the mussels had been procured from South Devonshire. A sample from this source was obtained, and sent to Dr. Klein for examination, -who reported as follows:— “7th December, 1908. “lie Mussels No. 2. Received November 30th.—They were analysed with a “view to detecting microbes belonging to the Gaertner typhoid group. “The bodies of 12 mussels were finely minced in a sterile dish ; the fluid “resulting from the 12 bodies amounted to about 18 c.c. In all instances the “fluid was turbid, and was used in amounts of 1/10 c.c. for each of two large plates “with Drigalski-Conradi medium and for each cf two tubes of Malachite green bile “salt broth. The result of these cultures and numerous sub-cultures was as “follows:— “Fifteen B. coli per mussel. “No B. Gaertner. No B. typhosus.” Upon enquiry it was found that the mussels in this case came from Lympston, South Devonshire, situated in the estuary of the River Exe. This place had been under the supervision of the Fishmongers' Company, and arrangements made for mussels to be gathered from an approved shoal, and no longer taken from a particular place, as in former times, that was considered an undesirable source of supply. As it was evident from Dr. Klein's Report that these instructions had been disregarded, strict instructions were given that in no case were mussels to be sent to market from places not approved by the Fishmongers' Company. I had occasion, in 1903, to direct attention to the danger incurred in the consumption of mussels derived from polluted sources. In the course of that year, out of 11 samples taken in Billingsgate Market and neighbourhood, no less than 10 were found to be sewage contaminated. Seven of the polluted samples having been imported from Holland, the Fishmongers' Company co-operated with the Netherlands Government with a view to a thorough investigation being made of the conditions under which they were cultivated and exported to this country. At the present time it is the custom of the wholesale dealers in the City, who purchase shellfish from Holland, to see that each consignment is accompanied by an official certificate issued by the Netherlands authorities to the effect that the produce is derived from unpolluted sources, but, in spite of these precautions, polluted samples, as shown above, are occasionally found. 115 Cases of mussel poisoning are common during the mussel season, the symptoms of the disease being disturbances of the gastro-intestinal and peripheral nervous systems. There is also very strong evidence that they may be an active agent in the spread of enteric fever. Dr. Bulstrode, in his valuable and exhaustive Report to the Local Government Board in 1896, quotes several instances where mussels have come under suspicion as having conveyed enteric fever. Recently (July, 1906), Dr. Robertson, Medical Officer of Health for Birmingham, has published a list of 74 cases coming under his notice where there appeared to be some connection between the consumption of mussels and disease. In 62 of these cases the onset of the disease occurred daring the height of the mussel season. In two notable instances mussels were eaten raw, and in each of these the consumer was attacked with typhoid fever. OYSTERS. A case of enteric fever in which oysters were supposed to be implicated was reported on the 30th November. The patient was attacked with the disease on the 16th November. He had attended public dinners in the City both on the 28th October and the 9th November, and it is believed partook of oysters on each occasion. If oysters were the cause of the illness the patient most likely became infected on the earlier of these dates, viz., 28th October. A sample of the oysters supplied was procured and submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported as follows:— “7th December, 1908. “Re Oysters No. 1. Received November 30th.—These were analysed with a view “to detecting microbes belonging to the Gaertner group. “Six oysters received. After draining the liquor the bodies of these oysters “were received in sterile dish and finely minced. The fluid resulting from these “six bodies amounted to about 16 c.c. The fluid was turbid, and 1/10 c.c. was used “for each of the following cultures, viz.: two large plates with Drigalski-Conradi “medium, and two tubes of Malachite green bile salt broth. “ The results o£ those cultures and numerous sub-cultures was as follows:— “ No B. Coli. No B. Gaertner, and No B. typhosus." These results show that, assuming the sample examined was derived from the same source as those eaten by the patient on the 28th October, the oysters in question were not connected with the illness. A case of enteric fever, attributed to the consumption of oysters at a City luncheon-bar, was reported from Wood Green on the 27th November, 1908. 116 In this case the oysters in question came from the neighbourhood of Whitstable. A sample, stated to have been derived from the same source as those suspected, was submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported thereon as under:— “ 7 th December, 1908. “ Oysters. No. 2. Received 30th November, 1908.—Six oysters received. Treated “ in the same manner as those in the previous case. (Oysters, Sample No. 1) gave “ the following results :— “ 16 B. coli per oyster. No B. Gaertner. No B. typhosus.“ This evidence was sufficient to show that there was no causal relation between the oysters and the disease. During December, 1908, the Medical Officers of Health of the Boroughs of Southwark, Paddington and Wandsworth respectively, were engaged in enquiries with regard to cases of enteric fever, when in each instance oysters supplied by a particular firm in the City were suspected. This dealer first came under my notice in June, 1903, when oysters sold by him were found to be polluted, and an order made at the Mansion House for their destruction. In November, 1906, in investigating a case of enteric fever at Walthamstow he was found selling “ oysters from his own beds,“ which proved to be highly polluted. Dutch oysters sold by him at that time were found to be grossly polluted. On the 8th December, 1906, he gave an undertaking to discontinue selling oysters from certain places until permitted to do so by the Fishmongers' Company, and on the 11th of that month it was ascertained that he had in the past purchased supplies from a company that had been in the habit of washing their oysters in a polluted pit. It was exceedingly difficult to secure any direct evidence with regard to where this man had purchased his supplies in the case brought to my notice in December last, as little or no reliance could be placed upon his statements. A sample taken at his shop in the City by an Inspector on the 15th December was stated by him in the forenoon to have come “ from their own beds,“ while in the afternoon he said they came from Holland. Dr. Klein's report on this sample was as under :— “ 21s£ December, 1908. “ Oysters. No. 3. Received 15th December.—The analysis of these oysters was “ made with ten oysters ; after draining the liquor, the bodies of these were finely “ minced, the resulting turbid fluid was used for cultures, with a view (a) of “ testing the condition of the oysters as to pollution in general, and (b) as to “ specific pollution with either the B. typhosus or with microbes belonging to the “ Gaertner-Paratyphoid group. 117 “As to (a)—The oysters showed no evidence of serious general pollution. The “number of B. coli calculated per one whole oyster was less than 8 (eight). There “were no Enteritidis spores per one whole oyster. “As to (b).—Two large Drigalski plates, each infected with 1/10th part of a whole “oyster, showed no colonies which in aspect, constitution and sub-cultures corre“sponded to either the B. typhosus or to the Gaertner-Paratyphoid group." These results indicate the oysters came from a source of doubtful purity, and the Fishmongers' Company, at my request, undertook to keep me advised from time to time as to where this dealer obtained his supplies in future. As regards the general question of shellfish pollution, it is greatly to be regretted that in spite of the opinion expressed by the Commissioners in their Fourth Report on sewage treatment and disposal, issued in December, 1903, that there is a growing demand for legislation dealing with the matter, and that “the evil is sufficiently grave to demand a remedy” no action has been taken by the Government for giving effect to the recommendations of the Commissioners. The following remedial measures were advocated in the Report referred to:— 1. Purification of sewage before its discharge in tidal waters. 2. The seizure and destruction of unwholesome shellfish exposed for sale. 3. The setting up of a competent authority to deal with all tidal waters, with power to control foreshores, to close dangerous beds, pits, ponds and layings, and in certain circumstances to require treatment of sewage. In my opinion, No. 3 is of the greatest importance, and until such competent authority, armed with ample powers to give effect to their views, is established, the present unsatisfactory state of affairs will continue. 118 DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILK SHOPS ORDERS. The additional powers conferred upon Sanitary Authorities in the Metropolis by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, include the following:— Section 5 enacts that any Sanitary Authority may remove from or refuse to enter on the Register the names of dairymen or purveyors of milk whose premises are. in the opinion of such Sanitary Authority, for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk thereon. Any person feeling aggrieved by any decision of a Sanitary Authority under the provisions of this section has the right of appeal within twenty-one days from the date of such decision to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. Hitherto purveyors of milk could be placed on the Register without any restrictions, and it is greatly to the advantage of the public health that Sanitary Authorities should be armed with the powers provided by this section as the sale of milk in small chandlers' shops, entirely unfitted for the proper storage of such a susceptible article as milk, is most objectionable from a public health point of view. The action taken in the course of the year under the section referred to above, with regard to those premises in the City unfitted for the sale or storage of milk, is referred to on page 67. At the end of the year there were 612 purveyors of milk registered in the City of London, as compared with 606 in 1907, an increase of 6. During the year the sale of milk was discontinued at 42 premises, and the owners' names removed from the register, 48 new premises were added, and 41 changes of ownership necessitating re-registration occurred. Each place on the register is regularly and systematically inspected, and their general condition is now much better than obtained in 1903, when the revised regulations for milkshops in the City came into force. The omission to re-close the lids of milk pans after serving a customer is still far too prevalent, 42 cases being reported in the course of the year; cautionary letters were sent to the offenders in each instance. Three cases of Infectious Disease (all Scarlet Fever) occurred at registered premises during the year, the necessary cleansing, disinfection, and usual precautionary measures being carried out in each instance. A list of registered purveyors of milk in the City is given in Appendix D, p. 180. 119 ICE CREAMS. Under the provisions of the Ice Cream Sections, Nos. 42, 43 and 44 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, which became operative on 1st November, 1903, any person engaged in the manufacture, sale or storage of ice cream, or any such commodity, who does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination, or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination, shall be liable for every such offence, on conviction, to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. He is also liable to a similar penalty if he omits to notify the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst persons employed by him in the sale, manufacture or storage of such commodity. An itinerant vendor of ice cream, &c., must exhibit a notice on his barrow stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such articles, failing which, he also incurs a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. In 1908 there were 246 premises in the City where ice creams were sold, as compared with 207 in 1907, and 233 in 1906. These places may be classified as under:— Place of Manufacture. Number. In the City. In other districts. Tea shops 123 40 83 Confectioners 20 16 4 Small confectioners and light . ment shops 103 53 50 Total 246 109 137 Of the 103 small confectioners, 101 are foreigners. The number of places in the City where ice creams are manufactured increased from 57 in 1907, to 109 last year, while 137 dealers obtained their supplies from other districts, as compared with 150 in 1908. From enquiries made in other districts, it was ascertained that in all but nine cases the manufacture was carried on under satisfactory sanitary conditions, and in each of the cases reported against the purchase of ice cream from them was prohibited until notification was received that the necessary sanitary improvement had been effected. Itinerant Ice Cream Vendors. In the course of the year 41 itinerant ice cream vendors were found in the City, an increase of one over last year. It was ascertained that in all cases the material they were selling was made outside the City. 120 Upon making enquiries of authorities of outside districts it was found that in six cases the addresses displayed on the barrows were incorrect, one man had changed his residence, and that in one instance the ice cream was made under unsatisfactory conditions. As the police have no power of making arrests in cases where no notice of place of manufacture is displayed, there will always be a difficulty in exercising control over these itinerant dealers. The following prosecutions were instituted during the year for non-compliance with the law with regard to exhibiting notices on their barrows stating the names and addresses of the persons from whom the ice cream was obtained:— Mortomeo de Genaro, 5, Back Hill, Saffron Hill 5s. and 3s. expenses. Frangeris Ericono, 51, Ivy Street, Hoxton 2s. ,, 3s. „ Antonio Stechetto, 7, Back Hill, Saffron Hill 2s. „ 3s. „ Guiseppe Pacini, 39, Warner Street, Clerkenwell 10s. „ 10s. 6d. „ 121 MEAT SUPPLIES IN 1908.* It is unpleasant when contemplating the deliveries of meat to the Central Market again to have to deal with a falling-of, still more so when comparing 1908 with previous years to find that some eight years of more or less steady progress have been obliterated, and that we are now in about the same place as we were in 1900. This question of decreasing market deliveries has been the subject of comment in these reports on previous occasions, and it has been pointed out that the establishment of dep6ts at different centres in the outer suburbs of London must inevitably detract from the amount of trade here; the worst feature of it is that these dep6ts are worked by firms who, though they cannot be said to constitute a ring or trust, have working arrangements which are quite as effectual as any organisation of the kind could be. We propose classifying the supplies in the manner adopted last year. 1. English Town-Killed.—This consists largely of beef from the Metropolitan Cattle Market, Islington, pigs consigned to or purchased by different slaughterers, and after dressing marketed at Smithfield ; sheep, lambs and calves purchased at various markets, and, when dressed, sent here to be sold. The opening months of the year were favourable to the cattle trade, supplies from abroad were light, and the fact that no United States cattle would be sent unless they realised a price at which the English grazier could also produce beef, was made the most of for a time, the sums obtained must have been satisfactory to the sellers ; but the weather became treacherous, half fat cattle were pushed out, and when once the all-important factor of quality was neglected the inevitable slump came, because the home productions were no longer competing with United States bullocks of prime quality, but with the low-priced refrigerated meat of Argentina. This condition of things lasted nearly to Christmas, then foot-and-mouth disease broke out in several States of America, and some of the principal ports for the shipment of cattle were closed. With the Americans competing less keenly prices again rose, consequently cattle good enough for the Christmas trade realised sums which have not been heard of for a long time. Of sheep there is almost every Monday a good show at Islington, and for the first half of the year they sold well, but later, when it appeared likely that the turnip crop in the middle and southern portions of England would be very light, if not an utter failure, a large number of half-meated sheep and lambs came on the market, and a little later plenty of excellent Dutch mutton, for which the owners were willing to accept very low prices, was sent, the result being that the later months of the year have seen a level of prices most unsatisfactory to the British sheep farmer. It would be improper to close our remarks on this section without some reference to the improved conditions under which slaughtering is now carried on at the Islington Cattle Market. A long range of slaughterhouses has been built, lined with sanitary bricks, and provided with the necessary appliances * i am indebted to Mr. G. P. Terrett for the remarks on pp. 121-125. 122 « for flushing and washing the walls; also with electric hoists for raising the cattle in the course of dressing, and an elaborate system of drainage. In close proximity, and connected by elevated rails along which the sides of beef are conducted, is an extensive well-ventilated cooling shed, constructed with light from the north, so as to exclude, as far as possible, the rays of the sun. A pig slaughterhouse, fitted in the manner most approved by modern experts, and a large cooling shed for the dressed carcasses of pigs, is provided; and also a Podewil apparatus for the destruction of condemned meat, slaughterhouse refuse, &c. Probably experience will suggest some details in which further improvements may yet be made in any case it is a laudable attempt to keep pace with the times, and a great improvement on the dark, dirty, insanitary places which until now have done duty as slaughterhouses at the first Cattle Market in England. 2. British Country-Killed.—Taken altogether this is the finest meat the Londoner gets. The trade in Scotch beef has been affected by the conditions previously mentioned, but a great deal of very excellent beef has been sent from the Aberdeenshire districts. There has also been an abundance of both English and Scotch mutton throughout the year, the quality of which is unsurpassed in any market in the world. The prevalence of tuberculosis has militated against any great development of the home-grown pig trade; and the laxity of inspection at some other centres has diverted supplies away from London. Taking these two sections together, it is encouraging to find that in spite of adverse conditions prevailing during the late summer and autumn months the home producer has more than held his own, and that a very creditable increase in the tonnage of British meat has found its way to the Central Markets. 3. Foreign-Killed., i.e., Continental, chiefly from Holland, Denmark and Belgium.—There was a moderate supply of Dutch mutton in the early months of the year, but during the fall there has been a very large quantity of which the quality has for the most part been excellent; it has the effect of "knocking the bottom out of the market," i.e., of depressing prices to a level at which they are no longer remunerative to the home producer. Of pork there has also been a fair quantity, but in this respect there has not been the tendency to swamp the market so observable with the mutton. A Netherland Royal decree was issued on June 24th making it compulsory that all meat sent from Holland to the United Kingdom should be inspected, and none except that which bore the label affixed by the Inspectors should be allowed for shipment ; this, we were informed, was to come into operation on January 1st, 1909, but late in December the Authorities suddenly altered their minds, and deferred the date at which it would become effective ; probably the same effect can be achieved by the regulations drawn up by our own Local Government Board, but that does not excuse the vacillation of the Dutch Government. More stringent regulations, combined with a system of meat inspection on an altogether wider basis, have been 123 promulgated by the Danish Government, and, if the system works out in practice as well as it looks on paper, there ought to be no more complaints as to the soundness of meat imported from that country. This consists of beef, of which the quality is "middling" to "fair"; mutton, some of which is indifferent, but the greater part "very useful"; and pork of varying size and quality, with carcasses of veal generally too large to be graded "first class," but of undoubted soundness. Belgium has remained in the same unsatisfactory position; there may be some sort of inspection at the place of slaughter, but if so, it is of so nebulous and uncertain a character, that for all practical purposes we on this side must regard all Belgium products as "not inspected." 4. Cattle Imported Alive and Slaughtered at Deptford and Elsewhere.—This is a branch of the trade which by its very nature could not fail to make itself attractive to carcass butchers. A man requiring 50 or 100 bullocks finds them classified and graded to suit the particular branch of the trade which he has made it his study to cultivate, and the purchase of such a lot is effected at one transaction without the loss of time involved amongst home-grown stock in picking them up in two's and three's from a number of separate sellers ; then in the provision of slaughterhouses, cooling sheds, refrigerators, &c., the Corporation has done everything in its power to foster and encourage business, with the result that while the British Cattle Market languishes, the one devoted to Foreign trade thrives. For a brief period during the summer there was a check, and another again at Christmas. The latter of these was attributable to an outbreak of foot-andmouth disease ; the first was stated to have arisen from the financial panic which so upset the United States, or it may have been an attempt on the part of the cattle dealers to force up prices ; it is, however, probable that the real cause will be found where it is likely to recur with increasing frequency, viz., in a genuine scarcity of beef. The requirements of America for home consumption are greater now than ever, while owing to the land being taken up for building railways and other purposes, the sources of supply are constantly being pushed further West, which means increased cost in reaching the seaboard ; consequently, those who want low-priced beef must look elsewhere than to America for it. Of the cattle which Canada has sent, those from the Eastern States have shown some improvement in quality and condition, while those from Manitoba and the Western portions of the Dominion are imperfectly made up, of irregular age and very wild, the natural result of having passed all their lives on the ranches ; yet they furnish a lot of good food at a moderate price. Argentine cattle are still prohibited from coming alive, a fact which is in some respects to be regretted, as the sale and slaughter of them, with the conversion of the hides, fats and offals into commercial products would afford work for a great many men, while the heads, livers, &c., would be useful, cheap food for the poorer classes. The length of time which has elapsed since any outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Argentina seems to reduce the risk almost to vanishing point. Very few sheep have come, and those few of indifferent quality. The importation of Argentine sheep to Antwerp, where they are slaughtered for the 124 London Market, continues, and in this connection it is interesting to note that a large number of Argentine store sheep are bought by Belgian farmers to fatten, so far as we can learn, without any bad results such as carrying footand-mouth disease. 5. Refrigerated Beef.—The best of this comes from the United States, and is generally of excellent quality; for many years this had been relied upon as furnishing good and cheap food for the masses, but home requirements have grown, and good Chicago beef can only be sent here if there is something like a certainty of it realising a fairly high price; consequently, the quantity has been getting smaller, while the Argentine coming in increasing volume has precluded the possibility of any such rise in price as would make larger shipments from the United States profitable. Concerning the Argentine, we should like to say a good word. Most of the works are in the hands of British firms (though two large ones have passed to Americans who market the produce in England), the trade is financed by British capitalists, the cattle and sheep have been bred from stock imported from Great Britain, and it seems likely that Argentina will play an important part in the meat supply of this country for many years. Much of the beef has been better made up for slaughter, and it is most interesting to note that if a cargo is out of condition, it is generally a poor lot of beef; if a few quarters amongst a lot are out of condition, those are almost invariably the weakest and thinest; hence it seems fair to argue that if the beef is to arrive in good condition it must be beef not lacking in substance to begin with. Such, indeed, is our experience of refrigerated meat throughout, as, for instance, every attempt to bring mutton at the comparatively high temperature of refrigerated beef has been a failure simply because the carcass of mutton was of insufficient bulk and thickness to remain rigid during the process of refrigeration. If we might, without offence, give the meat traders a word of advice, it would be "Look well to the Argentine meat supply, and take care that it does not get monopolised by foreign speculators; then improve the quality of the goods shipped by careful selection, by proper storage during the voyage, and by rapid distribution on its arrival here." Some reference was made last year to the Linley system of preserving beef in sterilized air. Several vessels have been fitted up with the necessary apparatus, and whenever it has been well selected and properly handled, it has arrived in a condition which argues that the system has many advantages, but whenever beef of indifferent quality has been shipped, it is too much to expect that any method of preservation will make it into desirable meat. 6. Frozen Meat from New Zealand, Argentina and Australia—has been of good quality throughout the year, the number of thin, wasted and unsaleable carcasses being less than in any previous year. The principal novelty was a small shipment of lambs from Natal, which arrived early in the year, and of which there has been no repetition; they were of fair quality, though carrying abundant evidence that the flock from which they were taken had not been subjected to the many years of careful selection necessary to 125 eliminate all undesirable features. A general summary of the trade will show that the Argentine shippers have again been very aggressive, both with beef and mutton, with the effect that Australian products are driven quite into the background, and the priority of New Zealand in point of quality is seriously menaced. So far, but little lamb has been sent from Argentina. New Zealand graziers, on the contrary, have made a special study of it, and have succeeded in producing an article which meets with the highest approbation here, though merchants are prone to keep them too long in the refrigerator, whereby the quality is impaired. Australian lambs have shown a satisfactory improvement in quality and preparation. The "abominations " in the shape of boneless beef and other scrap meats which have been so freely inflicted upon us for the last few years, have been less in evidence as the year drew towards a close, probably as a result of the action taken by the Local Government Board. They have never been very popular amongst Londoners, who evince no partiality for confidence tricks being played upon them in respect of their food. Early in the year, one Inspector (W. E. Down), fell ill, and has been unable to resume his duties* ; this difficulty has been met by the employment of an Assistant Inspector on one section of the Market, and by the addition of a youth, who sees to the work of collection and at the same time acquires the knowledge necessary for responsible work. The following Naval Officers have received instruction in the examination of meat, viz. : one Deputy Store Officer, eight Fleet Paymasters, seven Staff Paymasters, five Paymasters, nine Assistant Paymasters, and one Paymaster of the Cape Royal Naval Reserve, to all of whom Certificates of competency have been issued. Five persons have been summoned for sending diseased meat to the Central Markets, and convictions obtained in four cases. REGULATIONS UNDER PUBLIC HEALTH (REGULATIONS AS TO FOOD) ACT, 1907. For some years past there has been a growing necessity for arming Port Sanitary and Local Authorities with increased powers for the prevention of distribution of imported food of a doubtful character. The public feeling aroused by the scandals created by the attempted sale of unwholesome tinned food, which formed part of the Army stores returned to this country from South Africa, together with the revelations of the manner in which the trade in meat products was conducted in Chicago, and the representations upon the subject made to the Local Government Board by the Corporation and other authorities responsible for the protection of the public health, resulted in the President of the Local Government Board pledging the Government to take action for dealing with the evil. * I regret to say Mr. Down died on 11th February last while this Report was in the Press, 126 A measure for this purpose, entitled the "Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Bill," was consequently introduced in the Commons by the President of the Local Government Board in July, 1906, but was not then proceeded with owing to the heavy pressure of Government business. It was re-introduced in February, 1907, and received the Royal Assent on the 28th August of that year. The Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, became immediately operative, but it was not until the 12th September, 1908, that the Local Government Board issued the Regulations made by them for carrying out the provisions of the Act, together with a Memorandum thereon. Two sets of Regulations were made, viz.: — I.—"The Public Health (First Series : Unsound Food) Regulations, 1908," and II.—"The Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908." These Regulations deal, with few exceptions, with all the questions relating to control of food supplies upon which representations have been made to the Local Government Board from time to time by the Corporation. I.—The Public Health (First Series; Unsound Food) Regulations, 1908. These became operative on the 1st October, 1908. They have been framed with the object of securing that articles of food which are unsound, unwholesome, or unfit for human consumption, and which, as part of the cargo of a ship, are brought to a place in this country either as a place of destination or as a place of deposit for transmission to a place of destination elsewhere in the United Kingdom, shall be dealt with at the port of discharge. This procedure is necessary for the prevention of danger to the public health from the consumption of unsound or unwholesome food. Inspection of articles of food for this purpose has for many years been carried out with satisfactory results by the Port Sanitary Authority in the Port of London, and more recently also in the Port of Manchester. The experience gained in these Ports has been utilised by the Board in preparing these Regulations, which enable action to be taken with regard to unsound food in all Port Sanitary districts and in all Municipal Boroughs and Urban and Rural districts which include or abut on any part of a Customs Port, which part is not within the jurisdiction of a Port Sanitary Authority. It should be noted that the main feature of these Regulations is the exercise of control over food stuffs from abroad at the port of entry, and that the Local Government Board have not only power to make Regulations for this purpose, but may designate the authority for their administration. In those now under consideration the several Port Sanitary Authorities, in conjunction with the Customs, are detailed for the purpose, but the Local Government Board may direct by Order that a Port Sanitary Authority shall act with the Local Sanitary Authority when they consider joint action to be necessary. 127 II.—The Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908. These came into operation on 1st January, 1909. They are designed to protect the public from the danger entailed from the unrestricted importation of certain kinds of meat foods, which are classified as — Foreign Meat of Class I. „ „ „ II „ „ „ III. " Foreign Meat of Class I." means foreign meat in the form:— (a) Of scrap meat, namely, meat which, whether it is fresh, or has, before importation, been subjected to a process of freezing or other refrigeration, or to chemical or other treatment, with or without the addition of any preservative or colouring substance— (i.) Consists of scraps, trimmings or other pieces of such shape or in such condition as to afford insufficient means of identification with definite parts of a carcass ; (ii.) Has not, before importation, been made ready for human consumption in the form of a sausage, or of other prepared or manufactured articles of food ; and (iii.) Is without bone in its natural state of attachment ; or (b) Of tripe, namely, any edible part of the stomach, or of a tongue or kidney, to which formalin, or a solution, or other preparation of, or comprising formic aldehyde; or a compound containing fluorine or boron; or salicylic acid, formic acid, sulphurous acid, benzoic acid, or any compound or any such acid has been applied. (c) Of several parts of the carcass of a pig, or of other edible parts of a pig, which have not, before importation, been salted, cured, pickled, dried or smoked, or otherwise prepared as bacon or ham, and which are not contained in a box, case, receptacle or package with an official certificate impressed thereon, or affixed or attached thereto. "Foreign Meat of Class II.'' means:— Foreign meat which, being in the form of the entire carcass of a pig, has not, before importation, been salted, cured, pickled, dried or smoked, or otherwise prepared as bacon or ham, and is without the head in its natural state of attachment to the carcass, and is without the lymphatic glands about the throat, and any other part of the carcass in their natural position. "Foreign Meat of Class III." means:— Foreign meat which is in the form of several parts of the carcass of a pig, or of other edible parts of a pig, which has not before importation been salted, cured, pickled, dried or smoked, or otherwise prepared as 128 bacon or ham, which is not and does not comprise any foreign meat of Class I., and which is contained in a box, case, receptacle or package with an official certificate impressed thereon, or affixed or attached thereto. "Foreign Meat Unclassed" means:— Foreign meat other than foreign meat of Class I., foreign meat of Class II., or foreign meat of Class III. The Regulations provide for the manner in which meat in the several classes is to be detained by the Customs pending examination by the Medical Officer of Health. Rules are also given for the guidance of that Officer. Regulations are also made with regard to (i.) giving notice by the Sanitary Authority to the importers of their intentions with regard to consignments ; (ii.) destruction of foreign meat; (iii.) proceedings for proof that foreign meat is not intended for sale; (iv.) prohibition of removal for sale of foreign meat in certain cases, and other matters of administrative detail in connection with the subject. The Regulations will meet the case of the imported "boxed " or barrelled meat, which it has been my duty to so strongly object to under former conditions of importation. A Report of the Sanitary Committee, agreed to by the Court of Common Council on the 31st October, 1907, contained a recommendation of your Medical Officer of Health that the attention of the Local Government Board should be directed to the importance of making Regulations under the Act for the following purpose:— "For preventing the admission of any meat, or meat products, into this "country that have not been officially examined and certified as whole"some before export, the inspection to be in accord with the standard in "force in this country at the time. At present the only standard "existing is that laid down in the recommendations of the Royal "Commission on Tuberculosis, 1898." It will be seen from the following definition in the Foreign Meat Regulations that, with regard to this point, the Local Government Board requisitions entirely comply with the recommendations of the Corporation:— "The expression ' Official Certificate' used in relation to foreign meat "or in relation to a box, case, receptacle, or package containing foreign "meat, means a certificate, label, mark, stamp or other voucher that the "cattle or pig from which the meat is derived has been certified by a "competent authority in the place of origin to be free from disease at "the time of slaughter, and that the meat has been certified by the like "authority to have been dressed or prepared, and packed with the needful "observance of all requirements for the prevention of danger arising to "public health from the meat as an article of food." In a Report dated the 27 th October, 1908, it was pointed out by your Medical Officer that the administration of both sets of these Regulations was 129 placed in the hands of the Port Sanitary Authority, and that it would be in the best interests of the public, merchants, and others concerned, for the Local Government Board to issue orders, under Articles XVII. and XII. of the Regulations respectively, requiring joint action by the Common Council and the Port Sanitary Authority of the Port of London for the purposes of the Regulations in the matter. The Board concurred therein, and on the 4th December issued for consideration of the Court of Common Council draft Regulations to be applied to Orders made by them with respect to each of the above-mentioned sets of Regulations. These drafts were approved by the Court of Common Council on the 10th December, and the Local Government Board notified accordingly. Orders for the purpose indicated were issued by the Local Government Board on the 29th December last, and came into operation on the 1st January of this year. They may be cited as— "The City of London (First Series, Unsound Food Regulations) Order, 1908," and "The City of London (Foreign Meat Regulations) Order, 1908" respectively. The effect of the these Orders will be that in the case of the Public Health (First Series) Unsound Food Regulations the powers and duties under them in regard to food landed in the City—except in the cases referred to in paragraph 2 of the Order—will be exercised by the Common Council and their Medical Officer of Health. In cases where the Port Medical Officer has specified a place in the City for the detention of food, he is to notify the Medical Officer of Health of the City, who will thereupon deal with the food. When food consigned to a wharf in the City has been examined by the Port Medical Officer and found to be in good condition, he will, if the importer desires it, notify the Medical Officer of Health of the City of the fact of its examination, and no further examination will then be made by that Medical Officer of Health unless he has reason to think that the food has subsequently become unsound. With regard to the Order respecting Foreign Meat Regulation it is proposed that meat which, after it has been landed in the City, is made the subject of notice by the Officer of Customs, the Council and Medical Officer—except in the cases specified in paragraph 3—shall deal with it. If the Port Medical Officer has given a Certificate releasing any foreign meat from detention, under sub-division (5) of Article III of the Regulations, no further examination will then be made by the Medical Officer of Health of the City unless he has reason to believe that the meat has subsequently become unsound. 130 Orders have been issued relating to similar joint action on the part of the Port Sanitary Authority with the following Metropolitan Borough Councils, viz. : Stepney, Berinondsey, and Poplar. The assistance of the staff of Meat Inspectors being indispensable for carrying out the additional obligations imposed upon the Corporation by these Orders, the Chief Inspector of Slaughterhouses and Meat, and six of the Inspectors of Slaughterhouses and Meat were, on the 4th February of this year, subject to the approval of the Local Government Board, appointed Assistant Officers under Article XV of the Foreign Meat Regulations and Article XI of the Unsound Food Regulations, such appointments being duly confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 3rd March, 1909. It being evident that Steamship and Railway Companies engaged in the transport of Foreign Imported Meat were greatly interested in these Regulations, your Medical Officer, with a view to facilitate their working, convened a conference at the Guildhall on the 22nd December last, which was attended by representatives of the following Steamship and Railway Companies:— The General Steam Navigation Co. The John Cockerill Line. W. H. Muller and Co. (the Batavier Line). Phillips and Graves (representing the Holland Steamship Co.*). The Great Eastern Railway Co. South Eastern and Chatham Railway Co. (representing the Zeeland Shipping Co.). Of the above companies five, viz., the General Steam Navigation Co., the Batavier, the Holland Steamship Co., the Great Eastern Railway Co., and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Co. (for the Zeeland Shipping Co.), convey practically the whole of the meat exported to London from Holland. The John Cockerill Line carry almost solely from Belgium. PIGS. With the exception of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Co., on behalf of the Zeeland Shipping Co., all the shippers at present engaged in the Dutch trade agreed to your Medical Officer's suggestion that the best and simplest method of complying with the Regulations, so far as pigs from Holland were concerned, would be (1) For all carriers to refuse absolutely to ship on board their boats the carcasses of pigs that did not bear the Netherlands Government label indicating that such carcasses had been subjected to official inspection and found vyholesome. * This Company are now represented by the British Amsterdam Maritime Agency. 131 (2) To give notice to this Authority, at the earliest possible moment, of the time of arrival and the nature of the cargo, i.e., the quantity of pigs and other' meat on board. (3) They further undertook that all pigs should be sent direct to the Central Meat Market, except with the previous consent of your Medical Officer. The South Eastern and Chatham Railway and the Zeeland Shipping Co., being unable at that time to agree to carry only labelled carcasses, subsequently undertook that unlabelled carcasses only would be carried by their day boat from Flushing, and that the labelled ones should be dispatched by their night boat from the same port. With regard to the Belgian pigs'shipped by the John Cockerill Line, it was pointed out that as the British standard of tuberculosis is not reached in Belgium, the certificate of the Government of that country could not be accepted as a guarantee that the meat complied with the Regulations, and therefore the carcasses of such pigs would be liable to detention for inspection on arrival. As the initiative of action rests with the Officer of H.M. Customs, except in cases where the Medical Officer may desire to examine meat arriving from a specified country or port of shipment of particular consignments, arrangements were made with the Chief Officer of Customs in the City to detain (1) All carcasses of pigs from Belgium ; (2) All carcasses of pigs from Holland not bearing the official inspection label of the Netherlands Government landed at any wharves within the City limits, pending examination by myself or assistant officers. MEAT (OTHER THAN PORK). It was explained that the regulations provided means by which foreign meat generally, which is diseased, unsound, unwholesome, or unfit for human consumption can be dealt with, and such meat is therefore liable to detention for the purpose of examination. SCRAP MEAT, &c. With regard to the above, the Regulations are designed to deal with foreign butchers' meat which is imported in the form of scraps, trimmings, or other pieces not sufficiently identifiable with definite parts of a carcass; tripe, tongues, or kidneys treated with certain preservatives, or pieces of fresh pork contained in a package not bearing an "official certificate." These meats are classed together as "Foreign Meat, Class I.," and the representatives were informed that the regulations with regard thereto would be strictly enforced. 132 It was clearly understood that these arrangements were made with a view to minimising any delay that otherwise might be incurred in the execution of the duties imposed by the Regulations, and that the Corporation did not part with any of its rights or powers under them, reserving the right to check the meat from time to time at any point, and to vary and revoke them without notice. The "London Gazette," of the 22nd January last, gave notices of " official certificate" declared to be admissible in relation to Foreign Meat of Class III. admitted for import under Article III. of the Foreign Meat Regulations, which sanction the importation of fresh pork contained in a box, case, receptacle or package under certain conditions, one being that it should bear an "official certificate" indicating that it has been certified by competent authority in the place of origin to be free from disease at the time of slaughter, and that the meat has been certified by like authority to have been dressed or prepared and packed with the needful observance of all requirements for the prevention of danger arising to public health as an article of food. Such "official certificate" means a certificate, label, mark or stamp, or other voucher which, by a notice published in the " London Gazette," is declared to be admissible for a certain period. The notices in the Gazette referred to related to official certificates declared to be admissible in relation to Foreign Meat of Class III. imported from Denmark, the Netherlands, the Dominion of Canada, and the Dominion of New Zealand. The effect of these Regulations will be to practically stop the importation of a certain class of American frozen boxed meat, the undesirable nature of which has frequently been brought to your notice. The importation of tubercular pigs from the Continent will also be checked, and tripes, tongues, and kidneys saturated with compounds containing boron and other preservatives will be kept out of the country. Copies of the Regulations and Orders referred to in the foregoing are given in Appendix E, p. 186. REFRIGERATION. The great development of the system of Refrigeration, and its important bearing on the preservation of foods, was well shown by the marked success which attended the First International Congress of the Refrigerating Industry, held in Paris in October, 1908, to which your Medical Officer was appointed a British delegate. The Congress was attended by delegates from nearly every country in the world, and many useful and instructive discussions took place. 133 Perhaps the best proof of the high standard to which the trade has attained is the fact that the following resolution was unanimously passed by the Congress :— "That the refrigerating industry having attained world-wide importance, it is "highly desirable that exact scientific; data be obtained for determining the "conditions as to time and temperature under which perishable produce can be "satisfactorily kept. And that with greatest respect to all other countries, the "Corporation of the City of London, as the largest market authority, be asked to "conduct these inquiries." Hitherto it has been commonly believed that the freezing of meat properly carried out will ensure its preservation for an indefinite period, disregarding altogether the fact, now well established, that there is a distinct class of bacteria which live and flourish at the low temperatures of the freezing chamber. While on the one hand it is impossible to exaggerate the value of the freezing system in preserving food for long periods in a thoroughly wholesome and nutritious condition, it must always be borne in mind that there is a limit to its value, and that this limit will vary with the nature and condition of the food so treated. The working out of this important question will be of the utmost value both to the trade and the consumer. A complete investigation of the various problems involved has been undertaken by the United States Department of Agriculture. * In a recent report dealing with frozen chickens, issued by Dr. H. W. Wiley, it is stated that— "Macroscopic observations of fresh and cold stored chickens show that certain "plainly visible differences exist between the two classes, which differences are "progressive, depending on the length of the storage period," and that " in the "case of frozen birds there is no indication of any improvement in quality, that is, "in taste, odour, or flavour, during cold storage. There is a deterioration which is "noticeable, even at the end of three months, and becomes more marked as the "time of storage grows longer. Hence, without any reference whatever to the "question of wholesomeness, cold storage prolonged for six months or more "appears to be distinctly detrimental as far as taste, flavour, and palatability are "concerned." PRESERVATIVES IN MEAT PRODUCTS. The following are particulars relating to the meat products treated with preservatives referred to on p. 131. * Preliminary Study, by Dr. H. W. Wiley, on the effects of Cold Storage on Eggs, Chickens, and Quails (Washington, 1908). 134 No. Date. Sample of. From. Packed. Result of Analysis. Action taken. IMPORTED ARTICLES. 173 20th Feb.

Of the twelve Danish samples, two only contained preservatives in extensive quantities. The representatives of the American firms protested against the condemnation of their goods on the ground that the quantity of preservative found was small, but were not prepared to dispute the matter before a magistrate. Instructions were at once cabled to the American packers to discontinue sending their goods to the London market. The consignors had a legitimate grievance, inasmuch as there is no fixed legal limit as to the nature and amount of preservative permissible, but this question will not arise again, as the importation of meat of this class is now prohibited by the Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations now in force. The question of boric acid in sausages is now sub judice, notice of appeal having been lodged with regard to a conviction in a case of this kind at a Metropolitan Police Court. MARKING OF MEAT AT THE CENTRAL MARKETS. In my Annual Report for 1907 reference was made to the suggestion that the time was opportune for the Corporation to offer facilities for marking meat that could be brought to a depot established for the purpose at the Central Markets. The system would be a voluntary one, and a nominal charge made for inspection and marking which might cover the expense incurred. In April last year an opportunity appeared to present itself for initiating a system of this kind. It arose in consequence of the receipt of an application from a firm carrying on an extensive business as Preserved Provision Manufacturers for certificates of official inspection of meat purchased by them in the City Markets. This was necessary, as the firm in question did considerable trade with the United States of America, in which country such certificates were required under Regulations made under Section II of the Pure Food Law, 1906, of the U.S.A. The facts being reported to the Committee, it was left to the Medical Officer to take the necessary steps for making the necessary inspection and the issue of certificates. The following arrangements were then made for this purpose. The Chief Inspector of Meat was instructed to arrange as to the method of inspection, which could easily be carried out at the shops at Smithfield when the meat is purchased, in order to avoid any unnecessary delay or trouble. 136 That a label signed by the Inspector would be attached by wire to each piece of meat by an impressed leaden seal, bearing the City Arms on one side and P.H.D. (Public Health Department) on the other. The labels were to be numbered consecutively, and a record kept at the Market of meat so examined and passed. A certificate would be forwarded to the purchaser each day, showing a copy of this record, stating that the consecutive numbers correspond to those on the labels. It was proposed that in the first instance a charge of two pence be made for each seal so attached, in order to cover the cost of marking, and that this charge be reconsidered later. It was explained that this charge was solely for the extra work and expense involved in the marking, and not for inspection to which they were entitled. These arrangements were to have been carried out for a limited period— say, three or six months—in order to ascertain whether the system worked satisfactory. The Committee concurred herein, and decided that, in the meantime, the whole question of marking meat be adjourned, pending the result of the working of the proposed arrangement. This, however, never came into operation owing to the Local Government Board issuing Regulations with regard to the exportation of meat food products to the United States of America and the Philippine Islands, referred to on page 138 of this Report. With regard to this question of meat marking, it was found that in this case the firm welcomed the proposed method, as their interests were concerned, and the point I here wish to emphasise, and what I have before pointed out, is that the interests of British Agriculturalists are equally concerned in the matter, as there is little doubt that a great deal of foreign meat is sold as home produce, and this view has been endorsed by the Cattle Markets Committee. The fact is patent that anyone purchasing meat would prefer to know that it had been subjected to official inspection by experts, and failing the substitution of Public Abattoirs for private slaughterhouses, the official marking of meat that has passed the inspectors is the only means by which the public can have any choice in the matter. It is obvious that of two butchers established in the same neighbourhood, one selling unmarked meat and the other officially marked meat, the one selling the latter would get most of the business. . If the Corporation make provision for the examination and marking of meat at a dep6t established at Smithfield, as suggested in the Report presented to 137 the Sanitary Committee on the 22nd October, 1907, it would remain to be seen how far the salesmen would make use of it, but at any rate I am of opinion they should certainly have the opportunity of availing themselves of such a system. It must be remembered that it would be more in the interest of the salesman to have a voluntary system of the kind established, and for him to make use of it, than that he should be subjected to compulsory Regulations made by the Local Government Board for a similar purpose. It is true that up to the present the Board have only dealt with imported food and meat, but their powers under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act are practically unlimited. The practice of marking inspected meat is common in other countries, and in view of the increased interest now taken by the public with regard to the wholesomeness or quality of foodstuffs generally, it is more than likely that the practice will be extended to this country. The Corporation has ever been in the van in all movements in connection with the public welfare, and have modelled their administration of sanitary affairs with a view of ensuring that in all respects it should be in harmony with the spirit of the age. The traditions of the office, therefore, I have the honour to hold, impel me to again direct attention to this subject, and I would call attention to the fact that any owner of carcasses slaughtered at Islington Cattle Market can have his meat labelled after inspection, and that this system has been taken advantage of by some large dealers. EXPORT OF MEAT FOOD PRODUCTS TO CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. To Argentina. In November, 1907, the Local Government Board issued a memorandum for the guidance of persons engaged in the export of meat products to Argentina. In consequence of a decree issued on the 4th October, 1906, by the Argentine Government, requiring that all pigs and other imported animal products should be accompanied by a certificate (duly legalised by an Argentine Consul) of the country where they were manufactured, to the effect that the factory where the goods were prepared was under sanitary supervision, the Local Government Board, after consultation with the Board of Agriculture and the Board of Trade, formulated certain conditions, duly set forth in the memorandum, under which meat products may be accompanied by an official certificate which the Argentine Government agreed to accept with respect to meat products exported from Great Britain. The official certificate can only be issued by an official designated to act as " certifying officer " duly appointed by the Local Government Board. 138 Your Medical Officer's appointment as certifying officer was sanctioned by the Board on 6th November, 1907. The certifying officer is required to keep himself informed, by personal inquiry and other available ways, as to — 1. Structure and character of premises on which the meat foods are prepared, stored, or packed (as the case may be) in regard to opportunities of objectionable or unwholesome contamination of these foods, at any stage of their preparation, storage, or packing. 2. Cleanliness and wholesomeness of methods employed in preparing, storing, or packing the meat foods in question. 3. Precautions taken to avoid the utilisation for food purposes of diseased, unsound, or unwholesome meat in any portion of the premises; and arrangements safely to dispose of any meat which, on account of disease, unsoundness, unwholesomeness, or for any other reason is unfit for human food. If the information obtained by the certifying officer in regard to (1), (2) and (3) above is not in his view satisfactory, certification is to be withheld. Information is forthwith to be given to the Board by the certifying officer in any instance where he has refused to grant a certificate. The certifying officer will, as and when requested by the Board, give such information as may be required by them in regard to the methods of inquiry, inspection, and certification which have been adopted in regard to the premises in question. If the Board have reason to believe that improper use is being made at any time of any declaration, or of any certificate given by a certifying officer respecting any premises, the Board will cease to authorise the issue of official certificates in respect of such premises. To the United States of America and the Philippine Islands. Very similar procedure to the foregoing is now required in the case of meat food products exported to the United States of America and the Philippine Islands. In consequence of the Food Laws in force in these places, requiring that all imported meat food products shall be accompanied by an official attestation of precautions taken to safeguard the wholesomeness of the foods in question, the Local Government Board, at the request of the Foreign Office, have issued a memorandum for the guidance of persons in England and Wales engaged in the export of such articles to these places. The Regulations laid down were almost precisely the same as those relating to meat products exported to the Argentine, the only difference being that in addition to the certifying officer being required to keep himself informed with 139 regard to paragraphs marked 1, 2 and 3 on page 138, he has been charged with the additional duty of noting the 4. Steps taken to ensure that all meat foods prepared or packed for export to the United States of America and the Philippine Islands are solely the product of animals which, on adequate ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, have been found free from disease and suitable for human food; and if this is not complied with he must withhold the certificate. Your Medical Officer was also appointed certifying officer in this case. It should be noted that certificates for Argentina have to be vised by an Argentine Consul, while the United States Government recognises the authority of certifying officers without the formality of viseing. Copies of the Scheduled Forms of Declarations and Certificates required in both cases are given in Appendix F, page 207. INSPECTION OF NEW ZEALAND MEAT. In February, 1908, with the concurrence of the Sanitary Committee, the Assistant Chief Veterinarian, New Zealand, at the request of the Chief Veterinarian of the Government of that country, attended at the Central Markets for the purpose of obtaining full information as to the inspection there of meat imported from New Zealand and the standard adopted in dealing with it. In March. 1908, Mr. Alexander Crabbe, M.R.C.V.S., Glasgow, was appointed by the New Zealand Government as their permanent Officer, with instructions to make himself acquainted with all matters relating to New Zealand meat in this country, and especially as to the sufficiency or otherwise of the inspection in the country of production. It is hoped this course will prove beneficial both to the exporters and the dealers in this country, as it will lead to combined action in both countries. INSPECTION OF KOSHER MEAT. In May last, in consequence of some question as to the soundness of some meat passed by the Jewish Inspectors, the matter was brought to the notice of the Board of Shecheta, who were most anxious to co-operate in order to prevent such occurrences in future. The Board, therefore, at once made arrangements for their Killers and Inspectors to attend a course of lectures on meat inspection and be instructed by practical demonstration and the examination of carcasses of oxen, sheep and calves intended for human consumption, certificates being granted to those satisfying the examiner of their competency. This was a most satisfactory conclusion of a difficult question, and the Board of Shecheta were informed of the Corporation's cordial approval of their action. 140 IMPORTATION OF IMMATURE CALVES. In May last, the attention of the Netherlands Government was directed to the impropriety of their Inspectors passing as fit for export to this country calves of such an exceedingly low weight as to leave room for doubt as to whether the animal had any independent existence. On two days in March, four calves, weighing respectively 34 lbs., 27 lbs., 37 lbs. and 35 lbs., were seized in the Central Meat Market. Such puny animals by reason of their miniature condition are certainly not fit for food. In the City, the sale of calves for food, weighing less than 48 lbs. or of a less age than three weeks, is prohibited. REGULATIONS FOR MEAT INTENDED FOR EXPORT FROM THE NETHERLANDS. In September last, I was favoured by the Consul-General for the Netherlands with an English translation of the Netherlands Decree of June 24th, 1908, Number 50, prescribing the Regulations for carrying into effect Section 5 of the Netherlands Inspection of Meat for Export Law, 1907. Hitherto, the inspection and marking of meat for export from Holland has been conducted upon voluntary lines, a method that has proved most useful in preparing the way for a compulsory system. The following summary of these Regulations shows that the Netherlands Government is determined that, so far as statutory requirements are concerned, that an endeavour to ensure that meat for export from Holland shall be above suspicion. These deal with:— I. The manner of slaughtering animals, the meat of which is subject to inspection before export. II. The communes and places where, and the times at which, meat can be submitted for inspection before export. III. The state in which meat shall be submitted for inspection or transport before export. IV. The rules for the inspection of meat intended for export, the standard to be adopted for such meat, and the mode of dealing with it by sterilization or destruction when rejected for export. V. The manner in which the meat intended for export' is marked, and the arrangement of the marks. 141 These regulations will prohibit the passing of meat for export in the following circumstances:— If it is the meat of animals that have not been completely inspected. If on inspection any of the diseases referred to in a Schedule are found to exist. In cases of Tuberculosis or other nature, if such meat is condemned, in the country of destination. In cases of bone fractures and important lesions or wounds of the skin and subcutis. When in pigs extensive skin affections are found to exist. If local processes or abscesses have been removed before inspection.' When the meat has not been handled in a cleanly manner. In all cases in which serious doubt exists as to the fitness for export. With regard to Tuberculosis, these regulations will have the effect of preventing the export to this country of pork showing this disease "in any degree," inasmuch as the standard laid down by the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, 1898, will be adopted by Inspecting Officers in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, there has been some delay in fixing the date when these regulations become operative. The 1st January of this year was the original date fixed, but this has been postponed. In the meantime, the Local Government Board have agreed to accept, until the 1st May, 1909, the labels scheduled in these regulations as evidence of proper inspection, and the same have been gazetted as "Official Certificates " inaccordance with the requirements of the Public Health (Foreign Meat) Regulations, 1908. When these Regulations come into force in the Netherlands it will mark a great step in the system of Meat Inspection, and if carried out on the lines laid down it will be of immense advantage to the trade of that country and to the public here to have meat supplied with a guarantee of its freedom from disease. At the same time it must not be forgotten that this meat is sold in competition with the British and Colonial product, and that if this trade rivalry is to be on a fair basis, the British farmer should, in his own interests, insist upon the inspection and marking of his home-killed animals. In other words, the public Abbatoir system is the only one which will sufficiently protect, at the same time, the British producer and the public health. 142 QUALIFICATIONS OF MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTORS. In April last, I directed the attention of the Sanitary Committee to the conditions prevailing with regard to the appointment of these Officers. Under the Public Health Acts, a Food Inspector must possess a Sanitary Inspector's Certificate, however well qualified he may be for the position in other respects. In cases where an Officer's whole time is taken up with Food Inspection, most of the subjects in which he has to quality in order to gain such certificate are practically of no use to him in the performance of his duties, and he has, therefore, been put to much useless waste of time and expense when he would have been better occupied in acquiring a wider knowledge of matters relating to foodstuffs. At the present day, there is a general trend of public opinion in the direction of securing a more complete supervision of food supplies, and, as a consequence, there is an increasing demand for the services of men possessing special qualifications for the office of Food Inspector. Meat inspection, for instance, can only be satisfactorily performed by men who possess a practical knowledge of the butchers' trade, and the Corporation have made it a rule since the year 1861, in making such appointments, to act on this principle. It is clearly an anomaly that, before men with special experience, and therefore peculiarly well qualified for the office, can be appointed, they should be compelled to pass an examination embracing nearly every conceivable subject connected with Sanitary science, which is subsequently almost valueless to them in the execution of their duties. In the interests of both the public and the trader, it is essential that Food Inspectors should have undergone a thorough practical training in foodstuffs, and possess such special qualifications as the Local Government Board may approve. 143 Table showing the average deliveries at the Central Meat Market, and other details for successive quinquennial periods during the past 35 years:— Quinquennium.

TUBERCULOUS MEAT. An account has been kept of the meat seizures made during the year on account of Tuberculosis, and of the diseased meat recorded above, upwards of 98 tons, or 54 per cent., was found to be tuberculous. The following are the details of these seizures:— 2,617 pigs weighing lbs. 209,707 Pieces of pork and pigs' heads „ 1,212 83 plucks „ 370 10 livers „ 20 14 carcasses of beef „ 6,990 7 quarters and pieces of beef „ 1,370 7 calves „ 731 Livers and other organs of foregoing „ 368 220,758 Total weight 98 tons, 11 cwts. 0 qrs. 6 lbs.

As the result of the daily inspection of the City wharves, 153 loads of unsound food were removed from these places during the year by the Cleansing Department. The material so disposed of comprised:— Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Tinned fruit and vegetables 51 2 0 Condensed milk 20 11 2 Miscellaneous tinned food 29 18 2 Fruit pulp 27 3 0 Fruit and vegetables 39 15 0 Miscellaneous food 2 19 1 Total 171 9 1 The greater portion of the above was removed at the written request of the owners. Section 47 (8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, provides that— "Where a person has in his possession any article which is unsound "or unwholesome or unfit for the food of man, he may, by written "notice to the Sanitary Authority, specifying such article, and containing "a sufficient identification of it, request its removal, and the Sanitary "Authority shall cause it to be removed as if it were trade refuse." This provision takes away the ground of a common defence in prosecutions for being in possession of unsound food. It has often been suggested that the food was set aside with the intention of destroying it before it was discovered by the Inspector. This power to notify to Sanitary Authorities under this section affords a test where this line of defence is adopted. Additional powers with regard to dealing with imported food have now been conferred upon your Officers under the City of London (First Series, Unsound Food Regulations) Order, 1908, made under the provisions of the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, referred to at length on p. 125. 150 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. During the year 1,183 articles of food and drugs were analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. Of these, 78, or 5.67 per cent., were certified by the Public Analyst to be adulterated*, or not up to standard, as compared with 6.68 per cent. in 1907. A summary of the Quarterly Reports made during the year by the Public Analyst in accordance with the provisions of Section 19 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1875, is given on p. 160. Table I. The figures for the last eight years are here given:— Year. No. of Samples taken. Found Genuine. Found Adulterated.

Unfortunately there are no accurate means of arriving at the number of persons in the City during the daytime. It would appear from Table I. on p. 150, that the percentage of adulterated samples remained at practically the same figure as last year, but if the samples of meat products referred to on p. 133 are omitted—these having been specially selected in relation to the question of preservatives in such 152 articles imported from abroad—the percentage of adulterated articles found was 5.11 per cent., being a satisfactory decrease from the corresponding figures of previous years. As on other occasions, both your Public Analyst and myself have commented during the year on the unsatisfactory situation created by the unsettled state of affairs with regard to the presence of preservatives in foodstuffs. In reporting on 24th March, 1908, upon two samples of kidneys containing excessive quantities of boric acid, it was pointed out that a man making a reasonable meal of such treated material would ingest in the one case one-and-two-thirds, and in the other two-and-a-half times as much as the maximum dose of boric acid when used medicinally. Further, there is no justification for the presence of such quantities of preservatives, and there are special objections to their presence at all, as the food may be in a state of decomposition before treatment, the evidence of which would be masked by the drug used. One element in this question, viz. the situation both of the trader and the Public Analyst owing to the absence of any regulation on the subject, is put very clearly by your Public Analyst in his Report for the third Quarter of 1908, thus— "Whether salt, saltpetre, boric acid or sulphurous acid should be "permitted to be used are all fair questions for investigation and settle"ment, but such settlement should be by Act of Parliament, and not by "the tedious process of prosecuting vendors for having these or other "preservatives present, and moreover it seems scarcely fair to bring a "criminal charge against a vendor merely to settle a scientific question. "The Board of Agriculture have had statutory powers since 1899 to "limit or prohibit preservatives in dairy produce, and the Local Govern"ment Board have, under the Act of 1907, power to limit or prohibit "the use of any preservative in butter, margarine or milk-blended butter. "These departments have not published any regulations, and "although they both have the resources of the Government behind "them, hesitate to commit themselves. "This condition of things is not only a hardship to the trader, but also "to the Public Analyst, who has to take the responsibility of passing an "article as genuine although containing preservatives, or on the other "hand of condemning an article on account of the preservatives present. "As to which course to take he is left entirely without guidance. 153 In this connection it may serve a useful purpose to quote some observations contained in a report upon boric acid in sausages, presented by me to the Sanitary Committee on 24th November last year.*— "At present there are no statutory limitations as to the amount of "preservatives that can be used without the sale of an article being to "the prejudice of the purchaser. In July, 1899, a Departmental "Committee was appointed by the Board of Agriculture to enquire into "the use of preservatives and colouring matter in the preservation and " colouration of food, and to report "(1) Whether the use of such materials or any of them for the "preservation and colouring of food in certain quantities is injurious "to health, and if so, in what proportion does their use become "injurious. "(2) To what extent and in what amount are they so used at "the present time. "This Committee made certain recommendations with regard to milk "and milk products, and the prohibition of the use of copper salts in the "so-called greening of preserved food, but made no other recommendation "with regard to the use of preservatives in food, one reason for this "omission as stated in the report being that " ' It was soon evident that the question of food preservatives had " ' not at the time of our enquiry received special attention by the . " ' medical profession.' " "This expression of opinion was given nearly eight years ago, and "whatever the concensus of opinion of that profession on the subject "may be at the present time, there can be no question that the public "have a right to know what they are buying. "Since the date of the Departmental Committee referred to, the "physiological action of this drug has been investigated by many "observers, and the evidence now available enables a juster estimate to "be formed with regard to its action on the human system. Upon a "review of all facts, there can be no doubt that when this or any "other drug is added to a food product the purchaser should be notified "of its presence." It will be seen from the foregoing that there is an urgent demand for the settlement of the question of preservatives in food on the part of Public Health Officers, Public Analysts, Wholesale and Retail traders, Foreign importers, and * For results of Analyses, see p. 134. 154 in fact, from all concerned in the food supplies of the people. It is full time for a further inquiry into the use of preservatives and colouring matter in food, and that this question, together with the present unsatisfactory warranty section of the Food and Drugs Acts, should receive a more sympathetic consideration by the Government of the day than has hitherto obtained of the many representations on these subjects made to them by those responsible for the working of the Acts. MILK. Milk, which so readily lends itself to sophistication, has as heretofore received the special attention of your sampling officers, and comprised no less than 39 per cent. of the articles examined during the year. It is satisfactory to note there has been a marked decrease in milk adulteration in the City during 1908, as will be shown in the accompanying Table:— Year. No. of Samples Examined. Found Genuine. Found Adulterated. Percentage of Adulterated Samples. 1901 392 209 83 21.2 1902 599 519 80 13.3 1903 517 457 60 11.6 1904 452 417 35 7.7 1905 481 445 36 7.5 1906 556 513 43 7.7 1907 472 432 40 8.4 1908 469 440 29 6.2 A decrease in milk adulteration in eight years from 21.2 to 6.2 per cent. shows that an energetic and systematic administration of the Acts is greatly in the interests of the citizens, the costs of administration being more than met by the enhanced value of the food commodities sold to them. Of the 29 samples of milk reported against by the Public Analyst, the vendors of 18 were proceeded against, and in six of these, or 33⅓ per cent., the cases were dismissed upon proof of warranty. The offence in 8 cases consisted in adding water, in 9 of the removal of cream, and one sample was both skimmed and watered. The following Table shows the relation between place of purchase and adulteration :— Where Purchased. No. of Samples taken. No. Adulterated. Percentage of Samples Adulterated. 1907. 1908. 1907. 1908. 1907. 1908.

The penalties imposed upon offenders on conviction varied from 1s. and 18s. 6d. expenses to £5 and 18s. 0d. expenses. That over 6 per cent. of the milk samples taken during 1908 were adulterated—in spite of the fact that during the past eight years no less than 241 prosecutions have been instituted against milk dealers alone in the City— is an indication that milk sophistication is a paying business on the whole, and unless offenders are more heavily dealt with, the evil is likely to continue. Your Public Analyst reports that milk which used to be generally mixed with preservatives was in all cases last year free from boric acid and formalin. BUTTER. Three hundred and eighty-one samples were taken, of which five, or 1.3 per cent., were certified as being adulterated. The figures for 1908 and seven previous years are given hereunder. Year.

Fourteen of the above were purchased in the early morning, and all were genuine. The following summary shows the amount of this deception that was discovered in the six years 1903-8:— Date. Samples taken. Cases of Substitution. Percentage Substituted Samples. 1903 71 19 26.7 1904 101 12 11.8 1905 16 Nil. Nil. 1906 87 12 13.8 1907 184 8 4.3 1908 112 1 0.9 156 Of 23 other samples of butter supplied when a "roll and butter" was purchased, two were found to be margarine. Prosecution followed in each case, and the offenders fined £5 and 12s. 6d. expenses, and £5 and 17s. 6d. expenses respectively. It is not unlikely that the heavy fine of £100 imposed upon an offender in the City during the previous year has led to the marked decrease in butter adulteration in 1908. Butter and Margarine Act, 1907. This Act, a full abstract of which was given on p. 148 of my Annual Report for last year, came into operation on the 1st January, 1908. Section I. (1) of the Act requires that butter factories and any premises on which milk-blended butter is manufactured, or in which the business of a wholesale dealer in milk-blended Butter is carried on, should be registered with the local authority in such manner as the Local Government Board might direct. The following are the requirements for the purpose of such registration, issued by the Local Government Board on the 28th December, 1907:— (a) The name and address of the owner or occupier making the application. (b) The situation of the factory or of the premises on which the manufacture or the business of a wholesale dealer is carried on. (c) The name and address, or the names and addresses, of the owner or owners, or occupier or occupiers, or wholesale dealer, or dealers, carrying on the manufacture or the business. (d) Whether the premises are proposed to be registered as (i.) A butter factory. (ii.) Premises on which there is manufactured any milk-blended butter, or (iii.) Premises on which there is carried on the business of a wholesale dealer in milk-blended butter. During the year two butter factories in the City were registered in accordance with the requirements, and certificates of such registration issued in due course as directed by the order of the Local Government Board. The factories referred to are situated at West Smithfield, and Custom House and Wool Quays, Lower Thames Street, respectively. 157 "Milk-blended" butter can only be manufactured for sale and sold to the public under a name to be approved by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. In the course of the year the undermentioned names for mixtures of butter and milk have been approved by the Board:— Bradlac. Casora. Iveleat. Jensa. Brenco. Casova. Ivelene. Kingstyle. Casa. Consumo. Ivelette. Pearks' Bread mate. Casana. Fromaid. Ivelike. Pearks' Bredspred. Casmon. Iveldale. Ivelmene. Pearks' Own. Casoa. Iveldene. Ivelmore. The permissible amount of water in these mixtures is limited by Section 4 (2) of the Act to 25 per cent. A sample of "Pearks' Own" was certified by your Public Analyst to contain 23.3 per cent. of water. A sample of Pearks' "Milk-blended Butter," taken on the 16th May, 1906, before the passing of the Butter and Margarine Act, 1907, contained no less than 28.0 per cent. of water. It is noteworthy that the price per pound of the article was 1s. 2d. in each instance. Seventeen samples of margarine were examined as to their water content, but none were found to exceed the statutory limit of 16 per cent. COFFEE. Of 38 samples examined, 37 were pronounced genuine, and one was found to contain no less than 56 per cent of chicory. In this case the vendor was fined £5 and 19s. 6d. expenses. The amount of Coffee adulteration in the City during the last eight years is here given. Year. Samples taken. Found genuine. Found adulterated.

Of the 12 samples examined in 1908 one was reported against as containing no less than 50 per cent. of earth nut oil. This was purchased from a chemist who was subsequently fined £10 and 17s. 6d. expenses. The public should be cautioned against asking for "salad oil" if they want olive oil, as much of the former contains cotton seed or earth nut oil. Similar care should be taken when purchasing sardines. "Sardines in oil" may mean "sardines in cotton seed oil," and such is generally the case. The better class of manufacturer notifies on the tin that the fish are prepared with olive oil. Year. Samples taken. Found genuine. Found adulterated.

The articles reported against were: one sample of compound tincture of rhubarb, from which one-ninth of its volume of glycerine had been removed; the vendor was cautioned ; and one sample of iron pill, certified as being 36 per cent. deficient in ferrous carbonate; the vendor in this case was proceeded against and fined £2 and 17s. 6d. expenses. PRESCRIPTIONS. I had occasion last year to comment on the laxity that appeared to prevail in the compounding of prescriptions, as 12 out of 25, or 52.0 per cent., made up by chemists in the City were inaccurately dispensed. During the year under review 18 were examined by your Public Analyst, and 2, or 11.1 per cent., reported against. Proceedings were instituted in each case. In one, where a chemist had supplied "Pil. plumbi cum opio" 16.9 per cent. deficient in lead acetate, the summons was dismissed owing to the form in which the Analyst's certificate was made out. The other instance was a particularly bad one as the vendor, instead of dispensing the prescription viz., Pil. plumbi cum opio, a British Pharmacopoeia preparation, supplied an article known as Plummer's Pill, to which he stated that he had added approximately three-quarters of a grain of opium, an amount considerably in excess of that which should have been present in the pill asked for, and for which he had no authority. The vendor was fined £10, and £4 4s. expenses, and as he had been convicted for offences under the Food and Drugs Act on three previous occasions, the facts were brought to the notice of both the Pharmaceutical Society and the Society of Apothecaries of London. MALT VINEGAR. Of sixteen samples of malt vinegar submitted to the Public Analyst, six, or 37.5 per cent., were certified to be "vinegar other than malt vinegar." Five prosecutions were instituted against the vendors, one case being dismissed, and in the others, fines were imposed, varying from £5 with 17s. 6d. expenses, and £8 and 18s. 6d. expenses. The result of this exposure has been that anyone asking for "malt vinegar" at small shops in the City where vinegar is sold on draught is told either that they do not keep it or that they cannot guarantee it to be made from malt. Much of the article sold as vinegar at such places is a solution of coloured and flavoured acetic acid. There is at present no statutory definition of "vinegar." There is no objection to such artificial vinegar being sold under some designation which retains the word "vinegar," provided it also makes the nature of the product apparent. In January, 1908, a most interesting report "on the preparation and sale of vinegar in relation to the Sale of Food and Drugs Act," by Dr. J. M. Hamill, was published by the Local Government Board (Medical Department), an abstract of which was presented to the Sanitary Committee by your Medical Officer on 26th May, 1908. This deals very fully with the matter, and should be consulted by anyone interested in the vinegar question. 160 161 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875-1907.

In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognizance of the appointment, 89 persons were so examined during 1908, and of these 8, or 8.98 per cent., were reported by me as physically unfit for office. 16 officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement, and of these 13, or 81.25 per cent., were reported to be unfit for duty. In addition to the foregoing, four medical examinations were made of persons accepted by the Central (Unemployed) Body, on the recommendation of the City of London Distress Committee, for employment on the Labour Colony at Hollesley Bay, established by the Central Body under the Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905.

Powers, &c., of Justice in relation to unsound food. Article V.—On the complaint of the Medical Officer of Health that an article of food seized and carried away in pursuance of subdivision (4) of Article IV., or that an article of food in relation to which a notice has been given in pursuance of that subdivision, is unsound or unwholesome, or unfit for human consumption, a Justice, if satisfied, on his examination of the article of food, and on the evidence adduced before him, that the article of food is unsound or unwholesome, or unfit for human consumption, and that there is an absence of proof that the article of food is not intended for sale for human consumption, shall condemn the article of food and order it to be destroyed or disposed of under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health by such means and in such a manner as to prevent its being used for human consumption.

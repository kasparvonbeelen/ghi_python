ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1912, To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., 25th March, 1913. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present herewith the Report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1912. When 1 presented my Report for the year 1911, I was of the opinion that that would be the last submitted by me in my official capacity as Medical Officer of Health of the City of London, but circumstances delayed the appointment of my successor— Dr. W. J. Howarth—who did not, as a consequence, enter on his duties until 25th March, 1913. When I relinquished office, this Report was only in draft, and I am indebted to Dr. Howarth for his kindness in seeing it through the press. AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 675.2 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.051 square miles, equal to a square of 1.0252 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 10.81 miles to a side. DENSITY (1912). City of London, Registration District, at night 27.7 persons to an acre. „ „ „ „ during the day *542.1 „ „ Registration London, at night 60.4 „ „ ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London was .€39,004,436 on 6th April, 1912—whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London was £5,672,277, or nearly one-seventh of the whole County. POPULATION. The undermentioned figures are abstracted from the report of the Registrar-General on the Census of England and Wales, 1911 (County of London). Area. Statute Acres. Inhabited Houses.

These figures represent the population on the night of the 1st April, 1901, and 3rd April, 1911. * This figure refers only to persons "actively engaged in the City during the daytime." 10 CENSUS RETURNS.

This consists of two sub-districts, together containing a population of 18,695 at the middle of 1912, calculated on the last Census Returns:— St. Botolph 7,584 *St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 11,111 18,695 The Night population, therefore, of the City of London Registration District at the middle of 1912, is taken at 18,695, and it is upon this figure that all vital statistics in this Report have been calculated. The Day Census taken in May, 1911, showed that the Day population was 364,061 persons, and that 1,077,155 persons and 94,095 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the count was made. In 1903 it was ascertained that in the week ending 19th July no less than 347,463 vehicles passed to and from the four City bridges, viz.:—London, Southwark, Blackfriars and Tower, equivalent to upwards of 18,000,000 vehicles per annum. BIRTHS. During the year 1912, 387 births were registered in the City. The annual birth rate was at the rate of 20.7 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 15.4 per 1,000. The birth rates last year in the Sub-Districts were— St. Botolph 13.3 per 1,000. St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 25.7 „ In the Metropolis the birth rate in 1912 was 24.5 per 1,000. This decline in the birth rate has been in operation in this country since 1876, and is common to nearly all European countries. VACCINATION. Of the 410 children born in 1912, 180 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 28 had died before the age for vaccination, and in no case was the child insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 2 cases, 126 had removed into other districts, and 12 vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 62 cases of conscientious objection. The Public Vaccinators performed 233 re-vaccinations during the year. * On the 1st April, 1901, the Middle Temple was transferred from the Strand Sub-District to St. Sepulchre Sub.District. 11 • Vaccination Statistics in the City of London.

It will be seen that the number of conscientious objectors is increasing. This is doubtless due to the Vaccination Act of 1907, which is a direct encouragement to persons not to protect their children from the risk attending an attack of small-pox. MORTALITY. During the year under review, 806 deaths were registered in the District, including 674 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table, p. 17, for details. Deducting the latter, 132 deaths remain, to which must be added 46 persons who died in City Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered. The mortality, therefore, from which the City death-rate is calculated is 178. The death rate for 1912 was 9.5 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 10.9), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 13.6. Death Rates, pee 1,000 per Annum. Year.

The deaths from phthisis correspond to a rate of 1.06 per thousand of the population, compared with 1.35 in the Metropolis, Infantile Mortality. The deaths of children under one year of age to 1,000 births were 26, against 91 for the whole of London. « 12 The Table of infantile mortality on p. 14 shows the deaths of children under one year arranged according to monthly age periods. From this it will be seen that no less than 30 per cent. of these deaths occurred in the first month, 60 per cent. within the first three months, and 70 per cent. during the first six months of existence. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. The work under the notification of Births Act has been continued. During the year 185 births were notified belonging to the City, including eight still-births. 235 other notifications, relating to children not belonging to the City, were forwarded to the Medical Officers of their respective districts. Of the 185 City Births:— 99 were notified by Medical Practitioners. 54 „ „ by Hospitals, &c. 10 „ „ by Midwives. 22 „ „ by Parents. The Care of Infants. During the year 669 visits were paid to the homes to give instruction in the care and feeding of infants. The visits are appreciated by the mothers. Of the babies visited:— 83 per cent. were breast-fed. 11 „ were hand-fed. 6 „ were partly hand-fed and partly breast-fed. On the whole the children were well cared for, and in many cases the poorer mothers deserve praise for the care bestowed on their children. During the year, ten deaths occurred of infants under one year of age. A grant of l1/2 pints of milk daily has been allowed to necessitous nursing mothers. 0 This grant of milk has enabled many mothers to continue nursing their babies who otherwise would not have been able to do so. Breast feeding cannot be successful unless the mothers are properly nourished. During the year 47 mothers have been granted the milk for periods varying from one month to six months. Forty of the mothers were asked to bring their babies to a room at the "shelter" (a building belonging to the Corporation) each Monday to be weighed; the total attendances were 270. Great improvement was noted in most cases, both in the health of the mother and child, and this fact has clearly demonstrated to the mothers the value of milk and the need of sufficient and adequate nourishment being taken during the nursing period. In a few cases where great poverty has existed the milk granted has been the chief nourishment the mother has had. Such cases are not satisfactory. The babies generally were found to be in a healthy condition; it was necessary only in six cases to advise that a doctor should be called in. The mothers appear to bring more intelligence to bear in caring for their babies than formerly; they are recognising the necessity of warm clothing, fresh air and regular feeding. 13 INSTRUCTIONS IN THE CARE AND FEEDING OF INFANTS. In April, 1907, by order of your Worshipful Committee, a form of instructions to mothers in the care and feeding of their infants was circulated through the City, and similar action was taken by practically all Metropolitan Borough Councils. The instructions issued, though in the main agreeing, differed materially in detail, and as it was clearly advisable that all should be on the same lines, the matter was considered by a Committee of the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health, who have agreed on general draft suggestions. These were adopted by the Corporation, and incorporated in the new and revised edition printed in 1912. (See Appendix E.) \ Deaths in City Institutions. During 1912, 48 citizens died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 26.9 per cent. of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis being 43.3 per cent.

It will be seen from the foregoing that during the year, excluding Chicken-pox, 85 Certificates were received, including 18 "duplicates," and one in which the diagnosis was subsequently found to be incorrect. The total number of cases of "notifiable infectious disease" was, therefore, 66, as compared with 67 for the previous year. The total number of cases of Scarlet Fever reported was 33, compared with 22 last year. The following is a Return of infectious diseases notified, exclusive of Chicken-pox, in the City of London, with the percentages of such cases removed for treatment to hospitals or nursed at home during 1912, compared with the figures for the previous five years:— Year.

For cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis notified under the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, see p. 23. In each case a detailed examination was made of the sanitary condition of the premises where infectious cases occurred, and a summary of defects found by the District Inspectors is given on page 40. 20 RECEPTION OF CASES OF WHOOPING COUGH. The Board of Management, of the Metropolitan Asylums District have, in pursuance of the Metropolitan Poor Act, 1867, and the Acts amending and extending that Act from time to time, provided hospitals for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from certain classes of infectious disease. Subject to such regulations and instructions as the Local Government Board may from time to time prescribe, the above mentioned Board of Management are empowered by Section 80 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to admit into a hospital provided by the Managers any person who is not a pauper, and who is reasonably believed to be suffering from any of the diseases specified in the Section of the Act referred to. The Local Government Board, deeming it expedient that provision should be made with regard to the admission to such hospitals of persons (not being paupers) suffering from Whooping Cough, have, by virtue of their powers, prescribed the following regulations and restrictions by which persons may be admitted into any of the hospitals maintained by the Metropolitan Asylums Board:— Article I.—The Managers shall not receive into any of their hospitals a person to whom this Order applies unless, in their opinion, they have more accommodation available than is required for the reception of the pauper patients suffering from Whooping Cough, whom the Managers are authorised to receive. Article II.—Except as hereinafter provided, a person to whom this Order applies shall not be admitted by the Managers into any of their hospitals, except on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health for the district of the Sanitary Authority for the execution of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in which the person is residing at the time when the question of his removal to hospital arises. The recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health shall in every case be sent to the Managers, and shall be accompanied by such information respecting the circumstances of the case as the Managers may reasonably require. Provided that the Clerk to the Managers may, if he receives general authority in that behalf from the Managers, direct that a person to whom this Order applies shall be admitted into a hospital of the Managers otherwise than on the recommendation of a Medical Officer of Health, if, in the Clerk's opinion, the admission of such person is desirable on the ground of sudden or urgent necessity, or for some other special or exceptional reason. The Clerk shall report to the Hospitals Committee of the Managers at their next ordinary meeting the name of any person admitted to a hospital of the Managers on his direction, and the grounds on which his direction for admission of such person was given. Article III.—If it becomes necessary to determine the priority in which persons to whom this Order applies shall be admitted to any hospital, the Managers shall have regard to each person's need of isolation in the interests of the public health so far as the same can be ascertained from the information sent to them by the Medical Officer of Health in pursuance of Article II. of this Order, with the recommendations relating to the admission to hospitals of persons to whom this Order applies. 21 Article IV.—This Order may be cited as the Metropolitan Asylums (Whooping Cough) Order, 1912. From the foregoing it will be seen that such non-pauper cases shall be received into hospitals of the Board of Management only when there is room available beyond the requirements of pauper cases of Whooping Cough, and that, subject to certain exceptions provided for in Article II., non-pauper cases may only be admitted on the recommendation of the Medical Officer of Health of the locality in which the patient resides, such recommendation to be accompanied by any detailed information required by the Board of Management. This Order came into operation on the 9th August, 1912. I have not had occasion to recommend any individual for admission to the Board's Hospital since the Order became operative. RECEPTION OF CASES OF PUERPERAL FEVER. By the same powers as those referred to in the notes on Reception of Cases of Whooping Cough, the Local Government Board have issued an Order providing for the reception of non-pauper cases of Puerperal Fever into hospitals provided by the Metropolitan Board. The conditions are the same as those with regard to Whooping Cough enumerated above, and the Order came into operation on the 20th August, 1912. No case has arisen in the City since the Order became operative necessitating action thereunder. NOTIFICATION OF CEREBRO SPINAL FEVER (EPIDEMIC CEREBRO SPINAL MENINGITIS). As a preventive measure against the spread of the above-mentioned disease, which is still in evidence in London, the London County Council have, in accordance with the provisions of Section 56 of the Public Health (London), Act, 1891, made an Order, requiring for a further period of twelve months, as from and including the 18th March, 1912, the notification of cases of Cerebro-Spinal Fever (Epidemic Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis) in the Administrative County of London, and such Order has been duly approved by the Local Government Board. On the advice of a Committee appointed by the President of the Royal College of Physicians, it has been decided that for notification purposes the disease at present known as Posterior Basal Meningitis shall be included in the term "Cerebro-Spinal Fever," which term shall not, however, be interpreted to include cases of Meningitis due to Tuberculosis, Syphilis, Middle Ear disease or injury. Cerebro-Spinal Fever was first made notifiable in London by Order of the Local Government Board for a period of six months as from the 12th March, 1907, and has been extended by renewed Orders from year to year, the provisions of notifications having been in continual operation since 1907. 22 Immediate recognition of the disease presents many difficulties, as although there are certain characteristic features of the typical and severe attack, experience has taught that this fever may and does appear in milder and anomalous forms, and which lead to its being mistaken for other ailments of more common occurrence in this country. Unfortunately failure to recognise Cerebro-Spinal Fever is apt particularly to happen when the malady is of the "fulminant" variety, in which case death ensues rapidly. The examination of the Cerebro-Spinal fluid withdrawn from the lower part of the spinal canal by lumbar puncture, affords a valuable aid to diagnosis. The Corporation have therefore undertaken the bacteriological examination of the fluid for the diplococcus of Weichselbaum, and the City Medical Practitioners have been so informed. Only one case, i.e., a child age 21/2 years, has occurred in the City since this disease was made notifiable. The Local Government Board have under consideration the desirability of including the above disease in the list of notifiable Infectious Diseases. NOTIFICATION OF ACUTE POLIO-MYELITIS OR ACUTE POLIO-ENCEPHALITIS. Acute Polio-myelitis, a disease of acute or sudden onset, commonly occurring in young children, and often confused with Cerebro-Spinal Meningitis, was first made notifiable by the London County Council in September, 1911, who by virtue of the powers conferred by Section 56 (6) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, made an Order requiring for a period of six months its notification within the administrative County of London. This Order was extended indefinitely in March, 1912, and failure to notify cases of Acute Polio-Myelitis or Acute Polio-Encephalitis renders the offender liable to a penalty not exceeding 40s. The disease is most prevalent during the months of July, August and September, and chiefly attacks children during the second and third years of age. Although there is evidence that the disease may be carried by a non-infected person, it can hardly be classed with the highly infectious diseases, as many persons are known to have lived in close contact with patients and altogether escaped infection. In epidemics, however, isolation has been found of considerable value in limiting its sphere of influence. Beyond the fact that the disease is infectious, little appears to be known as to how such infection is conveyed, and although the water-supply, food, domestic animals, &c., have been suggested as responsible agents, no circumstances have yet been proved that can thus definitely attach the responsibility. Again, some cases appear to have been due to personal contact, but many have occurred where all these possible sources can be eliminated. 23 As an essential preliminary to a much needed investigation with regard to the etiology of the disease, notification is welcome, as enquiry will unquestionably result in the collection of useful statistical material. Moreover, notification and the administrative action associated therewith, should result in some limitation of the spread of the disease. In order to secure the initiation of prompt enquiry into the origin and incidence of this disease, the Local Government Board, in the interests of public health, have under consideration the desirability of adding it to the list of infectious diseases already notifiable. PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS. During the year, 96 notifications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis were received in accordance with the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908 and 1911. Of these, 24 were treated at Sanatoria, 21 were treated at home, 21 were received into the Infirmary, 9 cases were fatal, and 2 were not traced. 19 certificates were duplicates. All have been investigated and such action taken as was possible to improve the conditions of the sufferers and to prevent the spread of infection. PUBLIC HEALTH (TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1912. In December, 1908, the Local Government Board, in pursuance of powers vested in them by Section 130 of the Public Health Act, 1875, as amended by the Public Health Act, 1896, issued the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1908, which provided for notification to the Medical Officer of Health of the Local Sanitary Authority of cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in Poor Law Institutions and among persons under the care of Poor Law Medical Officers when acting in their public capacity. The Public Health (Tuberculosis in Hospitals) Regulations, issued in March, 1911, was a further step in impressing on the public generally, and especially the poorer classes, that Tuberculosis is an infectious disease, and as such can be fought and suppressed. These Regulations provided for the notification of Pulmonary Tuberculosis in In-patients and Out-patients, at hospitals, dispensaries and other similar institutions for the treatment of the sick, which are supported, either wholly or partially otherwise than by the contributions of the patients, and otherwise than from rates and taxes. The system of compulsory notification of all cases of Pulmonary Tuberculosis was completed in November, 1911, when the Local Government Board by the issue of the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1911, provided for the notification within 24 hours by a medical practitioner of any case of Pulmonary Tuberculosis which came under his notice. The issue of three Regulations with regard to the one subject has on occasions given rise to some slight difficulties of administration, and the Local Government Board have accordingly consolidated and amended these in the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912, dated 17th December, 1912. 24 These Regulations, which revoke those referred to above, provide for the compulsory notification of all cases of Tuberculosis, and this extension from Pulmonary Tuberculosis only, constitutes the most important amendment. The Board in framing the Regulations have kept in mind the advisability of simplifying the existing machinery of notification, and the procedure now provides for all the principal contingencies on a uniform plan. Every medical practitioner (unless acting as a School Medical Inspector) is by Article V. (unless he has reasonable grounds for believing that the case has been previously notified) required within 48 hours of his first becoming aware that any person on whom he is attending, whether at an Institution or otherwise, is suffering from Tuberculosis, to make and sign a Primary notification of the case on Form A (see Appendix F), and shall transmit such notification to the Medical Officer of Health for the District within which the place of residence of the person is situate at the date of notification. Article VI. requires any School Medical Inspector to notify on Form B (see Appendix G) all cases of Tuberculosis which come under his notice in the course of inspection held at Public Elementary Schools. For the purposes of this Article it is immaterial whether a case has been previously notified by some other medical practitioner or not, but a School Medical Inspector shall not be required to notify any case previously notified by himself. The Form of Notification is to be forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health for the District in which the child lives at the end of each week. Article VII. requires that as soon as practicable after the end of each week the Medical Officer of a Poor Law Institution or of a Sanatorium shall send to the Medical Officer for the District in which the persons notified reside— (a) A list on Form C (see Appendix H) of all cases of Tuberculosis admitted to the Poor Law Institution or Sanatorium during the week, and not being cases previously notified under Article V. (b) A list on Form D (see Appendix I) of all cases of Tuberculosis discharged from the Poor Law Institution and Sanatorium during the week. In regard to the indications by which a medical practitioner is to assume a person to be suffering from Tuberculosis, it. is distinctly laid down that notification is to be made on the strength of evidence other than that derived solely from Tuberculin tests. I may here point out that the duty of transmitting the notifications to the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the patient resides is now thrown upon the medical practitioner notifying. The repealed Regulations were complied with if the notification was addressed to the Medical Officer of Health of the district in which the Hospital, Poor Law Institution or Sanatorium was situated, leaving it to the Officers of the Local Authority to re-direct it and inform the notifying medical practitioner accordingly. 25 The notification to be made by medical practitioners may be divided into two classes, described as "Primary" and "Supplemental." "Primary notification" is required in every case of Tuberculosis unless the medical practitioner has reasonable grounds for believing that the case has already been notified. "A Supplementary notification" is an additional notification of a case previously notified. All "Primary notifications," with the exception of those made by School Medical Inspectors, are to be made on Form A. School Medical Inspectors are to notify on Form B. "Supplemental notifications" are to be made out by Medical Officers of Poor Law Institutions and Sanatoria only on Forms C. and D. Article VI requires the Medical Officer of Health (1) To send to the appropriate district all notifications erroneously addressed to him and to notify the notifying practitioner that he has done so. (2) To keep a Register under his personal charge, containing the full particulars set out in each notification. (3) To send a weekly return to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council of all cases received by him. Article XIII. empowers the Local Authority on the advice of their Medical Officer of Health to supply such medical and other assistance, such articles and facilities as may reasonably be required for the detection of Tuberculosis, for preventing the spread of infection and for removing conditions favourable to infection, do such acts and make such arrangements as may be necessary, and further may provide, publish or distribute suitable summaries of information, instructions and precautions with regard to Tuberculosis. Nothing in the Regulations is, however, to authorise any action which renders the person notified liable to a penalty or subjects him to any restriction, prohibition, or disability affecting him or his employment on the grounds of suffering from Tuberculosis.- Exemptions from the notification obligations have been made in the case of medical practitioners acting in the capacity of (1) Medical Officers of H.M.'s Prisons, Institutions, Certified Reformatory Schools, Certified Industrial Schools, State or Certified Lunatic Asylums ; (2) Medical Examiner of candidates for some office or appointment; (3) Medical Examiner on behalf of an Insurance Company ; (4) Medical Examiner of passengers and crew on an Emigrant ship, or (5) Certifying Surgeon under the Factory and Workshop Acts. 26 With the issue of these Regulations which came into force on the 1st February, 1913, compulsory notification of Tuberculosis can now be regarded as complete, and I am confident that the powers thus given to Local Sanitary Authorities will result in a marked benefit to the Public. APPOINTMENT OF BACTERIOLOGIST. Dr. E. Klein, who was appointed Bacteriologist to the Corporation in May, 1902, resigned his appointment in January of last year. Dr. F. W. Andrewes, who has from time to time undertaken Pathological examinations on behalf of the City, was appointed as his successor. EXAMINATION FOR PATHOGENIC BACTERIA. Any medical practitioner desiring examination of specimens for Pathogenic Bacteria in cases of suspected infectious disease occurring amongst their patients residing in the City, should forward them to me at the Guildhall. Arrangements have been made for free examination, and the results obtained will be communicated as speedily as possible. During the year the following specimens were so dealt with. It will be seen that positive results were obtained in 45.4 per cent. of these cases. Specimen. Disease suspected. Result— Positive. Negative. Four samples of sputum Tuberculosis 3 1 Six throat swabbing Diphtheria 2 4 One specimen of blood Enteric Fever — 1 CONTAMINATED MILK. In order to determine to what extent milk on arrival in London could be regarded as responsible for the dissemination of Tuberculosis, a system of taking samples on arrival at the great railway termini within the City boundaries, and submitting them to bacteriological examination, was instituted in 1902. Since then similar investigations have been conducted in 1904, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, and repeated in January of the year under review, when 30 samples were taken, representing the milk supply from the following counties:— Essex 12 Suffolk 9 Cambridgeshire 3 Hertfordshire 2 Buckinghamshire 1 Bedfordshire 2 Warwickshire 1 30 27 These were submitted to Dr. Andrewes for bacteriological examination, who reported thereon as follows:— No of Sample.

The nodules are not quite like tubercle histologically, and no tubercle bacilli can be found in them ; there are, however, groups of non-acid fast bacilli resembling pseudo-tubercle. In any case I do not consider it proved that the infection was due to the milk inoculation, as no local effect was produced. I think the sample ought to be classed as negative. 25 Small amount 24th January Killed 27th February Local tumour for first two weeks. At death negative.

Small amount in 14 Samples = 46.6 „ „ Fairlyy clean—46.6 percent. Negligible in 10 Samples = 33-3 „ „ Clean—33.3 per cent. Pathogenicity— In 3 Samples 10 per cent. Of which 2 yielded tubercle 6.6 „ „ 1 „ abscess 3.3 „ „ No serious pathogenic effect, beyond local tumour which disappeared (in 2 cases) in 90 per cent. These results indicate the prevalence of highly unsatisfactory conditions in the milk trade. Only 33.3 of the samples were clean, while the tubercle bacillus was found in 6'6 per cent. I have on occasions, when the results of an investigation have been of a more satisfactory character, felt that the efforts made to secure a pure and wholesome milk supply for the people of London, have not been altogether unsuccessful, but these feelings have been quickly banished by the unsatisfactory results of subsequent enquiries which have made it apparent that until the hands of farmers, dairymen, and others engaged in the distribution of this indispensable commodity are forced by Statute, no real or lasting improvement can be looked for. This investigation, however, revealed a marked improvement in the type of churn used for conveyance. The old objectionable pattern, which under the mistaken idea of providing "ventilation" afforded means of access to all kinds of dirt in transit is gradually being replaced by dust proof, sealed and locked churns, which, if the milk be clean and properly cooled at the farm and properly dealt with in transit, will do much to ensure its delivery in a proper condition. Milk from which eighteen of the samples referred to above were taken was contained in properly constructed receptacles locked and unventilated. In accordance with the agreement made under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1907, Section 35, details of the two tuberculous samples Nos. 2 and 11, were sent to the London County Council, who inform me that with regard to No. 2, a Veterinary inspection was made of the cows on the farm from which the sample was derived, and one cow found to have an unhealthy udder and another suffering from generalised tuberculosis ; No. 11, the London County Council were unable to take action in regard to the farm from which this sample was delivered, as the supply of milk had been discontinued. As this latter, in all probability, means that although the milk is not being sent to London it is being sent elsewhere, I have communicated the facts to the Medical Officer of Health for the district in which the farm is situated. 29 In all the other unsatisfactory cases the farmers were asked to furnish me with a report from a Veterinary Surgeon as to the health of the cows from which the milk was derived, and a report from the Medical Officer of Health for the district as to the sanitary circumstances of the farm, its surroundings. Inspections resulting from this request revealed in one case the fact that the floor of the cowsheds had no proper channel for drainage purposes, thus making it "impossible to keep the flanks of the cows clean," and in another, the suggestion was made by the Medical Officer of Health for the District that the dirt probably found access to the milk by reason of the careless work of a farm hand. For the purposes of comparison I print below the following summary of results obtained in the several series taken during the years 1904-1912. 1904. 1905. 1906. 1907-8. 1909.* 1910.* 1911. 1912. 1st Series 2nd Series % % % % % % % % % Fairly clean and pure 48.7 68.2 80 54.2 43.7 66.6 75 28.6 79.9 Unclean 43.6 22.7 12 37.5 43.8 33.3 25 71.6 20 Tuberculous... 7.7 9.1 8 8.3 12.5 4.7 6.25 Nil 6.6 * It will be noticed that in the years 1909 (second series) and 1910 the 100 per cent, is made up of clean and unclean samples only, which is accounted for by the fact that the samples in which tubercle was found also contained dirt and is accordingly also included under heading "Unclean."

These results, which indicate that at the time of delivery in the City, the milk was in nearly all cases up to the official standard and free from Boric Acid or formalin, must be regarded as very satisfactory. The highest percentage of fat was 4.90, the lowest 2.96, while the mean was 3.87. CREMATIONS. The number of Cremations at the Corporation Cemetery at Ilford during the year was 32, as compared with 20 in 1911. It will be seen from the table on page 31 that only three Crematoria in the United Kingdom have to record a decrease in numbers, while the total Cremations taking place in 1912 is 1,064, against 1,023 for 1911. The increase year by year in the total number of Cremations has been maintained, with three exceptions since 1885, when the first Crematorium in the United Kingdom was opened at Woking. The several large towns in the United Kingdom where Crematoria are erected are shown in the accompanying table, and the date of opening them indicated in the first column. It is interesting to note that since Cremation first received legal recognition in this country (1884) 11,047 bodies have been so disposed of. 31 CREMATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, 28 Years—1885-1912.

Vide "Transactions of Cremation Society of England, 1903." p 31. 32 EXHUMATION AND RE-INTERMENT OF BODIES AT THE CITY OF LONDON CEMETERY. During the year 6 Licences have been issued by the Home Secretary, permitting exhumation and re-interment of bodies buried in the City of London Cemetery at Ilford. In accordance with the terms of these Licences, the work of removal from the one grave, and re-interment in another, has been carried out in the early morning under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS, STONEY LANE, HOUNDSDITCH. These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's—Queen's— Prince's—North—and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class; some of the ground floors being let as shops. The buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 839* persons, compared with 847 in 1911. 69.8 per cent. are adults, and 30.2 per cent. children (under 14 years). The death rate for 1912 was 9.5 per 1,000 per annum. The number of deaths of children under one year, per 1,000 births, was nil, as against 26 for the City generally.

Of these 351,705 were disinfected at the request of City firms engaged in exporting second-hand clothing to South Africa, where the authorities 34 will not allow such articles to enter the country unless accompanied by a certificate duly signed by a medical officer of health, vouching for the proper disinfection of each consignment. In all 1,267 such certificates were issued during the year. The remaining 3,446 articles were from premises in the City where infectious disease had occurred. 191 bodies were received at the Mortuary, pending interment, 78 post-mortem examinations were made, 161 inquests were held on bodies, and 6 inquests on fires.

DISINFECTION OF CONVEYANCES AFTER CARRYING CASES OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE. Five public conveyances, which had been used to convey patients suffering from infectious diseases to hospital, have been disinfected at the City Disinfecting Station, Golden Lane, E.C. DISINFECTANTS. As heretofore, all the disinfectants used in the Public Health Department were obtained through your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for the following purposes:— A. Deodorising and "denaturalizing" condemned meat, disinfecting public conveniences (urinals, &c.). 35 B. Disinfecting roadways, street gullies, &c. C. Disinfecting premises, &c., after infectious disease, drain testing and sundries. The amounts spent during the past 12 months under the several headings were:— £ s. d.

Arrangements have been made with the heads of other departments whereby any disinfectants required by them can be obtained direct from the Contractor supplying the Public Health Department. PRESERVATION OF BODIES OF UNKNOWN DEAD. The De Rechter apparatus for the preservation of the dead, installed at the City Mortuary in March, 1909, was fully described in my Annual Report for that year. Since its establishment 22 bodies have been placed therein, four during 1909, eight during 1910, five during 1911, and five during 1912. With one exception these were all the bodies of unknown persons who had met their death by violence, and the preservation has in many cases led to their identification. SANITARY INSPECTIONS.

The Bye-laws now in force in the City for this class of property were made by the Court of Common Council on 24th November, 1904, and confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 20th January, 1905. Unfurnished lodgings, when the rent is not less than 10s. a week, and furnished lodgings when the rent is not less than 12s. 6d. a week, are exempt from the operations of the Bye-laws. Particulars relating to the registered Lodging-houses in the City now on the Register are given in the accompanying table, together with the corresponding figures for 1900:— Registered Lodging-houses.

This necessitated the service of a total of 285 Notices during 1912. 38 In addition to the foregoing there are eleven Blocks of Dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is "self-contained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that in these circumstances they are not subject to the Bye-laws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family:— WEST DISTRICT.

COMMON LODGING-HOUSE, 116, Middlesex Street. The Salvation Army "Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," opened on the 7th February, 1906, at 116, Middlesex Street, is the only Common Lodging-House in the City. Accommodation is provided for 455 persons (including a staff of 26), and the charge for the hotel portion is 5d. per night, and for the Shelter 2d. per night, These prices include what is termed by the fraternity "a bath and a bake" (a bath and disinfection of clothing). Food can be purchased at the Hotel cheaply. The premises are periodically inspected and always found to be well managed and kept in a cleanly condition. During the year there has been no repetition of the nuisance formerly complained of, caused by a number of men congregating outside waiting for admission and spitting on the pavement. As men so waiting number on occasions over 100, this nuisance was very real, and the cessation is doubtless due to the action of the Authorities, who refuse admission to applicants if they have been waiting about in the immediate vicinity of the premises before the doors open at 5 p.m. DRAINAGE PLANS. In the course of the year, 361 plans have been submitted with regard to proposed reconstruction of water-closets or drains in the City. 40 Of these, 338 were approved, 13 revised and approved, and 10 not approved. In all cases where, on revision, it was found that the plans were not in accordance with the Corporation Bye-laws, the matter was submitted to the judgment of the Sanitary Committee. STREET GULLIES. The gradual substitution of properly trapped gullies for those formerly existing has greatly reduced the number of complaints received of offensive smells, arising from those appliances, especially in warm weather. In some cases this nuisance was doubtless due to want of flushing, but in the majority faulty construction was the cause of the trouble. The City Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past, and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more up-to-date design will, I hope, eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil. OVERCROWDING. Overcrowding is a nuisance to be dealt with summarily under Section 2, Sub-section 1 (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and during the year 5 cases were reported by your officers. On the service of the statutory notice of abatement the overcrowding was discontinued in each instance. SANITARY DEFECTS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE. In every case of notification of infectious disease, the premises involved were inspected with regard to the drainage system, water supply, ventilation, &c.; and of the 52 cases so investigated in 1912, it was found necessary to reconstruct the sanitary system in 3 instances, and to make amendments to soil and waste pipes, water-closets, &c., in 15 others. HOUSE, TRADE AND OTHER REFUSE REMOVAL. The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1912, consisted of 27,116 cartloads of street sweepings and slops, and 50,533 loads of house and trade refuse, a total of 77,649 loads. The total for the year 1911 was 78,583. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Lett's Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. The horse manure collected from the street orderly bins is not included in the above, but is dealt with by a contractor, who sells it to market gardeners, Ac. RAILWAY STATIONS. Periodical inspections were made of the sanitary accommodation provided at the twenty-six Railway Stations in the City. In 18 of them the Companies they belong to have been called upon to effect sanitary improvements. The defects, for the most part, have been due to the lack of proper cleaning and to defective drains and sanitary fittings. In all cases the necessary works have been satisfactorily carried out. 41 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. In two cases only, out of 723 notices issued during the year by the District Inspectors, was it found necessary in consequence of non-compliance, to refer the matter to the City Solicitor with a view to taking such steps as he deemed necessary to ensure the required sanitary improvements being carried out. In each instance, however, the notices were subsequently complied with, without the matter being taken into Court. The following are the cases referred to:— No. 6, Falcon Square—Insufficient water-closet accommodation—Arrangements made. Nos. 10-14, New Broad Street—Defective drains—Drains relaid. SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS. There are 280 courts and narrow passages throughout the City which were regularly flushed during the summer months under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service and the flushing of the main streets, no less than 72,501,883 gallons of water were used. Of these courts and alleys, 22 were flushed six times a week, 9 five times a week, 2 four times a week, 28 three times a week, 130 twice a week, and 89 once a week. Disinfectants are also freely applied where desirable. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Custom House, as heretofore, required special attention. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the immediate vicinity of these places free from the nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially during hot weather. LIMEWASHING OF COURTS. There are 96 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed frequently, become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of passengers or vehicles, together with the action of the smoke-laden atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. Of the places so dealt with during 1912, 24 were situated in the East District, 39 in the Middle District, and 33 in the West District. NEGLECT TO COMPLY WITH WATER-CLOSET BYE-LAWS. In accordance with the Bye-laws with respect to water-closets, &c., made under Section 54 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1900, every one who shall intend to construct a water-closet, or to connect or disconnect any water-closet from any soil pipe or drain, should at least seven days before the work is to be commenced, 42 deliver or send to the Corporation at the Guildhall, a plan showing the situation of such water-closet, drawn to scale, together with a section showing the proposed means of ventilation. Under Section 17 every person who shall offend against these Bye-laws renders himself liable to a penalty of 5l. for every such offence, and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further penalty of 40s. for each day after written notice of this offence from the Corporation, Any infringement of such a Bye-law is a serious matter and may lead to considerable trouble and expense to the owner of the property, inasmuch as it may necessitate the condemnation of a system installed in contravention of the Corporation requirements. Two instances of this neglect have occurred during the year, and the following is a resume of the facts in regard to each. 175, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, E.C. A water-closet was erected at these premises without the submission of plans to my Department. The structure itself was situated under the public way, and was, moreover, not in accord with the Corporation requirements. 20, FENCHURCH STREET, E.C. Erection of a water-closet in contravention of the Bye-laws and without notice being given. It is important that serious notice should be taken of such cases as these, as although they may appear of trifling importance, much waste of time and money may be caused by this neglect on the part of those responsible, and the matter was therefore placed in the hands of the City Solicitor. REPORT OF DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON INTERCEPTING TRAPS IN HOUSE DRAINS. The Departmental Committee appointed by the President of the Local Government Board on the 15th October, 1908, to enquire with regard to the use of intercepting traps in house drains, have now concluded their labours, and their Report, dated 22nd December, 1911, is a document of a highly interesting and instructive character. Although the investigation nominally originated with a proposal by the Willesden Urban District Council to adopt a series of Bye-laws, from which had been omitted the 43 requirement as to provision of an intercepting trap, the controversy regarding the necessity and usefulness of the intercepting trap in house drains, is one of very long standing The intercepting trap was originally employed in modern drainage systems in order to prevent the escape of sewer air into dwelling houses and the consequent injury to the health of the occupants, and those who favour the trap claim that in order to accomplish this it is essential to intercept the aerial connection between the public sewer and the private house drain, and that any disadvantages involved are mainly matters of detail, and capable of remedy. Further, in view of the importance of excluding sewer air from the drain, they advocate the endurance of any minor irremediable disadvantages should they exist. On the other hand, opponents of this trap, while agreeing that sewer air should not be allowed to escape into the dwelling, contend that this desirable end is not attained by use of this trap, and moreover the disadvantages attendant on its use are of a most serious nature. The results of the experiments conducted on behalf of the Commission are given in the Report, which is divided into eight parts, and five appendices. Part I. dealing with the disadvantages of the intercepting trap shows :— 1. That the appliance is always an obstacle to the free flow of the sewage. 2. That it retains anything up to 79 per cent. of the solids of the sewage. 3. That it is exceedingly liable to blockage. 4. That any blockage may exist for some considerable time quite unrecognised. 5. That the fresh air inlet necessitated by the provision of an intercepting trap is a source of danger to health. 6. That the trap complicates and increases the cost of construction of house drains. When a trap is introduced it is suggested that iron drains, 3 inches in diameter, should be used, and the channels in the manholes be covered and not left open as obtain in present practice. If this be done, blockages of the drain can then be brought to the notice of the householder earlier than would be the case if the manholes were left free to act as a reservoir for a considerable quantity of sewage. The advantages claimed for this intercepting trap are set out in Part 2. These advantages are two in number viz.:— 1. That they act as barriers to rats. 2. That they prevent the passage of sewer air into the house drains. These advantages, however, appear to be discounted by the result of the experiments, which show that rats can and do negotiate traps, and that, providing the 44 drains are properly constructed, any sewer air passing into the house drain can only escape through a ventilating shaft. So far as properly constructed drains are concerned, there does not appear, therefore, any reason for the introduction of the interceptors, but I must point out that its abolition must of necessity render the defective drain a more imminent source of danger to the household. Part 3 and Part 4 are mainly scientific, and deal with the chemistry and bacteriology of the sewer air. Epidemiologically, sewer air is shown to be harmless, and the only argument against it is that the smell is occasionally offensive, and that persons susceptible to smells are, or might be, affected thereby. In short, it is argued that if sewer air did get into the house, little harm would be occasioned. The conclusion arrived at in Part 5, "Bacteriology of Drain Air," shows that graver dangers are to be feared from the air of the house drain than from the air of the sewer. The general evidence obtained by the investigation is given in Part 6, and in arguing that the breathing of sewer air does not necessarily result in illness, the case of the sewer men is cited. There does not appear to be any definite evidence that these men suffer from either general ill-health or from such diseases as enteric fever or those diseases designated " Septic." Some experiments conducted on animals showed that guinea-pigs which breathed nothing but sewer air are no less healthy than those kept in less unpleasant surroundings. Part 7 is confined to ventilation of the sewers, and perusal of this part of the Report leads one to the conclusion that the importance of sewer ventilation has been largely exaggerated. It appears, however, that if ventilators are necessary, the higher up the openings are placed the better will they carry away the offensive smells. From the above it will be seen that the case against the intercepting trap appears to be supported by an overwhelming volume of evidence, yet in the conclusions contained in Part 8, the Commissioners, having regard to the varying susceptibility of different persons, and feeling that the matter is one of serious public health importance, have decided that the question as to whether the intercepting trap is required or not is one that should be considered by the Local Authority, the merits of each case and the peculiarities of each locality taking their due and proper place in their deliberations. REMOVAL OF FISH OFFAL. The contract with Messrs. F. S. Hempleman and Co., for the removal of fish offal, expired on the 21st May, 1912, and on the recommendation of the City Engineer and your Medical Officer of Health, was renewed for a further period of 12 months. 45 The conditions of the contract, which was originally entered into in May, 1906, and has since that date been in continual operation, require that the Contractor shall collect and remove, free of charge, between the hours of 7 p.m. and 9 a.m., all fish offal from the Corporation Markets and Fishmongers' premises in the City, to the entire satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, in specially constructed galvanised iron bins of a pattern approved by that Officer, and to thoroughly cleanse and disinfect such bins before returning them to the Markets and shops. The undertaking of the Contractor to remove the material during the evening hours instead of the morning in order to obviate the necessity of the offal remaining in the City all night, has been attended with the success anticipated, no complaints having been received this year of smells arising from all-night storing of such offensive matter. Before arrangements were made for the removal of fish offal by a Contractor, it was dealt with by the Corporation's own Officers in the ordinary way as trade refuse, but the present method is both a financial and hygienic advance. REMOVAL OF HUMAN REMAINS. Liverpool Street, E.C. During the year only one instance has arisen of the disturbance of human remains i n the City. The workmen engaged on the extension of the Central London Railway and the construction of a new terminus at Liverpool Street, in January, unearthed a quantity of bones. A licence for their removal, dated 22nd January, 1912, was issued by one of H.M. then Secretaries of State for Home Affairs, under the following conditions:— (1.) That the removal be effected with due care and attention, to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. (2) That the remains be forthwith removed to and re-interred in the Ilford Cemetery. As the remains were brought to the surface they were carefully placed in cases specially prepared for their reception and subsequently buried at the City of London Cemetery at Little Ilford in accordance with the terms of this Licence. In close proximity to the site where these remains were discovered a large quantity were unearthed in 1903, during the construction of the Liverpool Street Underground Convenience. The spot where these bones were found originally formed a portion of the South side of Bethlem burial ground, and was thrown into the public way when the North London Railway was built. 46 In both cases the remains showed evidence of having been disturbed and reburied, and without doubt formed part of the same deposit. HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. The Hairdressers' establishments throughout the City remain under the supervision of your officers, and there are now 24 proprietors oE these places who hold certificates that they have undertaken to comply with the Regulations of the Corporation for the conduct of their business. One saloon has been closed, in one case there was change of ownership, and in four the proprietors have left the City. The following establishments are now on the Register:— Jacob Arbeiter, 9, Duke Street. The Army and Navy Toilet Club, 35, Bucklersbury. Chester and Co., 42, Old Broad Street. Civil Service Supply Association, 136-140, Queen Victoria Street. William Clarke, 5, Birchin Lane. Samuel Cohen, 120, Newgate Street. Fox's Paragon Toilet Club, 60, Fore Street. Kaspar Gleinser, 137, Fenchurch Street. Carl Hartmann, 5, Queen's Head Passage, Newgate Street. Phillip George Hoerr, 1, Cullum Street. Anton Kaiser, 4, Liverpool Street. Kingstone and Hubbard, 8-10, Ludgate Arcade. Charles Lehman, 8-9, Aldermanbury Postern. Heinrich A, E. Leopold, 8, Masons' Avenue. Charles Massberg, 12, Cullum Street. Marsh and Prince, 36, Coleman Street. Albin Antony May, 77, Fetter Lane. Thomas W. Monk, 5, Angel Court. The New Baltic Toilet Co., 37, St. Mary Axe. Pierre Pozzi, 16, Lawrence Lane. Ernst Robert and Erich Beyer, 13, Pilgrim Street. Stephen J. Schuster, 125, Wood Street. Arthur Jules Schweitzer, Royal Hotel, Victoria Embankment. Joseph Witte, 151, Aldersgate Street. WELL WATER SUPPLY IN THE CITY. The investigation into the character of the water as obtained from wells sunk in the City has been continued during the year. Three separate City buildings have been added to the already large number that derive their supply of this necessary element from this source, and samples of the water from the wells sunk in their precincts have been taken and submitted to the Public Analyst with satisfactory results. 47 Recourse to the artesian well for a water supply has now been made in 52 buildings throughout the City, and I am informed that the increasing demand made upon the water-bearing strata has not resulted in any appreciable lowering of the water "rest" level of those already in existence. SMOKE NUISANCES. Twelve instances of smoke nuisances were reported daring 1912. The number of observations recorded amounted to 287, as against 334 noted in 1911. The service of notices upon offenders resulted in the abatement of the nuisances in all cases, and there has been no occasion to take further action in the matter. While considerable reduction of smoke nuisance has been effected, much further improvement would be possible were your statutory powers strengthened. Attention has been invited to this matter in many of my former Reports, and unfortunately it is still necessary to prove that the smoke emitted is "black" as well as that the premises of the offenders are not used as a "private dwelling house," before a prosecution is possible. THE RAILWAY OFFICES BILL. 1912. The Railway Offices Bill, 1912, was promoted by private Members of the House of Commons with a view to securing a general improvement in the conditions of labour of those employed in Railway Offices. Sections 1, 2 and 3 were confined to matters of general sanitation, and Sections 4 to 9 to hours of labour. The sanitary conditions that every Railway Office was expected to comply with were as follows:— (a) It must be kept in a cleanly state. (b) It must be kept free from effluvia arising from any drain, water-closet, earth closet, privy, urinal, or other nuisance. (c) It must not be so overcrowded while work is carried on therein as to be dangerous or injurious to the health of the persons employed therein. (d) It must be ventilated in an efficient manner. (e) It must be adequately lighted both by day and night. ( f) It must be provided with an adequate supply of pure drinking water. (g) Adequate measures must be taken both by day and by night for securing and maintaining a reasonable temperature in each room in which any person is employed. In order to secure proper observance of the requirements as regards cleanliness, it was provided that all the inside walls of the rooms of a Railway Office and all the ceilings or tops of those rooms and all the passages and staircases, if they have not been painted with oil or varnished once at least within seven years, should be limewashed, or if they have been papered, should be repapered once at least within every fourteen months. If they had been painted and varnished they should be washed with hot water and soap at least once within fourteen months. 48 Provision was also made for the weekly cleaning of windows. Such requirements as these are of course a step in the right direction, but it is difficult to understand why they should be restricted to Railway Offices only. Could they be extended to all offices where clerks and other persons are employed, their utility would, I am sure, soon become apparent in the general improvement in the health of a large and important section of the community, many of whom are at present earning their daily bread in surroundings of a most unsatisfactory and even dangerous character. In this age when so much appears to be done to alleviate the sufferings of the tuberculous patient and to secure his restoration to health, it is a matter of regret that our legislature do not furnish local authorities with more definite and efficient powers for remedying conditions in offices, which in many cases must contribute largely to the spread of this disease. Had the Railway Offices Bill passed into law, the duties of carrying its provisions into effect would have devolved upon the Inspector appointed by the Secretary of State under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Such arrangement would have resulted in considerable overlapping, and these duties should certainly be entrusted to the Local Authority who are already armed with some powers in this matter in accordance with existing legislation. The failure of this Bill to reach the third reading is regrettable, as the principle of the provision and maintenance of sanitary conditions in offices once established, little difficulty should be experienced in extending it in the directions I have indicated. THE RAG FLOCK ACT, 1911. The Rag Flock Act, 1911, which came into operation on the 1st July, 1912, prohibits any person selling or having in his possession for sale, any flock manufactured from rags, or using for the purpose of making any articles of upholstery, cushions or bedding, flock manufactured from rags, or having in his possession such flock intended to be used for any of the foregoing purposes, unless it conform to the following standard of cleanliness prescribed by the Local Government Board Order of the 8th June, 1912, i.e.:— "Flock shall be deemed to conform to the standard of cleanliness for the " purposes of sub-section (1) of Section 1 of the Act, when the amount of " soluble chlorine, in the form of chlorides, removed by thorough washing " with distilled water at a temperature not exceeding 25 degrees Centigrade " from not less than 40 grammes of well mixed samples of flock, does not " exceed 30 parts of chlorine to 100.000 parts of flock." In the event of any offence against the Act, any person charged with such offence shall be entitled, if he bought the flock from any person resident within the United Kingdom under a warranty that it complied with the foregoing standard of cleanliness, and took reasonable steps to ascertain, and did in fact, believe in the accuracy of such warranty, to have the person who gave the warranty brought before the Court and summarily convicted of the offence. It is the duty of the Sanitary Authority of the district to administer this Act and for this purpose the Medical Officer of Health or Sanitary Inspector are empowered accordingly. 49 Provision is made for the division of the sample into two parts and the sealing thereof, and the obstruction of any officer in the execution of this duty renders the offender liable to a fine not exceeding £5. The various premises of bedding manufacturers, upholsterers and other shops in the City of London where flock might be used in the conduct of the business, have been visited, and the warehouses and workshops thereof inspected, but in no case does it appear that rag flock is used or intended to be used. In all the upholsterers' workshops in the City, it is the custom, where any rag flock or other rubbish occasionally used in chairs, or other articles sent for repair, is found, to destroy the same, and substitute hair, new cotton flock, mill-puff, &c., in the remaking. Any person convicted of an offence against this Act shall be liable to a fine not exceeding in the case of a first offence, ten pounds, or in the case of a second or subsequent offence, fifty pounds. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES. The work required to be done under the above Act continues to increase, the total number of premises registered being in excess of any previous year. The premises at present upon the Register number 4,028, and represent 7,977 workrooms, &c. As mentioned in my previous reports, a new register is made every year, containing only such information as is necessary for the current year's work. This special register also serves a necessary purpose in connection with the report required by the Act to be sent to H.M. Home Office each year, the figures required being abstracted from it. The yearly register is also useful in another respect, the premises being entered in numerical and alphabetical order, which greatly facilitates the work of inspection, as well as making it more easy for reference. In the reference book to Inspectors for 1912 there are 4,738 entries, and there were 3,572 notices served during the year for various purposes under the Act. The condition of the places inspected shows a general improvement as time proceeds. The number of Factories, Workshops, and Workplaces at present registered is as follows:— Premises. Workrooms, &c.  Factories 805 3,232 Workshops 2,162 3,684 Workplaces :— Kitchens of Restaurants, Tea-rooms, &c. 914 914 Stables 24 24 Other places 123 123 Totals 4,028 7,977 Of the 3,232 Factory Workrooms registered, 2,058 were occupied by men only, 546 by women only, and 628 by men and women. 50 Of the 3,684 Workshops registered, 1,920 were occupied by men only, 1,047 by women only, 682 by men and women, 32 were " Domestic Workshops," and 3 tenement Workshops. The number of workers employed was as follows :— Men. Women.  Factories 20,484 12,712 Workshops 8,394 11,873 Workplaces (Kitchens, &c.) 5,623 6,496 Totals 34,501 31,081 The following is a summary of inspections of separate Workrooms, &c., since the passing of the Act:— Factories.

The premises registered as Factories were duly inspected. The local authority has but limited responsibilities with respect to factories. The necessary cleansing comes under the supervision of H.M. Inspectors, as well as ventilation, &c., &c. The principal defects remediable by the Local Authority are the want of suitable and sufficient water-closet accommodation for both sexes and the abatement of general nuisances. Defects remediable under the Factory Acts other than as above-mentioned, when noticed in the course of inspection, are referred to H.M. Inspector. During the year 31 defects were so referred. 51 *Details of Factory Inspections, 1912.

In the year 1902, it became the duty of Local Authorities to see to the condition of all Workshops and the abatement of nuisances therein. The want of cleanliness and ventilation, the provision of suitable and sufficient water-closet accommodation, the abatement of overcrowding, the affixing of abstracts of the Act within workshops, the keeping of Lists of Outworkers upon the premises, &c., are some of the matters requiring attention. Constant changes in business arrangements are the principal reason for interference on the part of the Local Authority. It is frequently found in such cases that entirely new arrangements have to be made with regard to water-closet accommodation, &c. *Details of Workshop Inspections, 1912. Workshops notified by H.M.

(Kitchens of Restaurants, &c). The kitchens of restaurants, &c., were inspected as heretofore, and speaking generally an improvement was noticeable in their condition. It should be remembered that the business of a City restaurant is crowded into a very few hours in the day, and this results, in some cases, in extremely untidy conditions in the kitchen, necessitating constant cleansing—the want of which is the principal defect now found in kitchens. As a rule, however, your orders are carried out willingly and without delay. As mentioned in my previous reports Workplaces (unlike Factories and Workshops) may be established without notice to anyone. This is a serious defect in the Act, and more especially so in cases where food is stored or prepared. Any basement cellar may be used for the purpose and remain uninspected for years until it happens to be discovered, or complaint of some serious nuisance is received. 53 Other premises besides kitchens were inspected, including those occupied by provision merchants, grocers, fried fish vendors, fruiterers and greengrocers, &c. *Details of Workplace Inspections, &c., 1912.

Aboveground bakehouses 6 Underground bakehouses 21 Total number of bakehouses in the City 27 The Bakehouses were inspected as usual, 143 visits being made. Cleansing, &c., was needed in 23 cases which was carried out forthwith on service of notice. Generally speaking these places are kept in good condition and up to the standard required by the Act. The use of the underground bakehouse at No. 12, Gracechurch Street, has been discontinued (premises pulled down). SANITARY DEFECTS IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS NOTIFIED IN 1911 BY H.M. INSPECTOR OF FACTORIES. Complaints were received from H.M. Inspector in respect of 45 matters which were all disposed of before the end of the year or early in the year 1913. As previously mentioned, when dirty conditions or want of ventilation, &c., in Factories are observed, H.M. Inspector is at once notified of the fact—any necessary work being carried out under his immediate supervision. OUTWORKERS AND "HOME" WORKERS. The provisions of the Act relating to Outworkers were carried out as heretofore. The lists of the names and addresses of Outworkers receiving work from the City were duly received without the necessity of legal proceedings. Altogether 15,737 names were transmitted, with other details respecting each case, to the several Local Authorities, as required by the Act. Only very few "home" workers are engaged in the City, and these are dealt with by your Women Inspectors, together with Outworkers employed in the City, excepting in cases where men only are employed. The following figures show the steady increase of numbers:— Year. Number of Lists received. Outworkers Employed in City. Outworkers Employed outside City. Total number of Outworkers. 1902 - 17 3,752 3,769 (Note.—1st Notice issued to all employers at end of 1904.) 1905 576 236 7,891 8,127 1908 1,506 624 16,909 17,533 1911 1,515 656 16,405 17,061 1912 1,481 709 15,777 16,486 In a number of cases employers neglected to keep lists at their premises and to send copies of the same to the Corporation as required by the Act. In each case notice was served upon the offender and in all cases complied with. \ There was no case of infectious disease at any premises occupied by Outworkers in the City, but seven "contacts" with scarlet fever were notified. The necessary enquiries were made in each case and all precautions taken. 55. THIS TABLE WAS ISSUED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD BY REQUEST OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. †The figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers, as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximately) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be reneated. 4.—REGISTERED WORKSHOPS. 5.—OTHER MATTERS.

In use at the end of the year 21 Dated 31st December, 1912. (Signature) W. COLLINGR1D GE. Medical Officer ofHealth. Note. The Factory and orkshop Act. 1901 (S. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the administration of that Act in workshops and workplaces, and to send a copy of his Annual Report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State (Home Office). If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Memorandum of December, 1904. A further Memorandum on the Home Work Provisions of the Factory Act was issued to all District Councils and Medical Officers of Health in October, 1906. 58 WOMEN SANITARY INSPECTORS, In consequence of the vacancy on the staff not having been filled, it has been found impossible to complete the routine inspection of the factories, workshops and workplaces on the Register during the year. All new workshops notified by H.M. Inspectors have been inspected, and all complaints relating to premises in which women are employed, have been dealt with. FACTORIES. The number of factories inspected during the year was as follows:— Initial Inspections 66 Periodical Inspections 313 Re-inspections 14 Total 393 WORKSHOPS. Initial Inspections 209 Periodical Inspections 949 Re-inspections 157 Total 1,315 To these must he added the few Domestic Workshops, the number of visits paid being—Initial Inspections 6, Periodical Inspections 31, and Re-inspections 2, making a total of 39. WORKPLACES. The inspection of the kitchens of restaurants, tea-shops, &c., has been continued ; attention is mainly directed to securing proper means of carrying off fumes from gas stoves and providing adequate ventilation. Initial Inspections 5 Periodical Inspections 183 Re-inspections 66 Total 254 The total number of women employed in the above-mentioned premises is 14,179. 59 OFFICES. Complaints are constantly received calling attention to insanitary conditions in offices in which women clerks are employed ; these are all promptly investigated, and any defects found have been remedied, i.e., ventilation has been improved, overcrowding abated, sanitary accommodation provided or improved. Typewriting is an occupation making a peculiar tax on nerve and brain—the eye, the brain, the spine are all involved as well as the fingers, and it becomes a matter of vital importance that the conditions under which such work is carried on should be carefully and intelligently considered from a health standpoint. It is obvious that a higher standard will be demanded than that required in the case of mechanical work, and that one of the essential considerations must be efficient lighting. SCHOOL CHILDREN. The inspection of the dwellings of children, notified by the London County Council as requiring cleansing, has been carried out; 53 cases have been reported, and 66 visits have been paid. It is only fair to say that in the majority of cases experience tends to show that the cause of the children's condition must be sought for elsewhere than in the state of the home. PUBLIC CONVENIENCES FOR WOMEN. In addition to other work the Ladies' Waiting Rooms at Railway Stations and the Underground Conveniences for Women have been inspected. CHILDREN ACT, 1908. A notification was received from a Board of Guardians stating that a "nurse-child" had been removed from their district to an address in the City. On the first inspection the premises were found to be satisfactory, and subsequent visits showed that the child was well cared for and had improved in health. After some months the infant was removed to another district in London, and the London County Council was duly notified of the fact. 60 DOMESTIC WORKSHOPS, 1912. Premises. Trade. No. of Workers.

The Report of the Superintendent of the Central Markets shows that for the year ending 31st December, 1912, there was a decrease of 3,522 tons in the quantity of food delivered in the Central Markets, Smithfield.

Every year shows an increase in the quantities of frozen and chilled meat imported into this country, and a decrease in the number of animals imported for slaughter at the ports of landing. The following figures are interesting:— Live Stock Imports. Year. Cattle. and Lambs. 1907 472,015 105,601 1912 48,912 15,430 Decrease 423,103 90,171 Meat Imports. Year. Quarters of Beef (Chilled).

The following particulars taken from Messrs. Weddel's report are instructive in showing how much this country depends on importations for its meat supply:— 62 Table showing the Ports in the United Kingdom at which the importations from Australia, New Zealand and South America were discharged during 1912.

(b) That Australia furnishes only 14 per cent. of the imports, New Zealand only 18.17 per cent., South America 64.09 per cent., and other countries the balance, 3.74 per cent. The imports from New Zealand for the year 1912 showed an increase of 8.4 per cent. more than in 1911. Australia showed a decrease of 6.6 per cent., and South America showed a decrease in mutton and lamb but an increase of 4.8 per cent. in exports of meat more than in 1911, while North America, which at one time was considered an inexhaustible source of supply, has lost ground so much that it has now ceased to be a factor in the trade. Exportation of Meat to the Continent. This trade expands very slowly, there being many difficulties re regulations as to organs being left in situ, duties, &c. During 1912 the total shipments from all sources to the Continent, including Mediterranean ports, are calculated as amounting to 20,368 tons, against 17,661 tons for 1911. 1911. The following table shows the amount of meat exported from Smithfield, accompanied by Certificates from the Medical Officer of Health or the Veterinary Inspector :— Exported to Fore-quarters of Beef.

The quality of the meat coming from Argentina is of a high standard, but unfortunately at. times quarters of beef arrive which, on being cut into joints, show some of the lymph glands affected with tuberculosis. This matter has given all concerned much serious thought during the year. The importers of the meat are desirous that only sound meat should arrive, and it is only just to state that many of the cases were reported to us by the importers as they observed the lesions when the meat was cut up. The firms concerned have repeatedly asked for suggestions as to the best means of preventing a recurrence of the trouble. 65 Mr. E. Del Costillo, the Argentine Veterinary Inspector, has been indefatigable in his efforts to prevent this class of meat arriving. He has personally examined every piece of meat found unsound, and made special reports thereon. It has been suggested to him that no carcase which shows any lesion of disease, either in the carcase or in the organs, be exported, and he has reported to his Chief to that effect; it is to be hoped that in this suggestion a remedy may be found. Argentine Meat found Diseased. 43 hind-quarters of beef. 8 fore-quarters and pieces of beef. 14 top pieces of beef. 5 rumps „ 4 flanks „ 1 aitchbone „ 1 loin „ The trouble re moulds on beef has almost ceased, and it is now uncommon to observe meat so affected, instead of being, as it was a few years ago, an every day sight. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for another trouble, viz., bone taint, which is the cause of much good quality meat being destroyed; it is to be hoped that ere long a remedy may be found for this waste of meat. Australian Meat. It is gratifying to report that the hopes expressed in last year's Annual Report have been nearly fulfilled. The Australian Inspectors have improved in their work to a marked degree; in only a few consignments did we and more than 2 per cent. of the beef showing nodules, and these were in the majority of cases small nodules which had evidently escaped observation at the time of inspection. The majority of the consignments on examination were found free from parasites. No doubt those concerned in Australia, and even in this country, thought that the regulations applying to this meat were too severe, but they have produced the desired result, viz., the arrival of the meat practically free from parasites, thus protecting the interests of the consumers, assisting the Inspectors at the ports of landing, and saving the owners of the meat considerable expense in the handling of the meat in the Cold Stores. A number of calves' carcases arrived in London which were of very poor quality and were unsuitable for the trade; when the carcases were thawed out they were seen to be devoid of fat and the flesh very dark in colour, flaccid and unsightly. The same remarks apply to a number of carcases of mutton. As previously reported, this class of meat is unfitted for exportation—it is too poor in quality to stand the effects of freezing and thawing. These carcases were seen by Mr. Cherry, the Australian Veterinary Inspector, who agrees with this opinion. There is still a marked difference between the quality of the majority of the beef arriving from Australia and that from Argentina ; the prices paid for the best breed of bulls showed gratifying results by the class of meat sent from Argentina and placed on the Smithfield Markets during the Christmas week. A few cases of tuberculosis were observed, but in justice to the Inspectors in Australia, it is only right to state that the lesions were deep seated, and with one exception could not be seen until the meat was broken into joints. 66 Quantity of Meat Examined. 94,849 hind-quarters of beef. 27,509 fore-quarters of beef. 1,756 buttocks of beef. Swedish Meat. By special arrangement under the Foreign Food Regulations, Swedish meat, other than pig carcases, is allowed to be delivered on the Markets without inspection at the port of landing, subject to the condition that it is not sold until examined. The following tables show the quantity that arrived and the result of the examination:— 1,154 Calves. 30 Pigs. 748 Calves' Plucks. 17 Pigs' Plucks. 440 Calves' Breads. 326 Sides of Beef. 2,169 Calves' Heads. 1,521 Sheeps' Heads. 1,043 Calves' Tops. 1,064 Sheeps' Plucks. 227 Ox Tails. 501 Sheeps' Tops. 136 Ox Heads. 103 Cows' Udders. 710 Ox Tongues. 371 Sets of Offals. 162 Ox Lungs. 186 Feet (various). 202 Ox Livers. 7 Hampers of Suet. 99 Ox Plucks. 11 Stone Tripe. 20,223 Ox Kidneys.

The following table shows the number of carcases, organs, &c., found affected with tuberculosis. The organs were only slightly affected, and had, no doubt, escaped the attention of the senders. In the case of carcases and heads, the disease was invariably confined to the lymph glands, and the senders apparently were ignorant of the presence of the disease; only in one case was there appearance of gross carelessness, and a prosecution was instituted against the owner, who was found guilty and fined. 67 A considerable amount of microscopical work has been done re localised tuberculosis, and all the results have confirmed the opinions already expressed, viz., that where the disease is confined to the glands of the head, and the remainder of the carcase, after minute examination, presents no abnormal appearance, then the carcase, minus the head, may be passed as fit for human food. At present attention is being directed to the prevalence of the disease in poultry by making a post mortem examination of emaciated fowls, condemned as unfit for food, in the City Markets. Those examinations are proceeding, and at present it is sufficient to state that 50 per cent. of poor quality fowls are affected with tuberculosis, and in a degree which requires to be seen in order to realise its importance.

During the year a consignment of pig carcases stamped "Killed, Municipal Slaughterhouses, Shanghai," were deposited on the Central Markets. Several of the carcases showed that no examination had taken place. Seven of them were seized as unfit for human food, due to the following conditions:— Four affected with tuberculosis, Three „ „ hæmorrhagic adenitis, in addition to which the carcases were dirty and the rectum containing ingesta lef in situ. The matter was reported to the Local Government Board (see page 74). COLD STORES. The Cold Stores have been regularly visited, and the following table shows in detail the quantity of unsound food seized and destroyed, which is a considerable reduction when compared with 1911. This is accounted for by the seizure in the former year of large quantities of meat which had become unfit for food due to the Railway Strike. COLD STORES.

The two Inspectors stationed at Aldgate have performed good work during the year. Bye-law No. 19, which provides for butchers giving notice if they intend to slaughter animals before 7 a.m. or after 3 p.m. on Sundays, and before 6 a.m. or after 9 p.m. on weekdays, has again proved useful, as the following table shows:— Extra hours of duty performed by Inspectors.

It is probable that the increase at Aldgate would have been greater if the outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease had not caused considerable difficulty to the butchers in obtaining animals. 70 Number of Animals Killed at Aldgate.

In January, 1910, I had occasion to call attention to the unsatisfactory condition of a consignment of pigs, arriving in the City from China, and to the manner in which these were dressed before shipment. It was then arranged, inter alia, that future parcels should have the cervical and intermaxillary regions cut and thoroughly opened out and fixed before freezing, in order that the carcases, on arrival on this side, might be examined with a minimum of trouble and loss of time. Although improvement was evident for some little time, unfortunately this arrangement was not adhered to, and it is consequently necessary to thaw out the carcases before they can be properly examined. 75 Not only is there evidence of this indifferent butchering, but further, whatever inspection was made before shipment could only have been of a most perfunctory character. On the 24th of June last a consignment of these pigs was placed on the Central Markets, and examination by your Officers showed that some attempt had been made to examine the lymph glands of the heads before exportation by gouging out a portion of the neck of the posterior edge of the inferior maxilla on one side only, but the results arrived at by examination in their frozen condition were so unsatisfactory that the consignment was detained until sufficiently thawed out to allow of the submaxillary lymphatic glands being incised and examined. It was then found that these glands had not been previously cut into, in fact, the intermaxillary space had not been incised, and in seven cases the cervical region had not been opened up, the trachea and oesophagus being left in situ. In a number of cases the rectum, with its contents, was left in situ. The result of the examination was that four cases, or nine per cent., were condemned on account of Tuberculosis, and four on account of Hæmorrhagic Adenitis, and the unwholesome condition of the carcases, due to dirt, ingesta, &c. The Tuberculosis diagnosis was confirmed by a microscopical examination conducted by Mr. Dunlop Young, and all the facts reported to the Local Government Board. All the carcases were stamped "Killed, Municipal Slaughterhouses, Shanghai, February, 1912." It was explained to the Agent for the Consignors that proper examination could not have been made, inasmuch as the cervical region and intermaxillary space had not been opened up, and that without this being done, the carcases should not have been certified as "Free from disease." It was further pointed out to the Agent, that in future this should be done, and also a transverse incision made from the wing of the atlas on the one side, to the wing on the other side posterior to the edge of the inferior maxillæ, and skewers put in so as to keep the incisions open. If this be done it will be possible to examiné the carcases without the preliminary thawing out. Under the present conditions this procedure, which is undoubtedly prejudicial to the conditions of the meat, is absolutely necessary. FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE. In view of the prevalence of Foot and Mouth Disease during the first half of the year, the Local Government Board, after communication with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, issued a circular letter (dated 10th July, 1912), to Local Authorities, suggesting that Medical Officers of Health, Inspectors of Nuisances, and Assistant Officers under the Food Regulations, should exercise the strictest vigilance in the supervision of abattoirs and slaughterhouses and places where meat is deposited and exposed for sale. Foot and Mouth Disease has, in some cases, been discovered among cattle slaughtered at abattoirs, and also in certain parts of carcases when exposed for sale. 76 In view of the nature of the disease find the ease with which infection is conveyed, the Board emphasize the importance of a strict supervision over the meat supply by those Officers entrusted with the safeguarding of the public health, especially with a view to the distribution of meat or offal showing signs of this disease. The parts of carcases and the organs requiring especially careful examination, are the heads, feet, and tongues, and whenever lesions or signs suspiciously indicative of Foot and Mouth Disease are discovered, the Inspecting Officer should communicate with the Inspector appointed under the Diseases of Animals Act and retain for inspection the suspected part or parts, in order that any further action which may be considered necessary to trace the disease to its source may be taken. Stringency of examination is a sine qua non in the administration of the Meat Inspection Section of the Department, and all the Officers of that branch of the service are fully competent to detect suspicious cases of Foot and Mouth Disease. Moreover, the Veterinary Inspector in charge is also the Inspector under the Diseases of Animals Act, and it will be obvious that the relationship thus established must operate to the advantage of the public service. CONDEMNED MEAT SHED. HARROW ALLEY. For the storage of meat condemned at the Aldgate Slaughterhouses preparatory to removal in the Contractors' vans, a wooden box was erected on the public way in Harrow Alley as long ago as 1883. From time to time complaints have been made as to the offensive smells emanating from this receptacle, and although everything was done to eliminate any nuisance, it was found impossible by reason of the absorbent qualities of the wood to regard this method of the storage of unsound meat as anything but objectionable. Further, in view of the recently adopted system of continuous inspection of the carcases at the time of slaughter and the consequent increase in the quantity of meat seized, the capacity of the box was altogether inadequate for the purpose for which it was designed. Moreover, after so many years' use its repair or replacement became a matter of immediate necessity, and advantage was taken of the opportunity thus afforded to adopt more comprehensive and hygienic methods. Arrangements were made for the leasing of a stable in Harrow Alley in close proximity to the Aldgate Slaughterhouses, at an annual rental of £30, in which could be housed one of the Corporation's new tank vans. All meat condemned in the Slaughterhouses could then be placed at once into this receptacle, which would daily discharge its contents at the Contractors' premises. FISH SUPPLIES. 223,926 tons of fish, of which 155,286 were land-borne and 68,640 water-borne, were received at or near Billingsgate Market during the year. There was a decrease of 8,091 tons in the land deliveries, and a decrease of 2,451 tons in the deliveries by water. 77 MONTHLY FISH RETURNS, 1912.

As a result of the daily inspection of the City Wharves, 174 loads of Unsound Food were removed from these places during the year by the Cleansing Department. The material so disposed of comprised :— Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Tinned fruit and vegetables 26 17 0 Condensed milk 121 19 3 Miscellaneous tinned food 34 15 3 Fruit pulp 22 4 3 Fruit and vegetables 11 13 1 Miscellaneous food 1 13 1 Total 219 3 3 The greater portion of the above was removed at the written request of the owners. Section 47 (8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, provides that— " Where a person has in his possession any article which is unsound or " unwholesome or unfit for the food of man, he may, by written notice to the " Sanitary Authority, specifying such article, and containing a sufficient " identification of it, request its removal, and the Sanitary Authority shall cause it " to be removed as if it were trade refuse." This provision takes away the ground of a common defence in prosecutions for being in possession of unsound food. It has often been suggested that the food was set aside with the intention of destroying it before it was discovered by the Inspector. This power to notify to Sanitary Authorities under this section affords a test where this line of defence is adopted. Additional powers with regard to dealing with imported food have now been conferred upon your Officers by the Regulations made by the Local Government Board under the provisions of the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907. 79 ICE CREAM. In 1912 there were 215 premises in the City where ice creams were sold, as compared with 243 in 1911. In 93 instances the ice cream sold at these establishments was manufactured under supervision within the City, and in 122 cases the commodity was prepared in other districts and brought into the City ready for sale. In the latter cases, letters of enquiry relating to the conditions of manufacture were sent to the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough in which the ice creams were made. Satisfactory reports were received in each case, and this illustrates the great improvement that has taken place in the production of this article during the last three years. The decrease in the number of vendors of ice cream is probably attributable to the cold and wet summer; many confectioners refraining from making ice cream at all during the season. The places of sales may be classified as under: — Number. Plate of Manufacture. In the City. In other Districts. Tea shops 115 35 80 Confectioners 20 14 6 Small confectioners and light refreshment shops 80 44 36 ITINERANT ICE CREAM VENDORS. Since the City of London Street Traders Act (Traffic) 1909, which came into operation on October 1st, 1912, there has been almost a total disappearance of these alien street nuisances; previous to this, 28 were found to be hawking their wares in the streets of the City. Their names and addresses were obtained, and information as to the place of manufacture was forwarded to the Medical Officer of the district. Favourable reports were received in each case. One itinerant vendor of ice cream was summoned for failing to exhibit a name and place of manufacture of the ice cream on the barrow from which he was selling, in accordance with the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, Sections 42, 43 and 44. The summoning officer was unable to serve the summons owing to the fact that the man had disappeared the day previously. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS ORDERS. At the end of the year there were 638 purveyors of milk registered in the City of London, as compared with 639 in 1912, a decrease of one only. Singularly, last year the difference as compared with the previous year was also only one—an increase. The sale of milk was discontinued at 34 premises, and the owners' names removed from the register ; 33 new premises were added, and 23 changes of ownership necessitating re-registration occurred. Section 5 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, provides that any Sanitary Authority in the Metropolis may remove from or refuse to enter on the Register the names of dairymen or purveyors of milk whose premises are, in the opinion of such Sanitary Authority, for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk 80 thereon. Any person feeling aggrieved by any decision of a Sanitary Authority under the provisions of this section has the right to appeal, within twenty-one days from the date of such decision, to a Court of Summary Jurisdiction. This very necessary Act has had a most beneficial effect in enabling the Authorities to deal with the sale of milk in small chandler and grocery shops, either by the adoption of more precautionary measures for the proper storage of milk at such shops, or the prevention of the sale of milk on such premises altogether, and a marked improvement is noticeable as regards the condition of milkshops generally, no interference being found necessary as regards either the cleanliness of the shops or the vessels and utensils used bv the retailers. J In no instance has a case of infectious disease been reported as having occurred at a registered milk shop during the year. A list of Registered Dairymen and Purveyors of Milk in the City is given in Appendix D. REGISTRATION OF PURVEYORS OF MILK. Under the provisions of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, every purveyor of milk, dairyman or cowkeeper carrying on his trade, must be registered as such by the Local Sanitary Authority, and it has been the custom in the City to require registration of any firm selling or purveying milk in any degree, and on this principle, restaurants, tea rooms, and coffee houses, &c., have been subject to the control thus engendered. In June, 1902, the question was raised as to whether the owners of licensed premises, who sold milk over the counter, were liable to such registration. The question remained in abeyance until January, 1912, when Messrs Spiers and Pond were summoned at the instance of the Finsbury Borough Council for not having registered in respect of their premises at Farringdon Street Station. At the hearing the following facts were proved: Messrs. Spiers and Pond were tenants and occupiers of a refreshment buffet and bar at the Farringdon Street Station, and sold there different articles of food and drink, &c., amongst which articles was milk. The quantity of milk daily delivered at these premises averaged about four quarts, of which two were used for cooking purposes, and one consumed by the staff. It was stated that the takings from the sale of milk at this dep6t would amount to about fourpence out of a weekly turnover of 50l., and that in no circumstances was milk sold for consumption off the premises. It was, however, never refused when asked for for consumption on the premises. The magistrate convicted, holding that, within the meaning of the Order, any person who provided milk for and supplied it to persons wishing for it, was a purveyor of milk, and that carrying on the trade of a purveyor meant the providing and supplying of an article for profit. The defendants were fined 5l. with two guineas costs. 81 An appeal against this decision was heard in the King's Bench Division in October, 1912, before Lord Alverstone, L.C.J. Channell, and Avory, J.J., who held that the magistrate had wrongly convicted the appellants, who in their view were not " carrying on the trade of purveyors of milk " within the meaning of the Order, and that, therefore, they did not require to be registered. In giving his judgment, however, Lord Alverstone said that he did not decide what would under other circumstances constitute "the purveying of milk," though this judgment referred to above shows that a person in order to be a "purveyor" of milk must carry on the business so that the selling of milk is a substantial and not merely a subsidiary part of such business. The whole issue turned upon the meaning of the expression "carrying on the trade of a purveyor of milk," and it is now established that a person who occasionally sells milk in connection with another business does not carry on the trade of a purveyor of milk, within the meaning of these Orders, and consequently does not require to be registered under the provisions of the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders. As there is a large number of firms in the City selling milk under similar conditions, the decision, which involves the loss to sanitary authorities of the most effective means of control of this class of milk-seller, is one of the greatest importance. The value of Section 5 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which provides that any Sanitary Authorities in the Administrative County of London (which includes the City) may remove from, or refuse to enter on the Register, the names of dairymen or purveyors of milk whose premises are in the opinion of such Sanitary Authority for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk, is largely discounted by the decision under review, as the provisions of the section were mainly directed against the small and occasional sales of milk, such as from chandlers' or general shops, grocers' shops, restaurateurs, and the small confectioners' shops, the proprietors of which are, in the majority of cases, foreigners, and has in many cases been found useful in remedying conditions altogether unfavourable to the proper and cleanly sale or storage of milk. The Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, Section 34, as amended by the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1886, empowers the Local Government Board to make Orders for the registration with the Local Authority of all persons carrying on the trade of cowkeepers, dairymen or purveyors of milk, but gives no definition of a "purveyor of milk." It would appear, therefore, that the legislation would intend it to mean in fact what it says, i.e., any person purveying (or selling) milk. A purveyor of an article is a person who carries on the business of supplying and selling that article, and I would point out that although the sale of milk by a person carrying on the sale of other articles of food may be small and merely supplemental to such trade, there is no guarantee that such sale of milk may not largely increase; moreover—and this in my opinion is a most important point—the mere fact that the sale of milk is only incidental to other business would tend to result in less care being taken in handling and dealing with it, and that there was consequently an even greater need of control than obtained in properly registered dairies. 82 The quantity of milk sold should certainly not be a factor in determining the necessity for supervision, but such principle appears to be established by the above decision, and many persons at present registered will doubtless avail themselves of the opportunity offered and withdraw their names from the Register. As a matter of fact, I have already experienced this effect of the above-mentioned ruling. The small class of milk sellers mainly affected are the very class who from the Public Health point of view require the closest supervision, and upon my recommendation the Corporation of London made a representation to the Local Government Board asking them to amend the Order in question in such a way as to make it applicable to all persons selling milk within the City, or if it be considered necessary to except any class, such exception should be clearly defined. The representation has not yet had the desired effect. SALE OF MILK IN CHANDLERS' SHOPS. Some prominence was given during the year to the question of the sale of milk in chandlers' shops. Tt was suggested at a meeting of the London Retail Dairymen's Association, that there was considerable variation in the Metropolitan Boroughs as to the interpretation of the law with regard to the sale of milk on premises which are, perhaps, unsuitable. A letter was accordingly addressed to all Local Authorities throughout the Metropolis, with a view to obtaining greater uniformity of action in regard to this matter. In the City every purveyor of milk is required to be so registered in accordance with the regulations made under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, and such registration may be refused or delayed, and the name of any person duly registered removed from the Register, by order of Section 5 (Sub-Section 1) of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, which reads as follows :— "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Dairies, Cowsheds and "Milkshops Order, 1885, or in any subsequent Order, any sanitary authority "may remove from the Register kept by them of persons from time to time "carrying on in their district the trade of cow-keepers, dairymen or purveyors "of milk, or may refuse to enter upon such Register the name of any person "carrying on or proposing to carry on the trade of a dairyman or purveyor of "milk upon premises which are in the opinion of such sanitary authority "for any reason unsuitable for the sale of milk therein. "Provided that for the purposes of this Section, premises shall not be "deemed to be unsuitable for the sale of milk therein on any ground inconsistent "with the provisions or requirements of any Order or Regulation made under "any Enactment for the time being in force and applicable to such premises." So far as the requirements relate to chandlers' shops, the City has little concern therewith, as none of these shops within its limits sells or stocks milk in any degree. Other small general shops there are in plenty, and these are always required to be registered. 83 Before such premises are registered, however, a certain standard of cleanliness and sanitation has to be observed, and in order to render the milk sold as free from contamination as possible, every applicant for registration is required to provide a close fitting cabinet to entirely enclose the counter pan, which shall itself also be provided with an individual and separate close fitting lid. SALE OF MILK REGULATIONS, 1912. Representations have from time to time been made to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries by Local Authorities of districts where there is a trade in skimmed and separated milk, that Regulation 3 of the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901, does not operate satisfactorily in the prevention of the sale of skimmed milk to which no water has been added. This Regulation provides that skimmed or separated milk (not being condensed milk) containing less than 9 per cent, of milk solids shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, not to be genuine, by reason of the abstraction therefrom of milk solids other than milk fat, or the addition thereto of water. Considerable practical difficulty has arisen in instituting proceedings in cases in which water has been added to skimmed milk, but, owing to the fact that the milk has been imperfectly skimmed, the total solids have not fallen below 9 per cent. Thus a sample containing 1.5 per cent, of fat and 7.5 per cent, of milk solids other than milk fat, would probably contain over 12 per cent, of added water, though the total solids are up to the limit of 9 per cent. In such cases, Public Analysts are frequently loth to certify adulteration, and even when cases are taken into Court many magistrates appear unwilling to convict. Further, in practice, the old Regulations on occasions undoubtedly pressed heavily on sellers of separated milk, as the following hypothetical instances will indicate. The milk fat of milk containing 3 per cent, of milk fat and 8.5 per cent, of milk solids other than milk fat, was reduced by the process of separation to 0.1 per cent.; the percentage of total solids will thus only be 8.85, and a presumption of adulteration with water accordingly arises, although in point of fact no adulteration has taken place. As a result of the representations made on the matter, the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, in exercise of the powers conferred on them by Section 4 of The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, have issued The Sale of Milk Regulations, 1912. These Regulations are intended to obviate the difficulties previously experienced, and to facilitate the prevention of the adulteration of skimmed milk with water, and with this object replace the limit of 9 per cent, of total solids, below which a presumption of adulteration with water would arise, by a limit of 8.7 of milk solids other than milk fat. In cases where milk has been imperfectly skimmed, the fixing of the percentage at 8.7 per cent, may result in some hardship. For instance, if milk containing 3 per cent, of milk fat and 8.5 per cent, of milk solids other than milk fat is imperfectly skimmed so that 1.5 per cent, of fat remains, the proportion of milk solids other than milk fat will rise only to 8.6 per cent., and it will therefore be necessary that the Local Authority 84 take this point into consideration before instituting legal proceedings on the presumption of adulteration, where the deficiency of milk solids other than milk fat is slight, and the skimmed milk contains a considerable proportion of milk fat. For the information of your Worshipful Committee, the new regulations are here reproduced:— The Sale of Milk Regulations, 1912. Dated June 29th, 1912. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, in exercise of the powers conferred on them by section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, do hereby make the following Regulations:— Skimmed or Separated Milk. 1. Where a sample of skimmed or separated milk (not being condensed milk) contains less than 8.7 per cent, of milk solids other than milk fat, it shall be presumed for the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1907, until the contrary is proved, that the milk is not genuine, by reason of either the addition thereto of water, or the abstraction therefrom of milk-solids other than milk fat. Revocation of Existing Regulation. 2. Regulation 3 of the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1901, is hereby revoked but not so as to affect the validity of any certificate of analysis given before the commencement of these Regulations, or any legal proceedings in respect of any sample to which any such certificate relates. Commencement. 3. These Regulations shall come into operation on the First day of September, One thousand nine hundred and twelve. Extent. 4. These Regulations shall extend to England and Wales. Short Title. 5. These Regulations may be cited as the Sale of Milk Regulations, 1912. In witness whereof the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries have hereunto set their Official Seal this twenty-ninth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and twelve. (l.s) T. H. Elliott, Secretary. It will be seen that these Regulations do not absolutely fix a standard of genuineness, but merely transfer the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defence. So far as the City is concerned, the revised Regulations are of little or no moment, as from inquiries I have made at the premises where milk is sold, and also at the Bakehouses, Kitchens, and places where food is prepared, I am unable to find that in any of these is skimmed or separated milk used. Enquiries will, however, be periodically instituted, and should these lead to the discovery of the use or sale of skimmed or separated milk, the matter can then be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the new Order. 85 THE PUBLIC HEALTH (MILK AND CREAM) REGULATIONS, 1912. Representations have from time to time been made to the Local Government Board calling attention to the objections, from a health point of view, to the addition of preservatives and other foreign substances to milk and cream, and your Medical Officer has frequently urged the necessity for Regulations dealing with this subject. The Board are empowered by the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, to make regulations authorising measures to be taken for the prevention of danger arising to the public health from the importation, preparation, storage and distribution of articles of food or drink (other than drugs or water) intended for sale for human consumption, and in accordance with these powers have now issued "The Public Health (Milk and Cream) Regulations, 1912," These Regulations are designed to secure that no preservatives of any nature should be added to milk or to cream containing less than 35 per cent, by weight of milk fat at any stage from the place of production to that of delivery to the purchaser. Thus the addition of preservatives of any kind to milk is now an offence against the law, and any person infringing such law renders himself liable to a-penalty. In the case of cream containing over 35 per cent, of milk fat, the addition of boric acid, borax or a mixture of these preservative substances, or of hydrogen peroxide is permitted by the Regulations, subject only to a declaration required to be given by all persons dealing with such preserved cream for the purpose of sale for human consumption. It will be seen that the adoption of this system differentiates at all stages preserved cream as an article of commerce from cream to which no preservative has been added. Further, the addition of any thickening substance to cream or preserved cream is now prohibited. In the main, the Regulations, a copy of which is appended to this Report, are similar to the draft Regulations submitted to your Committee in March last, the principal alterations relating to— (1) The reduction from 40 per cent, to 35 per cent, of milk fat that must be present if preservatives be added; and (2) The removal of the limit of 0.1 per cent, of hydrogen peroxide, thus permitting addition of this substance as a preservative medium so long as a declaration is made in accordance with the form set out in the Schedule. The Regulations consist of four parts and a schedule. Part I. is confined to interpretations and definitions. Part II. forbids the addition of any preservative substance to milk intended for sale for human consumption, or the sale of any milk preserved in contravention of these Regulations. (2) The addition of any thickening substance to cream or preserved cream. 86 (3) The addition of any preservative substance to cream containing less than 35 per cent, by weight of milk fat. (4) The addition to cream, under any conditions, of any preservative substance whatever, other than (i.) boric acid, borax, or a mixture of these substances; or (ii.) hydrogen peroxide. Provision is made in this part of the Regulations for a declaration by the seller of preserved cream. Such declaration to be in the form of a label of a schedule size, attached to the package or receptacle, and inscribed with the words "Preserved Cream containing boric acid not exceeding per cent." or "Preserved Cream (peroxide)," as the case may be. In shops, restaurants, &c., where preserved cream is used, a notice must be exhibited or a statement to the effect made on every bill of fare, or other adequate means taken to direct attention of customers to the fact that preserved cream is used. Article IV. of this part of the Regulations constitutes an innovation. It is provided that before the Local Authority institute proceedings against any person contravening any of the Regulations of this part of the order, the Local Authority should afford him an opportunity of furnishing any explanation, and shall duly consider such explanation and all the circumstances of the case. It will be seen, therefore, that the Local Authority is empowered to act in a quasi-judicial capacity before instituting proceedings. Part III. enacts that similar prohibitions shall be extended to imported milk and cream, and imposes the duties of enforcing this part of the Regulations upon His Majesty's Customs and Excise, Part IV. deals with the determination of differences, and provides that the Local Government Board, on the application of all the parties concerned, may act as Arbitrator, The Schedule is confined to the size and wording of the declaratory labels. Although, presumably, the Public Analyst has to examine the samples, no directions are given as to the form which his Certificate is to take. This, however, may be regarded as an advantage, inasmuch as the raising of a technical point on its form by the defence is eliminated. There is, however, one serious omission from the Regulations. No provision is made for the Analyst's Certificate being considered as evidence. Presumably, therefore, it would be necessary in any prosecution to call the Analyst in person before the Bench to prove his analysis. It is important that this error should be rectified, and acting upon my recommendation the Corporation have made a representation to the Local Government Board urging the necessity for embodying a Clause similar to that in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, which reads as follows:— "At the hearing of the information in such proceedings the production of "the Certificate of the Analyst shall be sufficient evidence of the facts therein "stated, unless the defendant shall require that the Analyst shall be called as "a witness." 87 With this reservation I do not anticipate any difficulty in carrying out the Regulations, as existing arrangements for the collection of and examination of milk samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts can readily be extended. Since the Regulations became operative 6 samples have been taken in accordance with its provisions, and a summary of the results obtained will be found on pages 94-95. As these Regulations affected a large number of traders in the City of London, a notice (see Appendix J) drawing their attention to its provisions was delivered to all dairymen and others dealing in milk or cream within the City precincts. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. During the year 1,234 articles of food were analysed by the Public Analyst under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899, this number being made up as follows:— 109 samples were purchased and dealt with without the formalities of the Act being observed, and 1,125 were taken with the usual procedure. Of the informal samples 6 were found to be deficient, and subequent samples were obtained of the same vendors. Of the samples purchased formally, 31 were found to be sophisticated, a percentage of 2.7 per cent. A summary of the Quarterly Reports of all samples examined by the Public Analyst, showing both those taken in accordance with the Act and those taken otherwise, and the percentage of adulteration of each individual article, is given on pages 94 and 95. In ten years the percentage of adulteration has steadily decreased, last year, with a percentage of 2.5, being the lowest on record for the City of London; this year a slight rise will be noticed, 3.0 per cent, being the figure for 1912. The percentage of adulteration of samples taken in England and Wales in 1877 was 16.2; this percentage has been continuously reduced, and at present (that is to say the latest figures obtainable) the percentage in 1911 stands at 8.7. The accompanying Table has been partly compiled from the Annual Reports of the Local Government Board, to which are added some figures for the City of London, and London as a whole:— Year.

The slight increase in milk adulteration during 1912 (as compared with 1911) is shown by the following Table:— Year. No. of Samples Examined. Found Genuine. Found Adulterated. Percentage of Adulterated Samples. 1901 392 209 83 21.2 1902 599 519 80 13.3 1903 517 457 60 11.6 1904 452 417 35 7.7 1905 481 445 36 7.5 1906 556 513 43 7.7 1907 472 432 40 8.4 1908 469 440 29 6.2 1909 520 495 25 4.8 1910 474 454 20 4.2 1911 453 438 15 3.3 1912 481 462 19 3.9 The extent of sophistication was, in percentage of added water, from 5 to 39 per cent., abstracted fat from 6 to 17 per cent. ; in one instance a sample was found to contain 12 per cent, of extraneous water in addition to being 3 per cent, deficient in fat. The highest percentage of added water detected in milk during the year was 39 per cent., and was found to be present in a sample supplied by a person keeping a small light refreshment shop: a glass of milk was asked for and served by an assistant, the proprietress not being present at the time; a summons was issued and the defendant satisfied the magistrate that although legally liable, she had no guilty knowledge of the act performed by her servant. A mitigated fine of 2s. 6d. and 17s. 6d. expenses was imposed: it was suggested that the assistant drank the milk and made up the deficiency with water. The highest fines inflicted during the year were two of 25/, and 1/. 1s. costs, one of which was imposed upon a foreign milk seller for supplying a pennyworth of milk which was found to be deficient in fat to the extent of 10 per cent. This defendant had already been fined on four previous occasions, the last conviction being followed by a penalty of 20/, and costs. The other being a coffee house keeper who was substituting margarine on bread when bread and butter was asked for, the details will be found under "Butter." In no instance during the year has the presence of any preservative been found in any sample of milk purchased for analysis, which would seem to indicate that this objectionable tampering with milk is not practised by the dealers who are responsible for the City's milk supply. With the exception of two instances which occurred in 1911, no boric acid or other preservatives have been detected by the Public Analyst in the City milk supply for many years. In the cases referred to in one instance 30 grains per gallon was detected in a sample purchased from a man selling in the street, and in the other the smallness of the sample submitted prevented the amount of boric acid in the sample being determined. 89 The following Table shows the relation between place of purchase and adulteration:— Where Purchased. No. of Samples taken. No. Adulterated. Percentage of Samples Adulterated. 1911. 1912. 1911. 1912. 1911. 1912.

Of the five other samples, two were sophisticated, and were both obtained from wholesale milkmen in the act of delivery to the retailers, both of whom had been found to be selling impure milk. The wholesale dealers in each instance were summoned to appear before the Justices: one escaped heavy penalties by reason of his having provided himself with a warranty given to him by the farmer who supplied him with milk. This warranty he failed to establish, but meanwhile he had solicited the assistance of the Borough of Bermondsey, in which district the place to which the milk was consigned was situate—viz.: London Bridge Station. The Bermondsey Borough Council caused a sample of milk to be taken at this station, which was found on analysis to be adulterated with added water. The magistrate subsequently took a lenient view of the case and only imposed the nominal fine of 1s. and 2/. 28. costs. At a later date, the Bermondsey authorities prosecuted this farmer for the offence above mentioned, but the character of the farmer being good, and the past record of the milk dealer being notoriously bad, and the fact being also proved that the milk dealer was at the station before the sample was obtained by the Inspector and had access to the milk prior to the sample being taken, the case against the farmer was dismissed. In the case of the other defaulter, the magistrate imposed a fine of 20s. and 21s. expenses. BUTTER. 563 samples of butter were taken, of which 12, or 2.1 per cent., were certified as being adulterated. The figures for 1912 and ten previous years are given hereunder:— Year. No. of samples taken. No. of samples found Genuine. No. of Samples found Adulterated.

Altogether 250" bread and butter" samples have been purchased, out of which 9 (or 3.6 per cent.) were found wanting; 3 of this number were taken informally, with the view of establishing the fact that the substitution was habitual—the official sample subsequently taken in this case was also found to be sophisticated—and the vendor was fined £5 and 17s. 6d. expenses. The other fines obtained for butter adulteration were one of £25 and £l 1s. expenses (a second offence), another of 10s. and 20s. expenses, and another of 20s. and 17s. 6d. expenses. In another case the defendant pleaded that his wife, who was usually in charge of the shop, was ill at the time the sample was purchased, and that the act was performed by a servant contrary to instructions; the summons was dismissed. In the other instance the vendor was cautioned by the City Solicitor. In the one case of the adulterated sample being purchased at a general shop, a pennyworth of butter was asked for. The analysis of this substance showed it to be composed of margarine 60 per cent, and butter 40 per cent. The defendant closed his shop and vacated the premises before the summons was heard, but appeared before the Bench; a nominal penalty of 1s. was inflicted. In the two cases of sophistication occurring where a roll and butter was asked for the vendors of the samples were fined 20s. and 17s. 6d. expenses and 10s. and 17s. 6d. expenses respectively. The percentages of margarine present in the samples varied from 60 to 100 per cent. The following Table shows the figures of adulteration of butter samples when bread and butter has been demanded:— Date. Samples taken. Cases of Substitution. Percentage Substituted Samples. 1903 71 19 26.7 1904 101 12 11.8 1905 16 Nil. Nil. 1906 87 12 13.8 1907 184 8 4.3 1908 112 1 0.9 1909 115 1 0.9 1910 110 5 4.5 1911 144 6 4.1 1912 250 9 3.6 COFFEE. Out of 25 samples of coffee submitted, one only was found to be adulterated—this with 47 per cent, of chicory. Being a first offence a caution was administered to the vendor, who was later convicted of selling diluted vinegar, particulars of which are shown under Vinegar. 91 MUSTARD. 17 samples of mustard were examined, one proving to be sophisticated, the percentage of adulteration being 24 per cent, of starch and 0.5 per cent, added turmeric. The vendor of this sample was fined 40s. and 18s. 6d. expenses. COCOA. 23 samples of cocoa were obtained, and all returned genuine. DRUGS. 46 samples of drugs were purchased for analysis, and all returned genuine. The following Table includes particulars of drug adulteration in the City during the past ten years:— Samples taken.

One of the informal samples was found to be adulterated with arachis oil. A subsequent sample being taken with the prescribed formalities, the formal sample was found to be adulterated with 50 per cent, of arachis oil. A summons was issued, but the defendant was acquitted by reason of his being able to prove a warranty. The time limit having expired at the hearing of the summons, it was not found to be possible to institute proceedings against the giver of the warranty, which was regrettable. VINEGAR. 15 samples of Vinegar were obtained, 2 of which were diluted below Standard. One was found to be deficient in acetic acid 37 per cent., the other 30 per cent, deficient in acetic acid. In the first case the vendor was fined 20s. and 18s. 6d. expenses, and in the other, the defendant said he sold the Vinegar exactly as he received it from the sundry man and only disposed of a very small quantity. The case against him was dismissed. 92 The other samples submitted were 6 of cream (examined for preservatives), 1 of condensed milk, 5 of cheese, 3 of golden syrup, 11 of lard, 10 of pepper, and 3 of arrowroot. These articles were all favourably reported on. WARRANTY. During the year the "Warranty defence" was successfully pleaded in 3 instances, and the defendants escaped without penalty. PROSECUTIONS. 26 prosecutions were instituted, which are summarised as follows:—19 defendants were convicted and fined, 3 defendants proved warranty, 3 summonses were dismissed, and 1 summons was withdrawn on payment of expenses, 17s. 6d. 93 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875-1907. 1912.

In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognizance of the appointment, 44 persons were so examined during 1912, all of whom were reported by me as physically fit for office. Nineteen officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement, and of these 18, or 94 per cent., were reported to be unfit for duty. In addition to the foregoing, medical examinations were made of persons accepted bv the Central (Unemployed) Body, on the recommendation of the City of London Distress Committee, for employment on the Labour Colony at Hollesley Bay, established by the Central Body under the Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, public Department, Guildhall, E.C. Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. APPENDICES.

ADVICE TO MOTHERS.—Keep yourself in good health. The health of your baby depends upon your own during pregnancy. Take good and wholesome food at regular meals only. Do not take spirits, beer, stout or much tea, but rather milk or cocoa. See that your bowels act every day. When possible take exercise in the open air every day, and keep your window open night and day. 1. Feed your Baby regularly, by the Clock, and not by guesswork or whenever it cries. Babies get indigestion, feel uncomfortable, and cry if they are not fed at regular times. 2. Never give your Baby a Dummy Teat.—It is simply a bad habit, and dirty and dangerous. 3. As babies sometimes cry because they are thirsty, sips of warm water may be given. BREAST FEEDING.—MOTHER'S MILK IS THE BEST, CHEAPEST AND SAFEST FOOD FOR INFANTS. 1. Get your baby into good and regular habits of feeding. Babies form bad habits just as easily as grown-up people. 2. Keep the child at the breast about a quarter of an hour at each feed. 3. Do not feed more often than every two hours during the day, and once between 11 at night and 6 in the morning. Never let the baby feed too fast. Wake the baby if asleep at feeding times. The time between feeds should be gradually increased until, by the beginning of the third month, the breast is given every three hours, and at the age of six months five times in the day and not at all between 11 at night and 6 in the morning. The best times are 6 a.m., 10 a.m., 2 p.m., 6 p.m. and at 10 p.m. In this way the mother gets a rest at night, and so does the baby's stomach. WEANING.—Keep the baby on the breast entirely for nine months, if possible. Never wean during July, August or September, if you can help it. Wean slowly, giving first one feed of cow's milk a dav and then gradually increasing the number. Crusts of bread with butter or dripping and a lightly boiled egg may now be added. FROM ONE YEAR UPWARDS.—Do not give butcher-meat before the age of 18 months. Children must have no tea or stimulants, and such articles as pork, shell-fish, "fried fish," lobsters, baked pastry, new bread and hot cakes, are liable to cause convulsions, and must be carefully avoided. They should have three or four meals a day, and no food or sweets should be taken between meals. Beer and spirits are poison to a child and must never be given. If you think the baby is not thriving on the breast, do not give up breast feeding before the age of nine months without asking a doctor. RULES FOR DAILY USE.—Let the baby sleep in its own cot, and lie in it during the day. A banana crate, box, basket or drawer serves equally well, if the child cries, see if the napkin wants changing, or if the baby is cold and not properly covered up. Never rock the baby. Wake the baby up at the proper time for feeding. CLOTHING.—Give the baby a warm woollen vest with long sleeves, a soft knitted or flannel binder, a long flannel night-dress and an outer dress. Do not use a tight or stiff binder. Never use flannelette. "Shorten" at two to three months old. Keep to the vest and one flannel petticoat and dress, but now put on warm stockings instead of socks. Bath the baby once a day, and wash it once a day as well, using very little soap. Dry thoroughly, especially in ears and all folds of skin. Undress and dress the baby quickly, so that it does not catch cold. Babies must always be kept warm. The windows of the bedroom and living room, except at bath time, should always be kept open at the top, as wide as the weather will allow. The baby should be kept out of doors in the daytime as much as possible, and may sleep out of doors in mild weather in a sheltered place. DO NOT GIVE SOOTHING SYRUPS, TEETHING POWDERS OR PURGES WITHOUT THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS. Babies should be weighed regularly. If the baby cries often, does not increase in weight, does not sleep, is frequently sick, is constipated, has diarrhœa, snuffles, has cold feet, has a discharge from the eyes, or has a rash on the body or under the napkins, it is not well, and should be seen by a doctor. 115 BOTTLE-FED INFANTS. Note. These directions are not intended to apply to those babies who are ordered a special diet by a doctor. ADVICE TO MOTHERS. —Keep yourself in good health. The health of your baby depends upon your own during pregnancy. Take good and wholesome food at regular meals only. Do not take spirits, beer, stout, or much tea, but rather milk or cocoa. See that your bowels act every day. When possible take exercise in the open air every day, and keep your window open night and day. 1. Feed your Baby regularly, by the Clock, and not by guesswork or whenever it cries. Babies get indigestion, feel uncomfortable, and cry if they are not fed at regular times. 2. Never give your Baby a Dummy Teat. It is simply a bad habit, and dirty and dangerous. 3. As babies sometimes cry because they are thirsty, sips of warm water may be given. BOTTLE FEEDING.— Give only milk until the baby is about nine months old. Do not give condensed milk or any other infant food unless ordered by the doctor. Never give Separated or Skimmed Milk to a Baby. Milk.—Get good fresh milk twice a day. Boil it at once, pour it into a clean jug, cover with a clean cloth, and stand the jug in cold water. In hot weather the water should be changed often so as to be as cool and fresh from the tap as possible. Bottle.—Bottles with long tubes should never be used. Wash the bottle and teat thoroughly in hot water after each feed, and keep them in clean cold water until the next feed. When washing the teat, turn it inside out and hold it under the tap. Feeding.—Measure the milk carefully. Give the same amount at each feed, not more one time than another. If the child does not finish the feed, what is left should not be given again to the baby. Give the milk warm. From ¼ to ½ teaspoonful of fresh cream should be added to each feed, and the same amount of white sugar. About ½ teaspoonful of olive or cod liver oil should be given twice a day if no cream is put into the bottle. FROM BIRTH TO THREE WEEKS OLD.— Never feed more often than every two hours in the daytime, and once between 11 at night and 6 in the morning. At first the baby does not want more than one tablespoonful of milk and two tablespoonsful of water. By the time it is three weeks old it may be having 1 to 1½ tablespoonsful of milk and 2 of water. FROM THREE WEEKS TO THREE MONTHS OLD.—Gradually increase the quantity at each feed up to 3 to 4 tablespoonsful of milk and 3 of water, and the times between feeds to every 3 hours by day and once between 11 at night and 6 in the morning. FROM THREE TO SIX MONTHS OLD.—By the time the baby is six months old it should take 6 to 7 tablespoonsful of milk and 2 of water at each feed. Do not feed more often than every four hours, and not at all at night. FROM SIX TO NINE MONTHS OLD — Gradually decrease the water until the baby is taking 8 to 10 tablespoonsful of milk and no water at each feed. A little orange juice or stewed apple may now be given. FROM NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS OLD— Continue to give milk, but crusts of bread with butter or dripping, and a lightly boiled egg may be added. FROM ONE YEAR UPWARDS.—Do not give butcher-meat before the age of 18 months. Children must have no tea or stimulants, and such articles as pork, shellfish, " fried fish," lobsters, baked pastry, new bread and hot cakes, are liable to cause convulsions. and must be carefully avoided. They should have three or four meals a day, and no food or sweets should be taken between meals. Beer or spirits are poison to a child and must never be given. RULES FOR DAILY USE.— Let the baby sleep in its own cot and lie in it during the day. A banana crate, box, basket, or drawer serves equally well. If the child cries, see if the napkin wants changing, or if the baby is cold and not properly covered up. Never rock the baby. Wake the baby up at the proper time for feeding.

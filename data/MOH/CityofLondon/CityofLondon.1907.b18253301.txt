Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., 24th March, 1908. Gentlemen, In conformity with the requirements of the Local Government Board, I have the honour to present my eighth Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. In reviewing the work of sanitary administration during 1907 and previous years, it has been interesting to note the gradual evolution of the attitude of the citizens towards progressive hygiene. The public have by slow degrees learnt to recognise the value of practical sanitary science, and this growing knowledge has tended to increase the responsibility attaching to those whose duty it is to carry out the obligations imposed by the ever-increasing statutory requirements which come into being, pari passu, with the spread of education. Ministers of State and the Heads of Government Departments responsible for the health and well-being of the community are at the present time taking an active interest in all that relates to the subject, and many local authorities are finding that if the work is to be performed efficiently, their staffs of officials are inadequate to cope with the fresh duties cast upon them. The various sections of this report dealing with the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, the Factory and Workshop Acts, the steps taken for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, the control of food, supplies, &c., illustrate the wide range of subjects included in State hygiene. Year by year some fresh matter for special supervision is added to the list, the two latest being in the direction of the reduction of infantile mortality, and the medical inspection of school children. As an illustration of the change that has taken place in public opinion with regard to personal hygiene, it may be mentioned that last year a Bill 10 was introduced in the Commons for, inter alia, granting statutory powers (in certain circumstances) for the forcible detention and compulsory personal cleansing of individuals, without other warrant than the Act. Not only was such a measure promoted, but it became law, and is now on the Statute Book.* Only a few years ago the idea of advocating legislation of this character, which certainly interferes with the liberty of the subject, would have been deemed preposterous. It is evident, therefore, that the crusade against filth and disease is by no means complete, and even now the Local Government Board are engaged in framing regulations for a wider control of food stuffs under the powers conferred upon them last year by the Public Health (Regulation as to Food) Act. These will probably be of a far-reaching character, and further enlarge the duties and responsibilities of health authorities. The day is probably not far distant when the legislature will see the advisability, in the interest of the honest trader and of the public, of passing a " Pure Food Law" such as now obtains in the United States. Under this measure, manufacturers of drugs, tinned and potted foods, &c., are obliged to affix labels telling the exact truth about their contents. Thus one American, firm it is stated, now labels its "Best Strawberry Jam" as containing:—"Apple Juice 45 per cent., Corn Syrup 48 per cent., Granulated Sugar 6 per cent, and Colouring Matter and Flavour 1 per cent." The purchaser of this compound will have no difficulty in noting that it contains no strawberry at all. Another important provision is that when a preservative has been added, the nature and amount must be declared. The public have a right to know what they are eating. The maxim "caveat emptor" may be good from a lawyer's standpoint, but the sanitarian looks upon it from a different point of view, and the sooner the public in this country are protected from the iniquities of the unscrupulous trader, the better it will be. In earlier days the time of a sanitary inspector was chiefly occupied in looking after small property, clustered together in courts and alleys, in which the City at one time abounded. It is well known that this class of property is now practically non-existent in the City, and at first sight it might appear that, as a consequence, there would be less work for these officers. As a matter of fact, directly the contrary obtains. It is obvious that the defects that more generally require attention relate to sanitary conveniences. Now in the tenement class property that formerly existed, these places were generally placed in the yards, and frequently used in common. These were readily accessible to the Inspector, and it did not then take much time for him to examine the sanitary accommodation provided for * These powers are in operation in the Metropolis with regard to the cleansing of inmates of common lodging-houses and children attending public elementary schools. (2 Edw. 7 cap. clxxv., sec. 37). 11 a whole row of houses. The very large buildings containing offices that now, in most cases, occupy the sites of these old tenement houses, take up far more time in inspection than the premises they have displaced, because, as a rule, they have a separate block of sanitary conveniences on every floor, each of which has to be carefully examined at the request of a class of people far more exacting than that which occupied the old houses. It is true that many of these places are fitted with lifts, but nevertheless the work is laborious, entailing as it does, so much going up and down stairs. It frequently happens that an Inspector may have a dozen large buildings in hand at once where the entire system of drainage of each is being reconstructed, no portion of which is allowed to be covered up until he has inspected and tested it in sections. He has also to exercise a careful supervision in each case in order to secure that the works in progress are conducted strictly in accordance with the plans deposited at this office, from which no variations are allowed without the sanction of the Medical Officer of Health. A Sanitary Inspector in the City may be therefore almost considered to be acting as a Clerk of the Works on a large scale, but with greater responsibilities. His duties are such that it is not infrequent for his views to clash with those of property owners, contractors and architects, and it is clear that not only must he have an intimate knowledge of his profession—which can only be acquired by an extensive practical experience—but he must possess much tact and discrimination to ensure that the Corporation requirements are fulfilled in their entirety. It is highly satisfactory to record the fact that no complaints are ever received as to the manner in which these duties are performed in the City of London, and further, that it is a rare occurrence to be compelled to take proceedings for non-compliance with statutory notices. AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 672.7 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.051 square miles, equal to a square of 1.0252 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 10.81 miles to a side. DENSITY (1907). City of London, Registration District, at night 30.2 persons to an acre. „ „ „ „ during the day *56.5 „ „ Registration London, at night - 63.6 „ „ „ „ during the day not known. No Imperial Day Census has yet been taken. * This figure refers only to persons "actively engaged in the City during the daytime." The actual number of people visiting the City daily is probably nearly 1,500,000. 12 ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London was £43,897,571 on 6th April, 1907—whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London, including Temples, was £5,373,276, or nearly one-eighth of the whole County. POPULATION. The undermentioned figures are abstracted from the Registrar-General's Report, dated 30th December, 1901, on the Census of England and Wales, 1901 (County of London). TABLE A. Area. Statute Acres. Inhabited Houses. Population. 1891. 1901. 1891. 1901. City of London 672.7 5,340 3,865 37,702 26,923 For Registration, Parliamentary and Municipal purposes the boundaries of the City are co-terminous. These figures represent the population on the night of the 1st April, 1891 and 1901, exclusive of sub-district of Glasshouse Yard (see note on next page). A Day Census—the number of persons actively engaged in the City during the daytime—has been taken on three occasions, viz., in 1866, 1881, and 1891. It is a matter for regret that no Day enumeration was made in the City during the last Imperial Census year. TABLE B. CENSUS RETURNS. Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census.

This consists of two sub-districts, together containing a population of at the middle of 1907, calculated on the last Census Returns:— *St. Botolph 6,700 †St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 13,610 Total 20,310 The Night population, therefore, of the City of London Registration District at the middle of 1907 is taken at 20,310, and it is upon this figure that all vital statistics in this Report have been calculated. The Day population at the middle of 1907 was estimated at 380,150 ‡ persons. A Day Census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. In 1903 it was ascertained that in the week ending 19th July no less than 347,463 vehicles passed to and from the four City bridges, viz.:—London, Southwark, Blackfriars and Tower, equivalent to upwards of 18,000000 vehicles per annum. BIRTHS. During the year 1907, 268 births were registered in the City. The annual birth rate was at the rate of 13.1 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 14.1 per 1,000. The birth rates last year in the Sub-Districts were— St. Botolph 18.8 per 1,000. St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 10.4 „ In the Metropolis the birth rate in 1907 was 25.6 per 1,000, being the lowest hitherto recorded therein. This decline in the birth rate has been in operation in this country since 1876, and is common to nearly all European countries. * At the date of the last Census, this District included the "civil parish" of Glasshouse Yard. The parish was transferred to the Holborn Union by the Local Government Board Order, No. 43156, which came into operation on 29th September, 1901, and to the Registration District of Holborn (Finsbury Sub-District) on 1st January, 1902, making the Registration District of London City co-extensive with the Municipal City of London. All the Registration Districts in London are co-extensive with the Poor-Law Parishes or Unions except the District of Fulham. † On the 1st April, 1901. the Middle Temple was transferred from the Strand Sub-District to St. Sepulchre Sub-District. ‡ This figure is based upon the assumption that the number of persons residing, occupied or employed within the City during the active hours of the day has increased at the same rate since the last Day Census in 1891 that it did between that and the previous Day Census in 1881. 14 VACCINATION. Of the children born in 1907, 168 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 31 had died before the age for vaccination, and 3 were insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 13 cases, 34 had removed into other districts, and 13 vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 7 cases of conscientious objection. The Public Vaccinators performed 1,385 re-vaccinations during the year. Vaccination Statistics in the City of London. Year. Number of Births.

This measure received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907, and came into operation on the 1st January following. It was introduced in the Commons by the President of the Local Government Board as a Government Bill. Its object is to relieve the "Conscientious Objector" of the necessity of in person satisfying a magistrate that he conscientiously believes that vaccination would be prejudicial to the health of the child before he can obtain an exemption certificate. By this Act the anti-vaccinationist can secure exemption from the operations of the Vaccination Act by making a Statutory declaration before a Commissioner for Oaths or Justice of the Peace, or other Officer authorised to receive a Statutory declaration that he has conscientious objection, and it remains to be seen whether this Act will cause any increase in the numbers of those obtaining exemption. The form of declaration required by the Act is as under :— SCHEDULE. Form of Declaration. I, A. B., of in the parish of in the County of being the parent (or person having 15 the custody) of a child named C. D., who was born on the day of ,19 , do hereby solemnly and sincerely declare that I conscientiously believe that vaccination would be prejudicial to the health of the child, and I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of the Statutory Declaration Act, 1853. Dated this day of , 19 Signed A. B. Declared before me, at on the day of E. F. A Commissioner for Oaths (or Justice of the Peace, or other Officer authorised to receive a Statutory declaration). On the 21st September last, the President of the Local Government Board issued a Vaccination Order to Boards of Guardians of every Poor Law Union in England and Wales, requiring Registrars of Births to give printed notice to parents of all children born after the 31st day of August, 1907, acquainting them of the new means of obtaining exemption, and to furnish them with a copy of the required form of declaration. Common sense is wholly opposed to any relaxation of the law requiring that all persons should be protected by vaccination, and the passing of this Act is a retrograde step, much to be deplored and at variance with the teaching of science. It would have been far better for the legislation to have made a forward movement and carried a Bill making re-vaccination compulsory, as obtains in Germany. MORTALITY. During the year under review, 853 deaths were registered in the District, including *692 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table, p. 20, for details. Deducting the latter 161 deaths remain, to which must be added 97 persons who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered. The mortality, therefore, from which the City death rate is calculated is 258. The death rate for 1907 was 12.7 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 13.0), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 14.6. These figures are not corrected for sex and age distribution. These deaths occurred in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. 16 Death Rates, per 1,000 per Annum. Year.

The death rate from zymotic disease per 1,000 of the population was 0.44 compared with 1.41 in the Metropolis. Infantile Mortality. The deaths of children under one year of age to 1,000 births were 89, against 116 for the whole of London. The Table of infantile mortality on p. 17 shows the deaths of children under one year arranged according to monthly age periods. From this it will be seen that no less than 29 per cent. of these deaths occurred in the first month, 58 per cent. within the first three months, and 79 per cent. during the first six months of existence. Deaths in City Institutions. During 1907, 97 persons died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries, or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 37.6 per cent, of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis (1906) being 22.3 per cent.

In the following Tables will be found particulars of infectious disease notified under Sections 55 and 56 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and information as to the removal of patients to hospitals, infirmaries, &c.:— NATURE OF DISEASE.

It will be seen from the above that during the year, excluding Chicken-pox and Phthisis, 170 Certificates were received, including 20 "duplicates," and 10 in which the diagnosis was subsequently found to be incorrect. The total number of cases of "dangerous infectious disease" was therefore 140, as compared with 149 for the previous year. TABLE C.

In each case a detailed examination was made of the sanitary condition of the premises where infectious cases occurred, and a summary of defects found by the District Inspector is given on page 67. i SHELTER FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION DURING DISINFECTION. The Shelter in Golden Lane, Barbican, provided in accordance with Sec. 60 (4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which enacts that "sanitary "authorities shall provide free of charge temporary shelter or house "accommodation with necessary attendants for the members of any family 23 "in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, for the purpose of "enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the sanitary authority," has been visited by eight families during the year. They numbered 22 persons, of whom 16 were adults and 6 were children, and who were housed during the disinfection of their houses after:— Scarlet Fever Diphtheria Enteric Fever Chicken-pox 1 family. 4 families. 2 „ 1 family. 8 families. One family came from a home consisting of four rooms, five of three rooms, one of two rooms, and one of one room. 24 CONTAMINATED MILK. In investigating an outbreak of Enteric Fever at some premises in the City in April, 1907, it was found advisable to examine the milk supply. . ^ The establishment, which was a large one, was served with milk from three separate sources, and samples were therefore taken from each and submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported on them as under:— "Re Samples of Milk Nos. 1, 2 and 3, received on April 18th. "22nd April, 1907. "The analyses were made by taking the whole of the sediment of each sample "and inoculating with it the surface of two large Drigalski plates for each sample. "Although abundance of colonies of B. coli and of streptococci developed in these plates, there were no colonies that resembled either those of B. typhosus or "of B. Gaertner. "(Signed) E. KLEIN." Although these samples showed the absence of the specific germ of Enteric Fever, they indicated sewage pollution, and the dairymen were therefore asked to furnish the names of the farms supplying them. This information was at once given in two cases, but in the third the Dairy Company stated that it was not possible to do so after the lapse of time. A further sample was therefore taken, a duplicate being handed to the Company's representative at the time. Dr. Klein's report on this sample was as follows:— " Re Sample No. 4 of Milk received May 23rd. "30th May, 1907. "With the sediment of 300 c.c. made cultures for the detection of B. typhosus. "(a) Drigalski plates. " (b) Loffler's Malachite green Agar plates. "In both these sets colonies appeared, which by their colour and appearance "bore a resemblance to B. typhosus. "From the Malachite green Agar plate a number of promising colonies were "subcultured. "Some of these gave striking agglutination with typhoid serum in dilation of "1.50, but the character of the subcultures clearly proved that none of them are "B. typhosus; their behaviour in shake gelatine (gas bubbles), in Neutral red broth "(greenish fluorescent), in Lactose litmus peptone (red and gas), in Drigalski plate "(red colonies)—clearly showed that we were dealing with some coli-like microbes. "The result, then, is—that from the sediment of 300 c.c. of the above milk no "B. typhosus was isolated. "(Signed) E. KLEIN." 25 This also proving unsatisfactory, all the Dealers were asked to produce:— 1. A Report from a Veterinary Surgeon as to the health of the cows. 2. A Report from the Medical Officer of Health of the District as to the sanitary condition of the premises. These particulars were obtained in each instance. Summarised they were as under:— No. 1. (Stafford). Premises.—"In fair condition, some small repairs are required to "ceiling and wall. Water is being analysed." Cows.—"Of 19, 17 are in sound health, one has lung disease "permanent following pneumonia, possibly Tubercular, and another "emaciated udder doubtful thickened." In both cases sale is recommended, but no mention is made as to the necessity for taking precautions to prevent the animals being used for milk or food elsewhere. No. 2. (Suffolk). Cows.—"17 cows in healthy condition." Premises.—"Sanitary condition defective." No. 3. (Suffolk). Premises.—"The cows as a rule are not attended to before being —"milked, which is done in a portion of a large covered building, the "cows standing on dry straw, and earth underneath which prevents "any washing down. The building to which the milk is taken for "cooling is very small, and somewhat dilapidated. The water is "of good quality." Cows.—"There are 25 cows, and of this number 23 are in "apparently sound, healthy and good condition, the other two have "indurated udders." With reference to the samples from Suffolk it was ascertained that the Local Authority had not made any Regulations under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885. In each case the diseased cows were removed and the sanitary defects remedied. These facts furnish an illustration of the laxity that prevails amongst farmers and milk dealers with regard to their responsibilities to the public in securing the purity of such an important article of food as milk. Nor are either these parties likely to take any steps in the right direction unless they 26 are compelled to do so. Unfortunately, in the present state of the law there are great difficulties placed in the way, not the least of these being the apathy of Local Authorities with respect to carrying out their obligations under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885. With regard to these, a Return presented to the House of Commons on 13th May, 1907, shows— (a) The names of the Councils of Boroughs and Urban and Rural Districts who have made Regulations under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order of 1885, and (b) The number of Councils of each class who have not made such Regulations. From this Return we learn that while "The Corporation of the City of "London have made Regulations,* in the rest of the Metropolis Regulations "are in force which were made by the Metropolitan Board of Works."† The number of Authorities outside the Metropolis that have made, and have not made such Regulations are as under:— No. that have made Regulations. No. that have not made Regulations. Total. Councils of Boroughs 290 36 326 Councils of Urban Districts other than Boroughs 684 126 810 Councils of Rural Districts 493 165 658 1,467 327 1,794 In the aggregate, 18.2 per cent. have not made Regulations. Taken separately the percentage of these are as follows:— Councils of Boroughs 11.0 per cent. Councils of Urban Districts other than Boroughs 15.5 „ Councils of Rural Districts 25.1 „ It will be seen that approximately in one-fourth of the Rural Districts the Councils have failed to take advantage of the opportunity the law affords of exercising proper control over the source of milk supply in the districts over which they are supposed to exercise sanitary control. The Parliamentary Return from which the above figures are taken is somewhat incomplete, as while it gives the names and numbers of those Authorities "regulating" Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops, it gives the numbers only of those that have failed to do so. * These were last revised in 1903. † The Metropolitan Board of Works were succeeded by the London County Council in 1889. 27 The making of such Regulations is one thing, but the strict enforcement of them when made is the essential point. The condition of many of the milks that arrive at City Railway termini indicates that there is much room for improvement in that direction. In dealing with this question two points are clear— Firstly.—The urgent need for general legislation with regard to the milk supply. This must deal with the question at the farm itself, and must be the duty of the Local Authority. No half-hearted measure giving the Metropolis, or any other district, power to exclude infected or dirty milk is of any real service. If milk from a particular source is excluded by order from one place, it will be sent to another, either to be consumed therein, or possibly to be again forwarded to the excluded area. Secondly.—The Local Authority where the farm is situated alone can effectively deal with the question. If there is a difficulty in getting them to act in some cases by reason of vested interests or other causes, there should be no difficulty in devising a system whereby the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries would act in case of default. The enormous cost of an Authority, such as the London County Council or the Corporation, sending its Medical Officer and Veterinary Surgeon all over the country should alone be sufficient to condemn the system. But there are still graver objections. An outside Authority would act at a great disadvantage, and would meet with much opposition in carrying out its investigations, while the fact that the work was being done by a Central Authority would undoubtedly tend to diminish the feeling of responsibility of the Local Authority, who would not unnaturally be loth to spend time, money and energy on doing work which, if left undone, would be taken up by others. Any steps taken should be in the direction of increasing the responsibility of Local Authorities, and of quickening them to a lively sense of the same. The case of default can easily be dealt with, without in any way imperilling the co-operation of these Authorities, who are ready and willing to do their duty. In view of the great importance of this question, I would suggest that the Government be urged forthwith to promote general legislation with regard to milk supply on the lines indicated in this and previous Reports. 28 The following extract from the "Times" newspaper of the 12th February last indicates the attitude of the Government towards the question of milk supply* :— House of Lords.—Tuesday, llth February, 1908. "MILK SUPPLY. "The Earl of Northbrook asked the President of the Board of Agriculture "whether it was the intention of the Government to introduce legislation with "regard to the inilk supply during the present Session ; and, in the event of such "legislation being introduced by the Local Government Board, what steps the "Board of Agriculture proposed to take for the purpose of safeguarding the "interests of agriculture. He said that the dairy farmers realized that legislation "was not only desirable, but was necessary to ensure the supply of pure and "wholesome milk to the consumers. They would welcome such legislation if it were "just and equitable, and were applied to the whole country. The present system of "controlling the milk supply was eminently unsatisfactory. It was based on orders "which were permissive, and legislation which had been piecemeal. Some local "authorities had made rules under the Dairies and Milkshops Orders of 1885-86 "which were carried out in a satisfactory manner ; others had made orders which "were carried out in a perfunctory way ; in a large number of cases rural and "urban sanitary authorities had not chosen to make any regulations at all, and in "their districts the milk supply was without any supervision whatever. The "London County Council had powers of dealing with the milk supply under "three Acts, and were endeavouring to get more in a General Powers Bill "this Session. In a considerable number of districts there were two, three, "or four authorities with overlapping jurisdiction, with the result that "unnecessary burdens were put upon the farmers. A general public Bill was, in "these circumstances, desirable in the interests of both producer and consumer. It "had been announced by the President of the Local Government Board that the "Government thought it desirable that there should be legislation during the present "Session. His question invited a more definite statement. In speeches both by "the President of the Board of Agriculture and by Sir E. Strachey, who spoke for "the Board in the other House, farmers had received warnings as to possible "legislation, which had produced some feeling of insecurity and alarm, which, he "hoped, would now be allayed. He acknowledged the scientific equipment of the "Local Government Board, but reminded the President of the Board of Agriculture "that the milk supply required to be dealt with from a practical as well as a ''theoretical point of view, and that any question concerned with cattle should be "dealt with by the competent advisers of the Board of Agriculture, in whom the "agriculturists had confidence. He hoped the President of the Board of Agriculture "would give consideration to the suggestion that before any legislation was "introduced an inquiry, Parliamentary or departmental, should be held into the " question of the milk supply of the country. "Earl Carrington said he was glad to be able to announce that he had received a "letter from his right hon. friend the President of the Local Government Board stating "that it was the intention of the Government to introduce legislation this Session in "respect to the milk supply of the country. He agreed that the milk industry was "not in the satisfactory condition which every one desired ; and as the great object "of the present Government was practical legislation he felt sure that in the * See foot note on page 74. 29 "forthcoming Bill the matter would be dealt with practically. With regard to the "second part of the noble earl's question, he could not make a definite announcement "until the proposals of the Government were a little more developed ; but he could "promise that he would do everything in his power legitimately to protect the "farmers in the proposed legislation consistently with the interests of the public "welfare. As to the suggested public enquiry, he would consult with the President "of the Local Government Board. He might add, as the matter was somewhat "connected with the present subject, that the news from Scotland was that no fresh "outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease had taken place, and that the disease was "being confined to a very limited area. "The Earl of Roskbery.—As regards that last point, has the noble Earl "received any representation from Linlithgow on the subject of the restrictions? "Earl Carrington.—I have. "The Earl of Roskbery. —Does my noble friend mean to pay any attention to " it? " Earl Cakrington.—I am afraid I must have notice of that question. "The Earl of Onslow did not think the reply of the President of the Board of "Agriculture carried the matter very far. The public were already aware that it "was the intention of the President of the Local Government Board to introduce a "Bill dealing with the question of the milk supply. He thought the Government might "be reminded that there was such a place as the House of Lords. That House was "not very busy just now; and there was no reason why the proposed Bill should "not be brought forward there, so that farmers might have an early opportunity of "expressing their opinions on it. "The Earl of Camperdown supported the suggestion that the Bill should be "first introduced in the House of Lords. At the present time there was no indication "that any business would be given them to do by the Government. "Lord Tweedmouth said he was not in a position to state whether the "Government were prepared at once to introduce the measure in that House. He "hoped, however, it would soon be introduced, whether in the Lords or in the "Commons. In the course of the next few weeks noble lords would have two "Scottish Bills to discuss. "The Earl of Rosebery.—After they have been discussed in the Commons." CARRIAGE OF MILK BY RAIL. In January, 1904, the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries issued a Leaflet containing correspondence, passed in 1899, between themselves, the Board of Trade, and the Railway Companies with regard to the conveyance of milk by rail in locked and sealed churns, which shows that all the principal railway 30 companies make no difference in their charges when sealed cans are used, which are stamped with their tare weight, and merely reserve the right to open locked cans when there is any reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the consignment. I have repeatedly pointed out the undesirability of consigning milk to London railway stations in unsealed vessels. The Board of Agriculture and Fisheries last year took further steps for preventing pilfering or contamination of milk in transit by issuing on the 27th February a circular letter to makers in Great Britain of churns for carriage of milk by rail. The Board point out that two of the principal dairy farmers' associations have for several years recommended their members to send their milk by rail in sealed churns, and that the railway companies do not object to carry milk in sealed churns, provided the tare weight is stamped on the outside of the churn. The Board suggest that the following points should be kept in view in connection with the construction of milk churns :— (1) The churn should have the tare weight stamped on the outside. (2) The lid of the churn should be constructed so as to facilitate sealing. (3) The churn should be constructed so as to prevent, as far as possible, the removal of milk from the churn while sealed. (4) The churn should be constructed so as to prevent water being added to the milk in the churn while sealed. (5) The churn should be constructed so as to prevent dust or dirt from being blown or washed into the churn when the lid is affixed. There is no difficulty in making churns that fulfil these conditions, and more than one firm has placed such on the market. It is unfortunate that the Board have no power to enforce their recommendations, and failing authority for this purpose it is doubtful whether much immediate improvement will be effected even with the co-operation of the various trade societies and associations throughout the country. At present only a small proportion of milk sent to the metropolis is conveyed in sealed churns, but it is to be hoped that the action taken by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries will induce manufacturers, when receiving orders for new churns, to advise the adoption of churns made in accordance with the recommendations of the Board. 31 SHELLFISH POLLUTION. In ray annual report for 1906 it was pointed out that Dr. Bulstrode's report to the Local Government Board in 189fi showed conclusively that at that date, in the greater part of the layings, shellfish were cultivated under conditions that render them specially liable to sewage pollution, and although since then some attempt has been made iD some places to modify the evil, much remains to be done. The Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal, dated 28th December, 1903, contains the following expression of opinion. "After carefully examining the whole of the evidence on this point (viz. : extent "of disease due to the consumption of contaminated shellfish) we are satisfied that "a considerable number of cases of enteric fever and other illness are caused by the "consumption of shellfish which have been exposed to sewage contamination. "There can, however, be no doubt that the evil is sufficiently grave to demand "a remedy." These observations indicate the gravity of the situation, and although they were made no less than four years ago, up to the present they do not seem to have made any more impression on the legislation than did Dr. Bulstrode's report seven years earlier. Meanwhile constant confirmation is received that the danger from eating contaminated shellfish is an ever present one, indeed, being far more real and in need of being dealt with from a public health point of view than many reforms receiving more attention from the public. As in former years requests were received to make investigations with regard to shellfish purchased in the City suspected of having caused illness. OYSTERS. In a case reported from Walthamstow, a resident in that district who was attacked with Enteric Fever—which terminated fatally—was taken ill soon after eating oysters purchased in the City. Samples of Oysters were purchased at the shop supplying them, and submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported upon them as follows:— " Re Sample of Oysters, received November 22nd. "Eight oysters were examined thus :—After thoroughly cleansing the outside, "the shell was opened, the liquor drained off, and the entire fish finely minced. "Eight fish yielded about 8-10 c.c. turbid thick fluid. This fluid was examined "for B. typhosus by means of large Drigalski plates—eight plates in all, each plate "receiving a little over one-tenth c.c. of the turbid thick fluid. "The result was this:—Amongst numerous colonies of B. coli communis, there "were present a considerable number of bluish colonies, some of these resembling in 32 "aspect and mode of growth colonies of B. typhosus. Examined under the micro"scope only four gave the primary tests for B. typhosus, viz.: being cylindrical "motile bacilli in size like those of B. typhosus. Analysed by sub-culture it was "found, however, that one was a liquifier, two others were B. fluorescens puttidus "(forming bluish pigment). The fourth failed to give any indication of clumping "with typhoid serum, and failed to grow in phenel-broth- "It is, therefore, clear that no B. typhosus was isolated from this sample "I think at the same time that the oysters were highly polluted, containing "abundance of B. col: communis, proteus vulgaris, and bacillus fluorescens "puttidus." A copy of this analysis was sent to the Fishmongers' Company and the salesman informed as to the condition of the oysters. In an interview with him some difficulty was found in ascertaining exactly the source from which they were derived, and further samples were taken and submitted to analysis with the following result :— " Re Samples of Oysters received November 28th. "These oysters were examined in exactly the same manner as the previous "sample, viz. :—By Drigalski plates. "The result of this examination showed the presence in all of the oysters of "abundance of B. coli communis. A large number of colonies simulating "B. typhosus were tested, and were found that none of them complied with the "character of B. typhosus. "Owing to the abundance of B. coli communis, I consider these oysters unclean." On the 3rd December, further samples were taken from so-called "Whitstable" and "Dutch" Oysters, the result of this analysis is as follows :— " Re Samples of Oysters, No. 3 and No. 4. "Received in the afternoon of December 3rd, by Inspector Hills, labelled :— "Sample No. 3—Whitstable. "Sample No. 4—Dutch. "The result of the bacterioscopic analysis of these samples is as follows :— "Whitstable Oysters No. 3. "On opening, two or three were found shrivelled up and discoloured, no liquor in "shell. "Of eight oysters, five contain abundance of B. coli communis. One further "oyster contains some other kind of B. coli. All of them contain the spores of B. "enteritidis sporogenes. A Drigalski plate made with one-fifth c.c. of shell-water "contains great crowds of microbic colonies, capable of growing at 37° C., amongst "them some colonies of Porteus vulgaris. "Dutch Oysters No. 4. "Of eight oysters, six have abundance of B. coli communis, one further oyster "has some kind of B. coli. Half of them have spores of B. enteritidis sporogenes. "A Drigalski plate made with one-fifth c.c. of shell-water contains very numerous "colonies, capable of growing at 37° C. 33 "When the same procedure of making Drigalski plates of clean oysters is used, "there appear on such a Drigalski plate kept at 37° C. either lio colonies at all, or "very few only, thus showing that a clean oyster and its shell-water are practically "free of microbes capable of growing at 37° C., whereas in the above two cases "there were contained in the shell-water crowds of such microbes, and this in "agreement with the results of the other analysis above stated, viz., that both "samples contain abundance of sewage or filth microbes, viz., B. coli communis and "spores of B. enteritidis sporogenes. "For these reasons, 1 consider both samples unclean and polluted with sewage "or filth. (Signed) "E. KLEIN." Another fatal case of Enteric, which the deceased's friends attributed to oysters eaten in the City, was reported from Exeter, but on examination by Dr. Klein of a sample purchased at the shop where they were bought showed these to be quite clean. Both the Fishmongers' Company and the Vendor of the contaminated oysters were acquainted with the results, and the latter at once gave an undertaking to discontinue the sale of all oysters except those derived from sources known to be free from pollution. In the course of this enquiry it was ascertained by the officers of the Fishmongers' Company that the oysters in question had come from some layings that were above suspicion, but had subsequently been stored in some sewage-polluted pits. The Company immediately took action, which resulted in the absolute closure of these pits by the owners. A case of considerable importance to the public was heard at the Lexden and Winstree Sessions on the 21st August last, when an oyster merchant of Wyvenhoe was summoned at the instance of the Wyvenhoe Urban District Council for selling oysters that were unfit for human food. The summons was taken out under Section 107 of the Public Health Act, 1875, and Section 28 of the Public Health Act, 1890. The oysters in question, which were Portuguese relaid, had been sold to an officer of the Fishmongers' Company, who submitted them to Dr. Klein for analysis, who reported on them as follows :— " Analysis of Oysters. "Of six Portuguese oysters—small six have abundance of B. coli communis. "Two specially examined—both have enteritidis spores. "Of six Portuguese oysters, large—all have abundance of B. coli communis. "Two specially examined—both have enteritidis spores. "Result—oysters distinctly sewage polluted, therefore unfit for food in their raw "E. KLEIN." 34 It was proved that defendant had been previously warned by the Fishmongers' Company that some o£ his pits were contaminated. The defendant was fined £20 and costs, including £5 for expenses of analysis. As an illustration of the character of the local surroundings I quote the following description from an article discussing the prosecution in the " Fish Trades Gazette" :— "The town of Wyvenhoe has a population of 2,700, and its sewers "empty themselves at various points on the foreshore from the ship"building yard on the West, to the gasworks on the East, creating "what is nothing else than a filthy public nuisance. On the opposite "side of the river higher up is Rowhedge, with sewers on its foreshore. "On Wyvenhoe foreshore defendant has a yard adjoining the pit "compulsorily closed four years ago, and on either side of the yard are "two sewers not many feet apart, one of which is connected with a "slaughter house. As the mouths of the sewers are high up on the "foreshore, their contents at low water gullies and pools. Such we "are told is the unenviable situation of this place ! " Upon the facts becoming known, the Fishmongers' Company were communicated with, and it was ascertained that steps had been taken to prevent any shellfish being sent to the City that had been taken from the place where the condemned oysters were stored. Such a state of things as that described above should be an impossibility, and it reflects little credit upon our Governing Bodies, that although the need for legislation with regard to shellfish became so pressing so long ago as 1898, that a deputation from the authorities of twenty-seven large towns, to the President of the Local Government Board, urged the necessity of legislation in order to minimise the dangers to which the public are exposed through the consumption of sewage contaminated oysters, and other shellfish, without however committing itself to the particular lines which such legislation should follow—yet the only evidence of any movement in the required direction is the Report of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal previously referred to. As the present office holders are pledged to effect improvements in the domestic welfare and governance of the people, the present may be an opportune time to again urge upon the Local Government Board the importance of dealing with this question as speedily as possible. The longer the matter is delayed, not only does the danger become greater, but also more difficult to deal with. 35 WINKLES. Four cases were reported during the year, in which winkles were suspected of having caused Enteric Fever, the winkles having been obtained from Billingsgate in each instance. The first case occurred at Wandsworth in February, another at Woolwich in March, and a third at East Ham in May, but in neither instance could any definite information be obtained as to the source of supply. The fourth case of this kind occurred in September at Wandsworth, but as a month had elapsed since the winkles were purchased, the source of supply, as in the previous case, could not be identified. It was ascertained, however, that they were obtained through an agent in Glasgow, who purchased supplies from a great number of places in the Western Isles of Scotland. Some of these are known to be polluted, and the authorities in which they are situated have taken steps to prevent winkles from being collected from them. 36 ROYAL COMMISSION ON TUBERCULOSIS- The second Interim Report of the Royal Commission, appointed on the 31st August, 1901, to enquire into the relations of Human and Animal Tuberculosis, was issued in January, 1907. The reference to this Commission was to enquire and report with respect to tuberculosis. (1.) Whether the disease in animals and man is one and the same. (2.) Whether animals and man can be reciprocally infected with it. (3.) Under what conditions, if at all, the transmission of disease from animals to man takes place, and what are the circumstances, favourable or unfavourable, to such transmission. It will be remembered that this enquiry was instituted in consequence of a pronouncement by Dr. Koch at the British Congress on Tuberculosis in 1901, when he expressed the following opinion :— "I feel justified in maintaining that human tuberculosis differs from "bovine, and cannot be transmitted to cattle. "The infection of human beings (from animals) is but a very rare "occurrence. 1 should estimate the extent of infection by the milk and "flesh of tubercular cattle, and the butter made of their milk, as hardly "greater than that of hereditary transmission, and I therefore do not "deem it advisable to take any measures against it." These views being in opposition to those held by the majority of experts who had studied the subject, and as, if accepted, they would have involved the abandonment of all inspection and destruction of meat affected with tuberculosis, it became imperative that the question should be the subject of an immediate and exhaustive investigation. In May, 1904, the Commission were in a position to prove that human tuberculosis could be transmitted to cattle, and on the 13th May of that year issued a first interim report, which stated :— "We have thought it our duty to make this short interim report for "the reason that the result at which we have arrived, namely, that "tubercle of human origin can give rise in the bovine animal to "tuberculosis identical with ordinary bovine tuberculosis, seems to us to "show quite clearly that it would be most unwise to frame or modify "legislative measures in accordance with the view that human and "bovine tubercle bacilli are specifically different from each other, and "that the disease caused bv one is a wholly different thing from the "disease caused by the other." 37 In the second Interim Report, dated January, 1907, it was shown that human beings could be, and frequently were, infected with tuberculosis through the consumption of milk. The Commission reported thereon in the following terms :— "There can be no doubt that in a certain number of cases the "tuberculosis occurring in the human subject, especially in children, is "the direct result of the introduction into the human body of the bacillus "of bovine tuberculosis, and there can also be no doubt that in the "majority, at least, of these cases the bacillus is introduced through "cow's milk. Cow's milk containing bovine tubercle is clearly a cause "of tuberculosis, and of latal tuberculosis in man." "A very considerable amount of disease and loss of life, especially "among the young, must be attributed to the use of cow's milk contain"ing tubercle bacilli. The presence of tubercle bacilli in cow's milk can "be detected, though with some difficulty, if the proper means be "adopted, and such milk ought never to be used for food. There is far "less difficulty in recognising clinically that a cow is distinctly suffering "from tuberculosis, in which case she may be yielding tuberculous milk. "The milk coming from such a cow ought not to form part of human "food, and, indeed, ought not to be used as food at all. "Our results clearly point to the necessity of measures more stringent "than those at present enforced being taken to prevent the sale or the "consumption of such milk." Since these reports appeared, three large volumes have been published giving a complete history of all the experiments that led the Commission to make the pronouncements referred to above. The books contain an enormous mass of material, including literary matter, illustrations and reports on inoculation, feeding and other experiments, that although exceedingly interesting and valuable from a scientific point of view, are of no attraction to the general public. One of the most interesting features of the appendices is contained in the summary of feeding experiments. These were made with bovine tubercle bacillus :— 1. To ascertain the relative susceptibility of different species of animals to this mode of inoculation. 2. To study the anatomical distribution of tuberculosis produced by feeding. Many species of animals were employed for this purpose. 38 In all these it was found that wherever generalised tuberculosis is produced by feeding, the lungs are generally affected often to a greater extent than any other organ in the body. These experiments show that tuberculosis is readily set up in pigs, and that in young ones it is usually of a progressive type. The adult pig, although readily affected, is much more resistant than the young one. The young pig was found to be undoubtedly the most susceptible to tuberculosis of all the animal species used in this series of experiments. In this connection I may mention that the leaflet No. 100, published by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for the guidance of pig breeders in Januar}r, 1904, was revised in May of this year, and it is pointed out in the later edition that tuberculosis in pigs is probably caused chiefly by feeding them on refuse milk from dairies in which cows with tubercular udders exist, and on the offal of diseased cattle. Inoculation experiments were also carried out on a large scale, and it is interesting to note that they showed that the chimpanzee and the various species of monkeys used are highly susceptible to the bovine tubercular bacillus, this high susceptibility being so clearly established that it seemed to be unnecessary to perform any more experiments on the same lines. As these animals are the most nearly related to the human race, it is not unlikely that tuberculosis can be conveyed to man in the same manner. Butchers, slaughtermen and others engaged in the meat trade should exercise the greatest care in the pursuit of their calling, and when slaughtering or cutting up any animal that shows the slightest suspicion of disease, they should thoroughly cleanse the implements used before they are again employed. The appearance of these volumes are very welcome, as they indicate clearly that the Local Government Board had the strongest warrant for the recommendation they issued in their circular letter dated 11th March, 1899, for the guidance of sanitary authorities and their officers in any action they may have to take with regard to tuberculous meat. Further, they emphasise the pressing necessity for immediate legislation with regard to the control of both meat and milk supplies throughout the country, there being almost daily evidence of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs. SPITTING IN RAILWAY CARRIAGES. The exhibition of cautionary notices against the evil practice of expectoration in railway carriages has not been without some good effect, but at the same time there is much room for improvement in manners of a certain section of the public who disregard them. 39 The present type of notice adopted is usually in the form of a request to passengers to abstain from this objectionable habit, 011 the grounds of cleanliness and danger to the public health, but it is advisable that it should be more generally known that the railway companies are armed with powers of repression of this nuisance under one of their bye-laws, which is to the following effect:— "No person shall spit upon the floor or upon any part of any carriage "using or being on the railway, or upon the platform at any station "of the Company, or upon the floor, side or wall of any hall, office, "waiting-room, refreshment-room, public room, or public passage at any "station of the Company. Any person infringing or not observing this "bye-law and regulation shall be liable to a penalty, and in case of non"compliance with the request of any servant or agent of the Company "to desist, may, without prejudice to any such penalty, be forthwith "removed from the Company's premises by or under the direction of any "such servant or agent." The penalty referred to is a fine not exceeding forty shillings for the first offence, and not exceeding Mo for any subsequent offence. It will be noticed that under this bye-law, not only is it a punishable offence to spit upon the floor or upon any part of any carriage using or being on the railway, but any person who does not comply with the request of any servant or agent of the Company, may be forthwith removed from the carriage. Your Medical Officer suggests, therefore, that the several railway Companies who have adopted this bye-law, and have stations in the City, be asked to direct attention to it by public notice posted on their premises, or that if more agreeable to any Company, the Corporation might offer to provide such notices, if their exhibition be permitted. CEREBRO SPINAL FEVER. The spread of this disease in Central Europe and America having given rise in some quarters to a doubt whether it may not have newly extended to, or been developing in this country, the Local Government Board in August, 1905, addressed a Memorandum to all Sanitary Authorities dealing generally with the characteristic symptoms of the disease, and especially with the minor anomalous manifestations. On the recommendation of your Medical Officer, a copy of this Memorandum was sent to every medical practitioner in the City. This is reproduced on 40 p 42 of the Annual Report for 1905, and on p. 36 of the Report for 1906 will be found a brief account of a fatal case that occurred in the City in that year. On the 21st February, 1907, a circular letter was received from the Local Government Board pointing out that Cerebro-Spinal Fever had recently been somewhat prevalent in parts of Scotland and Ireland, and that a few cases had occurred in this country. Sanitary Authorities were therefore advised to be on the alert to detect the presence of the disease in their district, or to satisfy themselves as to its absence. The Board also directed attention to their Memorandum issued in August, 1905, referred to above, and copies of the same were again issued by the Corporation. On the 26th February, 1907, the London County Council made an order requiring, for the period of six months, the notification of cases of Cerebrospinal Fever occurring within the administrative County of London. This order was approved by the Local Government Board, and came into operation on the 12th March. The Council made another order in August, extending the notification of this disease for a further period of eighteen months as from and including the 13th September. This was also approved by the Local Government Board, and accordingly came into operation on that date. No case has been reported in the City since the disease became notifiable. DIPHTHERIA IN PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. In January, 1907, your Medical Officer reported that the Medical Officer for the Education Department of the London County Council had informed him that the Council had passed the following Resolution : "That the Education Committee be authorised to refuse, during the "presence of diphtheria in any district, re-admission to school of children "excluded on account of diphtheria or sore throat, until such children "shall have obtained a medical certificate of freedom from infection "based on a bacteriological examination." The letter suggested that in order to give effect to this Resolution, it was proposed that a card should be used for such cases, giving the reason for exclusion, and stating that the necessary certificate could be signed by their own Doctor or the Medical Officer of Health. 41 While in accord with the view expressed in the Council's Resolution, with regard to a bacteriological examination in the circumstances as stated, the Sanitary Committee accepted your Medical Officer's recommendation, that in cases where the parents were unable to obtain the necessary certificates from their own Doctor, they should be directed to apply to the Medical Officer of the Education Department. The Committee's view of the matter having been communicated to the London County Council, the latter undertook that their Medical Officer would furnish bacteriological reports on specimens submitted to them when necessary. CLEANSING AND DISINFECTION OF SCHOOLS. With the object of preventing the occurrence of cases of infectious diseases of all kinds among school children, it would be well if all class-rooms, and school books were periodically disinfected as a matter of routine. A case is reported from America when, after the disinfection of upwards of 100,000 books used in the Public Schools of Buffalo, it was noticed that there had been a decrease in contagious diseases, particularly Scarlet Fever and Measles. With regard to the disinfection of school-rooms, the Committee on Disinfection of the American Health Association, in the review of the work of the year 1904, state that remarkable results have followed the occasional use of a suitable disinfectant on the floors of school-houses, and that infectious cold and other dust-borne diseases were thereby much lessened among the scholars. The Scotch Education Department issued a Memorandum in November, 1907, giving full instructions as to the most efficient way of cleansing and disinfecting schools, and articles used in the course of instruction. The directions given, were prepared by the expert advisers of the Local Government Board for Scotland. They are based upon actual experience, and take full account of practical difficulties. Great stress is laid upon the importance of periodical cleansing, and disinfection of schoolrooms, and to the dangers arising from dusty atmosphere, dust being one of the factors in the dissimination of infectious disease. It is for this reason therefore, that periodic disinfection is advisable, even when no known infectious disease has been present. The memorandum deals fully with the following points :— i. The sources of dirt in schools, and the danger attending it. ii. The general principles of cleansing and disinfection wherein moist cleansing of floors, walls &c., is strongly advocated. Full specific directions are also given how best to disinfect schoolrooms and school appliances. 42 The Corporation have no power to enforce disinfection except in cases where infectious disease has occurred, and the Education Authorities should be therefore invited to give careful consideration to the suggestions of the Scotch Education Department, with a view to their adoption in all schools under their charge. CLEANSING VERMINOUS CHILDREN ATTENDING PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. At the latter end of 1906, your Medical Officer reported that some suggestion had been received from the Education Department of the London County Council, with a view of checking the number of children attending the schools in a verminous condition. Two alternative schemes were proposed, one where the name and address of any child in a verminous condition is forwarded to the Medical Officer of Health, whose Inspector calls at the House and leaves an order entitling the child to a bath and disinfection at the public expense, the other was for the Medical Officer of Health to furnish the Medical Officer of the Education Department of the London County Council with a supply of cards, also entitling the child to a free bath and disinfection. At your Medical Officer's recommendation, the Committee decided to adopt the first suggestion, because it would involve the inspection of the child's home when he made his call, whereas in the second, he might remain ignorant of the number of infected children or the places where they resided, and it is most essential that houses of verminous children should be strictly looked after. Arrangements were therefore made in February, 1907, that the names and addresses of verminous children should be sent to your Medical Officer, and if after the inspection it was necessary, an order on the Guardians for cleansing and disinfecting the child would be granted. Such orders will only be issued with respect to children residing within the City. 43 CREMATION. The number of Cremations carried out at the Corporation Crematorium at Uford last year was 18, being 5 less than in 1906, and a reference to the Table on page 48, shows that a slight decrease is recorded at several other Crematoria, the total number in the Kingdom during 1907 being 706, as compared with 743 in 1906. In view of the steady annual increase in the numbers from 1885 to 1906, it would appear that this is merely a casual fluctuation, and does not indicate in any way that the process is becoming less popular. Apart from any matter of sentiment, there can be no question that the best, quickest, and most sanitary method of disposing of a dead body is to reduce it to ashes in a properly constructed furnace. Cremation solves the question of intra mural burial. It would be far more convenient and more in accordance with modern science if the remains of those the Country honoured by laying them to rest in our Abbeys and Cathedrals, were always cremated, and their ashes alone deposited in the place of sepulchre. Moreover, our churches could receive within their walls, without danger to the living, as in the past, the remains of those who had been their supporters during their lifetime, should their survivors desire it. The managers of several of the Crematoria in the United Kingdom have favoured me with some notes on their experiences of Cremation. The Hon. Secretary of the Birmingham Crematorium remarks :— "I have found that in many cases where a deceased person had left "instructions for cremation, the relatives being adverse to cremation, "would not permit of the body being cremated, and I have also found "that undertakers can greatly influence relatives of a deceased person "either for or against cremation in accordance with their own ideas. "We have recently learned of cases in which the above facts have taken "place." The Superintendent of the Sheffield Crematorium states :— "Although the total shows an increase of 12 only over last year, I am "of opinion that Cremation is becoming more popular." 44 The Superintendent of the Corporation Crematorium at Bradford, referring to the year's work, remarks :— "These figures are not large, and we cannot say that we have made "much progress during the year. I believe, however, that cremation is "becoming more widely known and better understood. Still the people "are not sufficiently educated on the subject." Referring to the decrease in the number of Cremations carried out during the year by the London Cremation Company, both at Woking and Golder's Green, the Secretary writes :— "The growing interest in the subject of Cremation is evidenced by "the increased number of enquiries and the large number of visitors who "avail themselves of the facilities offered for inspecting the buildings "and apparatus when a cremation is not proceeding, gives us reason to "think that the set back is quite a temporary one, and not to be regarded as a decline in the movement." The Secretary of the Scottish Burial Reform and Cremation Society, Ltd., Glasgow, remarks :— "We are finding as the years go past that Cremation as a means of "disposing of the dead is gradually gaining in public favour." The Manager of the Leeds Crematorium notes that:— "The progress seems to be slow, and the prejudice against Cremation "stubborn." The suggestion has been made that the Home Office Regulations should no longer require : (1) the applicant to make a Statutory Declaration ; and (2) that the second certificate should not be confined to a limited body of medical men, but that any medical practitioner who has been on the Register for five years, should, without further qualification, be permitted to sign the second certificate. It has been said that the retention of these regulations tends in a great measure to retard the spread of Cremation, but I am quite unable to endorse this opinion. Opponents of Cremation would be only too ready to make adverse use of any attempts to relax the present regulations which, very properly, have been made exceedingly stringent, and it would certainly be most unwise to lend any countenance to the suggested alteration. It will be seen from the foregoing that apart from the slight set-back of last year, the practice is steadily increasing in favour in this country. In other countries the movement is making steady advancement, as will be seen from the following figures.* * The figures, &c., in the following notes are taken from the German publication "Die Flamme," kindly placed at my disposal by the Secretary of the Cremation Society of England. 45 Germany. The first Crematorium was opened at Gotha in December, 1878 ; a second was established at Heidelberg in 1891 ; a third at Hamburg in 1892 ; and a fourth at Jena in 1898, Other towns followed suit, and'.there are now fourteen towns with Crematoria. The total number of bodies incinerated in Germany from 1878 to the middle of last year was 13,614. Denmark. The only Crematorium in this Country was established at Copenhagen in 1893, where 508 cremations have taken place up to the middle of last year. Italy. There are now no less than 28 Crematoria in Italy, the first being erected at Mailand in 1876 ; a second was built at Cremona in 1881, and every year other towns established similar appliances. From 1876 until the middle of last year 6,513 bodies have been cremated in this country. France. A Crematorium was established at Pere-la-Chaise, in Paris, 1889, and from that date to 1906 inclusive, 4,204 cremations for private persons took place. During the same period 82,758 hospital remains and unclaimed bodies, &c., were also dealt with. Provincial Crematoria have also been established at Rouen, Lyons, Rheims and Marseilles, but no figures are available. I am informed that the three latter are used mainly as adjuncts to the local cemetery, and that when it is full, the bodies of those who have, by agreement, been interred for a term of years, are exhumed, and their remains cremated. Russia. Crematoria for St. Petersburg.—The President of the Sanitary Committee has submitted his report to the St. Petersburg Town Council in favour of the establishment of a crematorium in the town, to be used with due regard to the interests of justice, and in fulfilment only of the testamentary instructions of such deceased persons as may have decided to be cremated. ("Lancet," 28th February, 1908.) 46 Norway. A Crematorium was opened at Bergen in June, 1907, during which month three bodies were cremated. Sweden. Crematoria were established in Stockholm and Gothenburg in the years 1887 and 1890 respectively, where up to the middle of 1907, 1,152 cremations had taken place. Switzerland. Basle, Geneva, St. Gall and Zurich are supplied with Crematoria, the first being built in the latter town in 1889. From that date to the middle of 1907, 3,129 cremations have taken place in this republic. United States of America. Washington, D.C., was the first town in the United States in which a Crematorium was introduced. It was built in 1876. The next were built at Lancaster Pa., and Washington Pa., in 1884, and since that date thirty similar establishments have been erected in other parts of the Union. The returns of the number of bodies incinerated are somewhat incomplete, but it is known that from 1876 to the middle of 1907, 335,732 cremations have been carried out in the States. Canada. The only Crematorium in Canada was opened in 1903, when up to the end of 1904, 44 bodies were dealt with. The returns for 1906-7 are not available. South America. Crematoria have been established at Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Ayres and Monte Video, but the number of bodies cremated are not given. In addition to the foregoing, Crematoria are in operation at Calcutta, India, Adelaide, South Australia; also one at Shanghai, China, for the use of Europeans. An attempt is being made by a local Cremation Society at Auckland, New Zealand, to induce the Municipality to establish a Crematorium. 47 With regard to the establishment of Crematoria in India, it is interesting to note that so long ago as March, 1874, Major Martin, of the 4th King's Own Regiment, issued from the Regimental Press at Poona, a "Specification of a Cinerator for the use of Brahmins and other Hindoo castes who perform their funeral rites by burning." Major Martin, in introducing the subject, remarks :— "Burning the dead having been from time immemorial a funeral rite "practised by certain castes in India, and one which it would not, from "its peculiar adaptation to the climate, be wise to endeavour to abolish ; "it becomes us to consider how the custom can be modified so as not to "prove a nuisance and cause of nuisance." "It is really time that measures were taken to remove from our sight "the disgusting scenes forced upon us in our daily walks, and to prevent "our health and that of the natives themselves being affected by the "pernicious vapours emanating from diseased bodies undergoing the "process of calcination." A full description and illustration of the proposed "Cinerator" is given, and this little book forms an interesting link in the bibliography relating to modern cremation. In view of the importance in the interests of the public health of encouraging the adoption of cremation, it would seem desirable that the question of reducing the cost of cremation at the City of London Cemetery should be considered. At the present time, the charge for cremation at the City of London Cemetery is £4 4s., this fee including Clergy fee in respect of a burial service, before, at, or after cremation, the .provision of a plain urn for the ashes, storage of the latter for three months, and at the expiration of this period, its burial in a plot of ground specially reserved for this purpose. 48 CREMATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, 23 Years—1885-1907.

Vide " Transactions of Cremation Society of England, 1903," p. 31. 49 ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS, STONEY LANE, HOUNDSDITCH. These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's—Queen's— Prince's—North—and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class ; some of the ground floors being let as shops. The buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 941* persons, compared with 1,031 in 1906. Sixty-two per cent, are adults, and thirty-eight per cent, children (under 14 years). This reduction in the number of inhabitants is owing to the steps taken to prevent overcrowding, which had been brought to my notice in the course of the year. It should be stated that where overcrowding was found to exist, it was not due to the abuse of sub-letting but mainly to the natural increase of families. The death rate for 1907 was 13*8 per 1,000 per annum [of which 30*7 per cent, was of children under 5 years of age]. The number of deaths per 1,000 births of children under one year was 91, as against 89 for the City generally.

The number of births was 33, viz. : 14 males and 19 females. The birth rate, 35-0 per 1,000, is the highest recorded since 1902, and is 2"6 per 1,000 above the average for the previous five years. * i.e., persons sleeping on the premises. 50 Only one illegitimate birth has been recorded in these Dwellings since 1894, which is consistent with the high reputation for morality among the Jews, by whom they are mainly occupied. The birth rate in these Dwellings reached a maximum of 46*9 per 1,000 in 1896, and until 1907 had since been falling, as shown by the following figures :— Birth Rate, Artizans' Dwellings. 1896 - 46.9 1902 - 45-8 1897 - 40.3 1903 31.2 1898 - 43.1 1904 30.1 1899 37.5 1905 - 29-1 1900 - 38.4 1906 - 26-1 1901 - 33.8 1907 35.0 The Baths provided for the use of the tenants of these Buildings, which were opened in May, 1904, continue to be extensively used, the number of persons bathing during 1907 being 12,477, of whom 4,935 were males and 7,542 were females.

With the exception of one year, viz., 1903, the expenditure for disinfectants was the lowest recorded since the methods and material adopted in 1901 have been in operation. This is due 'to the cold and wet summer season experienced in 1907. As heretofore, all the disinfectants used in the Public Health Department were obtained through your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for the following purposes :— A. Deodorizing and " denaturalizing " condemned meat. B. Disinfecting public conveniences (urinals, &c.). C. Disinfecting roadways, street gullies, &c. D. Disinfecting premises, &c., after infectious disease, drain testing and sundries. The amounts spent during the past twelve months under these several headings were :— £ s. d. A 3 10 0 B 22 19 11 C 92 18 9 D 36 19 3 Total £156 7 11 The average amount expended during the previous three years for similar purposes was £180 4s. 2d. During the year arrangements were made with the heads of the several other departments of the Corporation whereby in the future any disinfectants required by them can be obtained direct from the Contractor supplying the Public Health Department. It is hoped that a considerable economy will be effected by this procedure. 53 SANITARY INSPECTIONS.

A list of registered tenement houses is given in Appendix C (p. 174). COMMON LODGING-HOUSES. 24-25, New Street, Bishopsgate. 4, Vine Street, Minories. These premises formerly used as common lodging-houses and closed in February, 1906, have since been demolished, and police dwellings erected on their sites. 116, Middlesex Street. The " Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," No. 116, Middlesex Street, is the only common lodging-house in the City. It provides sleeping accommodation for 453 persons, and was opened on the 7th February, 1906. On the 27th February, 1906, when reporting the opening of this place to the Sanitary Committee, I expressed the opinion that the establishment of a common lodging-house of such large dimensions within the City would probably result in an increase in the number of persons chargeable upon the ratepayers as destitute sick inmates removable to the City Infirmary. 58 In my annual report for last year some figures were given showing that this prediction was amply justified by events, and the number of inmates that have sought the shelter of the City Infirmary during 1907 has been even greater than in the previous year. During the twelve months ended 31st December, 1907, 391 persons (as against 303 in 1906) frequenting this place became chargeable upon the ratepayers. Of these 300 (against 210 in 1906) received orders for admission to the City of London Infirmary at Bow, 63 were given orders for admission to the City Workhouse at Homerton, and the remaining 28 received medical advice only, being not ill enough to require treatment at the Infirmary. A person has only to sleep one night in this place to qualify for admission to the City Infirmary, and this method of securing medical treatment or advice is becoming increasingly popular. In July, 1907, the Churchwardens and Overseers of St. Botolph Without, Bishopsgate, had occasion through their Chairman, Mr. Bull, C.C., to draw the attention of the Sanitary Committee to the matter with a view of protecting the interests of the Overseers and Ratepayers. This question of persons in quasi-philanthropic institutions becoming chargeable to the Ratepayers of the districts in which such places are situated has arisen elsewhere than in the City. " Bruce House," a County Council common lodging-house in the Strand, and a Rowton House in Hammersmith Road are also cases in point. With regard to the latter, it was reported by the Finance and General Purposes Committee at a meeting of the Hammersmith Guardians on 29th January last* that they had considered a statement and particulars submitted by the Clerk with reference to the cost of the cases admitted from Rowton House during the year ended at Michaelmas, 1906, and recommended that Rowton House, Ltd., be informed that the sum of £2,040, stated to be the gross cost to the rates in the Annual Report of the Local Government Board Inspector, is rather under than over the amount actually expended. Nor is this the only objection to such an institution in the City. Much annoyance was caused by some hundreds of undesirables congregating near the building between the hours of three and five every afternoon before they were admitted at the latter hour. These men conduct themselves in anything but an orderly manner, and complaints were also made of the nuisance caused by the freedom with which they expectorate on the footpaths. The assistance of the Commissioner of Police was invited with a view to remedying these evils, and the Army officials have directed applicants for * Daily Telegraph, 30th January, 1908. 59 accommodation not to assemble before 4 p.m., and they are now admitted an hour earlier, viz., 4 p.m. instead of 5 p.m. as heretofore. These alterations have effected considerable improvement in lessening the nuisance complained of. WATER-CLOSETS AND DRAINAGE PLANS. In the course of the year 341 plans for the proposed reconstruction of water-closets and drains were submitted for approval. With modification in certain cases, these were agreed to and the works carried out. In sixteen cases, however, it was found that plans for waterclosets were not in accordance with the Corporation Bye-laws, and were disallowed. OVERCROWDING. Overcrowding is a nuisance dealt with under Section 2, (1), (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1901, and nineteen cases were reported during the year. Notices of abatement being served, the overcrowding was discontinued in each instance. Several of these were discovered during a room to room inspection at the Artizans' Dwellings at Stoney Lane. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. In seven cases only, out of 1,185 Notices issued during the year by the District Inspectors, was it found necessary in consequence of non-compliance to refer the matter to the City Solicitor with a view to taking such steps as he deemed necessary to ensure the required sanitary improvement being carried out. With one exception—now being dealt with—the Notices were subsequently complied with without the matter being taken into Court. The following are the cases referred to :— Premises. 1-14, Barbican - Drainage defects - Drainage relaid. 26, Cloth Fair - Non-registration of tenement house. Notice complied with.

Court repaved. 50, Moorgate Street - Defective drain - In Solicitor's hands. 2, Shaftesbury Place - Overcrowding - Overcrowding abated. 36, Primrose Street - Defective drains and watercloset. Notice complied with. 29, Milk Street - Dry rot in floors of basement - Concrete floor substituted. 60 STREET GULLIES. Several complaints were received during the summer months of nuisance of smells from street gullies in the public thoroughfares. In dry weather this is sometimes due to want of flushing, but in a large number of cases the nuisance arises through faulty construction, many of these gullies being untrapped. The City Engineer is giving special attention to this matter, and where complaints are made owing to this cause these appliances are being reconstructed greatly to the relief of passers by and persons living in the vicinity. SEWER VENTILATORS IN ROADWAY'S. These also are from time to time the subject of complaint. It has been found that the best way—although a somewhat costly one—of abating the evil is to close the ventilators in the roadway and substitute large iron ventilating shafts attached to the wall of a neighbouring building. At times some little difficulty is experienced in obtaining the consent of the owner to the erection of the proposed shaft, but in most instances they are willing to render assistance towards the abatement of what is an intolerable nuisance under certain conditions of atmosphere, &c. LEADENHALL MARKET. The whole of the drainage throughout the market has been re-constructed and the system of drainage ventilation re-modelled. New soil and water-pipes have been fitted, and in some cases water-closets were removed from basements where they could not be efficiently ventilated. removal of fish offal. The contract with Messrs. F. S. Hemplieman and Co. for the removal of Fish Offal expired on the 21st May, 1907, and on the recommendation of the City Engineer and your Medical Officer of Health was renewed for a further period of twelve months. The conditions of the contract require that the Contractor collect and remove, free of charge, between the hours of 7 p.m. and 9 a.m., all fish offal from the Corporation Markets and Fishmongers' premises in the City, to the entire satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health, in specially constructed galvanised iron bins, of a pattern approved by the Medical Officer of Health, and to thoroughly cleanse and disinfect such bins before returning them to the markets and shops. DRAINAGE, RED BULL WHARF, UPPER THAMES STREET. In the course of some building operations at this place, which has been acquired for the purpose of a cold storage depot, it was found that the drain from the Wharf also received the drainage from some premises in Red Bull Yard adjoining. 61 This arrangement being unsatisfactory, as it would have been most undesirable to have a drain running through premises where meat is stored and where it would be affected by the low temperature of the place, an arrangement was made by which the owners were enabled to divert the whole of the drainage into the public sewer in Angel Passage on the East side of the Wharf. DRAINAGE, ROYAL EXCHANGE. Considerable progress has been made during the year in the reconstruction of the drainage and sanitary arrangements at this building, and almost twothirds of the work has been completed and tested with satisfactory results. Owing to the construction of the buildings considerable difficulties have presented themselves in the course of the alterations. As an instance, in some places the workmen have had to cut through no less than nine feet of solid brickwork, the building being of massive construction. Piercing the stone mouldings, for the admission of ventilation shafts, so as not to spoil the architectural features of the building, was also a difficult and laborious operation. Iron pipes for soil drainage have been adopted throughout the Exchange, and the provision of sanitary accommodation for women employed in the building, referred to in my last Annual Report, has been arranged for. DRAINAGE, Nos. 1 to 14, BARBICAN. Complaints having been made of leakage through the railway tunnel over the Metropolitan Railway line running under these premises, it was found in the course of investigation that the main combined drain taking the drainage of these buildings was very defective and the cause of the evil. The several owners were therefore called upon to abate the nuisance, but some question having arisen as to their legal liability in the matter, it was considered advisable in the interests of all parties concerned to settle the matter amicably if possible. It was finally suggested that the Corporation should relay the drain and bear some portion of the charges incurred, the owners of the premises each bearing a proportionate share of the cost. This was agreed to, and the drain relaid, iron pipes being used as less liable to damage from vibration caused by railway traffic. RAILWAY STATIONS. Periodical inspections were made of the sanitary accommodation provided at the twenty-five Railway Stations in the City. In nineteen of them, the Companies they belong to have been called upon to effect sanitary improvements thereat. The defects, for the most part, have been due to lack of proper cleaning and to defective drains and sanitary fittings. In each case the necessary works have been satisfactorily carried out. 62 INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS. The undermentioned schools in the district have been inspected, various defects found, and the following works executed :— St. Bride's School, Bride Lane.—New water-closets, urinal, soil-pipe, and lavatory basins have been constructed. St. Dunstan's Schools, Fleet Street.—New iron drains, waterclosets, urinals, soil-pipe, and lavatory waste pipe constructed. St. Dunstan's Infants' School, Fetter Lane.—New iron drains, new water-closets, urinals, lavatory basins, waste pipes and soil-pipes have been constructed. The ventilation to the School-room has been improved, and a new lobby to the water-closets constructed. St. Bartholomew the Great Schools, Bartholomew Close.—The soilpipes were tested at the request of the Education Authority and found defective. The defects have been remedied, and the drains and soil-pipes again tested with water and found sound. REMOVAL OF HUMAN REMAINS. Four cases were dealt with in the course of the year, viz., at :— St. Peter-le-Poor. No. 9, Fore Street. St. Sepulchre Schools, Nos. 8 and 9, Giltspur Street. Site of Old Christ's Hospital. ST. PETER-LE-POOR. The Secretary of State, under circumstances fully detailed in my Annual Report for 1906, on the application of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on behalf of the Vestry Clerk, having given his consent under Section 16 of the Union of Benefices Act, 1860, for the removal of human remains (under the direction of your Medical Officer) found during the demolition of this Church, which had been united with the benefice of St. Michael, Cornhill, the work of exhumation was commenced on the 18th of February, 1907, and completed on the 8th of April of that year. In the process, the earth covering the whole of the area of the Church was removed down to the virgin soil, and sifted for bones. These filled 252 boxes, which were taken to the City of London Cemetery at Ilford for re-interment in accordance with the regulations in force in the City for such removal. One other coffin claimed by relatives was removed and buried elsewhere. In all, 253 cases were buried at Ilford, 241 were interred in one enclosure in consecrated ground purchased for the purpose by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the remaining 11, by special desire, being buried in two private graves adjoining that in which the majority were placed. 63 ST. SEPULCHRE'S SCHOOLS, GILTSPUR STREET. In the course of some rebuilding operations at Nos. 8 and 9, Giltspur Street, adjoining St. Sepulchre's Schools, a quantity of human remains were disturbed. Upon application to the Home Secretary a license dated 11th February was issued authorising their re-interment in the City of London Cemetery, Ilford, under the supervision and to the satisfaction of your Medical Officer. The Churchwardens of St. Sepulchre subsequently made a formal request to be allowed to re-inter them on the spot in the burial ground belonging to the Church, from which at some time they had originally been removed. This was allowed, as it involved no danger to the public health and avoided 9 considerable expense. The bones were re-laid in the Churchyard, being surrounded and covered with a sufficient layer of properly made concrete. FROM THE SITE OF OLD CHRIST'S HOSPITAL. In April, 1907, during some excavations made on the site of Old Christ's Hospital for the extension of the General Post Office building, some human remains were found. These filled four cases, which were removed and re-interred at the City of London Cemetery at Ilford with the usual precautions. In this instance the bones were dealt with under the provisions of Section 7 of Christ's Hospital (London) Act, 1901, which provided that any human remains found on any part of the site of Christ's Hospital were to be removed under the superintendence and to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. No. 9, FORE STREET. In September, 1907, in the course of some excavations required in the rebuilding of the above premises, which adjoined to the North-east corner of Cripplegate Churchyard, some human remains were discovered which, when collected, filled two cases. After communicating with the Home Office and the Churchwardens of Cripplegate, an arrangement was made for their reinterment in the Churchyard, and this was duly carried out under my supervision. 64 UNLAWFUL REMOVAL OF HUMAN REMAINS. In December last, it became necessary to call the attention of builders and other persons responsible for conducting building operations in the City, which are likely to involve any disturbance of human remains in excavating, to the importance of strict observance of the provision of Section 25 of the Burial Act, 1857, which expressly enacts that :— " Except in cases where a body is removed from one consecrated place " of burial to another by faculty granted by an ordinary for that purpose, " it shall not be lawful to remove any body, or the remains of any body, " which may have been interred in any place of burial, without license " under the hand of one of H.M. Principal Secretaries of State, and " with such precautions as such Secretary of State may prescribe as the " condition of such license ; and any person who shall remove any such " body or remains, contrary to this enactment, or who shall neglect to " observe the precautions prescribed as the condition of the license for " removal, shall, on summary conviction, before any two justices of the " peace, forfeit and pay for every such offence a sum not exceeding ten " pounds." The prohibition in this section extends to any place of burial, and not merely to burying grounds which have been closed, or to burying grounds provided by burial boards or otherwise. In the case of Reg. v. Sharpe, 26 L.J. (N.S.) M.C, 47 ; 7 Cox, C.C. 214, it was held to be an indictable misdemeanour at common law to enter an unconsecrated burial ground, and without the knowledge or consent of the owners of the ground, or authority of any kind, to dig up and carry away a corpse buried therein ; and this, even although the person committing the act may have been actuated by motives of affection and respect to the dead, and of religious duty, and have conducted the removal decently. The 15 and 16 Vict., c. 85, s. 42, enables places to be established for the reception of bodies until they are interred. (Glen's Burial Boards Act, 1881). As it did not appear that this requirement was generally known, the Committee, on my suggestion, directed the publication in the public press of the following notice :— Notice to Architects, Builders and others. " The attention of Architects, Builders, and other persons connected " with building operations in the City, which are likely to involve the " disturbance of human remains, is directed to the responsibilities " incurred by any breach of the following Section of the Burial Act of " 1857, and to the importance of at once giving notice to the Medical " Officer of Health of any cases where human remains are discovered :— 65 " ' Burial Act, 1857—Section 25. " ' Except in the cases where a body is removed from one " ' consecrated place of burial to another by faculty granted by the ' ordinary for that purpose, it shall not be lawful to remove any " ' body, or the remains of any body, which may have been interred " ' in any place of burial, without licence under the hand of one of " ' Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State, and with such '' ' precautions as such Secretary of State may prescribe as the " ' condition of such license ; and any person who shall remove any " ' such body or remains, contrary to this enactment, or who shall " ' neglect to observe the precautions prescribed as the condition of " ' the license for removal, shall, on summary conviction before any " ' two justices of the peace, forfeit and pay for every such offence " ' a sum not exceeding ten pounds." COMBINED DRAINAGE. For many years past, the law relating to Combined Drainage in the Metropolis has been in a most unsatisfactory state, and has cast an unduly heavy burden upon the ratepayers. The St. Pancras Borough Couucil have taken a very active part in endeavouring to remedy the present anomalous condition of the law, and have invited the support of the Corporation in their efforts to amend the legislation dealing with the question. Although, owing to their drainage works being mainly constructed under local Acts, the Corporation are not so immediately concerned in this matter as the Metropolitan Borough Councils, yet it was felt that the support of the Corporation should be extended to any movement for improving the existing condition of affairs, more especially as it has been estimated that the cost incurred by the ratepayers of London in reconstructing sewers due to combined drainage, has amounted during the three years 1904-6 to a sum of no less than £65,000, and it is certain that such liability will continue year by year as owners of property become better acquainted with the legal position, and therefore will be more ready to take advantage of the difficulties which local authorities experience in proving the liability of the owners for drainage works. By invitation of the St. Pancras Borough Council, a Conference of representatives of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils was held at the St. Pancras Town Hall on the 27th June, 1907, to consider the whole matter, when it was referred to a Committee of the Conference to prepare for presentation to the President of the Local Government Board a Petition and Draft Bill dealing with the law relating to this question. 66 A second meeting was held on the 6th December, 1907, when the Committee's Report and Draft Bill was presented. It was a short Bill of two Clauses, Clause I being a definition of the meaning of the word " Drain," and Clause II. the short title. Clause I. was to the following effect:— 1. " In and for the purposes of the Metropolis Management Acts, " 1855 to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act " or Acts amending the same, the word " drain " shall be deemed to " include any sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the " passing of this Act, with which two or more houses or premises " (whether belonging to the same or different owners) are at the date of " the passing of this Act, or may at any time thereafter, be connected or " which is used or capable of being or intended to be used for the " conveyance of the drainage of such houses or buildings, directly or by '' means of any other sewer or drain, to any public sewer, but shall not " include any sewer which has been constructed as a sewer to the satis" faction of the Corporation of the City of London, the London County " Council, the Metropolitan Borough Councils or their respective " predecessors, or any sewer which has been constructed by any of " those Authorities at the public expense." -Clause II. was as under :— 2. " This Act may be cited as the Metropolis Management Amend" ment Act, 1907, and shall be construed as one with the Metropolis " Management Act, 1855, and the Acts amending the same." The Committee recommended :— " (a) That the Draft Bill be approved and adopted." " (b) That a copy of the Draft Bill approved by the Conference be " forwarded to each of the City and Metropolitan Borough " Councils." " (c) That the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils be asked to " bring the Draft Bill before the Members of Parliament repre" senting their respective Districts, with a view to obtaining their " support and co-operation in the promotion of the Bill through " the various stages of the House." The report was received, when, upon the motion of the Chairman that recommendation (a) be adopted, an amendment was brought forward to the following effect:— " In and for the purposes of the Metropolis Management Acts, 1855 " to 1899, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, or any Act or 67 " Acts amending, the same word " drain" shall be deemed to include any " sewer or drain, whether constructed before or after the passing of this " Act, with which two or more houses or premises are at the date of the " passing of this Act, or may at any time thereafter, be connected or " which is used or capable of being or intended to be used for the " conveyance of the drainage of such houses or buildings, directly or " indirectly, to any sewer which has been approved as such by the " Metropolitan Commissioners of Sewers, the Metropolitan Board of " Works or the London County Council, but shall not include any sewer " so approved as aforesaid." Upon being put to the vote, the amendment was carried, as also when put as a substantive motion. Recommendations (6) and (c) were also agreed to. Should this Draft Bill meet with the support of the City and Metropolitan Borough Councils, no doubt steps will be taken to promote the Draft Bill as amended during the present Session. SANITARY DEFECTS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE. All premises where infectious disease was notified were inspected with reference to drainage, soil and waste pipes, water-closets, water supply, ventilation, &c., and of the 106 cases, it has been necessary to entirely reconstruct the sanitary system in 10 instances ; and amendments have been made to soil and waste pipes and W.C's in 62 others. HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1907 consisted of 31,977 cartloads of street sweepings and slop, and 51,077 loads of house and trade refuse. Total, 83,054 loads. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Letts' Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. 68 SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS. All courts and narrow passages throughout the City were regularly flushed during the summer months under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service and the washing of the main streets last year no less than 77,424,000 gallons of water were used. Disinfectants were also freely applied where necessary. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Custom House, as heretofore, required special attention, there having always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the neighbourhood of these places free from the nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially in hot weather. The following is a list of the 256 places that were flushed, so arranged as to show the number of times they were washed down weekly :— Flushed Six times a week. Cavendish Court French Ordinary Court Lower Thames Street Cobb's Court Harrow Alley Viaduct Steps Church Row (Fenchurch Street) Huggin Lane Church Row (Houndsditch) Flushed Five times a week.

There are seventy-six courts and narrow passages in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed regularly, become dirty and unsightly through the traffic of passengers or vehicles and the action of a smoke-laden atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. The following is a list of the places so dealt with during 1907 :— EAST DISTRICT. Black Horse Yard, Aldgate. Hanover Court, Houndsditch. Providence Place, Middlesex Black Raven Court, Leadenhall Harrow Alley, Aldgate. Street. Street. Hartshorn Alley, Leadenhall Rose Alley, Bishopsgate Street.

Smoke nuisances were reported at twelve premises during 1907. The number of observations recorded amounted to 341, as against 595 noted at 19 premises in 1906. The service of Notices upon offenders resulted in the abatement of the nuisances in all cases, and therefore, there has been no occasion to take further action in the matter. No nuisance of smoke from Railway locomotion was reported during the year. It is gratifying to note that at a discussion on " the Smoke problem in large towns" held at the Royal Sanitary Institute, on the 14th November, 1907, not only were the reports and efforts for dealing with this evil, of the late Sir John Simon, formerly Medical Officer of Health for the City, made 50 years ago, commended, but similar suggestions for effecting improvements as those mentioned in your Medical Officer's Annual Reports for 1903 and 1906 were also entirely concurred in. It was generally agreed that legislation was required for dealing with the following points:— (1) The substitution of some other term for the word " black" in in Section 24 (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. At present 72 unless the smoke causing the evil is " black smoke," it is not a nuisance that can be dealt with summarily under that Act. (2) Owners of private dwelling-houses should no longer be permitted to discharge smoke from their chimneys in such quantity as to be a nuisance. If stronger measures for dealing with smoke nuisances become operative it will greatly encourage an increased use of both gas and electricity for cooking purposes. There can be no doubt that the substitution of electric motors for steam engines in printing works and other places where power is used, has considerably lessened the smoke evil. HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. The number of registered Hairdressers' establishments remains about the same as in 1906, six new firms have been placed on the Register,.four have been closed, and in three cases the names have been struck off for noncompliance with the Regulations. During the year information was received that the Governor of Cape Colony, with the advice of the Executive Council, had approved the adoption of the Regulations in use in the City of London as Regulations for the control of Barbers' and Hairdressers' Saloons within the Borough of Kimberley. It appears that Colonial Authorities are armed with more effectual powers of insisting upon their requirements being carried out, than obtains in the mother country, as one of the Regulations in force in the Borough of Kimberley reads as under : — " Any person contravening any of the above Regulations shall be " liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding ten pounds sterling, and in " default of payment to imprisonment with or without hard labour for " any period not exceeding three calendar months." The action of a Colonial Authority in adopting the Regulations of the Corporation must be considered as complimentary, and the inhabitants oi Kimberley are to be congratulated upon the action of their representative in making any breach of their Regulations a punishable offence. It is much to be regretted that similar powers are not in operation here. 73 The Register of those Hairdressers who have undertaken to comply with the Regulations now includes the following establishments :— The Army and Navy Toilet Club, 35, Bucklersbury. Arthur P. Cornell, 5, Birchin Lane. Chester and Co., 42, Old Broad Street. Civil Service Supply Association, 136 to 140, Queen Victoria Street. Louis Cohen, 151, Aldersgate Street. Samuel Cohen, 120, Newgate Street. Fox's Paragon Toilet Club, 60, Fore Street. Frederick G. Foerstel, 1, Telegraph Street. Franz Friedel, 35, Moorgate Street. The Gresham Toilet Company, 93a, Gresham Street. Antoine Heifer, 6, King Street, Cheapside. Carl Hartmann, 5, Queen's Head Passage, Newgate Street. Frederick Heitman, 13, Pilgrim Street. George Heifer, 36, Coleman Street. Gustav Krajewski, 137, Fenchurch Street. Anton Kaiser, 4, Liverpool Street. Kingstone and Hubbard, 8-10, Ludgate Arcade. Charles Lehman, 8-9, Aldermanbury Postern. Heinrich A. E. Leopold, 8, Masons' Avenue. Charles Massberg, 12, Cullum Street. Thomas W. Monk, 5, Angel Court. The New Baltic Toilet Co., 37, St. Mary Axe. Pierre Pozzi, 16, Lawrence Lane. Lucien Saulet, 5, Eastcheap. Alexander Schocke, 149, Cannon Street. Stephen J. Schuster, 125, Wood Street. Henry Theobald, 201, Bishopsgate Street Without. Frederick Woenowske, 14, Aldersgate Street. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) BILL, 1907. This Bill, an abstract of which was given in my last Annual Report, received the Royal Assent on 28th August, 1907, and came into operation on the first day of January of this year. The Bill was opposed by the Corporation, as it particularly affected their interests. Opposition to the Bill was also presented from other quarters, and certain of the Council's proposals were abandoned. As originally drafted; the Bill contained much controversial matter and unsatisfactory proposals, which might have jeopardized the chances of its passing. 74 Of these the most important were Parts IV., V. and VI., relating to the milk supply of the Metropolis. Part IV.—Clauses 21 to 31, for the prevention of the supply of tuberculous milk to the county, was retained, and is now in operation. Part V.—Clauses 32 to 48, Miscellaneous Sanitary Provisions, was abandoned. Part VI.—Clauses 49 to 51, to legalise the establishment of Milk Depots in the Metropolis, was also dropped. The main objection to Part IV., which is intended to deal with tuberculous milk, is that it attacks the question at the wrong end, and seeks to deal with it at the railway station of delivery instead of at the source—the farm. Moreover, the London County Council has no power to stop the delivery of any consignment that may be under suspicion. They can take samples, but before the result of the examination can be known, the remainder of the milk will have been consumed. The Council have by this Act merely obtained power to exclude tuberculous milk from the County of London, and there is nothing to prevent the farmer selling infected milk elsewhere when excluded from the Metropolis. As originally drafted, the Bill debarred the Corporation from exercising the powers sought by the County Council in the City for the administration of this part of the Act, but when the Bill was in Committee in the Lords, the Corporation secured the addition of a Clause conferring on them or their Medical Officer similar powers within the City concurrently with the County Council or their Medical Officer. Part V. of the Bill, as drafted, gave the County Council powers to deal with unwholesome or dirty milk in a very similar way to those obtained in Part IV. with regard to tuberculous milk, but owing to the opposition of the Corporation and others, it was dropped during the progress of the Bill in Parliament. It is revived again, however, in Part II. of the General Powers Bill, introduced by the County Council this Session (1908).* Part VI. contained proposals for granting authorities power to establish depots in their districts for the sale of sterilized milk. This also was not preceeded with by the Council. Apart from the question of municipal trading, which involved competition with local tradesmen at a loss to the ratepayers, as evidenced by similar experiments in Lambeth, *On the 6th March, while this Report was in the press, the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, was read a second time in the House of Commons when, on the President of the Local Government Board giving an undertaking to bring in a general Bill dealing with tha milk supply of the whole country, an instruction was given to the Committee to strike out all the clauses in Part II. of the Bill dealing with the milk supply other than the model milk clauses. The opposition of the Corporation to this part of the Bill is thus fully justified by the action of the legislature. 75 Woolwich, and Battersea, there is no evidence that sterilization is the most effectual way to reduce infantile mortality, indeed the contrary is the generally accepted view of those who have carefully followed up the question. We know as a matter of fact that rather more than eight per cent. of the milk supplied to the City contains the bacillus of tuberculosis. Tuberculous milk is diseased milk, and is known to be potent for danger to life, as shown by the Local Government Board Report on Tuberculosis (see p. 37 of this report). It is obvious that it is far better to eliminate any risk of danger at its source, than to adopt doubtful expedients for rendering milk harmless after it has passed out of the control of the farmer. The observance of strict cleanliness in the handling of milk from the cow to the child, together with the taking of precautions to prevent the use of tubercular cows for dairy purposes, is the more rational course to adopt. The Corporation further petitioned against the sections relating to the Cleansing of Verminous Persons and their Clothing in Common LodgingHouses, which powers, it was proposed, should be exercised by the County Council Officers within the City. This petition was successfully sustained, and similar powers to those sought by the County Council have been conferred upon the Corporation within the City in which the Council's Officers will not have any authority to exercise the powers sought. There are great objections to the promotion of legislation dealing with the control of food supplies to the Metropolis and elsewhere, by patchwork legislation of the kind promoted by the London County Council, whose General Powers Bills generally contain proposals that are extensions or amendments of the Public Health Acts. The latter being a class of legislation which should more properly be promoted by the Government of the day, and be made to apply to the whole country. The control of milk supplies is especially a matter that should be under the supreme authority of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, whose business it should be to see that the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders are effectively carried out by those responsible for their administration. The need for more radical improvement in this direction is shown by the views expressed on this matter in the last published Annual Report of the Local Government Board (1906-1907), quoted on page 108 (Dairies and Milkshops) of this Report. Some further notes on this subject will be found on p. 24 (Contaminated Milk). 76 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES. Since the year 1902, when the above Act came into operation, the work of inspection has continuously increased. The Register of Workshops compiled by H.M. Factory Inspectors contained the names of 1,452 firms, and this number has since been increased to 1,927; while the Staff, which has been increased to five, is still insufficient to cope efficiently with it. The work of inspection is a laborious one, and the character of the Register continually changes from year to year owing to additions, removals, changes of name and description of the several businesses registered, and needs continuous attention to ensure a correct record being kept. It is not unusual for workshops to develop into factories, or vice versa, entailing elimination from one register and re-registration in the other. In addition to the figures before mentioned, 524 firms are now registered in the Factory Register, 837 in the Register of Kitchens of Restaurants and Tea Shops, and 103 in the Register of Workplaces (other than kitchens) where food is stored or prepared, &c. During the year 4,643 entries were made in the book recording references to the Inspectors concerned, together with letters received, &c.—16,570 names and addresses of outworkers were sent to other local authorities, and 2,643 notices were issued. This is in addition to correspondence, and abstracting necessary information from the Registers as required by the Act for the information of H.M. Factory Department, a work which absorbs much time and attention. The number of Factories, Workshops, and Workplaces at present registered is as follows :— Factories Premises. Workrooms, &c. 524 1,997 Workshops 1,927 3,143 Workplaces :— Kitchens of Restaurants, &c. 599 837 Kitchens of Tea Rooms, &c. 238 Stables 35 35 Other places 68 68 Totals 3,391 6,080 77 The following figures abstracted from the several Registers will be of interest. Of the 1,997 Factory Workrooms registered, 622 were occupied by men only, 81 by women only, and 1,294 by men and women. Of the 3,143 Workshops registered, 1,019 were occupied by men only, 517 by women only, and 1,607 by men and women. The number of workers employed was as follows :— Factories ... Men. Women. 11,870 9,761 Workshops - 6,682 10,967 Workplaces (Kitchens, &c.) 3,925 5,957 Totals - 22,477 26,685 The following is a summary of inspections made annually since the passing of the Act:— Factories. 1904—Inspections during the year - 78 1905 ,, ,, „ - 735 1906 ,, „ ,, - 1,708 1907,, ,, ,, - 2,387 4,908 Workshops. 1901 - - - - - - 745 1902 - - - - - - 481 1903 . - - - - - 547 1904 - - - - - - 1,293 1905 - - - - - - 2,025 1906 - - - - - - 3,481 1907 . . . - - - 4,087 12,659 Workplaces. 1902 - - - - - - 468 1903 - - - - - - 357 1904 - - - - - - 93 1905 - - - - - - 854 1906 - - - - - - 1,159 1907 _ - - - - - 868 3,799 FACTORIES. This year sees an increase in the number of Factories registered, no fewer than 116 firms having had their premises inspected for the first time. The defects found are similar in all respects to those found in workshops. 78 * Details of Factory Inspections, 1907.

WORKSHOP As mentioned in previous Reports, the sanitary defects generally found in workshops may be classified under the following headings :— Want of cleansing. Insufficient ventilation. Overcrowding. The lack of separate and suitable water-closet acccommodation for both sexes. Much difficulty is experienced in dealing with the subject of ventilation where the employment of gas rings and stoves, &c., is the polluting agent. In many cases the only effectual remedy is mechanical ventilation, but this is not always easy of application. Where chimney openings exist it is well to place stoves or rings within them, and this has often been done on the suggestion of your Officers. Injury to health is at times caused by defective rubber tubing allowing gas to escape in small quantities, possibly unnoticed by the workers. Both in the interests of health and for the prevention of fire, this kind of pipe connection to gas rings should not be permitted. * Details of Workshop Inspections, 1907. New workshops notified by H.M. Factory Department - 213 No Abstract of Act affixed where women and young persons were employed — cases notified to H.M.

The whole of the premises registered were visited during the year, and there is but little to add to previous Reports. There has undoubtedly been a marked improvement in Kitchens, both structurally and also in the standard of cleanliness maintained. The meat and other foods are inspected in the course of the ordinary visits of the Inspector. 81 * Details of Workplace Inspections, &c., 1907.

Four underground bakehouses were discontinued, viz. :— 15, Duke Street (pulled down). 21, Holborn. 85, Fore Street. 8, Lambeth Hill. * Established during 1903. † These have been established at least 22 years. 83 VOLUNTARY SANITARY CERTIFICATES FOR KITCHENS, &c. Up to the present only three certificates have been granted, two for kitchens and one for a bakehpuse. Although many enquiries have been made concerning the matter, they have not proceeded further owing, apparently, to the stringency of the requirements. SANITARY DEFECTS IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS NOTIFIED IN 1907 BY H.M. INSPECTOR OF FACTORIES. Where sanitary defects (which are remediable under the Public Health Act, 1891, but not under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901) are found by H.M. Factory Inspector in the course of his work, jt is his duty to notify the Local Authority of the same. During the year 21 such notifications were received, some of which referred to factories as well as workshops. The number is much below the average of the last 11 years. Some of the defects reported were of a minor character, want of icleansing, &c. The Factory Inspector was notified of defects in factories coming under the observation of the Workshop Inspectors. The sanitary defects reported at the 21 places referred to above were remedied before the end of the year. A comparison of the number of such notifications received in past years with the vear under review shows as follows :— Year. No. of Complaints received. 1897 - 34 1898 65 1899 55 1900 ....... 49 1901 - 51 1902 54 1903 66 1904 31 1905 32 1906 39 1907 21 Annual Average - 45-1 84 On investigating the reports of H.M. Factory Inspectors, defects other than those notified have been remedied where necessary. The additional defects found included :— (1) W.C's opening directly into workshops, &c. (2) Gas stoves, &c., not ventilated. (3) Defective drains. (4) Defective soil pipes. (5) Defective urinals. (6) Defective waste pipes, &c. OUTWORKERS AND "HOME" WORKERS. It is obvious that there can be but few " Home" workers in the City. The total number of Outworkers' premises registered is 197, only 49 of which can in any way be described as occupied by " Home " workers. The remainder are ordinary workshops, and appear on the Register of Workshops, The " Home " workers are visited by your Women Inspectors periodically. See page 102. In pursuance of Sections 107, 108 and 110 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, the Home Secretary on the 23rd May, 1907, issued the following Order with regard to Home Work :— " I.—Section 107 (relating to lists of outworkers) and Section 108 (relating to " employment in unwholesome premises) shall apply to the following classes of " Work :— " The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing and repairs " ing of wearing apparel; " The making, ornamenting, mending and finishing of lace and of lace curtain and nets; " Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work ; " The making of electro-plate ; " The making of files ; " Fur-pulling ; " The making of iron and steel cables and chains ; " The making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels ; " The making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gear buckles, " mullin bits, hooks and attachments of all kinds ; " The making of locks, latches and keys ; " The making or repairing of umbrellas, sunshades, parasols or parts thereof; " The making of artificial flowers; 85 " The making of nets other than wire nets; " The making of tents ; " The making or repairing of sacks ; " The covering of racquet or tennis balls; " The making of paper bags ; " The making of boxes or other receptacles or parts thereof made wholly or " partially of paper, cardboard, chip or other similar material.

The list of outworkers required to be kept by Section 107 and the copies " thereof shall be kept and made in the form and manner and with the particulars " shown in the Schedule hereto. '' 3. This Order may be referred to as the Home Work Order of the 23rd May, " 1907. " 4. The Home Work Order of the 15th August, 1905, is hereby revoked. " H. J. GLADSTONE, " One of His Majesty's Principal "Home Office, Whitehall, " Secretaries of State." " 2Srd May, 1907." The Order issued prior to the above with regard to this question was dated loth August, 1905, and that now under review differs only so far as the addition of trades which experience has proved could with advantage be added to the list. These trades are printed in italics. The principal object aimed at in the outworker Clauses of the Act is, of course, the prevention of the spread of disease, and it may be of interest to explain the system in its operation. Persons engaged in certain specified trades are required to send to the Local Authority in which their premises are situated a list of the names and addresses of all persons employed by them as outworkers. These are forwarded by the Local Authority to the Borough or District Council in whose district the outworkers reside or have their place of business ; they are then registered by them, and in the event of any case of infectious disease occurring at the premises of an outworker, the fact is forthwith communicated to the employer, who is required to cease giving out work to the outworker and receiving work from him, until such time as the local Medical Officer of Health certifies the premises, <fcc., to be free from infection. Much difficulty was at first experienced in procuring lists from employers, and it was only after printed notice was issued to each firm concerned a few days before the Lists became due that an improvement took placed. The following figures will illustrate what has occurred :— Year. Number of Lists received. Outworkers Employed in City. Outworkers Employed outside City. Total number of Outworkers. 1902 — 17 3,752 3,769 1903 — 118 2,729 2,847 1904 272 123 3,334 3,457 (Note.—1st Notice issued to all employers at end of 1904.) 1905 576 236 7,891 8,127 1906 1,112 229 14,376 14,605 1907 1,426 491 16.570 17,061 87 In spite of the fact that the printed notice has been regularly sent, it became necessary upon several occasions to issue summonses against employers for neglecting to comply with the Act. The following particulars relate to the nine firms so dealt with in 1907 :— Date of Hearing. Name. Address. Trade. Where Heard. Result. 1907. Feb. 21 H. Owen and Co. 130, Queen Victoria Street. Tailors Mansion House 10s. and 12s. £>d. costs. 55 F. E. Sparrow 6, King Street » 55 2s. costs. 55 Geo. Smith and Co. - 11, Ludgate Hill 55 Summons withdrawn.

Stuttle and Co. - 11, Gresham Street - 55- 99 10s. and 2s. costs. From a return issued by H.M. Factory Department on the " Administration by Local Authorities in 1906 of the Home-work provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901," it appears that the total number of Outworkers in the Administrative County of London for all industries coming under the Act was 28,101, and that of this number 7,886, or more than one-fourth, were notified by the Corporation. In 106 instances it was found that no list of outworkers was kept in the prescribed form at the employers' premises as required by the Act. The offenders were warned of their neglect, and in no case was it necessary to take legal proceedings. During the year a large number of notifications of infectious disease in connection with workers and outworkers have been received. In each case a special visit was made to the employer's place of business, and all necessary precautions taken to prevent a spread of the infection. The cases dealt with numbered 109, and included 89 Scarlet Fever, 7 Enteric Feverj and 13 Diphtheria. 88 WOMEN SANITARY INSPECTORS. FACTORIES. During the year 1907 all the factories in which women are employed, then on the Register, have been inspected. The following table shows the number of visits paid and of women employed:— Trade. No. of Workrooms. No. of Women employed. General. Women's. Total. Clothing and Allied Trades - 214 53 267 2,739 Furniture - 21 — 21 139 Printing, Bookbinding, &c. - 305 — 305 2,336 Tobacco - - - 87 3 90 489 Miscellaneous (Tea Packing, Silk Winding, &c.) - 16 — 16 135 Totals - - - 643 56 699 5,838 The trades in which the largest number of women are employed are : (i.) Blouse-making, with 1,480 women working in 65 workrooms, and (ii.) Printing, with 1,357 women in 210 workrooms. The defects found were as follows :— Sanitary accommodation dirty 60 „ „ defective - 42 „ „ not kept separate for sexes - 1 ,, „ insufficient - 3 General defects ..... 14 Total • 120 WORKSHOPS. The workshops inspected during the year represent 94 trades, the majority of them being places where clothing of some kind is made. The number of visits paid include 238 initial and 1,100 periodical inspections. 89 477 defects were discovered chiefly in relation to dirty walls and ceilings, and dirty or defective sanitary conveniences. Trade. No. of Workrooms. No. of Women employed. General. Women's. Total. Clothing (including Millinery, Blouses. Tailoring, Feathers, Flowers, Fur, Mantles, Underclothing, &c.) - 569 424 993 8,150 Perfumery, Brushes, Combs, Fans, &c. 9 8 17 135 Umbrellas ------ 79 9 88 424 Furnishing, &c.

(including Christmas Cards, Pencils, Cardboard Boxes, Pattern Cards) 76 16 92 592 Miscellaneous (including Druggists, Saddlery, Corks, Sponges, Tinfoil, Spice Packing) 23 12 35 242 Total - - - - 836 492 1,328 10,166 The largest number of women employed in one trade is 2,020 in the 161 Millinery workshops on the Register, next comes 1,013 in 93 Blouse workrooms, and then 786 in the Artificial Flower Trade. All these are seasonal trades, and the number of workers varies very much with the time of year. It has only been possible to inspect these workshops once during the year. 34 domestic workshops are included in the above table. A separate list of these is given on page 93. FLORISTS' WORKSHOPS. A recent decision in the High Court has placed retail florists within the provisions of Section 149 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. This case, Hoare v. Robert Green, Ltd., was an appeal from the decision of a metropolitan magistrate on a summons issued against the respondents for failing to exhibit in their workshop the prescribed abstract of the Act which is required by Section 128. The respondents carried on the business of retail florists, employing a number of young women and girls, whose duties consisted partly of serving customers in the shop and partly of making up natural flowers into wreaths, crosses and bouquets, and arranging floral decorations, for which purpose frames of wood or wire were sometimes used, in a room behind the shop. 90 It was contended on be'ialf of the respondents that in these circumstances they were not a workshop, and did not come within the provisions of Section 149 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, and the Magistrate holding that the room was not a workshop within the meaning of the Act, the case was dismissed. On the application of the Inspector a case was stated for the opinion of the High Court, which was heard before the Divisional Court on the 26th July last, when the decision of the Magistrate was reversed, the Court holding that the room was a place in which manual labour was exercised by way of trade in or incidental to the making of an article or the adapting for sale of an article, within Section 149 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, and that the room was therefore a workshop within the Act. There are sixteen of these places in the City, all of which have been inspected and registered as workshops. A few defects, including in some instances want of proper sanitary accommodation, were found to exist, but all are now being remedied. WORKPLACES (KITCHENS). The result of the inspection of basement kitchens is to show the entire unsuitability of most of these places for the purpose. The difficulty of efficiently ventilating underground rooms of any kind is very great, and it is obvious that this difficulty is much increased when to the ordinary vitiation of the air by breathing, are added the fumes from gas stoves and the steam generated in cooking. The most elaborate arrangement of air shafts and fans will scarcely avail to render the atmosphere fit to breathe, to say nothing of the unhealthy effect it is likely to have on the food cooked and stored in it. It has been found that in many basement kitchens a much greater amount of cooking is being done than was formerly the case, and Consequently that the number of gas stoves has increased in proportion, while no additional means of ventilation nor methods of carrying off the fumes from the stoves has been provided. In the 188 kitchens inspected during the year, no fewer than 132 defects have been found : 52 kitchens were badly ventilated ; 34 required cleansing ; in 31 cases the sanitary accommodation was dirty or defective ; and there were besides, 15 general defects. The number of women employed in these kitchens is 2,664. 91 The London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1908, includes a clause dealing with the contamination of food in any premises in which " any " article, whether solid or liquid, intended or adapted for the food of man, is " sold or exposed for sale or deposited for the purpose of sale or of preparation " for sale or with a view to future sale." Clause 21 of this Bill provides that:— (a) " No urinal, water closet, earth closet, privy, ashpit, or other like sanitary convenience shall be within, or directly communicate with, such room or place ; (b) " No cistern for supplying water to such room or place shall be in direct communication with, and directly discharge into, any such sanitary convenience ; (c) " ISlo drain or pipe for carrying oft' fcecal or sewage matter shall have any inlet or opening within such room or place ; (d) " No such room or place shall be used as a sleeping place, and so far as may be reasonably necessary, to prevent risk of infection or contamination of any such article, no sleeping place shall adjoin and communicate directly with such room or place ; (e) " Refuse or filth, whether solid or liquid, shall not be deposited or allowed to accumulate in any such room or place ; (/) "No act or thing shall be done or permitted in any such room or place likely to expose any such article to infection or contamination." FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1907. This Act was presented by Earl Beauchamp in the House of Lords on the 2nd May last, and after being amended in the House of Commons, was passed in both Houses and received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. The main object of the Act is :— To extend the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, to laundries carried on by way of trade or for purposes of gain, or carried on as ancillary to another business, or incidentally to the purposes of any public institution, and To regulate hours of employment in laundries ancillary to a business carried on in any premises which, apart from the provisions of this Act, are a factory or workshop. 92 The principle of extending legislation to institutional laundries has already been fully reported on in the Annual Reports, 1905 and 1906. As regards other laundries, the new Act does not make many changes in the duties imposed on local authorities. Hotel laundries are for the first time definitely included in the list of premises coming within the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Acts*, and laundries " in which not more than two persons dwelling elsewhere are employed " are no longer exempt. There is likely to be some confusion caused by the provisions of section 3 of the new Act, which refer to " workshop" laundries. Sub-section (6) requires " in every laundry, all stoves for heating irons to be sufficiently " separated from any ironing room or ironing table, and gas irons emitting " any noxious fumes are not to be used " ; and (c) " the floors to be kept in " good condition and drained in such a manner as will allow the water to flow " off freely." A laundry in which there is a contravention of any of these provisions shall be deemed to be a factory or workshop not kept in conformity with the principal Act. This places the duty of carrying out these provisions in the hands of H.M. Inspectors, regardless of the fact that under sections 7 and 8 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (which have not been repealed) contraventions of the provisions with regard to ventilation and drainage of floors in workshops are to be deemed to be nuisances liable to be dealt with summarily under the law relating to public health. And by section 1 of the new Act, laundries in which no mechanical power is used, are scheduled as workshops. There are consequently now two authorities responsible for the carrying out of these provisions. INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN INSPECTORS IN YIDDISH. During the year, with the approval of the Court, the two Women Inspectors (Miss Safford and Miss Pole) have attended classes for instruction in Yiddish, and the knowledge thus acquired has been found most useful in carrying out their duties among the foreign Jews dwelling in the neighbourhood of Houndsditch. * In a case taken under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (Caledonian Railway Company v. Paterson, 1898, 1 F. (J. C.) 24), it was held that a laundry attached to a hotel was not carried on by way of trade or for purposes of gain when the following kinds of work were done in the laundry : (a) washing the hotel linen, (£>) washing the clothes of the hotel servants without charge as part of their remuneration, and (c) washing the clotheB of visitors to the hotel at high charges. 93 DOMESTIC WORKSHOPS, 1907.

These names represent 197 outworkers, 47 of whom had been notified in previous years and were already on the register, the remaining 150 were newly notified as outworkers, though the majority of them were already on the Workshop Register. In addition to the actual outworkers, the numbers notified include 11 contractors and 5 persons to whom work was given out, but whose trades were not on the schedule ; these were printers, engravers, and makers of leather goods. 208 names have been taken off the Register owing to the workers having moved or given up work, or to wrong notification, the premises having been found on inspection to be warehouses. There are also several cases of an outworker being notified under several names by different employers. In view of the fact that that part of the Home Office Return which deals with outworkers is headed " Home Work," it is necessary to point out that the number of outworkers carrying on work in their own homes is only 49, 15 being occupiers of workshops, 25 of domestic workshops, and 9 being occasional workers, i.e., those whose " labour is exercised at irregular intervals " and does not furnish the whole or principal means of living to the family," and who are consequently exempt from the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act. There has been no occasion to take action under section 108 or sections 109 and 110 in Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, with regard to any outworker's premises during the past year. ♦ The following Table shows the number of places in the City where work is carried on by " outworkers." 95 Return showing the number of places in the City where work in carried on by " outworkers " Factories.

Many complaints have been received as to the absence of separate sanitary accommodation for women employed as clerks in offices ; in some cases the want has been discovered in the course of inspection. In 34 cases the owners of the premises, upon the matter being brought to their notice, have provided the necessary conveniences and wash-basins. In only two cases was it found necessary to serve Statutory Notices. Representations have also been made as to the dirty or defective state of the sanitary accommodation and the want of ventilation in the same. These defects have all been remedied. In most cases the work required was of a structural nature, and this has been carried out under the direction of the District Inspectors. LADIES' WAITING ROOMS AT RAILWAY STATIONS. One hundred and twelve inspections have been made of the ladies' waiting rooms at the railway stations in the City, and the defects found, which have all been of a minor nature, have been remedied. The 27 ladies' waiting rooms are distributed among the 22 railway stations as follows :— 4 ladies' rooms at Liverpool Street Station. 3 „ „ „ Fenchurch Street. 2 „ „ „ Cannon Street (S.E.&C.R.). 2 „ „ „ Holborn Viaduct; and 1 ladies' room at each of the following :— Aldersgate. Cannon Street (District). Moorgate (C.&S.L.R.). Aldgate. Moorgate (Metropolitan Moorgate (C.&G.N.R.). Bank (C.L.R.). Railway). Post Office. Bank (C.&S.L.R.). Ludgate Hill. St. Paul's. Bishopsgate Street. Mark Lane. Snow Hill. Broad Street. Monument. The Ladies' Waiting Room at Blackfriars has been closed, but this station being connected by a passage with St. Paul's Station, passengers have access to the Ladies' Waiting Room there. At Moorgate (Metropolitan) Station one of the two Ladies' Waiting Rooms has been closed. There is now no Ladies' Room at Mansion House Station. The improvement, previously mentioned, in the sanitary condition of these waiting rooms has been maintained. 97 UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES FOR WOMEN. The usual inspections of underground conveniences have been carried out. There are at present 13 of these conveniences for women in the City, situated at:— Aldersgate Street (North). Aldersgate Street (General Post Office). Aldgate. Bishopsgate Street Without. Circus Place (Finsbury Circus). Farringdon Street (North). Farringdon Street (South), Ludgate Circus. Golden Lane. Guildhall Buildings. Holborn. Minories. Upper Thames Street (near London Bridge). West Smithfield. Two of these have been opened during the year, viz., one at Aldgate High Street, and one at Bishopsgate Street Without. Any defects found have been reported to the Engineer. FEEDING OF INFANTS. During the year 1907, 268 births were registered, 39 of which took place in public institutions, the parents being non-resident in the City. These cases have been notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which they belong. In all cases where the notification of a birth is received and the parents reside in the City, the home is visited and the mother advised as to the care and feeding of the infant. Special attention is paid to the sanitary condition of the house, and notes taken as to the number of rooms occupied by the family, the number of persons living and sleeping in those rooms, whether the child sleeps with the parent or in a cot, and whether the mother goes out to work. Any sanitary defects found are handed over to the District Inspector to be dealt with. During the year 39 defects have been discovered, chiefly relating to defective sanitary arrangements, dirty walls and ceilings (in several cases verminous), and overcrowding. The total number of visits paid during the year was 657. 98 At the age of six months the infants are re-visited, and again at the age of twelve months, so as to obtain full particulars as to the methods of feeding during the first year of the child's life. The following Tables will show the percentage of infants fed on the breast, cow's milk, proprietary foods, &c. :— Method of Feeding for First Six Months. Per cent. Breast-fed entirely 68-0 Do. and Cow's Milk ... 11-8 Do. and Condensed Milk 3-3 Do. and Proprietary Foods ... 3-3 Do. and other Foods ... 0-9 Cow's Milk entirely ... 5-2 Do. and Condensed .». 0-9 Do. and other Foods... ... ... 2-9 Do. and Proprietary Foods ... 2-3 Condensed Milk entirely 1*4 Total ... 100-0 Method of Feeding for Twelve Months.

These complaints were referred to the Milk Shop Inspector to be dealt with. The number of deaths of infants under twelve months registered during the year was 24. Details of these deaths are given in the Table on page 17. The following particulars were obtained as regards the feeding of the infants :— Seven were breast-fed entirely. One was fed on the breast and Nestle's Milk. Nine were having cow's milk either entirely or supplemented by the breast, Nestle's or other food. Three infants died within three days of birth. In four cases satisfactory particulars could not be obtained, the mothers having either returned to work or removed from the address given. It should be borne in mind, in considering this question of infant feeding, that a large number of children die every year from marasmus and debility, and that the cause of this mortality may frequently be traced to the deficient quality of the milk secreted by the mother. When there is poverty in the home, it is the mother and baby who suffer most, .as the husband and other children must be fed, so the woman herself goes without. Further, she is not only often underfed before the baby is born, but also all the time she is suckling it, consequently her milk becomes poor and unsatisfying, the infant fails to thrive, and gradually dies from malnutrition for lack of nature's food. In such cases, if only help in the way of providing good milk and other nourishment could be extended to the mother both before and after confinement, it would often be the means of ensuring greater health and strength for these little ones, and in many cases saving the life of a child. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907. On the 23rd April, 1907, an Act, known as the Notification of Births Act, 1907, was brought in by Lord Robert Cecil, and received the Royal Assent on the 28th August, 1907. The object of this Act is to ensure early notification of births to the Medical Officer of Health, so that advice may be given to the mother in regard to the rearing and nurture of the child. % The Act may be adopted by any Local Authority in the United Kingdom. 100 Section 3 of the Act enables the Board by Order to declare the Act to be in force in the area of any Local Authority which has not so adopted, if they think this expedient, having regard to the circumstance of the area, and in that case the order of the Board will have the same effect for the purpose as a resolution of adoption duly passed by the Local Authority of the area, and assented to by the Board. By section 2, sub-section 3, it shall be the duty of any Local Authority by whom this Act may be adopted as soon as the consent of the Local Government Board is given to the resolution of adoption, to bring the provision of this Act to the attention of all Medical Practitioners and Midwives practising in their area. In the case of every child born within an area in which the Act is in force, it will be the duty of the father of the child, if he is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of its occurrence, and of any person in attendance upon the mother at the time of or within six hours of the birth, to give notice in writing of the birth to the Medical Officer of Health of the District in which the child is born. The Act provides for the registi'ation of still births. This is a most important point, as hitherto there has been no means of obtaining any record of these. The notice is to be given by posting a prepaid letter or post card addressed to the Medical Officer of Health giving the necessary information of the birth within 36 hours after the birth, or by delivering a written notice of the birth at the office of the Medical Officer within the same time. The Local Authority are required to supply, without charge, addressed stamped post cards containing forms of notice to any Medical Practitioner or Midwife residing or practising in the area who applies for them. A person who fails to give the requisite notice of a birth will be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding 20s., unless he satisfies the. Court that he had reasonable grounds to believe that notice had been duly given by some other person. The notification is to be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the requirements of any Act relating to the registration of birth. In London, the Medical Officer of Health of the City and of every Metropolitan Borough in which the Act is in force for the time being must send weekly to the London County Council, in a form prescribed by the Board, a list of all notices received by him under the Act during the past week. The Local Government Board consented to the adoption of this Act within the City of London, and fixed the 19th February, 1908, as the date for the Act to come into operation. 101 INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT OF WOMEN. On 6th November last, a Conference was held at the Home Office to consider the question of further regulation of Industrial Employment of Women before and after child-birth. At the present time no woman is allowed to be employed in a factory or workshop within four weeks after she has given birth to a child. The Conference on Infantile Mortality advocated :— (1) The extension of this period from one month to three ; and (2) The prohibition of the employment of women advanced in pregnancy, unless medically certified to be fit for work. Before introducing such legislation the Home Secretary is anxious to be sure of his ground and to be satisfied that there is sufficient justification for imposing further restriction. He has, therefore, asked the Sanitary Authorities throughout the country to undertake an exhaustive enquiry into the whole subject, and to furnish returns which could be summarised and considered by the Home Office. The Sanitary Committee has agreed to make the proposed investigation, which is to extend over a period of two years. A supply of forms of enquiry have been received from the Home Office dealing with the questions of :— (1) Precise occupation of mothers during pregnancy. (2) How long ceased from work before birth of child. (3) How soon employed after confinement. (4) If the work carried on was in a factory, workshop, at home, or elsewhere. (5) Nature of the work—(1) laborious, or (2) light. (6) Feeding of the child. (7) Weekly earnings of the husband. (8) Income of family. And several other minor details. These forms when filled up with the necessary particulars are returned to the Home Office. The earlier notification of births will greatly facilitate this enquiry, as immediate information will now reach the Medical Officer of Health, and the information will extend to still-births as well as live births. 102 HOME WORK. A Select Committee of the House of Commons was appointed in May, 1907, " to consider and report upon the conditions of labour in trades in which " Home Work is prevalent, and the proposals, including those for the "establishment of Wages Boards, and the licensing of Work-places, which " have been made for the remedying of existing abuses." Your Worshipful Committee on 24th June, 1907, authorised Miss Safford (your senior Woman Inspector) to give evidence before the Select Committee. Miss Safford appeared before the Committee on the 25th July, and the following is an outline of the evidence she gave. CITY OF LONDON (1906). Outworkers' Lists.—The number of lists received from Employers during 1906 was 1,112, giving a total of 14,573 names of outworkers. Of these, 14,376 names were forwarded to other local authorities, leaving 197 as resident in the City. To these must be added 32 notified to the City by the local authorities. Of the 229 names received, 142 were notified by 1 employer, 47 by 2, 18 by 3, 8 by 4, 9 by 5, 2 by 6, 2 by 7, 1 by 11. Procedure as to Lists.—In January and July, notices were sent to all firms known to give outwork. In 1906, the 351 firms who neglected to send in a list by February and August 1st, received a cautionary letter from the City Solicitor. One firm failing to comply was summoned and fined. Outworkers working in the City.—Only 27*9 per cent, are Home Workers. Figures for 1906 show that of 229 Outworkers, 6 are Contractors, 5 are Factories, 154 are Workshops in premises other than Dwelling-houses 24 are Workshops in Dwelling-houses, 30 are Domestic Workshops, 10 Dwelling-houses in which work is taken in occasionally. The actual number of Home Workers is 64. In 31 cases the work is done in rooms used only for work. In 20 cases the work is done in the living room. In 13 cases the work is done in living and sleeping room. In the last class, 6 are rooms with only one occupant ; in two cases the occupants are a woman and an aged relative whom she is helping to support. 103 In one, the occupants are an old man and wife. In one, a woman living alone and employing a young girl, the remaining three are occupied by families where the mother was taking in work to supplement the father's wages. These three were all occasional workers. One room was overcrowded.

These premises are subject to constant inspection, and are under stringent bye-laws. Speaking generally, Home Workers' premises are more cleanly than the Workshops of Outworkers who rent a room in premises, each room of which is let separately as a workshop. It is in these latter that overcrowding and dirty conditions are mostly found. Existing legislation is sufficient to deal with insanitary conditions, but power is required to compel the Outworker to disclose the name of his employer. 104 Powers and Duties as to Home Workers.

A further Memorandum, on the Home Work Provisions of the Factory Act, was issued to all District 108 DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS ORDERS, 1885, 1886 and 1899. Under these Orders every Local Authority is required to keep a Register of every purveyor of milk, dairyman, or cowkeeper in its district, to supervise the milk trade, and to carry out certain general regulations prescribed in the several Orders. Under these now in force the Local Authorities are bound to register any purveyor of milk no matter how unsuitable the premises may be where the milk is sold. The London County Council have deposited a General Powers Bill in which power is sought inter alia :— " To enable the Sanitary Authorities in London to refuse to register, " or to remove from the Register, Cowkeepers, Dairymen or Purveyors " of milk, whose premises are unsuitable for the sale of milk thereon." I have already reported at length to the Sanitary Committee on the 23rd April, 1907, upon a similar suggestion of the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn, and expressed therein the opinion that it appeared that there was nothing to prevent the Local Government Board making Orders prescribing, as a precautionary measure, that milk should not be sold on unsuitable premises, and this would, as a consequence, prohibit the registration of such places. Should this view be correct, any further statutory powers in this direction are unnecessary. As the whole question of regulation of food supplies throughout the country is now engaging the attention of the Local Government Board, it is very desirable that any additional powers for control of milk supplies should be placed in the hands of all Local Authorities, and further, that steps should be taken to ensure that they are strictly enforced everywhere. Nothing could be more unsatisfactory than the present manner in which many Authorities neglect their duties in this respect, as will be seen by some observations in this Report on " Contamination of Milk," pp. 24-30. This view of the matter is also supported by the last published Annual Report of the Local Government Board (1906-1907), as will be seen from the following extract:— " It is evident that many Local Authorities, especially Rural District " Councils, carry out the duties imposed upon them by the Dairies " Orders very imperfectly, and that even in districts where milk is " produced in large quantities and sent away by rail, insufficient attention " is paid to the cattle and their surroundings and to the sanitary " condition of the cowsheds. Only a few Rural District Councils " appear to attempt any system of Veterinary examination of cattle." 109 There are no cowsheds in the City of London. At the end of the year, 606 purveyors of milk were on the Register, as ■compared with 581 in the previous year, being an increase of 25. In the course of the year the sale of milk was discontinued at 30 premises and the owners' names removed from the Register. 55 new premises were added, and 34 changes of ownership, necessitating re-registrations, occurred. These premises are regularly and systematically inspected, special care being taken to ensure that milk receptacles are kept covered, and that the milk vessels used are kept in a cleanly condition. In the course of the year 55 cases were reported of neglect to keep pans used for the storage of milk covered in accordance with No. 17 of the City Regulations as to Milk Stores and Milk Shops. In each case the offender was cautioned. An early morning visit to some premises kept by an Italian resulted in finding him serving milk from a dirty receptacle. The man was warned, and the milk destroyed. Two cases of Infectious Disease (both Scarlet Fever) occurred on registered premises in the course of the year, and in each instance the patient was removed to hospital, and the necessary cleansing and disinfection carried out before allowing any distribution of milk from the premises. ICE CREAMS. Under the provisions of the Ice Cream, Section Nos. 42, 43 and 44 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1902, which became operative on 1st November, 1903, any person engaged in the manufacture, sale or storage of ice cream, or any such commodity, who does any act or thing likely to expose such commodity to infection or contamination, or omits to take any proper precaution for the due protection of such commodity from infection or contamination, shall be liable for every such offence, on conviction, to a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. He is also liable to a similar penalty if he omits to notify the outbreak of any infectious disease amongst persons employed by him in the sale, manufacture or storage of such commodity. An itinerant vendor of ice cream, &c., must exhibit a notice on his barrow stating the name and address of the person from whom he obtains such articles, failing which, he also incurs a penalty not exceeding forty shillings. In 1907 there were 207 premises in the City where ice creams were sold, as compared with 233 in 1906, and 249 in 1905. 110 These are classified as under, the corresponding figures for 1906 being given in italics :— Places where Sold in City. Place of In the City. Manufacture. In other Districts.

There was a slight increase of the number of itinerant ice cream vendors in the City last year, 40 being noted, as compared with 32 in 1906. No case was reported of a barrow being found not bearing the name and address of the manufacturers of the article sold. This was doubtless due to the prosecution, in 1906, of eight itinerant vendors, who failed to exhibit such notice as required by the Act. It was found that in every case the ice creams sold by itinerant merchants were made outside the City. During 1907 there were 57 places in the City where ice creams were manufactured, against 73 in 1906, the owners of the remaining 150 premises in the City dealing in this article obtaining it from manufacturers in other districts. Upon making enquiries of authorities outside the City with regard to the latter, it was reported that in six cases sanitary improvements were required, and in each instance the sale of ice cream from the places in question was prohibited until the necessary sanitary improvements had been carried out. All ice cream manufactured in the City was prepared under satisfactory conditions, with one exception, where it was made at a small tenement house that was quite unfit for the purpose ; upon being served with a notice to discontinue the manufacture of ice cream on the premises, the owner at once transferred his business to Stepney. Ill POISONOUS NUTS. An unusual case of poisoning occurred last summer, when on the 4th of August I received notice from the Police that several children at Guy's Hospital were being treated there for symptoms of irritant poisoning, caused by eating nuts sold by a costermonger in Peckham. The Hospital Authorities communicated with the Metropolitan Police, who, in turn, notified the City Police by telegram, as under :— " Several persons have been treated at Guy's Hospital and elsewhere " for vegetable poisoning, the result of eating Kaloo Nuts sold by " Mr. B., Duke's Place, Aldgate, to E. T., Blue Anchor Lane, Peckham. " 3rd inst." Upon receipt of this message, I visited the City and traced the bulk of the nuts to the premises of a cocoanut and general fruit merchant in Mitre Square, Aldgate, and obtained the surrender of the remainder of the consignment. On the following day, viz., Monday, 5th August (Bank Holiday), these nuts were taken before Alderman Sir John Ritchie at the Mansion House, who condemned the same as unfit for human food, and made an order for their destruction. It appears that they were a consignment of 16 cwt., of a kind unknown to the dealer, who had purchased them from a ship's captain who had brought them to this country as a speculation. There was said to be nothing exceptional in this transaction, as the dealer stated he was in the habit of encouraging ships' captains to furnish him with novelties of this kind. Fortunately the Peckham costermonger was the City dealer's first and only customer. This man bought two cwt., which he hawked in Southwark, with the result that five children, who ate some, had to be taken to Guy's Hospital. In addition to these, eight other children, belonging to five families living in Peckham, suffered from similar symptoms of irritant poisoning. In these cases, some boys from houses adjoining that where the nuts were stored had climbed a fence and stolen some of the nuts, which they subsequently distributed amongst their acquaintances. Dr. Newton Palmer, House Physician in Guy's Hospital, has kindly furnished me with the following notes on the cases seen by him : — " I was called to four of the five cases which came up, all presenting similar " features, their ages varying from two to seven years. The worst case (which " was admitted) was a child of two years eight months, suffering like the rest from " an acute gastritis. At 12 mid-day she had eaten some of these nuts, commenced " vomiting at ] p.m., and continued till after admission at 3 p.m. She was in a " collapsed condition, temp. 94'6, pulse 120, resp. 26, with sunken eyes and 112 "greyish face, the usual expression of an infant with acute vomiting. When "saw the child she was vomiting at fairly frequent intervals, apparently without "pain, watery bile-tinged fluid. There was no diarrhoea. After treatment she "rapidly recovered. The other children did not appear again at the surgery, "though told to do so, whence I infer that they rapidly improved." The Medical Officer of Health for Camberwell states that the symptoms in those attacked by illness in his district varied from severe pains in the stomach, diarrhoea, sickness and headache to a slight amount of indisposition. As there appears to have been some doubt as to the species of nut in question, it may be interesting to quote from the following report kindly sent by the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, to whom specimens had been submitted:— "The seeds received for identification are those of a species of Aleurites, probably "Aleurites Fordii, a native of China. The seeds of Aleurites Fordii are believed "to be the chief source of Chinese Wood Oil, and to possess poisonous properties. "The tree is closely allied to the Aleurites Triloba, a native of Malay and Polynesia, "the seeds of which are known as 'Indian Walnut' or 'Candle Nut,' and said to "contain 50 per cent, of oil used as food and for burning. "Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, "August 6th, 1907." A sample was also sent to your Public Analyst for chemical examination, who reported thereon as follows:— "These nuts yield an oil agreeing in properties with Chinese Wood Oil obtained "from Aleurites Candata. It has the reputation of possessing poisonous properties. "17 th September, 1907." In No. 4, 1906, of the "Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information," published by the authorities at Kew Gardens, it is stated:— "With regard to the use of T'ung Oil in Europe and America, it is known that "it is employed to a considerable extent in one or two industries, and is also being "experimented with in others, but much secrecy is maintained with regard to the "matter. So far as can be gathered, it is employed in linoleum factories, as a "substitute for linseed in some industries, and is also believed to form the basis of "a varnish to compete with that produced from copal. It may be noted that this "oil has poisonous properties ; the refuse cake is employed as manure in China." The nuts of Aleurites Fordii have also been the subject of enquiry by the authorities of the Imperial Institute. The following notes are extracted from the Bulletin of the Imperial Institute, Vol. v., No. 2, 1907:— "Examination of the oil.—On extraction with light petroleum, the kernels were "found to contain 58.3 per cent, of oil, which is equivalent to a yield of 36.4 per "cent, from the entire nuts. "The oil was light in colour, and, on exposure to air in a thin layer, dried in a "day at the ordinary temperature, giving a varnish-like residue. On heating in a " water oven at 100 deg. C. the oil dried and formed a resin-like solid. 113 "The 'constants' of the oil were determined and found to agree well with those "recorded for commercial samples of T'ung Oil, as shown by the following table:— Oil from seeds of Aleurites Fordii. Commercial Tung Oil. "Specific gravity at 15 deg. C. 0.9404 0.9360 Milligrams of potassium hydroxide required per gram of oil. "Acid value 2.89 — "Saponification value - 191.8 152.211 "Iodine value 166.7 149-165.7 per cent. "Hehner value 94.6 96.0-96.6 „ „ "Titer test 42.42.5 deg. C. 37.1-37.2 deg. C. "The examination has shown that the oil extracted from these seeds of Aleurites "Fordii is similar in composition to the T'ung oil of commerce. It is, however, "lighter in colour, and produces a lighter coloured varnish on drying, so that it is "probably a purer product. It is noteworthy also that it has a higher titer test "than commercial T'ung Oil." It was fortunate that no fatal case occurred amongst the children who had eaten these nuts. But for the prompt action of the Police in getting into communication with the City Authorities, and thus enabling me to secure the remainder of the consignment, there is every probability, as the following day was a Bank Holiday, similar cases of poisoning would have occurred on a larger scale. The Sanitary Committee, recognising the intelligence and valuable assistance given by the Police, directed that they be thanked through the Commissioner for the services rendered to the public health on this occasion. In view of the fact that the vendor of these nuts had offered them for sale in entire ignorance of their dangerous character, no legal proceedings were taken against him, but the Committee marked their sense of the impropriety of his having sold them solely on the strength of the word of a stranger that they were of an edible variety, by cautioning him to exercise greater care in this direction in the future. The Southwark Authorities subsequently took action against him for selling nuts, which were unwholesome and unfit for food, to the costermonger, and against the latter for exposing them for sale, the dealer being fined £5 and £2 2s. costs. The summons against the costermonger was withdrawn. 114 * MEAT SUPPLIES AT THE CENTRAL MEAT MARKET. Although deliveries of meat to the Central Market do not quite reach the record of 1906, they still show a weight some 1,500 tons in excess of any previous year, and although the falling off in the quantity actually condemned as unfit for human food is satisfactory as showing some improvement in methods of transit, yet it could hardly be contended that the quality of meat on which the population of London lives, is not making retrograde movements year by year. Why this should be, the reasons for it, and the prospect for the future, are subjects which may well form matter for consideration in this year's report, in the hope that, from our experience in the past, may be gathered wisdom which shall guide us in the future. The supply to the Central Market comprises:— (а) English Town killed. (b) British Country killed, including Scotch. (c) Foreign killed (i.e. Continental, &c.) (d) American Home killed. (e) American and Argentine refrigerated. (f) Australian, New Zealand, and Argentine frozen. (a).— Taking them in this order, the town-killed meat consists of beef from the Metropolitan Cattle Market, Islington, pigs consigned to the slaughtermen there, and when killed sent to Smithfield to be sold, sheep and lambs purchased by carcase butchers, and after slaughter, marketed here. The British cattle trade has been in an unsatisfactory condition throughout the year, the cold season has not conduced to the fattening of the animals, and the placing of large army contracts in the hands of the Americans has been productive of results far from encouraging. The Corporation has re-modelled the methods of slaughtering at the Metropolitan Cattle Market, and it is hoped it will attract the productions of some of the better class graziers, and as the United States has sent us some 50,000 fewer bullocks this year than last, there may yet be a future for the English beef trade. The pigs in this category have been throughout of satisfactory quality, though cases of tuberculosis are still distressingly numerous amongst them. The sheep also have been of good quality, very free from disease, and have almost invariably realised satisfactory prices, indeed, mutton has throughout the year been the bright spot of the Home trade. For the remarks on pp. 114-117 I am indebted to Mr. G. P. Terrett, Chief Inspector of Slaughterhouses and Meat. 115 (b).—Country-killed meat has been generally of first class quality. Scotch beef maintains its pre-eminence as being the very best article of the kind in the market, and the mutton from the Lothians and border districts has left nothing to be desired. Scarcely, if at all inferior, are the productions of the West Country breeders, while splendid carcases of the Suffolk Down breed from their own and adjacent counties have, from time to time, excited universal admiration. Lincolnshire and other counties have also sent us some excellent mutton, though it must be remembered that there is a largelv increased local consumption, and that here the meat is in competition with that produced all over the world, this and the habit importers have of swamping the market create an element of risk which does not attract to London. (c).—There has been a certain amount of poultry, game, and other small goods from France, Russia, and Italy, but except these, nearly all the supply under this head came from Holland, Denmark, and Belgium. Dutch mutton has mostly been good, and the pork, so far as it was inspected and labelled, excellent, but a large quantity not labelled, of which the quality and soundness was just, as it happened, has also been sent, and it is greatly to be regretted that there should be any delay in enforcing the law as to the compulsoryinspection of all carcases for export to this country. There has been rather less of mutton, while the supply of Dutch pork has at no time been excessive, and the prices have ruled somewhat high, probably the high price of meat in Germany has something to do with this, and also the fact that so little meat of any kind has come from Denmark. The imports from Belgium are limited to pork and rabbits, of the former there is a certain method of inspection wholly unreliable, and not carried out in accordance with the standard laid down in the recommendation of the Royal Commission, while the latter for the most part reach the consumers without coming into the City. (d).—We now come to a very important branch of this subject, viz., cattle imported alive and slaughtered at Deptford, Birkenhead and elsewhere, the two places named furnishing almost the entire supply of this article for London. A few years ago these were great gaunt animals of any age, "which means certainly aged," now they are chiefly neat, symmetrical bullocks of 2, 3, or at most 4 years old, carefully brought over and landed with an immunity from bruises which is nothing short of remarkable, after having been sufficiently rested from the voyage to fit them for slaughter, they dress into neat bright carcases of beef greatly resembling the best Scotch, and well calculated if it were so desired, to deceive buyers into the belief that they were getting that article; the illusion would, however, probably breakdown under the knife and fork test. It scarcely needs demonstration that cattle prepared with so much skill and cost must realise a fairly high price for the trade in them to be remunerative, the shortage of 90,000 bullocks is probably the effect of (a) greater requirements to feed the ever increasing population of the United States, (b) the low 116 prices ruling here as a consequence of the abundance of low priced refrigerated beef from Argentina, and (c) the badness of the season in Canada, "which caused the imports therefrom to be few in number and indifferent in quality, as compared with previous years. Of sheep imported alive, the number was small, while the quality left much to be desired ; in this connection, when it is considered that Argentine sheep are regularly shipped to Antwerp, slaughtered there, and then carcases, skins, fat, &c., sent on here, one cannot help wondering what is saved by the process ; the splendid sheep market at Deptford, probably the best in the kingdom, stands nearly idle, there they would come under the supervision of the officers of the Corporation, and would be prepared by British labour for consumption by the British public. (e).—Beef is brought in refrigerating chambers (a) from the United States, chiefly Chicago, (b) from Argentina. The first has been coming to this country for more than 30 years, and has got to be looked upon as quite a standard article on the British Market ; it is for the most part excellent beef, the length of time it has passed in the cold chamber has been just enough to make it ready for cooking; it has, for the last two years or so, had to face a very keen competition from the Argentine article, and some of the importers have made the mistake of thinking that competition was a question only of price, they have therefore shipped an inferior article for which they were prepared to take a low price, and so have, to some extent, sacrificed the reputation of their own meat; others have continued to send the best they could get, and now find themselves standing on a different level. The condition of this beef has been almost invariably good throughout the year, and the quality furnishes little room for comment beyond the remark made above. Argentine refrigerated beef is the object to which all eyes are turned, because probably the development of this trade contains the secret of the beef supply of England for many years to come. Taken generally, the meat has been more carefully handled, and the arrival of supplies better timed, than previously, but much of it has been poorly selected, badly prepared for slaughter, and not well handled on its arrival here ; this last is owing to the fact that most of the importers being people who have been engaged in the frozen meat trade, have taken for granted that like it, refrigerated meat could be dallied with indefinitely, whereas the three weeks or so occupied on the journey is about the utmost it will stand, and it should, on its arrival here, be brought into consumption as quickly as possible. However, one of the largest works has just passed into the hands of a Chicago firm, and however undesirable that may be from a British point of view, there is no doubt it will lead to the meat being more rapidly placed in the hands of the consumer. Another matter which may possibly have a bearing on this branch of the trade is the introduction of the Linley system of preserving beef in sterilized air. The s.s. "Guardiana" was specially fitted up for this system, and landed her beef here in excellent condition. It would be unsafe to generalise 117 from one shipment, but so far as we have seen, the merit appears to be in the immunity from prejudicial change after leaving the refrigerator, thus differing entirely from ordinary refrigerated beef, which, in this humid climate, deteriorates with great rapidity. Further shipments will show whether there is any real advantage in this system. (f).—Importers of frozen meat from New Zealand and Australia have also had very keen competition from the various companies bringing frozen meat from Argentina. There has been an increased supply of sheep from Australia. Most of the carcases have been good useful mutton, but a great many were fat and wasteful, while some of the lambs and young sheep were very imperfectly made up, and thawed out wet, so that it would be easy to mistake them for dropsical ones. There has also been an abundant supply of sheep and lambs from New Zealand, but although these still retain their superiority to any other frozen produce, they are not as good as formerly. No doubt they have to be sought for further afield, but whatever the reason may be, we miss the symmetry and fullness of flesh of the old Canterbury, for which the North Island and others, which have been sent to make good the deficiency, are inadequate substitutes. Meanwhile the breeders in Argentina are finding some results from the use of the splendid rams they have purchased in Shropshire and elsewhere in this country, and have been sending us a class of mutton which is improving year by year, and bids fair in a short time seriously to challenge the claim of New Zealand to the premier position. Of frozen beef, New Zealand and Australia have both sent us considerably more than previous years, having in that way contributed to make good the shortage of American live cattle. The New Zealand beef has been good, and they appear now to have learned the lesson of careful preparation for slaughter, as there has been very little loss from "bone taint." The quantity of frozen Argentine beef has been about on a level with previous years. It may here be remarked that this branch of the trade is getting very largely into the hands of the Americans and a few others, whose arrangements for distributing meat of this kind are widespread in character; hence the business is done more largely than ever from dock stores and other depots of a similar description, ignoring Smithfield even for many of the larger London buyers, thus emphasising the necessity for a closer and more rigorous inspection of those stores containing as they do almost unlimited means of concealing anything which the proprietors may wish to screen from observation; they are for the most part in the hands of people who would not lend themselves to any improper proceeding of this kind, but that does not in any measure relieve a public body of its duty to keep them under observation. The other food imported in a frozen state consists of American pigs, pork loins and cuttings, boned quarters of beef, sheeps' and pigs' plucks, kidneys, and the bye-products of slaughtering, as to which there is nothing to add to the comments of last year. Their method of sending boneless chucks 118 and scrap meat has been adopted by Argentine, New Zealand and other shippers. The whole subject is now being dealt with by the Local Government Board, and the objections to its importation are fully discussed on pp. 125-132. Three Assistant Inspectors have been added to the staff during the year. The following naval officers have received instruction in the examination of meat, viz.:—The Assistant Director of Victualling, Whitehall ; seven Fleet Paymasters; nine Staff Paymasters; ten Paymasters ; one Assistant Paymaster, and a Fleet Paymaster of the Imperial Japanese Navy, to all of whom, with two exceptions, certificates of competency have been issued. In four instances the senders of bad meat were prosecuted, convictions being obtained in each case. This is the smallest number for many years. For details see p. 138. DISEASED MEAT WITH VETERINARY CERTIFICATE. On the 9th January, 1907, a consignment of 14 pigs, sent by a farmer at Northolt, Middlesex, was received by a salesman in the Central Market, and six of them found by your Inspectors to be tuberculous were consequently seized and destroyed. Accompanying these pigs was a Certificate signed by the County Veterinary Inspector stating that he found them "free from symptoms of contagious or infectious disease, and fit for human food," and that he had therefore authorised their removal. On the following day four other pigs from the same farm accompanied by a similar Certificate from the same Veterinary Inspector arrived at the Market, and of these three were condemned as tuberculous, and one as being in a generally inflammatory and congested condition. These were consequently destroyed as being unfit for food. A third case of this kind occurred, when 11 carcases of pigs, out of a consignment of 45 sent to the City Market, were found to be tuberculous, and therefore seized and destroyed. These pigs were accompanied by a permit signed by an officer of the Huntingdon Police authorising their removal under the Swine Fever Order. Upon enquiry it was found that the permit was granted on the strength of a Certificate from a Veterinary Surgeon that the pigs were "perfectly free from either a contagious or infectious disease and fit for human consumption." 119 In each of these cases the farmers had acted in good faith, having asked a Veterinary Inspector or Police Officer to have the carcases examined before removal. The question, however, arose, why the Veterinary Surgeon in each instance certified diseased carcases to be "fit for human consumption." The reason given by one was that tuberculosis is not a disease scheduled by the Board of Agriculture, and that certifying officials have no power to detain any animal or carcase affected by it. The other Veterinary Surgeon concerned stated that after examining 52 carcases of pigs, together with the lungs and livers, in which organs he should expect to find tuberculosis, he passed 45 of them perfectly free from either contagious or infectious disease, and that opinion he must adhere to. These explanations being extremely unsatisfactory, the Sanitary Committee ordered the facts to be reported to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, who, under date the 11th April, furnished the following explanation:— It appears that under Article 4 of the Swine Fever Order, 1894, Rule 2 : "Carcases of swine shall not be removed from an infected place except "with the permission in writing from an Inspector or Officer of the "Board or an Inspector of the Local Authority." In the cases in question, the owners of the pigs were desirous of moving some carcases of swine from an infected area ; in order to conform with the above rule it was necessary to obtain the required certificate. In neither case was the Veterinary Surgeon required by Rule 2 of the Order to do more than give permission in writing for the removal of the carcase from a Swine Fever infected place. The point is, that in each of these instances, although the carcases in question were affected with tuberculosis, the Veterinary Inspector had certified that they were fit for human food. In these circumstances I recommended that the Board of Agriculture be requested to draft a form of Certificate that would obviate any misapprehension in future—this suggestion being made in view of a statement contained in the Board's communication that they were considering the Order referred to. 120 MARKING OF MEAT: In the Annual Report for 1906 it was pointed out that when the new Public Abattoir, established by the Corporation to take the place of the private slaughterhouses that had hitherto existed at the Metropolitan Cattle Market at Islington, under the control of the Corporation, was opened, an excellent opportunity would be presented of initiating a system of marking meat, that on inspection was found to fulfil the requirements of the Local Government Board recommendations with regard to meat inspection. Several reasons were advanced for making this suggestion. Stated briefly, they were as under:— (i.) The promotion of the interests of British Agriculturists. (ii.) When purchasing marked meat the public is guaranteed that not only are they buying British produce, but also that the meat is unquestionably wholesome. With regard to (i.), considerations of space prevent any enlargement on this point, but some figures given and arguments advanced on pages 121 and 122 of the Report for 1906, referred to above, should command serious attention. In June, 1907, I recommended to the Sanitary Committee that the Cattle Markets Committee of the Corporation should be invited to give this suggestion their consideration. This course was agreed to, and in September following, the Cattle Markets Committee reported that although concurring in the view that marking of meat, if general, would greatly benefit Agriculturists, they were of opinion that the time was not yet ripe for introducing the principle. The matter is still under consideration. SUGGESTED MEAT MARKET DEPOT AT CENTRAL MARKETS, SMITHFIELD. In October, 1907, in introducing this subject to the Sanitary Committee, I adverted to the question of Meat Marking at Islington—referred to above — and to the opinion expressed by Mr. King, Veterinary Surgeon to the Corporation, to the effect that he agreed with the principle of meat marking, and that such marking would greatly benefit Agriculturists, also that there is little doubt that a great deal of foreign meat is sold as Home produce. 121 The suggestion referred to was that the time appeared opportune for the Corporation to offer facilities for marking meat that could be brought to a depot established for that purpose in the Central Market. The system would of course be a voluntary one, and a nominal charge made for inspection and marking which might cover the expenses incurred. The Depôt would be placed in charge of an experienced officer, and a record kept of all meat examined. This should specially appeal to the trade, as it would offer protection against any charge of unsoundness that might be brought against the salesman by other authorities, while at the same time it would protect the salesmen against unjust claims for return of money on the ground that articles purchased were unfit for food at the time of sale. It is not unlikely that sooner or later the Corporation will be placed under some official obligation with regard to marking of meat passing through markets under their control, and it seems advisable, therefore, to attempt some experiments in the direction indicated, to demonstrate the extent to which the marking of meat would be received both by the trade and by the public. UNSOUND POULTRY. Attention was given last Autumn to the best means of reducing the amount of game and poultry condemned in the City Markets. In the Annual Reports a table is given classifying the meat seizures during the year, and under the heading "Poultry" is included also game and rabbits. This class of food is particularly liable to undergo decomposition in warm weather, especially when improperly packed or stored, and in the case of poultry to wrong treatment before killing. This loss being mainly preventable, and due in a great measure to lack of method and ignorance, it was suggested that it would serve a useful purpose,, and check to some extent the destruction of much valuable food, if salesmen in the City Markets were supplied with circulars to send to their country customers, containing information as to the best methods of preparing, sorting and packing such goods for market. The Sanitary Committee having concurred in this proposal, notices containing concise directions for these purposes were furnished to all game dealers in the City. A copy of the notice is appended. 122 Corporation of London PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. NOTICE. UNSOUND POULTRY, GAME, etc. THE Corporation of London has recently had under consideration the very large amount of Poultry and Game condemned in its Markets, the value of which amounts on an average to several thousand pounds per annum. Enquiry shows that a large proportion of this waste is due to carelessness or ignorance of consignors as to the best methods of preparing and packing such goods. Poultry and Game require for their preservation in good condition the greatest possible care and attention to details at every stage, of killing, storing, and packing. The Corporation has therefore requested its. Medical Officer of Health to prepare the accompanying Circular Letter on the subject. Copies may be obtained for distribution on application. JAMES BELL, Town Clerk. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.G., December, 1907. 123 Hints as to the proper methods of preparing and packing Poultry and Game for Market 1.-KILLING. (a) Birds intended for slaughter must be kept for a certain time without food. Twenty-four hours is the shortest time that should be allowed for "fasting," and this should be increased in hot weather. If killed without proper fasting, the flesh will not keep properly, and will not look so well. (b) The greatest care must be taken to prevent damage to the skin and tissues of the bird,—bruised flesh rapidly decomposes. The simplest plan of killing is by dislocating the neck. The birds should at once be placed on shaping boards, head downwards. Plucking should be commenced before the flesh is cold. Game should be hung up or laid out separately until quite cold. 2.-PACKING. Poultry and Game must be allowed to become quite cold before packing. To this end each bird should be laid out separately in a cool place, if possible in a direct current of air. More loss is due to inattention to this important detail than to any other cause. In sending Poultry to the London markets there is a prevalent practice of hurriedly dispatching imperfectly cooled consignments to be in time for market. The cooling will be carried out while "shaping." Poultry and Game should always be packed in such a way as to receive as much fresh air as possible. The packages must be freely ventilated. Hampers and baskets may be made sufficiently open to allow of ample circulation of air. If wooden cases are used, they should either be crates made of battens, with wide spaces, which are useful and inexpensive, or, if boxes, openings should be made in the tops, bottoms and sides. The material used for lining the cases and filling in between the birds should be light and porous, and the packing, while loose enough to allow of ventilation, should be sufficiently firm to prevent bruising of the flesh. Thoroughly dry wheat (not oat) straw is the best material for packing. It is certain that, if the above points are carefully attended to, Poultry and Game will arrive at market in far better condition than at present, and much preventible destruction of good food will be avoided. The above hints have been drawn up after consultation with some of the leading salesmen in the Market, whose valuable co-operation is hereby acknowledged." WILLIAM COLLINGRIDGE, M.D., Medical Officer of Health, City of London. 124 PUBLIC HEALTH (REGULATIONS AS TO FOOD) ACT, 1907. This Act was brought in by the Government in July, 1906, but was not then proceeded with. It was re-introduced in February, 1907, received the Royal Assent on the 28th August of that year, and became immediately operative. This Act enables the Local Government Board to make Regulations for the prevention of danger arising to public health from the importation, preparation, storage and distribution of articles of food. This object is attained in the Act by extending the power of the Local Government Board to make Regulations under the Public Health Act, 1896, and enactments mentioned in that Act so as to make provision for:— (a) The examination and taking of samples of articles of food or drink (other than drugs or water) intended for human consumption. (b) Applying, as respects any matters to be dealt with by the Regulations, any provision in any Act of Parliament dealing with the like matters, with the necessary modifications and adaptions. (c) Providing for the recovery of any charges authorised to be made by the Regulations or any services performed thereunder. In this Act the machinery existing with regard to epidemic diseases under the Public Health Act, 1875, the Public Health Act, 1896, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, is utilised for the purpose of food inspection. When this measure was under consideration, there was a feeling in some quarters that it placed too wide a control in the hands of a single minister; the Government accepted this view, and added Section 2, by which no regulations made under the Act can become operative until they have been laid forty days before Parliament. The Local Government Board having some time past had under consideration the issue of such regulations, the Court of Common Council, on the 31st October, 1907, agreed to a Report of the Sanitary Committee submitting, on the recommendation of your Medical Officer of Health, that the attention of the Board be directed to the importance of making Regulations under the Act for the following purposes:— (1) For preventing the admission of any meat, or meat products, into this country that have not been officially examined and certified as wholesome before export, the inspection to be in accord with the standard in force in this country at the time. At present the only standard existing is that laid down in the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis, 1898. 125 (2) For ensuring that all imported tinned meat should be properly sterilised and bear the date of packing and the name of the packer or his registered mark or number impressed on the tin. (3) For prohibiting the conveyance of meat through the public thoroughfares, except in properly constructed carts or other suitable vehicles in which the contents are properly covered and protected. CERTAIN IMPORTED MEAT FOODS OF QUESTIONABLE UNWHOLESOMENESS. The Local Government Board recently issued a Report of their Inspector of Foods, Dr. G. S. Buchanan, containing notes on the following subjects:— (1) Imported Boneless Scrap Meat, (2) Imported Pork, in regard to Tuberculosis, (3) Imported Tripe, Tongues, and Kidneys, which are heavily dosed with boron and other preservatives, and making suggestions for dealing with the above-mentioned classes of imported food. Dr. Buchanan points out that the matter was brought to the notice of the Board by questions asked in the House of Commons and by representations from the Corporation. "PART I.—IMPORTED BONELESS SCRAP MEAT- "The notes on this subject are arranged as follows :— " 1. Nature of imported boneless scrap meat; countries of origin; amount " imported; uses of this material. "2. Inspection in regard to boneless scrap meat. "3. Objections to imported boneless scrap meat. "4. Suggested application of Regulations to imported boneless scrap meat. "1. Nature of Imported Boneless Scrap Meat ; Countries of Origin; " mount Imported; Uses of this Material. "Boneless Scrap Meat from the United States of America." Boneless Beef. Most of this comes from the United States, a small quantity prepared with preservatives, the greater part frozen. These goods are a bye-product of the canning trade—that is, they are composed of the inferior parts of inferior animals, the wholesale price being about 3d. a pound. This meat is generally used by makers of meat pies and sausage makers, only a part of it reaches the 126 Central Meat Market, and the boxes are often sold unopened direct from various Cold Air Stores, and in some cases no Market tolls are paid. The total importation of boneless beef chucks of all descriptions during 1905 into the United Kingdom was 2,722 tons. Boneless Pork. This meat which comes from the United States of America is composed chiefly of "pork cuttings" and "ham trimmings," these are mainly made up of the scraps which are removed in preparing the hams and other parts of the carcases. The total quantity of pork and ham cuttings and butts imported during 1905 was rather over 800 tons. Boneless Scrap Meat from Argentina. This entirely consists of beef which provides a certain amount of boneless meat, but not of scrap meat similar to that from the States. Setting aside "box offals," i.e., livers, hearts, kidneys, &c., it consists mainly of skirts, ox-cheeks and ox-tails. Boneless Scrap Meat from Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Only a small proportion of this finds it way into London. Small quantities of beef and pork trimmings preserved with boric acid are imported from Canada. Boneless Scrap Meat from the Continent of Europe. "Nothing is known of this by the Inspectors of Smithfield Market, with the "exception of some salted boneless beef from Denmark. It is stated, however, that "there is a trade in sausage meat of a dubious character from different Continental "ports, which does not find its way into the public markets. " 2. Inspection in regard to Boneless Scrap Meat. " Inspection in this Country. "Inspection in this country can afford no check whatever as to the existence of "disease conditions in the animals whence meat of this description is derived. Nor "can any such inspection operate as a check upon the use of uncleanly or "objectionable methods of obtaining, treating, collecting or packing the scrap meat "in the place of its preparation abroad. Dr. Collingridge has drawn special "attention to this matter in reports to the City Corporation, and it has been insisted "upon by the Medical Officers of Health of Birmingham and other cities where "there are important meat markets. "An Inspector, however skilled, can make nothing of chucks or trimmings while "they are frozen hard, and all he can do in practice, when they thaw, or after they "have thawed, is to look for signs of decomposition. Inspection for decomposition is of "itself a matter of some importance, as the chief use of the scrap meat is in the "mincing machine, and it is obviously undesirable that scraps which are in doubtful "condition should be allowed to be turned into sausage meat. 127 "Inspection in the Country of origin. "It is doubtful whether any system of inspection, however rigid, can in practice "be regarded as satisfactory in the case of meat prepared for export in the form of "scrap meat. Meat in this form is rightly held in considerable suspicion by health "authorities. In the experience of this country it has been found specially "convenient to traders wishing to make profitable use of bad or doubtful meat. "Certain foreign meat laws take account of this objection to scrap meat of all kinds. "In the German Empire the importation of the kind of scrap meat here referred to 'is interdicted. In the case of the boxed boneless chucks, trimmings, &c., now "chiefly in question, it has to be remembered that the meat may be of inferior "quality to begin with (canners). Moreover, preparation of scrap meat must "involve a considerable amount of handling ; scraps may be collected from dirty "floors or thrown into unclean receptacles, and are liable to be dirtied or ''contaminated in other ways. "United States Inspection.—In a memorandum addressed to the Board early in "1906, I drew attention to the law and regulations in the United States as to the "inspection of establishments where animals are slaughtered and meat is prepared "for export. Save for certain questions regarding tuberculosis, referred to below, "the instructions of the United States Bureau of Animal Industry to its inspectors "at these establishments, in regard to their judgment and condemnation of animals ''affected by disease, appeared to constitute a code which could be regarded as "generally satisfactory from the health point of view. I pointed out, however, that "it was quite another question how these regulations worked in practice, and "referred to accounts of the rapidity with which carcases are dealt with in the "large packing houses of Chicago and elsewhere, and to the arrangements for "inspection made there. "Since that date various documents and reports have come to hand in connection "with the agitation which has led to the United States Meat Inspection Act of 1906. "From these it is evident that in the past the staff" of inspectors at the packing "houses must often have been wholly inadequate to secure a thorough inspection of "carcases for disease on the lines of the official instructions. "Until this year, at any rate, the official labels have had no significance as "regards preparation, cleanliness, chemical treatment, and the like, of meat "imported in the form of scraps. "But although, henceforth, the label 'U.S. Inspected' will no doubt mean more "than in the past, it would be rash at this stage to place too great reliance upon its "significance when attached to boxes containing such a commodity as scrap meat "prepared for export." Dr. Buchanan further points out that the standard with regard to tuberculosis is:— "not that which is in force in this country, and that therefore; the home trader has a "legitimate grievance if scraps of pork of tuberculous animals are allowed to come "into the market, for no other reason than that the condition of the animals from "which they are derived cannot be ascertained by inspectors in this country. "Summarising the objections to imported boneless scrap meat, "1. It is meat in an objectionable form. No inspection can suffice to detect disease. 128 "2. It is not prudent to regard it free from suspicion of unwholesomeness, "solely on the strength of the declaration of the importers, or of any "guarantee of inspection which may be furnished by the Government "concerned. "3. In view of the methods of American meat inspection, it is quite "possible it may have been derived from tuberculous animals. "4. It is desirable that sausage makers should obtain meat which is readily "identifiable with particular parts of a carcase, and have some knows "ledge of the meat they use. "5. That boxes of frozen meat have been found to show signs of "decomposition at an early stage after they have been thawed. It is "not desirable that imported sausage meat with unknown and some"times large quantities of chemical preservatives should be sold. "4. Suggested application of Regulations to Imported Boneless Scrap Meat. "The unchecked admission of boneless scrap meat into the United Kingdom "appears to constitute a definite risk to health. It also hinders equitable "administration of public health laws and regulations relating to unsound or "diseased meat in this country. "I have repeatedly found this question of boneless scrap meat referred to by "Home traders when speaking of the hardship of having their meat seized by local "authorities on account of disease or other conditions which rendered it "unwholesome." "At the present time the volume of trade in this commodity is small, and to "prohibit its importation would cause little interference with trade." PART II.—TUBERCULOSIS AND IMPORTED PORK. Dr. Buchanan refers to the Recommendation of the Royal Commission of 1898, "the presence of tuberculous deposit in any degree should involve seizure of the whole carcase and of the organs," and the fact that the Board has advised the adoption of this standard by Medical Officers of Health and Meat Inspectors, and further that the second Report of the present Royal Commission emphasises the need for continuing precautions against the risk entailed to human health by food containing tubercle bacilli of the "bovine" type. Reference is made to the systems of inspection in various countries, which are summarised as follows:— "Classification of Imported Pork in regard to Tuberculosis. "In 1906 I found that imported pork could be classified as follows:— "Class A.—Practically free from tuberculosis. Required to have been submitted to examination by a qualified inspector whose instructions are to reject for tuber"culosis in any degree. "Dutch.—The whole of the Dutch pig carcases which bore labels attesting "Government inspection for export. "Danish.—Practically all pork imported from Denmark 129 "Class B.—Some safeguard against tuberculosis afforded by the system of meat "inspection established by the meat law of the country of origin. Such inspection "would exclude pigs affected by tuberculosis in certain forms, but would pass other "tuberculous pigs. "United States Practically the whole importations from these two "Belgium. countries. "Class C.—No safeguard against tuberculosis in any degree. "Dutch.—Pig carcases from Holland not bearing labels attesting Govern"ment inspection for export. "Class D.—Unclassified ; importation small. "Australian, Canadian, Russian, New Zealand, and other countries. "On the Customs figures above given the importation into the United Kingdom "of fresh and frozen pork in these different classes appeared to be approximately:— "In Class A, about 54 per cent, of the total. ” B, ” 34 ” ” ” C ” 9 ” ” ” D 3 ” ” "If suitable action is taken under the new meat inspection law in the Netherlands, "Dutch pigs in Class C may be expected in future to diminish in number or to "disappear altogether. The recent Belgian circular in regard to exported pork has "presumably already effected some transference of Belgian pigs from Class B to "Class A. It may here be noted that the Canadian Meat and Canned Food Act, "1907, provides for systematic inspection of meat foods prepared in Canada for "export, under which regulations will no doubt be made regarding tuberculosis and "other diseased conditions of animals slaughtered for food. A system of official "inspection of meat prepared for export has already been developed in Australia and "in New Zealand. “United States.—As matters now stand, if the label ‘U.S. Inspected’ on "packages of box pork from the United States is accepted at its maximum value, "it affords a guarantee that the meat does not come from animals suffering from certain severe forms of tuberculosis, but does not attest that none of the meat is "derived from tuberculous pigs ; indeed, the United States regulations justify the "assumption that some of the box pork comes from animals affected by tuberculosis." Practical Difficulties in Administration with regard to Tuberculosis in Imported Pork. Dr. Buchanan points out that inspection at the place of slaughter is the only safe way of dealing with pork. The present arrangements are unfair to the Home trader, inasmuch as American boxed pork is allowed to be sold when it may have been derived from tuberculous animals ; the Home trader has no such privilege. He does not suggest that any relaxation should be permitted from the standard set up by the Royal Commission of 1898, but that measures should be taken to secure the greater wholesomeness of that which is imported, and for that purpose suggests the following conditions:— "(a.) Pork imported as carcases to be required to consist of entire carcases "including the head and lymphatic glands about the throat. 130 "(b.) Pork imported in portions less than the entire carcase to be enclosed "in boxes, barrels, bags, or other receptacles bearing an official mark "which has been accepted by the Board. The Board's acceptance of "any proposed mark as an official mark would depend upon the "evidence forthcoming from the exporting country that the mark "affords a guarantee that the carcases from which the portions of pork "have been derived hare been examined by competent and responsible "officers and have been found free from tuberculosis in any degree. PART III. TRIPE, TONGUES AND KIDNEYS, HEAVILY DOSED WITH PRESERVATIVES. This deals with the question of the addition of boron compounds and other preservatives for the purpose of preservation. A statement is made that the amount found is seldom less than 60 grains per lb., and sometimes over 150 grains per lb. (2.14 per cent.).* "These amounts are so large that it is justifiable to infer that many persons who eat "tripe of this kind would incur definite risk to health from the dose of boric acid "taken. A quarter of a pound of this tripe—which may be considered a moderate "meal—must often contain more than the maximum dose of boric acid prescribed "for an adult by the British Pharmacopoeia. It must be remembered that tripe is "considered to be a food easy of digestion, and is given to invalids on that account. "A further and important objection to this tripe is that decomposition may set in, "but owing to the presence of the preservative, no obvious sign of it will be present. " Suggested Application of Regulations to Tripe, Tongues, and Kidneys "Imported in Preservative Solutions or Packing. "The considerations above set out indicate the desirability of action by the Board, "under the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, to prevent the "introduction from abroad at English ports of tripe (whether cooked or uncooked), "tongues, and kidneys, which arrive in receptacles containing any preparations "consisting of or comprising boric acid ; borax or other borates; sulphurous acid "or sulphites." It will be noted that the views and recommendations set forth in Parts I. and II. of the above Report strongly confirm the views of the Corporation as set forth in the Reports of the Sanitary Committee. If regulations are made on these lines under the powers of the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act, 1907, a considerable safeguard to the health of the people will be established, and a legitimate grievance of the Home trader and producer as to unfair competition will be removed. * In this connection it may be mentioned that it has been found by Professor Klein that—provided the conditions as to locality, general cleanliness, character of the meat and bread are satisfactory—the minimum quantity of "boric preservative" required for arresting decomposition in sausaee meat for a period of three days under normal conditions is 26.24 grains, or 0 37 per cent, of preservative to the pound of sausage material 131 AMERICAN BOXED MEAT. Several cases occurred last year that have a direct relation to Dr. Buchanan's opinion quoted above that:— "Although henceforth, the label ' U.S. Inspected' will no doubt mean "more than in the past, it would be rash at this stage to place too great "reliance upon its significance when attached to boxes containing such a "commodity as scrap meat prepared for export." The new Regulation known as B.A. (Order No. 157) concerning meat inspection of the United States Department of Agriculture came into operation on 25th July, 1906. On the 15th May, 1907, a quantity of plucks taken from a box bearing the stamp indicating that the contents had been "inspected and passed," were seized as being diseased. This was by no means an isolated case, and your Inspectors not infrequently find this label unreliable. Another reason for taking exception to the importation of this boxed meat under present conditions is shown by the fact that a sample taken from a case containing roughly chopped fore-quarter of beef bearing the U.S. label, was found on examination by your Public Analyst to contain 0.78 per cent, of boric acid, equivalent to 54.6 grains per pound, an excessive amount. The Public have a right to know what it is they are buying, and in my opinion, when a preservative is added to any article of food or drink, the fact should be made known to the purchaser by label or otherwise. There is a further danger to health that may arise from the consumption of this boxed meat when packed under insanitary conditions, which evidently prevail at some packing establishments. Early in September, 1907, the attention of Dr. Chalmers, Medical Officer of Health for Glasgow, was directed to a consignment of American boxed meat which had reached Glasgow direct. Upon examination nothing was discovered suggesting unsoundness in the flesh of the animals at the time of slaughter, but micro-organisms were present whose normal habitat is the intestines. By way of explaining their presence in the centre of a mass of frozen meat, two explanations were advanced. In the first place the organisms in question, which belong to the coli group, rapidly penetrate the tissues of animals after slaughter, and so might reach those portions which were contained in the consignment. This, however, from the condition of the flesh otherwise, was considered unlikely, the probable explanation being that due care was not exercised in protecting the surface of the flesh from direct contamination. The practical result is that the flesh containing organisms of this character rapidly undergoes decomposition on thawing, and that the presence of intestinal organisms in flesh food is apt to induce changes therein which experience has shown to be associated with ptomaine poisoning. 132 DISEASED CARCASES BEARING U.S. LABEL. Illustration of the little value of the U.S. label attached to carcases is shown in the following cases. On the 3rd May, 1907, a firm of salesmen in the Central Market, Smithfield, sent from a cold air store to a customer at Reading a fore-quarter of American beef bearing the inspection label of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Upon arrival at Reading this meat was examined by an Inspector of that authority who found the sternal glands to be diseased. On the 22nd October, 1907, I submitted to the Sanitary Committee specimens cut from the carcase of a pig badly affected with acute pleurisy which had seriously affected the condition of the animal. The carcase, which was in consequence quite unfit for food, was seized and destroyed with the consent of the salesmen. This pig was seized on the 18th October at one of the premises of one of the largest meat importing Companies. Upon enquiry it was found that it came from the State of Massachusetts, U.S.A., in the s.s. "Georgian" from Charlestown. At my suggestion the attention of the United States Government was called to the matter in order that they might have an opportunity of furnishing some explanation, but up to the time of writing this has not yet been supplied. These cases emphasise the necessity of still exercising a most careful supervision over all meat coming from the United States. The new regulations for meat inspection in the United States, though perhaps in themselves commendable, appear to be carried into effect with so little regard to efficiency that your Inspectors would not be justified in passing a carcase bearing a U.S. label without examination. TUBERCULOUS PIGS FROM RUSSIA. In April, 1907, a consignment of 60 frozen Russian pigs, without heads, reached the Market for a preliminary examination while still in a hardened condition; evidence of tuberculosis was found in four out of five, an arrangement was therefore made that in order to facilitate inspection, the whole consignment should be dealt with by one form, when a careful examination disclosed that 13 out of the 60 were tuberculous. Being informed that a large consignment of 250 was expected, and knowing that the Russian standard of inspection was not in accordance with those recommended by the Local Government Board, and adopted in the City Markets, the Sanitary Committee, acting on my advice, directed that the facts be brought to the notice of the Russian Consulate and to the Local Government Board. 133 Table showing the annual deliveries and other details during the past 34 years:— MEAT SUPPLIES, 1874 TO 1907.

The material so disposed of comprised:— Tons. Cwts. Qrs. Tinned fruit and vegetables 41 14 2 Condensed milk 67 5 3 Miscellaneous tinned food 34 11 3 Fruit pulp 16 17 2 Fruit and vegetables 30 12 2 Miscellaneous food 3 7 2 Total 194 9 2 The greater portion of the above was removed at the written request of the owners. Section 47 (8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, provides that— "Where a person has in his possession any article which is unsound "or unwholesome or unfit for the food of man, he may, by written "notice to the Sanitary Authority, specifying such article, and containing "a sufficient identification of it, request its removal, and the Sanitary "Authority shall cause it to be removed as if it were trade refuse." This provision takes away the ground of a common defence in prosecutions for being in possession of unsound food. It has often been suggested that the food was set aside with the intention of destroying it before it was discovered by the Inspector. This power to notify to Sanitary Authorities under this section affords a test where this line of defence is adopted. 142 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. During the year 1,092 articles of food and drugs were analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899. Of these, 73, or 6.68 per cent., were certified by the Public Analyst to be adulterated*, or not up to standard, as compared with 6.60 per cent. in 1906. Table I.

Unfortunately there are no accurate means of arriving at the number of persons in the City during the daytime. It will be seen from Table I. that in the course of the seven years 19011907, 7,540 samples have been taken in the City, or upwards of 1,000 samples annually, and that of these, 580 were found adulterated; the average annual percentage of adulterated samples during the seven years being 7.7. The actual percentage of adulteration at the present time is, however, lower than this, having fallen from 13.11 in 1901 to 6.68 in 1907. 144 From the Table it would appear that the decrease of adulteration in the City during the years 1901, 1902, 1903 and 1904 had been followed by an increased amount of adulteration during the three succeeding years 1905, 1906 and 1907. This increase is, however, more apparent than real. There can be little doubt that the numerous prosecutions that have taken place since the Acts were rigorously enforced has brought about a great improvement generally in the character of the food and drugs sold in the City, any apparent increase in the percentage of adulterated articles being due to discrimination in the selection of the articles taken for analysis. In the last published Report of the Local Government Board on the working of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, mention is made of the increasing practice of the exhibition of notices stating that articles offered for sale are not guaranteed to be pure or up to standard. Such notices are generally displayed for the express purposes of protecting the vendor from the consequences of selling a sophisticated article, and in order to place difficulties in the way of prosecutions. Such notices are to be found in 21 per cent. of registered purveyors of milk in the City, while notices for the same purpose are exhibited in no less than 40 per cent. of the City Public-Houses. These facts and the advantage taken by unscrupulous traders of the loop-hole afforded them by an easy abuse of the warranty clauses are greatly conducive towards weakening an effective administration of the Food and Drugs Acts. With regard to the Notices exhibited in licensed premises, I think it would be well, when the annual consideration is given to the renewal of licences by the Local Authority in the City, to furnish the Justices with a list of all those houses in which such notices are used. It is obvious that no publican who is carrying on his business honestly and properly need be in fear of a visit from an Inspector, and if the Justices gave due weight to this aspect of the question it might assist them in coming to a decision in those cases where there is any doubt as to the advisability of the renewal of a licence. MILK. In the City, as elsewhere, Milk is the article most generally adulterated. is gratifying, however, to note from the following Table that this form fraud has very materially diminished during the last seven years.

In 7, or 23.3 per cent. of the cases taken into Court the defendants successfully pleaded the Warranty Clauses of the Food and Drugs Acts. Twenty vendors were fined for selling either watered or skimmed milk, and penalties imposed varying from 5s. and 17s. 6d. expenses to £5 and £l 3s. 6d. expenses. This relation between places of purchase and the detection of adulteration is not without interest, as shown by the following Table. Where taken. No. of Samples taken. No. Adulterated.

In some of these cases the samples were taken at the request of a retail milkman to test the quality of the milk supplied by farmers or wholesale dealers. PRESERVATIVES IN MILK. In February 1907 the Sanitary Committee referred to me for consideration and report some resolutions with regard to this subject passed by the Metropolitan Borough Council of Paddington. These were as under:— "(a) That communications be again addressed to the Local Govern"ment Board and the Board of Agriculture urging that statutory effect "be given to the recommendation of the Departmental Committee of "the Local Government Board of 1901, prohibiting the use of any "preservatives in milk. "(6) That, in the event of the Local Government Board being unable "to act in accordance with the foregoing resolution, regulations under "Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, should be made by 146 "the Board of Agriculture, defining, in accordance with the circular "letter of the Local Government Board of the 11th July, 1906, the "exact amounts of formalin and boron preservatives which may be added "to milk where disclosure of the presence of preservative is made at the "time of sale. "(c) That a copy of the foregoing resolutions be forwarded to the "London County Council, to the Corporation of the City of London, "and to each of the Metropolitan Borough Councils. With regard to (a) I reported that I was in entire accord with the resolution, and I therefore repeated the opinion I had already expressed* that the time had arrived when the recommendations of the Departmental Committee, referred to in the resolutions, should be given a legal value, and adopted by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries under the provisions of Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. As to (6), I was unable to advise that either formalin or boron preservative be allowed to be introduced into milk in any degree, and in this view I am supported by the recommendation of the Departmental Committee, viz.:— "That the use of any preservative or colouring matter whatever in "milk offered for sale in the United Kingdom should be constituted an "offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act." Resolution (c) required no comment. This report was agreed to, and a copy ordered to be sent to the Paddington Borough Council. IMPROPERLY LABELLED IMPORTED SKIMMED MILK TINS. In January, 1907, it was reported that upon examining the contents of 100 cases, each containing 96 tins, marked " Machine Skimmed Condensed Milk,"—part of a consignment of returned stores from South Africa—delivered at a dealer's premises in the City, it was found that although the cases were marked in accordance with legal requirements, the tins within were not. Section 1, Sub-section 1 (c) of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, requiring that Condensed, Separated, or Skimmed Milk imported into the United Kingdom in tins or other receptacles should bear a label whereon the words "Machine Skimmed Milk," or "Skimmed Milk," are printed in large and legible type, failing which the importer is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £20 for the first offence, and £50 for a second, and £100 for any subsequent offence. The tins in question were not labelled in accordance with this provision. * See pages 136 and 137, Annual Report, 1906. 147 As the Act provides that offences under this Section shall be undertaken by the Commissioners of Customs, the facts were communicated to them, and in reply thereto, His Majesty's Board of Customs undertook to instruct their officers to take samples from any further importation of condensed milk of the same brand unless the label bears the words "Machine Skimmed Milk," it being the practice of the Board of Agriculture to see that such milk is so labelled in accordance with the Section of the Act referred to above. Such instructions were in due course issued by the Board, and a copy of the same forwarded to the Town Clerk. BUTTER. Four hundred and eleven samples were taken, of which 13, or 3.16 per cent., were certified to be adulterated. The figures for 1907 and six preceding years are given in the following able:— Year. No. of samples taken. No. of samples found Genuine. No. of Samples found Adulterated.

In the case of the offender who was fined £100, it was the fourth conviction, and evidence was given that he had instructed his assistants never to serve persons who were not regular customers with margarine when butter was asked for, but in serving known persons to do so. As in former years special attention was given to the character of the butter served at coffee-houses, and of the 184 samples taken at these places, of butter served upon slices of "bread and butter," it was found that in 8 cases, or 4.3 per cent., margarine had been used instead of butter. The following summary shows the amount of this deception that was discovered in the five years 1903-7:— Date. Samples taken. Cases of Substitution. Percentage Substituted Samples. 1903 71 19 26.7 1904 101 12 11.8 1905 16 Nil.

Of the remaining 227 samples of butter taken elsewhere, in 5 cases, or 2.2 per cent., margarine had been served in substitution for butter. No other form of butter sophistication was reported during the year. BUTTER AND MARGARINE ACT, 1907. (7 Edw. VII., Ch. 21). Shortly after the introduction of the so-called "milk-blended butter," about the year 1900, it became apparent that existing legislation did not afford sufficient protection to the public from what one witness, before the Select Committee on the Butter Trade, described as having been originally "solely a fraud, nothing but a fraud, and a deception with the intention of passing off something which was not what it pretended to be." The manufacturers of this article—which is really a debased butter— succeeded in eventually evading the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act. It is true that proceedings might have been taken under the " Merchandise Marks Acts," but the enforcement of these Acts rests with individuals and not with any public authority. To those not familiar with the nature of this article it may be useful if I quote here the notes made by me on the subject when dealing with the proceedings of the Select Committee's enquiry on the Butter Trade in the Annual Report for 1906. "One of the most important features of the enquiry was the evidence "taken in relation to so-called "milk-blended butter." "This is a form of sophistication that I have already directed attention to in my Annual Reports for the years 1903-4-5. "It was ascertained in the course of the enquiry that this so-called "butter is made in this country by five firms, and it was also given in "evidence that it is composed of butter and milk, with the addition of "boracic acid, that have been mixed together by machinery, one firm "alone making from 80 to 85 tons a week. "Upon its first introduction, some years ago, it was sold as butter, "such description being, of course, a fraudulent one. This abuse was 149 "checked to some extent by the imposition of fines in cases where the "firms manufacturing it were proceeded against under the Sale of Foods "and Drugs Acts, for selling butter containing an excessive amount of "water. "For some reason or other this mixture appealed to a certain section "of the community that did not know butter when they saw it, and who "were readily imposed upon by cleverly worded advertisements. This "stuff is now sold as" milk-blended butter," a title cleverly designed to "mislead. It is further placed in a wrapper, bearing an artfully worded "declaration that purports to describe its real nature. "This statement protects the manufacturer from prosecution, as it is "a sufficient disclosure that the article is a mixture. It professes to be "a "blend" of butter and milk, but the ordinary buyer can hardly be "expected to know that the milk so added itself contains about 87 per "cent. of water as a natural constituent. "Nor do the public know that this " butter," as a result of such "blending, when completed may contain as much as 28 per cent. of "water. "A sample purchased in the City on the 16th May, 1906, was certified " by the Public Analyst for the City to contain the parts as under:— " Butter Fat 64.8 per cent. "Water 28.0 „ " Card 5.7 „ " Salt and Ash 0.8 „ " Boric Acid (H3B03) 0.7 „ 100.0 "It was first placed on the market some seven years ago. If the "recommendations contained in the Report of the Select Committee are "adopted in any new legislation, the sale of this article under the "description of butter will be prohibited." From time to time measures have been introduced in Parliament for remedying this state of things; the first Bill for dealing with "milk-blended butter" being brought in, in 1902. A second Bill was introduced in 1903, other Bills followed in 1904 and 1905, these being on the lines of the 1903 Bill as amended in Committee. 150 On the 5th March, 1906, the Select Committee before referred to was appointed "to consider whether any, and if so, what further legislation was required in order to secure the better control and conduct of the trade in butter and butter substitutes." The result of their deliberations was ordered to be printed on 9th July, 1906, and a summary of the same with a copy of the recommendations of the Committee will be found in my Annual Report for that year. The Butter and Margarine Act, 1907, is the result of the Select Committee's Report. It was introduced in the Commons as a Government measure by the Representative of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries on the 17th February, 1907, and received the Royal Assent on the 21st August of that year. The Act came into operation on the 1st January, 1908. The object of this Act is to prevent the adulteration of butter at its source instead of, as in previous Bills, making the seller or retailer responsible. It will bring under efficient Government inspection those Factories and traders who for years past have been sophisticating butter. The Act provides for the inspection of all so-called butter factories where blending is done, as well as all margarine factories, and a thorough system of tracing the products from one wholesale dealer to another until it reaches the retail trader. The penalties for infringement of the Act will probably act as a deterrent, as the fines vary from £20 for a first offence, £50 for a second offence, and not exceeding £100 for the third and any subsequent offence, and in cases where imprisonment can be inflicted under Section 17 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, to such imprisonment as is by that section authorised, i.e.: "(2) Where, under any provision of the Sale of Food and Drugs "Acts, a person guilty of an offence is liable to a fine not exceeding "£50, and the offence in the opinion of the Court was committed "by the personal act, default, or culpable negligence of the person "accused, that person shall be liable (if the Court is of opinion that "a fine will not meet the circumstances of the case) to imprison"ment, with or without hard labour, for a period not exceeding "three months." Provision is made in the Act for the registration of factories and ments, also for the inspection of factories by Officers of the Board of Agriculture and the Local Government Board, and by an Officer of the Local Authority, who is authorised to procure samples under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, if specially authorised in that behalf by the Local Authority, and he shall have the same powers of entry, inspection and sampling as regards any premises registered with the authority as a butter factory. It will be an offence under the Act if any substance intended for use 151 for adulteration of butter is found in any butter factory, and the occupier of such factory shall have committed an offence if any oil or fat capable of being used for adulteration is found on the premises. A limit of 16 per cent. of moisture in butter and margarine and 24 percent. in milk-blended butter is fixed. In section 5 there is included a list of Articles, the importation of which is made an offence by section 1 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. There are:— "(e) Butter containing more than 16 per cent. of water. "(f) Margarine containing more than 16 per cent. of water. "(g) Any butter substitute containing more than 24 per cent. of water. "(A) Any butter substitute or imitation butter, except in packages "conspicuously marked "Butter Substitute" or "Imitation "Butter," as the case may require, or with such name as may be "approved by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries for the "purpose." Under section 6 the Board of Agriculture has power to make regulations with regard to the proportion of any curd in any samples of butter, and under section 7 the Local Government Board may make regulations as to prohibition for use of all preservatives that may be specified in the regulations in the making of butter, margarine or milk-blended butter, or for limiting the extent to which any particular substance or preservative may be used in the manufacture of such articles. The Act does not prohibit the sale of milk-blended butter, but it must be dealt in under certain restrictions. It can only be manufactured for sale or sold to the public under a name to be approved by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and under the conditions applicable to the sale or description of margarine, with the substitution of an approved name for the word "Margarine," except that in any case where, in order to comply with those conditions the article is delivered to the purchaser in a wrapper, there shall, in addition to the approved name, be printed on the wrapper in such manner as the Board may approve, such description of the article, setting out the percentage of moisture or water contained therein as may be approved by the Board. The foregoing are the main provisions of the new Act, but it should be pointed out that it is largely legislation by reference, and the time has arrived when it would be to the advantage of those who have to administer the Food Adulteration Acts, as well as to the public generally, if the several enactments dealing with the question were consolidated in one Act. 152 The following are the new duties imposed upon the Corporation by this Act:— (1.) The registration of butter factories. (2.) The registration of any premises on which there is manufactured any milk-blended butter, or on which there is carried on the business of a wholesale dealer in milk-blended butter. (3.) The inspection of and sampling at any premises registered in the City as a butter factory. With regard to (3), Officers of a Local Authority can only have powers of entry, inspection or sampling in butter factories when specially authorised in that behalf by the Local Authority. For these purposes, therefore, my recommendation that your Medical Officer of Health and the six Senior Sanitary Inspectors should be authorised in accordance with Section 2 (2) of the Act, was agreed to at the Court of Common Council on the 31st October, 1907, and the Local Government Board and Board of Agriculture and Fisheries notified accordingly. NETHERLANDS BUTTER BILL. In January, 1907, I submitted for the consideration of the Sanitary Committee the views of the Public Analyst for the City—Dr. Teed—with regard to the suggested Netherlands Butter Bill, a synopsis of which the ConsulGeneral of that country had been good enough to furnish. Briefly, the Bill contained provisions for the control of places where butter is made, on much the same lines as obtains in the English Butter and Margarine Bill passed last year, but as there were certain clauses in it of a techno-chemical character, the Committee invited Dr. Teed's opinion thereon. Dr. Teed's notes on the Bill were as under :— "The first Clause 'Commercial Butter must contain a certain per"centage of fat, to be fixed by Royal Decree,' is somewhat similar to "Clause 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, which gives power "to the Board of Agriculture to fix certain standards for butter (as also "for milk, cream, and cheese). So far as regards butter, the Board of "Agriculture has only fixed a standard as to the amount of water it "may contain, but they could also fix a standard for fat if they chose. "The second Clause, 'Margarine shall not indicate a higher saturation "figure than 10 for the volatile fatty acids contained in it,' means that "the amount of butter permissible to be mixed with margarine shall "not exceed some 40 per cent. As it stands, no method of anal) sis 153 being indicated, and the statement referring to margarine, and not to "fat of margarine, it is quite possible that some dealer who is proceeded "against under it, might persuade the Court that it had no meaning. "What I understand is, 'The fat of margarine shall not indicate "a higher saturation figure than 10 for the volatile fatty acids contained "in it by the Reichert Meissel process of analysis.'' "In the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, Section 8, the amount of "butter fat in margarine fat is limited to 10 per cent. It seems a pity "that the standard could not be arranged to be identical in the two "countries." The Committee concurred in my view that Dr. Teed's observations were of sufficient importance to be brought to the notice of the Netherlands Government, especially the last paragraph advocating international agreement as to the permissible amount of butter in margarine. This course was adopted, and on 25th March, 1907, the Consul-General for that country wrote to say that he had received a request from the Netherlands Department of Agriculture to convey their thanks to Dr. Teed for the interest he had shown in the matter, and was desired to point out that the figures mentioned in the Clauses to which Dr. Teed had referred applied to butter as well as to margarine, to molten and filtered fat; further, that the opinion was expressed in a review of a synopsis of the Bill only. With regard to the progress of this measure, the Consul-General of the Netherlands informs me that under present political conditions the Government that came into office quite recently will have to decide whether it will take over the Bill from its predecessors. When the magnitude of the figures relating to imported butter are considered, it will be seen that any legislation in any country, exporting that article to the United Kingdom, dealing with the control of manufacture and the precautionary measures observed for safe-guarding its purity, must be of special concern both to the trade and to the public. As mentioned elsewhere in this report, our own manufacturers of butter can now only carry on their business under special restrictions to ensure the purity of their products, and unless the maker of butter imported from abroad is under similar control, the public must suffer, and the home producer be placed at a disadvantage. In this connection the following figures are not without interest. They are extracted from the latest Custom House returns, and show the quantity and the value of butter imported into the United Kingdom during 1906. 154 From Foreign Countries. From Tons.

Twenty-two samples were taken, one of which was reported against. In this instance cotton seed oil was served as a substitute. It should be borne in mind that this refers only to olive oil sold as such. There is no definition of so-called "Salad" oil, which may be composed of any oils provided they are not actually poisonous. 155 The most common substitute for olive oil is cotton seed oil, and there is little doubt that the increased use of this oil is largely responsible for the troubles of digestion so common at the present day. Apart from its value in the preparation of salads, fish, &c., olive oil is a wholesome, nutritive article of diet, especially useful in the case of children and persons unable to digest ordinary fat. DRUGS. The accompanying Table shows the extent of drug adulteration in the City for the last seven years:— Samples taken. Found genuine. Found adulterated. Percentage of adulteration. 1901 111 103 8 7.2 1902 79 74 5 6.3 1903 65 60 5 7.7 1904 52 48 4 7.7 1905 61 56 5 8.2 1906 47 42 5 10.6 1907 65 59 6 9.2 Metropolis (1906) 5.0 I have had occasion in previous Reports to point out that the proportion of drugs found to be not up to standard requirements was far too high, and little improvement in this respect has taken place last year. It is not suggested that any fraud is intended on the part of the vendors, but that the offence is due to carelessness or neglect to ensure that the drugs sold are in accordance with the recognised standard. Included in the adulterated samples were two of powdered gentian root containing 25 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively of ground olive stones. Both offenders were prosecuted. In each case, however, the drug had been in stock for a number of years, and had been purchased by the vendors with the business. Each was ordered to pay 12s. 6d. expenses. Two samples of light magnesia were reported against. One, an informal sample, was certified to contain 20.9 per cent. of carbonic acid and water; the other, a formal purchase at the same shop, 11.5 per cent. of carbonic acid and 7.7 per cent. of water. The vendor of the latter was prosecuted and fined £5 and 17s. 6d. expenses. In a case where iron pill was asked for, the purchaser was supplied with quinine and iron pill. This was an informal sample. Samples taken subsequently at the same shop were returned as genuine, thus showing that the sale of pills containing quinine in the first instance was an illustration of gross carelessness. 156 PRESCRIPTIONS. It is obviously of the greatest importance to the public generally, and the medical profession in particular, that prescriptions should be made up with absolute accuracy, yet analysis showed that in 25 cases of simple prescriptions handed over the counter, no less than 13, or 52 per cent., of them were found to be inaccurately dispensed. Upon enquiry it was found that in many cases the deficiency of active principles was due to a careless system of dispensing which was becoming common, viz. : the correct quantity of the drug was measured or weighed, but the water was simply added in amount sufficient to fill the bottle, the capacity of which was assumed to be accurate. That this assumption is a dangerous one is shown by the fact that it was found by experiment that a six-ounce bottle may be as much as 5½ drams, or 11.25 per cent. in excess of the reputed contents. Consequently, if the assumed capacity of the bottle is relied upon by the dispenser, and the dose measured, the quantity of the drug ordered by the physician to be taken by the patient will be diminished to this extent. The only way, therefore, in which accuracy in dispensing can be ensured is to measure the amount of water as well as the drugs. It being clear that in these cases there was no intention of fraud or intention to deceive on the part of the chemists, no legal proceedings were taken against them, and, at my suggestion, the Committee directed that a circular letter, of which a copy is here given, should be sent to every prescribing chemist in the City. "DISPENSING. "Several samples of prescriptions recently made up at Chemists' shops "in the City of London have been certified by the Public Analyst to be "deficient in the ingredients required by the formula submitted by the "purchaser. "Investigation shows that in some cases the deficiency of the active "principle prescribed was due to the prevalent custom among dispensers "of weighing or measuring the drug and adding sufficient water to fill "the bottle, the capacity of which is assumed to be accurate. This is a "dangerous assumption, as shown by the fact that a sample of reputed "six-ounce bottles was found to contain on an average 5½ drams in "excess of this quantity, equal to 11.25 per cent. It is obvious that if "the dose be measured, the quantity of the drug taken by the patient "will be diminished to this extent. "Accuracy in dispensing is essential, and this can only be ensured by "measuring the water employed as well as the drugs. 157 "The cases referred to having been reported to the Sanitary Com"mittee of the Corporation of London, I have been instructed to direct "your attention to the importance of this point, which, if not carefully "observed by yourself and your assistants, may render you liable to "proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. As a result of these proceedings some firms in the City now affix a special label to all bottles of medicine compounded by them, of which the following is an example:— "N.B.—In conformity with the new requirements of the Board of "Health Department of the City of London, this Prescription has been "accurately measured into the bottle ; rendered necessary on account "of the inaccurate fluid capacity of bottles. It is suggested that a "graduated glass measure should at all times be used to correctly "measure the dose. Aug. lst, 1907. The only exception that can be taken to this label is that the requirement is no new one, and the words "requirements of Pharmacopoeia Britannica" should be substituted for the words "new requirements of the Board of Health Department of the City of London." Later in the year it was found necessary to take proceedings against several chemists for not making up prescriptions in accordance with the formula asked for. These resulted in the imposition of three fines of £5, and one of £2, with 17s. 6d. expenses in each instance. In none of these cases was it suggested that the offenders attempted in any way to defraud the purchaser, and the prosecutions were instituted solely with a view of protecting the public from the ill effects likely to be caused from carelessness in dispensing, and to induce chemists to take the requisite means for ensuring that the stock preparations and drugs are exactly what they are represented to be by the wholesale manufacturers from whom they obtain their supplies. In one case where a mixture made from a prescription which ordered Iodide of Potassium and Tincture of Cinchona was certified to be deficient in cinchona alkaloids to the extent of 18 per cent., the wholesale dealer subsequently acknowledged that the article they had furnished the chemist with was not up to standard. Such cases, however, in no way relieve the dispensing chemist from his obligations to the public and the medical profession, he is supposed to have the necessary knowledge to be able to test his stock, or he can take the precaution of purchasing all tinctures, &c., under a warranty, which latter is a good defence in any proceedings that may be taken against him. In commenting on the prosecutions referred to above, it has been pointed out in an article in the Pharmaceutical Journal on "Inaccurate Dispensing," that although up to the present, faults in compounding have been dealt with by 158 Local Authorities under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, it is also an offence under Section 15 of the Pharmacy Act of 1868, which enacts that:— "Any chemist who shall compound any medicines of the British "Pharmacopoeia, except according to the formularies of the said Pharma"copoeia, shall for every such offence be liable to pay a Penalty or sum of "Five Pounds." The writer of the article referred to states that:— "Local Authorities acting on the reports of their analysts may even "persuade the Privy Council to move the Pharmaceutical Society to "take action. Proceedings could only be instituted by the Registrar, "and it will be noted that medical practitioners, apothecaries and patent "medicine mongers cannot be hit for the foregoing offence." Although the Pharmaceutical Society has not had occasion to exercise the powers which it has in this connection, it must be borne in mind that such powers have not lapsed, and that if in consequence of habitual carelessness on the part of compounders the Council is called upon to exercise powers conferred upon them by Section 26 of the Act referred to, it will be seen that the consequences may be of much gravity to the offender. This Act provides that:— "The Privy Council may direct the name of any person who is con"victed of any offence against this Act, which in their opinion renders "him unfit to be on the Register under this Act, to be erased from such "Register, and it shall be the duty of the Registrar to erase the same "accordingly." It is a curious fact that in the existing Sale of Food and Drugs Acts no allusion whatever is made to the British Pharmacopoeia, and it is probably due to the reference to that authority in Section 15 of the Pharmacy Act, 1868, before quoted, that for many years it had been customary for magistrates to accept it as a standard in dealing with cases of drug adulteration. It was not until the year 1901 that it was definitely decided in the High Court that:— "If a drug to be found in the Pharmacopoeia is asked for, this drug "must be supplied, and that if it is not sold with the ingredients and in "the proportions prescribed by the Pharmacopoeia, there is at least "primd facie evidence that what is sold is not of the nature, substance, "and quality which was demanded." The above is an extract from the judgment of the Court delivered by Mr. Justice Phillimore in the case of Dickins v. Randerson in the King's Bench Division on the 29th January, 1910. 159 This was an appeal by case stated from the decision of Justices of the West Riding of Yorkshire convicting the appellant, a Pharmaceutical Chemist, upon an information preferred against him by the respondent, an Inspector of Food and Drugs, charging him with unlawfully selling, to the prejudice of the respondent, two ounces of mercury ointment, which on analysis was found to be deficient in mercury. It was contended on behalf of the appellant that he was not by law required to sell mercury ointment to a purchaser in accordance with the standard quality prescribed by the British Pharmacopoeia, except when specially asked by the purchaser to do so, or when making up the prescription of a medical practitioner : and that accordingly it was within the discretion of the appellant to supply the diluted preparation in all cases in which he thought fit to do so, and that he had therefore committed no offence under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. The Justices found that the commodity sold was not of the nature, substance, and quality of the article demanded by the purchaser, and prescribed in the British Pharmacopoeia, whether expressly asked to do so or not. The questions for the opinion of the Court were:— (1) Whether the appellant was so bound as last aforesaid or not. (2) Whether there was any evidence to support the finding of the Justices. (3) Whether the information was properly laid under Section 6 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. (4) Whether the conviction was good in law. The conviction was affirmed. (This important case was fully reported in "The Times" of 30th January, 1901.) The remaining 50 articles examined comprised 14 of mustard, 12 of tinned meats, 11 of cocoa, 6 of lard, 2 each of Demerara sugar and honey, and 1 each of cheese, prawns, and Kello nuts. Some notes on these nuts will be found on page 111. REGISTRATION OF WHOLESALE DEALERS IN MARGARINE AND MARGARINE CHEESE. At the end of 1906 there were 46 dealers in Margarine, and 15 dealers in Margarine and Margarine Cheese on the Register. In November last it was ascertained that the names of 31 firms who had either "gone away" or "removed" remained on the Register, and that there were 18 dealers in Margarine who were not registered. 160 161 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875-1899.

By direction of the Sanitary Committee sixteen persons were cautioned as to the questionable or unsatisfactory character of articles sold by them. MEDICAL EXAMINATION. In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognisance of the appointment, 50 persons were so examined during 164 1907, and of these 7—or 14 per cent.—were reported by me as physically unfit for office. Nineteen officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement, and of these 9—or 47.3 per cent.—were reported to be unfit for duty. In addition to the foregoing, seven medical examinations were made of persons accepted by the Central (Unemployed) Body, on the recommendation of the City of London Distress Committee, for employment on the Labour Colony at Hollesley Bay, established by the Central Body under the Unemployed Workmen Act, 1905. In conclusion, I desire to express to the Sanitary Committee my appreciation of much kindly consideration extended to me during the past year, and to recognise as fully as possible the loyal support and hearty co-operation of the staff by whom, of necessity, the greater part of the actual work has been carried out to the entire satisfaction of the Corporation. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C.

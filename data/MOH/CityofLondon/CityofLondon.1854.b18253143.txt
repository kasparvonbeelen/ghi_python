At a Meeting of the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, held at the Guildhall of the said City, on Tuesday, October the 9th, 1855:— The Medical Officer of Health laid before the Court his Annual Report, which was ordered to be Printed, and a Copy to be sent to every Member of this Court, and the Court of Common Council. JOSEPH DAW, Principal Clerk. THE SANITARY CONDITION of the CITY OF LONDON. SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT. To the Honorable the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Upper Grosvenor Street, October 9th, 1855. Gentlemen, To-day, as the last act of my official connexion with your Hon. Court, I have to lay before you the various mortuary tables, prepared, according to my annual practice, to illustrate the sanitary condition of the City during the twelve-month terminating at Michaelmas. You will see that in the fifty-three weeks for which these tables account, there have died out of 6 your population 3,400 persons, representing the high death-rate of about 25½ per 1,000. During the last six months (including the critical heats of summer) the City has been healthier than its average, and the mean weekly number of deaths has been under 59; but throughout the previous half-year, we had been participating in the general effects of a very unhealthy season, and had been suffering a mean weekly loss of 72 persons. Those unhealthy months, preceding and following last Christmas, included, first, a period* in which the epidemic influence of Cholera had scarcely left the Metropolis, and afterwards a winter of very unusual severity. It will be satisfactory to you to know, that under these unfavorable circumstances, the inmates of the City, with all their disadvantages of crowding, suffered less than other urban populations; and especially during the three months of winter, while (according to the Registrar-General's quarterly return) the average death-rate of town-districts in England was 80 per 10,000, that of the City of London was but 71|. *The more important sanitary facts of this period formed the subject of a separate Report, dated December 19th, on the "Cholera-Epidemic of 1854, as it prevailed in the City of London." 7 I need not trouble your Hon. Court by repeating former arguments, to shew that your present death-rate, even though it contrasts favorably with that of many urban districts, still admits of being . largely reduced: but glancing at the important physical changes you have now wrought within the City, and at their encouraging success, I may express my confident hope and conviction, that, partly through arrangements which are already in operation, and partly through others which will soon come into effect, you possess the means of increasing very considerably the salutary results which yet are only in their dawn. Habitual and detailed inspection of the poorer houses in the City, numbering nearly seven thousand, will indeed still be requisite, even to maintain the vantage-ground you have gained; for the evils incident to such dwellings tend to perpetual relapse, and it is only by incessant vigilance that comparative wholesomeness can be enforced. In respect of all that is necessary for this purpose, I venture to believe that my successor will find his path the easier for his not being the first to tread it: not only because the chief difficulty of applying your Acts of Parliament to the sanitary improvement of the City has now been overcome, and legal precedents have been established ; nor 8 only because the grosser forms of domestic uncleanliness have now been immensely abated; but especially because your Inspectors have grown so familiar with the duties in question, and your copying-clerk so practised in keeping account of all sanitary business, that this department of your work now moves almost with the regularity of a machine.* And other influences, tending year by year to lessen the death-rate of your population, will now come in aid of your sanitary progress. It is inseparable from Science that it must advance. The knowledges which are ministerial to Medicine have in the last few years grown more than in as many preceding generations; and the fruitage of that stately tree begins to give evidence of its widelier-spreading roots. If among these results there may be counted many an improvement in the curative treatment of disease, surely at least equal progress may be predicted for those other and still higher functions of our art, which relate to the *In my Fifth Annual Report I described at some length the routine here adverted to. For the convenience of those who may wish to examine it in detail, I append to my present Report the chief tabular forms which have been in use for the various purposes of my office. 9 maintenance of health by the beneficent agency of preventive medicine. Neither is it of slight moment, that the mechanical appliances of sanitary improvement are at length being warmly discussed by the persons best able to perfect them; and that already, in consequence of such agitation, the means of warming, of ventilation and of drainage, are daily becoming easier of use, cheaper of purchase, more effective of construction. It is a hard struggle, when Science seeks to innovate on the traditions of trade, involved in such questions as these, and to stir the passiveness of common life from its acquiescence in existing evils: but your officers are not likely to overlook the increased facilities now open to them, in respect of various works which they must execute or enforce; and increased experience in itself will ever be rendering more effective both their exertions and your own. Legislative changes too have contributed, in fact or in germ, towards the result which I anticipate. The amended Nuisances Removal Act will very usefully concur with your older sanitary powers; for under its enactments your Officer of Health will possess means, which I wish had fallen to my lot, for enforcing the necessary ventilation of 10 wholesome houses, and for diminishing that fatal overcrowding, against which I have had no sufficient authority to contend. The removal of your great cattle-market has yet to fulfil some of its most important uses: for I trust that the abattoirs connected with your new Smithfield will soon have proved so attractive to many persons who now slaughter within the City, as to justify you in procuring authority to extramuralise the remainder of this craft; and I cannot doubt that the same institution will soon enable you to remove from the neighbourhood of Leadenhall Street that nuisance of the hide-market to which I have so often adverted. Within a few weeks the opening of your new Cemetery, now all but completed, will have terminated for the City for ever the nuisances and scandals of intramural burial, and will have given you the means of greatly diminishing those evils which belong to a retention of the dead within the chambers of the living. Two years hence—and the time will have arrived for the Water Companies, in accordance with the requirements of the Legislature, to have completed their alteration of the intermittent, for the constant system of supply; and to this change, 11 more than to any one future event, I look with certainty that it will vastly increase your means of reforming domestic uncleanliness among the poor, and will relieve you from an amount of obstruction, which hitherto has all but paralyzed your most useful powers. Three years later—though it seems long to wait for so desirable a consummation—and Sir Benjamin Hall's Metropolis Local Management Act will have procured the dispollution of the Thames. Not only will the extreme sanitary evils of tidal drainage have been included in this reform; but, between your long river-side boundary and the opposite flats of Surrey, there will once more flow a stream which may be regarded with complacency, as the means of healthy ventilation through the heart of London. In modes to which I have referred, so much has been done or is doing, and the promise of advantage is so great, that it seems almost invidious to point out what remains undone. Yet I hope you will allow me to remind you of one very great intended good, which hitherto exists only in intention. The City of London possesses no public baths, no public laundries, no model dwellings. These institutions, which in their relation to the poor are beyond most things reformatory and educational, and which seem 12 in a peculiar manner to claim support from the wealth and authority of your great municipal government, have hitherto not made a beginning within the City. But I have reason to believe that many Members of the Corporation feel a warm interest in their projected establishment; and without expressing any opinion as to the degree in which such an undertaking belongs to this Commission, I do very earnestly hope that, either by your agency, or through some other section of the Corporation, there may soon be bestowed upon the industrious poor of the City, east and west, the incalculable boon of public baths and wash-houses; and that instead of many a noisome court, and in contrast to the wretched hovels of to-day, there may soon arise some fruitful types of model dwelling, built as beseems the richest municipality in the world, thoughtful for its laboring poor, and seeking to be recorded in the monuments of a wise beneficence. Reverting to what is at present in operation— to your inspectional system as it has existed for the last four or five years—there may be in it some drawbacks and imperfections, on which, at various times, I have not hesitated frankly and freely to speak. But making all allowance for these, I believe I may honestly congratulate you on having established, at least in rudiment, as a pattern for other local authorities undertaking the like task, all 13 the essential conditions of an effective sanitary superintendence. Through the kindness of the Registrar-General, and through the friendly co-operation of my able professional brethren, the Poor Law Medical Officers of the City of London, I have been kept continuously informed of all those local fluctuations of disease and mortality, which indicate the temporary pressure of sanitary evils. Thus, by voluntary aid, has been supplied the one element for which your own constitution had omitted to provide; an element indeed of primary importance, since certain kinds of disease and death are abnormal phenomena, constituting the evidence of abnormal causes; and since it therefore becomes a first need for the sanitary operations of any local authority, that they should be fully cognisant of such evidence, so far as it relates to places within their jurisdiction. From this simple commencement, expanded year by year according to circumstances, there has started that system of inspection, now prevalent in the City, which embraces in its operation about seven thousand houses; which has had for its immediate result the entire abolition of cesspools, the almost universal adoption of domestic waterservice, the enforcement of periodical house-cleansing, the mitigation of innumerable nuisances; 14 and which promises for its ulterior fruits, some already ripening under your eyes, a great diminution of human suffering and misery. Seven years more, such as have just elapsed—with those increased powers which are at hand, and with exertion proportionate to such powers—will enable you to shew an unequalled example of successful sanitary government; and I hope I may be permitted to express my earnest and respectful wishes for the unimpeded continuance of that career of public utility, which the Commission has already so eminently trodden; assuring you, Gentlemen, that while retaining many grateful recollections of your personal kindness, I shall continue with lively interest to watch the future expansion of that system, under the infancy of which it has been my happiness to serve. I beg to remain, Gentlemen, Your obliged and obedient Servant, JOHN SIMON. NOTE TO TABLE, No. I. In calculating the Death-Rates given in the last lines of this Table, I have proceeded as follows:— First, I have counted all Workhouse-Population and Workhouse- Deaths as forming part of the aggregate population and aggregate mortality of that Union to which the particular Workhouse legally belongs. Next, I have distributed among the several sub-districts the population and the mortality of their Union Workhouses, in the ratio of the general sub-district population; so as to prevent the high Workhouse-Mortality from telling unjustly against that sub-district in which the Workhouse happens to have been erected. Thus, for instance, the East London Union has its male Workhouse placed in the territory of the West London Union; but I have reckoned it as belonging to the East London Union, in respect both of its population and its deaths. Similarly, the City of London Union has its Workhouse situate at Bow; but, not the less, I have considered its 794 inmates and 526 deaths as belonging to the population and the mortality of our central Union. Thus again for the sub-district death-rates—for instance, in the two sub-districts of the East London Union: reckoning the Workhouse-Population not as exclusively due either to Cripplegate or to St. Botolph, but as furnished by these sub-districts jointly, in the ratio of their populations, I have distributed 576 between them in the proportion 23435: 20582. The WorkhouseDeaths of the period (802) have been similarly distributed; and the rates, given in the last line of the table, are finally deduced from a comparison of these sums, viz:— 23435 + 306.66: 2458 + 426.991 :: 1000 : 121.515 which, divided by 5 (to show an annual, instead of a quinquennial, result) gives 24.30 as the annual death-rate for St. Botolph; and, in like manner, 20582 + 269.33 : 2483 + 375.008 gives 137.065 as the quinquennial, and 27.41 as the annual deathrate per thousand for the sub-district of Cripplegate. Hospital-Deaths have been distributed, as far as possible, according to the previous residence of the patients. Thus the north sub-district of the West London Union, in which St. Bartholomew's Hospital is situated, is made to retain only its just proportion of deaths. On the same principle I have reckoned to the death-lists of other sub-districts those cases in which I could ascertain that the residents of such sub-districts had gone to die either in St. Bartholomew's or in other Metropolitan Hospitals.

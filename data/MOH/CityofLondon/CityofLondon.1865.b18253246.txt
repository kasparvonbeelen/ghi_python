THE EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Honourable Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, In accordance with the usual practice, I lay before you, at the expiration of the year, the several Tables which elucidate the Sanitary Condition of the City; and you will perceive that during the last twelve months there have been 1,488 marriages, 2,350 births, and 2,544 deaths among the population under your charge. These numbers are at the rate of 13.0 marriages, 205 births, and 22.2 deaths per 1,000 of the population. In all England the average proportions are 8.4 marriages, 34.8 births, and 22.2 deaths; and during 8 the last ten years the average numbers in the City have been 14.7 marriages, 21.2 births, and 24.8 deaths. The numbers forming this aggregate have been very irregularly distributed. In the East London Union the marriages have been at the rate of 11.1 per 1,000 of the population, in the West London Union 17.4 per 1,000, and in the City of London Union 12.7 per 1,000. The births have been at the rate of 24 per 1,000 in the first-named union, 22.7 per 1,000 in the second, and only 16.2 in the third; but the death-rate has been largest in the Western Division of the City, where it has amounted to 26.8 per 1,000, and smallest in the Central Division (18.2). The proportion in the several districts, as compared with the averages of the last ten years, are as follows:— Death-rate per 1,000 of the Population. 1860. Average of 10 Years. East London Union 23.8 26.4 West London Union 26.8 28.2 City of London Union 18.2 21.3 Entire City 22.2 24.8 All London 26.2 24.0 Districts of Chief Towns 26.7 24.3 Country Districts 20.3 19.9 All England 23.4 22.2 9 These numbers are full of meaning, for in the first place they show that the sanitary condition of every district of the City has been greatly improved during the last ten years,—the average death-rate having been reduced to the extent of about 11 per cent.; and secondly, they show that the aggregate mortality in the City (22.2) is much less than the common death-rate of the Metropolis and the large towns of England (24.3). It stands, indeed, exactly at the average proportion (22.2) for the whole of England during the last ten years. Thirdly, it will be seen that it is less than the proportion in England (23.4) for the year which has just expired, for having been an unhealthy year, the death-rate has been almost everywhere excessive. In London it has risen from 24.0 per 1,000 to 26.2, and in the chief towns of England from 24.3 to 26.7; but here, notwithstanding the existence of cholera, the death-rate has improved from an average of 24.8 to 22.2 per 1,000 of the population. It is true that there are dark spots in the western districts of the City, where the death-rate still stands at a high proportion; but even there the mortality is being gradually reduced, for in ten years it has declined from an average of 28.2 per 1,000 to 26.8. In the classification of deaths according to age, it will be noticed that the number of deaths among infants is becoming gradually less, for in 10 ten years it has declined from an average of 187 per 1,000 deaths to 171; while that of adults, and especially of persons at from 40 to 60, is being steadily increased. This is shown in the following Table:— Proportion of Deaths at different Ages per 1,000 Deaths. Ages. East London Union. West London Union. City of London Union. Entire City. Average of Ten Years. Under 1 188 190 137 171 187 From 1 to 5 208 199 142 183 200 „ 5 to 20 71 64 78 71 75 „ 20 to 40 129 165 137 142 130 „ 40 to 60 177 205 220 200 182 „ 60 and over 227 177 286 233 226 Total all Ages 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,000 In the whole of the Metropolis the proportion of deaths among children of less than five years of age is 438 per 1,000 of all the deaths; and in England it is 426 per 1,000. At first sight, therefore, it would seem that as the number of such deaths in the City is but 354 per 1,000 of the total mortality, the actual death-rate of children is remarkably small; but the contrary is the fact, for we must not forget that the proportion of children to adults in the City population is also remarkably small. This is seen in the diminished birth-rate of 11 the City, which, instead of being at the rate of 34.8 per 1,000 of the population, as it is in all England, or at the rate of 34 per 1,000, as it is in the rest of London, is only 20.5 per 1,000. To be able to judge, therefore, of the comparative mortality of children, the facts must be examined from another point of view, as by looking at the deathrate among infants of less than a year old. In the course of the last year there were 2,350 births in the City, and there were 436 deaths of children under 1 year of age; consequently, of every 1,000 children born in the City during the year, 185 died before they had reached the first birth-day—the proportion in the several districts being from 224 per 1,000 in the Western District, to 154 in the Central. In all England the proportion is but 148 per 1,000, and in the whole of London it is but 151. It is manifest, therefore, that the mortality of infants in the City is excessively large, and it is explained by the circumstance that it represents almost entirely the death-rate of the children of the poor; in fact, year by year as the better classes of the population leave the City, and the residue of the married or productive portion of it gets to be poorer and poorer, the death-rate of infants becomes, as we might expect, larger and larger. In the course of the last ten years it has increased from an average of 170 per 1,000 to 185. 12 That this mortality is excessive there can be no doubt, and it is equally certain that it is due to preventable causes, but how to reduce it is a most difficult problem; for it involves not only the question of the sanitary condition of the houses of the poor, but also the larger questions of their social habits and means of existence. I shall have occasion briefly to discuss these matters in a subsequent page of the report. The diseases which have chiefly contributed to the mortality for the year are the following: of the 2,544 deaths, 341 were from phthisis, 141 from tabes, scrofula, or atrophy, 42 from hydrocephalus, 146 from teething or infantile convulsions, 124 from continued fever, 65 from scarlet-fever, 29 from small-pox, 82 from measles, 118 from whooping-cough, croup, or diphtheria, 17 from erysipelas, 177 from alvine disorders, of which 68 were among children of less than five years of age, 373 from bronchitis, pneumonia, or asthma, and 128 from violence, privation, or poison. Altogether there were 128 deaths from violence and want, 524 from tubercular diseases, 146 from convulsions, 612 from diseases of a zymotic character, and 373 from inflammatory affections of the lungs. During the last ten years the average numbers have been 158, 599, 161, 584, and 476, respectively. In all cases, therefore, excepting the group of 13 zymotic diseases, the proportions for the last year have been below the average; and even in respect of the zymotic group the increase has been chiefly from one kind of disorder, namely, alvine flux, the deaths from which have risen from an average of 93 in the year to 177, and this increase has been entirely among adults—the mortality of children from the disorder having been at the common average of 68 for the year. I hope shortly to make this the subject of a special report, and to show you how year by year, with the progress of sanitary measures in the City, the mortality from alvine disorders has been steadily declining; that while in the course of the first six years after you became possessed of your increased sanitary powers, the average mortality from alvine disorders was at the rate of 64.2 per 1,000 deaths, or 93.5 per 10,000 of the population, it was in the next six years but 14.2 per 1,000 deaths, or 20.6 per 10,000 of the population, and in the six years which have just expired, it has been but 12.5 per 1,000 deaths, or 181 per 10,000 of the population. Some notion may thus be formed of the value of your sanitary labours, although it is perhaps better seen in the diminished mortality from alvine disorders at each successive visitation of cholera. In 1848, for example, when your sanitary powers were enlarged, cholera was among us, and at that 14 visitation the mortality in the City from alvine disorders was at the rate of 219.2 per 1,000 of the deaths, or 63.5 per 10,000 of the population. Six years afterwards, in 1854, there was another visitation of the epidemic, but the sanitary condition of the City had been so improved that the mortality from alvine disorders was reduced to 69.8 per 1,000 of the deaths, or 19.7 per 10,000 of the living. And now at the close of 1866, when we have to record the results of another visitation, we find that the mortality has been only at the rate of 42.8 per 1,000 of the deaths; or 9.5 per 10,000 of the population. Nor is it alone in this comparative reduction of the City death-rates at the several visitations of cholera, that the beneficial operations of your sanitary measures are indicated; it is shown likewise in the low death-rate from cholera in the City during the past year, as compared with that of other European cities which the epidemic has visited. Here the mortality from the disease has not exceeded 7 per 10,000 of the population; whereas in all London it has been at the rate of 18 per 10,000, in Paris 39, in Amsterdam 42, in Naples and in Vienna 51, and in Brussels 163. Besides which it must not be forgotten that the City has stood as a barrier between the eastern 15 parts of the Metropolis, where the pestilence raged so severely as to have caused a mortality of about 64 per 10,000 of the population, and the western districts, which suffered only to the extent of 3.6 per 10,000. Who can doubt, therefore, of the beneficial influence of the sanitary measures which have been exercised in the City of London? for, although there may be no actual or logical proof that a single life has thus been saved, yet it would argue much credulity to believe that all these facts are but mere casual coincidences. Among the other forms of zymotic disease which have advanced in severity, though not to any large extent, during the year, are continued fever and small-pox, the former having increased from an average of 111 deaths in the year to 124, and the latter from 24 to 29. The chief increase of fever has been observed in the Eastern district of the City, and of small-pox in the Western; but the cause of this increase is not apparent, except that the occurrence of small-pox in undue proportion is unquestionable proof of the failure or neglect of vaccination. The principal facts connected with the meteorology of the year are recorded in Table No. VI. of the Appendix. They are deduced, as usual, from the observations at Guildhall, under the 16 superintendence of the Engineer, Mr. Haywood, and they indicate a somewhat remarkable condition of weather; for although the mean temperature of the air (53 degrees Fahrenheit) has been greater than the average for the last eight years (50.7 degrees), and the mean humidity of it (74) has been less than usual (80), yet there has been an excessively large amount of rain. During the preceding eight years the average rain-fall in the City has been 22.41 inches per annum, and the number of wet days has been 158, but last year the rain-fall was 33.68 inches, and there were 197 wet days. This excess of rain was very general throughout the four quarters of the year, as may be seen from the following Table:— Table of Rain-fall, Humidity, and Temperature in each quarter of the year. Quarter ending December 1865. Quarter ending March 1866. Quarter ending June 1866. Quarter ending Sept. 1866. Entire Year. Total Rain-fall (inches) 8.56 9.60 7.42 8.10 33.68 Average of 8 years 5.83 4.35 5.88 6.35 22.41 Number of Wet Days 61 50 41 55 197 Average of 8 years 39 38 41 40 158 Humidity (degrees) 83 81 68 66 74 Average of 8 years 84 85 76 76 80 Mean Temperature 47.3 43.5 56.6 64.8 53.4 Average of 8 years 47.8 41.1 64.1 60.0 50.7 The highest temperature during the year was on 17 the 13th of July, when the thermometer stood at 84 degrees Fahrenheit, and next to this, on the 27th of July, it was at 83.5 degrees. The lowest temperature in the year was 27.4 degrees, and it was registered on the 1st of March; but frequently during the first three months of the year, the thermometer was below the freezing point. The influence of temperature in the death-rate of the City population is shown in Tables No. I. and No. III. of the Appendix; and you will observe that, in almost every district of the City, the largest mortality is in the winter months, when the inclemency of the weather exerts its influence on the aged and feeble. This was not so in former times, when, in consequence of the bad sanitary condition of many of the City districts, the effects of the cold of winter were completely masked by those of the heat of summer—"the higher temperature acting in some sort as a test of defective sanitary conditions, and giving to the several local causes of endemic disease an augmentation of activity and virulence." This was the remark of Mr. Simon in 1853, but it no longer applies in 1866; for even with an epidemic of cholera, the mortality in the City during the summer months has been, in almost every district, less than that of the winter season. c 18 Mortality in each of the City Districts in each of the four quarters of the year.

In the year which has just expired, the average temperature throughout the country has been rather low, and the barometric pressure has been less than usual, while the quantity of rain, and the force of the wind have been excessive. In 1849 and 1854 the phenomena were nearly the opposite of these, for the weather was generally calm, the rain-fall less than the average, and the temperature and barometric pressure were unusually high. As far, therefore, as these phenomena are concerned we are still unable to perceive that there are any special atmospheric conditions peculiar to the epidemic. With respect to the sanitary work of the year, I have to report to you that there have been 19 12,213 inspections of houses, of which 3,271 have been inspections of the registered common lodginghouses. These have resulted in the issuing of 3,068 orders for sanitary improvement—comprising 4,225 separate items; of which 2,080 were for cleansing and lime-whiting the interiors of houses, 845 for cleansing and repairing closets, 588 for amending the water supply and cleansing butts and cisterns, 426 for repairing and trapping sinks and drains, 206 for removing dust and other refuse, 12 for abolishing cesspools, and 12 for abating smoke nuisances. All these numbers are greatly in excess of the average; and I am bound to state that your inspectors have worked during the anxious period of the last year with unusual diligence. I have already reported to you on the necessity for augmenting the sanitary staff of the City, partly because of the gradual development of sanitary work, but chiefly on account of increased prospective duties from the Sanitary Act of 1866. The rate at which the sanitary work has been increasing since the year 1855, when I was elected your Medical Officer of Health, is shown in the following table. c 2 20 Number of Inspections of Houses and of Orders issued for Sanitary Improvement in the City of London in each of the last eleven years:— Years. Houses Inspected.

Rules and regulations in accordance with the provisions of your Act of 1851, were also drawn up and enforced for their proper management; and from that time to the present, the registered common lodging-houses of the City have been under constant supervision. In consequence of this alteration, the number of inspections of houses at once rose from less than 6,000 in the year to nearly 8,000, and little by little it increased to rather more than 9,000, but beyond this it rarely advanced. It was evident to me, however, that it was still necessary to extend the sanitary work of the City; and finding it could not be done with the then existing arrangements, I recommended you to make a complete change in the mode of performing the work, and to appoint officers who should devote the whole of their time and attention to the sanitary business of the City. This recommendation was adopted in 1864, and with a staff of three sanitary inspectors, the number of inspections was increased from about 9,000 in the year to 10,700; in 1865 it was 11,008, and last year it was 12,213. But here, again, it was found that we had reached the limit of work that could be properly done by such a staff of officers; and although the number of 22 inspections was very large, yet there were frequent complaints of the interval which elapsed between the inspections of the poorer class of houses; for as these are not less than 4,000 in number, it was not possible to make a thorough inspection of them more frequently than once in about three months. In many cases the interval is undoubtedly too long, and therefore, at your request, the solicitor and myself undertook a re-examination of the whole sanitary business of the City, and we reported to you thereon in the month of June last. We advised that the City should be divided into four equal districts, with a sanitary inspector for each of them, and we reported in detail on the method of conducting the work. The appearance of cholera in London directly after we had so reported, and the passing of the Sanitary Act of 1866, gave force to our recommendations, and they were adopted as soon as possible; for the Sanitary Act of 1866 requires a very close and constant supervision of the houses of the poor. In other respects, also, it is an important amendment of the Nuisances Removal Acts of 1855 and 1860, for it not only enlarges the definition of a nuisance, but it adds considerably to the power of the local authorities in dealing with it. Until recently, the word nuisance, in all Sanitary Acts had a very limited signification. It was 23 merely applied to such a state of premises, ditches, gutters, water-courses, privies, urinals, cesspools, drains, or ash-pits, or to any animal so kept, as to be in either case a nuisance or injurious to health; but now it includes any house, or part of a house, so overcrowded as to be dangerous or prejudicial to the health of the inmates; any factory, workshop, or work-place not already under the operation of any general Act for the Regulation of Factories, or Bake-houses not kept in a cleanly condition, or not ventilated in such a manner as to render harmless, as far as practicable, any gases, vapours, dust, or other impurities, generated in the course of the work carried on therein, that are a nuisance, or injurious or dangerous to health, or so overcrowded while work is carried on as to be dangerous or prejudicial to the health of those employed therein; and any lire-place, or furnace, or chimney, not being the chimney of a private dwelling-house, sending forth black smoke in such quantity as to be a nuisance. The Act also provides for the inspection of shipping within the jurisdiction of the nuisance authority—a ship or vessel being regarded in the same manner as if it were a house within such jurisdiction, and the master or other officer in charge of it as the occupier. Moreover the Act imposes on the local authority 24 the obligatory duty of inspecting nuisances, and promptly abating them—in default whereof, it empowers the police, under direction of one of Her Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State to take the necessary proceedings, and to charge the cost thereof to the local authority. The powers of the local authority are also considerably enlarged in respect of the cleansing and disinfecting of houses; the providing means for the disinfection of clothing, bedding, &c.; the providing carriages for the conveyance of persons suffering from contagious or infectious diseases; the providing places for the reception of those who have died of any infectious disease, and for the removal of such bodies from rooms in which persons are living or sleeping, and for the burial of such bodies at the charge of the poor-rate, whenever such burial has not been undertaken in reasonable time by the friends or relatives of the deceased; and finally the providing places for the reception of dead bodies awaiting a coroner's inquest—which powers are permissive and not compulsory. But the chief and most important part of the Sanitary Act of 1866, is that which empowers the local authority, under sanction of the Secretary of State, to make regulations for the better management of the lodging-houses of the district, as in 25 fixing the number of persons who may occupy a house or part of a house which is let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family; the registration of houses thus let or occupied in lodgings; the inspection of such houses, and the keeping the same in a cleanly and wholesome state; the enforcing therein the provision of privy accommodation, and other appliances and means of cleanliness in proportion to the number of lodgings and occupiers; the cleansing and ventilating of the common passages and staircases; and the cleansing and lime-whiting of such premises at stated times. A copy of the regulations for these several objects will be found in the Appendix, and being sanctioned by the Secretary of State, they may be enforced by severe penalties; moreover the nuisance authority may at their discretion require payment of costs or expenses either from the owner or occupier, and the occupier so paying may deduct the amount from the rent. In cases where within three months there have been two convictions for over-crowding a house, or improperly occupying a cellar, the justices may direct the closing of the premises for such time as they may deem necessary, and may empower the local authority to close the cellar permanently. Lastly, the Act imposes a penalty of Five 26 Pounds on any person who wilfully and without proper precautions exposes himself in any street, public place, or public conveyance whilst suffering from any dangerous infectious disorder; and on any person in charge of one so suffering; and on any owner or driver of a public conveyance who does not immediately provide for the disinfection of his conveyance after receiving therein an infected person; and on any person who lends, sells, transmits, or exposes any infected bedding or clothing without previously disinfecting them. The importance of these additions to the sanitary powers of the local authority can scarcely be overrated; for although in the City of London they were somewhat anticipated by the provisions of the Sewers' Act of 1851, yet they were not sufficiently defined to be exercised with freedom, and there has always been considerable difficulty in maintaining a proper condition of the lodginghouses of the City. From this time forth, however, the regulations which have been made for their management, and sanctioned by the Secretary of State, will give you ample control, as far as the landlord is concerned, over this class of property; and I recommend that every notice for sanitary improvement should be regarded as a peremptory notice—that no indulgence should be given to landlords to avoid or delay the execution of sanitary 27 works ordered by the Court to be done, for it is through such indulgence that the labours of your officers are seriously increased, and the passive resistance of landlords to your injunctions encouraged. In every case, therefore, where at the expiration of the appointed time for the completion of the works ordered to be done, the work is undone, it should be given over to your workmen for completion, and proceedings at law at once instituted against the offender; for it is only by the force of such examples we can hope to carry out in a proper manner the provisions of the Act. I do not expect, however, that even with the most vigorous exercise of the law, the sanitary condition of the poor will at once be very largely improved ; for the situation of their houses in the narrow courts and alleys of the City, where at times there is not a breath of direct ventilation, and where the foul gases generated in profusion by filthy habits, have no means of escape, but by slow diffusion, will counteract the best efforts at sanitary improvement. Built long ago, when the value of light and air was not at all appreciated, or was interfered with by legislative enactments, and intended for the residence of only a single family, they are unfit for the gregarious occupation of the poor. Besides 28 which the houses are old and dilapidated, and are so saturated with the filth of ages, that nothing will thoroughly cleanse them. Can it be surprising, therefore, that they are the constant abodes of disease; that tabes and scrofula, and hydrocephalus, are the endemic maladies which strike down the infant; and that phthisis and renal affections are the disorders which shorten the life of the adult? Nor is it to be wondered at that they are frequently visited by graver forms of disease, as fever and alvine disorders. In one sense, perhaps, it is encouraging to find that City improvements are fast encroaching upon this kind of property; and if it were not that the destruction of it always leads to the overcrowding of other places equally unfit for a residential population, its demolition would be a manifest advantage. But in this age of improvement, there is little or no concern for the domestic wants of the poor, and the mischiefs which are growing out of such neglect, will soon call for active legislative interference. Model lodging-houses which were built and intended for the poor, are occupied by a superior class of persons, and in reality, there is no house accommodation provided for those who are so largely displaced. What therefore can be expected but this terribly necessitous over-crowding, which the sanitary officer vainly endeavours to lessen? That the habits of the poor 29 have to a certain extent brought about this condition of things, there can be no doubt; for their reckless destruction of property, and disregard of all rules and regulations, have forced them into the hands of the most unfeeling landlords, and have checked that spirit of enterprise which so large a want would otherwise have created. In future legislation, this part of the subject must be considered, and as much attention must be devoted to the duties of the tenant, as to the obligations of the landlord; for it is not enough to provide fit and wholesome dwellings for the poor, it is also necessary that the poor themselves should be taught how to use them. Of what avail are all the sanitary appliances for giving them comfort and cleanliness if such appliances are immediately abused and put out of order? What benefit is there in compelling a landlord to provide a good supply of water to his house, if the receptacles or apparatus are forthwith deranged or broken by the tenants? What encouragement is there in providing proper and decent closet accommodation, when the fouling of closets is a matter of hourly occurrence; or what advantage is there in erecting convenient dust-bins, when instead of using them for the refuse of the house it is cast into the cellars and mixed with the worst description of filth? Such, indeed, is the perversity and ignorance of the poor, in all these matters, that they can 30 hardly be got to use anything in a proper manner which is provided for their cleanliness and comfort; and it is high time that some means should be used to improve their habits in this respect, for they add considerably to the difficulties of enforcing sanitary measures, and give a plausible excuse to the passiveness of landlords. The last point to which I have to refer is that the markets and slaughter-houses have been duly inspected during the year, and the officers have condemned 340,820 lbs., or rather more than 152 tons of meat as unfit for human food. This is nearly twice as much as the average proportion for the last five years. 171,051 lbs. of it were diseased, 148,151 lbs. were putrid, and 21,618 lbs. were from animals that had died from accident or disease. It consisted of 1,044 sheep and lambs, 629 calves, 2,081 quarters of meat, and 6,826 joints of meat. Besides which, there were condemned in the City markets, chiefly on account of putridity, 1,126 head of game and poultry, 8 quarters of venison, and many tons of fish and shell fish.

March, 1914 Annual report of the medical officer of health for the year 1924. * To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C. 21th January, 192 5. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I beg to present herewith the report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Corporation of the City of London for the year 1924. AREA. The City of London (excluding The Temple) comprises an area of 661 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.032 square miles, equal to a square of 1.016 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 1081 miles to a side. DENSITY (1924). City of London, Registration District, at night 202 persons to an acre. ,, ,, ,, ,, during the day *578.5 „ „ Registration London, at night 62.6 „ „ * This figure refers only to persons "actively engaged in the City during the daytime," and is based upon a Census taken in May, 1911. ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London (including the City) was £49,873,798 on 6th April, 1924 ; whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London was £6,614,730 or about one-eighth of the whole County. The sum represented by a penny rate is £27,561. b2 8 POPULATION. The undermentioned figures are extracted from the Preliminary Report of the Registrar-General on the Census of England and Wales, 1921:— City of London (Not including the Temple) Area, Statute Acres. 661 Inhabited Houses. Population. 1911. 2,784 1921. 2,398 1911. 19,657 1921. 13,527 These figures represent the population on the nights of the 3rd April, 1911, and the 19th June, 1921. The following table shows the progressive decline which has taken place since 1861 in the number of inhabitants who reside within the City boundaries, and the progressive increase in the number of workers who are daily employed the City:— Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population. 1861 112,063 - 1866 — 170,133 1871 75,983 — 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 — 1911 19,657 364,061 1921 13,706 — There is only one registration district in the City. The estimated population of the City for the year 1924 is 13,330. The day Census taken in 1911 showed that the day population was 364,061 persons, and also that 1,077,155 persons and 94,095 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the count was taken. BIRTHS. During the year 1924, 413 births were registered in the City, 346 of which, however, did not belong thereto. To the remaining 67 must be added the births of 27 children born to citizens temporarily residing outside the City boundary. The number of births, therefore, on which the rate should be calculated is 94. The annual birth-rate was 7.1 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 10 6 per 1,000. In the Metropolis the birth-rate in 1924 was 18 7 per 1,000. MORTALITY. During the year under review, 719 deaths were registered in the District, including 656 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table, p. 11, for details. Deducting these latter, 63 deaths remain, to which must be added those of 88 persons who died in Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered ; the total, therefore, on which the City death-rate is calculated is 151. The death-rate for 1924 was 11.3 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 1.15), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 12.1. DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE.—Of the City deaths, 5.3 per cent, were caused by injuries or violence, as compared with 3.2 in 1922 and 5.8 in 1923. This is 13 below the average for the previous five years.

INFANTILE MORTALITY. The deaths of children under one year of age were at the rate of 117 per 1,000 births, as against 69 for the whole of London. Too much importance should not be paid to what is obviously a high infantile death rate. Statistical results are liable to very considerable fluctuations when numbers are few as is the case in the City. The increase over 1923 of practically 40 per cent, results from a decrease of 17 in the number of births and an increase of 2 in the number of deaths. NOTIFICATION OF BIRTHS ACT, 1907, AND INFANT WELFARE WORK. No new work has been undertaken in connection with Infant Welfare Work. Care has, of course, continued to be given to the City infants and the usual clinic has been held every Wednesday at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Supplies of milk, in some cases at cost price and in others free, have been provided in accordance with the scheme outlined in my annual report for 1921. 442 notifications of births, made in accordance with the Notification of Births Act, were received. Of these only 87 belonged to the City, and the balance were transferred to the appropriate Authorities. Miss Wilkinson, who undertakes the work in connection with the Notification of Births Act and Infant Welfare, reports having made 321 visits in connection with birth notification and 101 special visits in connection with infant welfare. Seven visits have also been made in respect of cases coming within the scope of the Children Act, 1908 ; mainly in relation to nurse children. At the centre above referred to. a total of 564 attendances was made by mothers. ADVICE TO WIVES AND MOTHERS. To ensure that Mothers were in possession of reliable advice on the best methods to adopt in relation to the care of their children, a card was prepared some years ago, a copy of which was handed to all Mothers when the birth of a child was notified. This year it was decided to replace the card by copies of the booklet issued by the National League for Health, Maternity and Child Welfare. This pamphlet has been drawn up with the object of securing uniformity of instruction throughout the country, and it has, I understand, been adopted by a large number of Local Authorities. 11 VITAL STATISTICS OF WHOLE DISTRICT DURING 1924 AND PREVIOUS YEARS.

For years before 1911 some of the corrected rates probably will not be available. The rates should be calculated per 1,000 of the estimated gross population. In a district in which large Public Institutions for the sick or infirm seriously affect the statistics, the rates in Columns 5and 13 may be calculated on a nett population, obtained by deducting from the estimated gross population the average number of inmates not belonging to the district in such institutions. * In Column 6 are to be included the whole of the deaths registered during the year as having actually occurred within the district. In Column 12 is to be entered the number in Column 6 corrected by subtraction of the number in Column 8 and by addition of the number in Column 9. Deaths in Column 10 are to be similarly corrected by subtraction of the deaths under 1, included in the number given in Column 8, and by addition of the deaths under 1 included in the number given in Column 9. † The Medical Officer of Health will be able from the returns made to him by the local Registrar of Deaths, as well as from the quarterly lists furnished by the Registrar-General, to fill in Column 8 in accordance with the rule in the next paragraph below. The Registrar-General, either directly or through the County Medical Officer of Health, will supply the Medical Officer of Health with the particulars of deaths to be entered in Column 9 ; and all such deaths must be included in this Column, unless an error is detected, and its correction has been accepted by the Registrar-General. For Column 4 the Registrar-General will furnish to the Medical Officer of Health a Statement of the number of births needing to be added to or subtracted from the total supplied by the local Registrar. ‡ "Transferable Deaths" are deaths of persons who, having a fixed or usual residence in England or Wales, die in a district other than that in which they resided. The deaths of persons without fixed or usual residence, e.g., casuals, must not be included in Columns 8 or 9, except in certain instances under 3 (b) below. The Medical Officer of Health will state in Column 8 the number of transferable deaths of "non-residents" which are to be deducted, and will state in Column 9 the number of deaths of "residents" registered outside the district which are to be added in calculating the nett death-rate of his district. The following special cases arise as to Transferable Deaths :— (1) Persons dying in Institutions for the sick or infirm, such as hospitals, lunatic asylums, workhouses, and nursing homes (but not almshouses) must be regarded as residents of the district in which they had a fixed or usual residence at the time of admission. If the person dying in an Institution had no fixed residence at the time of admission, the death is not transferable. If the patient has been directly transferred from one such Institution to another, the death is transferable to the district of residence at the time of admission to the first Institution. (2) The deaths of infants born and dying within a year of birth in an Institution to which the mother was admitted for her confinement should be referred to the district of fixed or usual residence of the parent. (3) Deaths from Violence are to be referred (a) to the district of residence, under the general rule ; (b) if this district is unknown, or the deceased had no fixed abode, to the district where the accident occurred, if known; (c) failing this, to the district where death occurred, if known ; and (d) failing this, to the district where the body was found.

Of the 418 births notified to the Vaccination Officers during 1924,114: had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 14 had died before the age for vaccination, and in one case a child was reported as insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in two cases, 210 had removed into other districts, or the vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 77 instances of conscientious objection. The Public Vaccinators performed 38 re-vaccinations during the year, and in addition to the 114 successful vaccinations referred to above, 8 persons were vaccinated for the first time.

Few comments are necessary with reference to the incidence of infectious disease during the year 1924. Diphtheria was prevalent to the extent of 8 cases as compared with 17 in 1923. The number of Scarlet Fever cases was 12 compared with 39 in 1923. There was no case of Erysipelas as compared with 5 cases in 1923. Measles and Rubella are not notifiable diseases and only a few cases of illness of this type were brought to my notice through the medium of the school medical service. Two cases only of Chicken-pox were notified and two of Ophthalmia Neonatorum. The percentage of cases removed to hospital for treatment continues satisfactory, viz. : 95.5. In each instance of notified disease a detailed examination is made of the sanitary condition of the premises where the case occurred and a summary of defects found by the District Inspector is given on page 66. NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.—In the following tables will be found particulars of certificates relating to cases of infectious disease, and information as to the removal of patients to hospitals, infirmaries, &c.

Three cases of Smallpox were reported from outside areas, with which City workers had been in more or less close contact. The customary precautions were taken at the place of employment and other employees engaged in the same place of business were encouraged to be vaccinated. This advice was accepted in twentyfive instances. ISOLATION ACCOMMODATION 6, BRIDGEWATER SQUARE. Suitable accommodation for the isolation and observation of Smallpox cases is provided by the Corporation at No. 6, Bridgewater Square. In my last annual report reference was made to the fact that formal notice to vacate the premises had been received and that the Corporation could continue to occupy them only on a monthly tenancy. Endeavours are being made to obtain alternative provision but, up to the time of writing this report, without success. NURSING OF MEASLES, &c. The Corporation has approved of the expenditure of £25 per annum in respect of the nursing of complicated cases of Measles, Encephalitis Lethargica and Cerebrospinal Fever, and have also agreed to expend the sum of £30 on provision of medical assistance and nursing attendance in necessitous cases of Influenza. No action was necessary under this heading during 1924. TUBERCULOSIS. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY.—The Tuberculosis Dispensary has been open throughout the year for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis of various types on Tuesdays and Fridays from 12-30 to 2-30; on Mondays from 5-0 to 8-0 ; on Thursdays from 6-0 to 8-0 ; and on Wednesdays, 11-30 to 1-0. In all, 251 sessions have been held, and in addition the Tuberculosis Officer has visited cases at their homes when necessary. NEW PATIENTS.—The number of new patients examined was 382 as compared with 378 last year. A.—PATIENTS RESIDENT IN THE CITY, Number of Under observation at the Dispensan on Jan. 1st, pending diagnosis. Examined for the first time during the year. Total.

PATIENTS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FOR DIAGNOSIS.—The wards of the Hospital are open for the reception of cases presenting difficulties of diagnosis which can only be overcome by observation as In-patients. Five resident and 13 non-resident patients were admitted for this purpose. EXAMINATIONS OF SPUTUM.—The following is a summary :— City Residents. Non-Resident. Total. Positive 6 33 39 Negative 39 159 198 RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT.—The number of patients for whom residential treatment was arranged was 55. They are summarised as follows :— Admitted to L.C.C.

Patients resident in the City 12 1 13 Patients non-resident but working in the City 36 4 2 .... 42 48 4 2 1 55 Persons neither resident nor working in the City are transferred immediately to their own Tuberculosis Officer and subsequent arrangements are made by him. This system has worked satisfactorily. PERSONS TREATED AND SUPERVISED AT THE DISPENSARY.— (A) Patients resident in the City. All persons suffering from tuberculosis who are resident in the City may be supervised and treated at the Dispensary. The total number of cases so treated was 76. The number of cases under supervision on December 31st, 1924, was 71, classified as follows :— Arrested 10 Quiescent 24 Active 37 Non-attendances 10 17 It is gratifying to note that only two of the cases classified last year as quiescent or arrested have become active. In addition a large number of contacts are kept under observation. (B) Patients non-resident in the City. (a) Who work in the City. On diagnosis these patients are informed that they can be treated and advised at the Dispensary or transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. The majority decide to remain patients at the Dispensary. (b) Who do not work in the City. On diagnosis these patients are transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough, so none are treated here. TOTAL ATTENDANCES— Insured. Non-Insured. Total. Residents 165 357 522 Non-Residents 710 961 1,671 2,193 In view of the fact that cases in the last stages of the disease are extremely infectious, especially in crowded houses, the Corporation have made arrangements to pay for the maintenance of selected City cases at St. Columbia's Hospital, Swiss Cottage. One such case was admitted during 1924. THE TUBERCULOSIS NURSE.—The work of the Tuberculosis Nurse has been continued on the same lines as former years. 72 homes have been visited and 601 visits made in connection with after care and following up. In addition to the above, patients, some of whom were in an advanced stage of the disease, have been nursed in their own homes. 5 of these cases terminated fatally. For nursing purposes 31 visits were paid. GENERAL.—The following information is supplied in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health. The paragraph numbers correspond with those in Circular 168, and where a number is omitted the subject matter does not concern City work :— (i.) The Tuberculosis Dispensary is at St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the Tuberculosis Officer is Dr. F. H. Young, O.B.E. ; one Tuberculosis Nurse is engaged in the work. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for insured and uninsured persons by the London County Council. (iii.) Patients are referred to the Tuberculosis Dispensary from hospitals, school clinics and other institutions, with all of which there is close co-operation. The services of the Staff and all the resources of St. Bartholomew's Hospital are available for diagnosis and treatment. Many patients are referred to departments of the Hospital for these purposes. (iv.) The Tuberculosis Officer is in constant consultation and communication with general practitioners, so that there is close co-operation between them and the Dispensary. He reminds them when reports are due on insured patients under domiciliary treatment and provides them with copies of the form with names and addresses inserted. (v.) When the diagnosis is in doubt and the patient is under the care of a practitioner, arrangements are made with him for re-examination ; in other cases arrangements are made with the patient, but should he fail to attend, either the Tuberculosis Nurse calls upon him or he is reminded of the appointment in writing. (vi.) The Tuberculosis Officer explains to the patients the importance of the examination of home contacts, and in addition to the necessary visits of the Sanitary Inspectors the Tuberculosis Nurse visits the homes of City residents periodically for the same purpose, and arranges for the attendance of the contacts at the Dispensary at times convenient to them. The supervision of these contacts and the re-examination of suspects among them is secured by the home visits periodically made by the .Nurse. (vii.) Considerable use is made of X-rays from the point of view of diagnosis and decision as to method of treatment to be recommended. (viii.) Experience shows that when the disease is active, residence in an institution more quickly and certainly brings about arrest than when treatment is attempted at home on sanatorium lines, and that the lessons learnt in the sanatorium are sometimes put into practice by the patient on his return home to his permanent advantage. (ix.) Dental treatment is provided by the Dental Department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the Corporation defrays the whole or part of the cost of artificial dentures for necessitous cases. (x.) Nursing in their own homes of patients resident in the City is one of the duties of the Tuberculosis Nurse. Milk has been provided for necessitous persons requiring extra nourishment and in this connection the sum of £20 has been expended. 18 (xi.) Patients suffering from Non-pulmonary Tuberculosis receive advice and treatment from the Surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, to whom they are referred from the Dispensary. Treatment in residential institutions is provided as for pulmonary cases. The Corporation supplies surgical apparatus free of cost for necessitous residents in the City. (xii.) The arrangements for "care" and "after care" are carried out by a subcommittee of the Sanitary Committee, on which two ladies are co-opted as members.* It receives detailed reports on all cases of Tuberculosis occurring among City residents, (xiii.) No local arrangements exist for providing employment for patients, (xiv.) No opportunity has arisen for the use of a shelter, but arrangements would be made for any suitable case if a site were available. (xv.) No special points have been noted as to the incidence of Tuberculosis ; the records do not show that the disease is specially prevalent among any class of workers in the City. (xvi.) The usual methods for preventing the spread of infection are adopted, and pocket sputum flasks are provided free of cost. (xvii.) The principal difficulty encountered occurs on the discharge of a patient from a sanatorium with the disease quiescent. The home environment to which he returns is often unsatisfactory ; suitable occupation near his home may be practically unobtainable, even when remuneration is not the main consideration, and the very considerable benefit gained is in some cases soon lost and the treatment in the sanatorium largely wasted. (xviii.) Difficulties also arise with regard to advanced cases. These are usually very infectious and do not care to go to the infirmary. This has been largely remedied by the arrangement made by the Corporation already referred to. NOTIFICATION OF TUBERCULOSIS.—In August, 1923, the Ministry of Health issued a circular letter, directing attention to the fact that the requirements of the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1912, so far as they relate to the notification of persons suffering from Tuberculosis, did not appear to be fully appreciated by certain practitioners. It was stated that in certain districts more than 40 per cent, of the persons dying from Tuberculosis had not been previously notified as suffering from that disease. Although no difficulty has been experienced in securing notification of City cases, the Sanitary Committee considered it desirable, in view of the above Circular, that a special communication should be addressed to the City practitioners by the Medical Officer of Health asking them to ensure prompt notification in order that it might be possible to deal with cases with the maximum of expedition. The following table sets out the number of cases, both of Pulmonary and Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis, which were brought to my notice during the year 1923, and also the total number of deaths from Tuberculosis among City residents during the same period *— Age Periods.

In both instances the disease was not determined until after death. * The present lady members of the Committee are Lady Cooper, O.B.E., and Miss Crosby, M.B.E 19 TUBERCULOSIS.

(Signed) KENNETH M. WALKER, Mcdical Officer of the Treatment Centre. D 22 VENEREAL DISEASES. The following is a brief summary of the work carried out at the Special Treatment Centre for Venereal Diseases during the year 1924:— At the beginning of the year 240 males and 108 females were registered on the books as receiving treatment, which compares with 461 males and 141 females at the beginning of the previous year. Of these patients, 176 males and 71 females were under treatment for syphilis and 80 males and 27 females for gonorrhoea. New patients admitted totalled 417 as compared with 505 in the previous year, and 583 in 1922 and 758 in 1921. 32 males and 11 females suffering from syphilis discharged themselves before completing the first course, and 4 males and 1 female after completing the first course, but before completion of treatment. 2 males and 2 females completed treatment, but failed to submit themselves to final test ; 10 males and 7 females were transferred to other centres, whilst 7 males and 0 females were discharged after completion of treatment and observation. In the case of gonorrhoea, 72 males and 34 females, out of the total of 150 and 50 of the respective sexes coming under treatment during the year for the first time, discharged themselves before completion of the first course of treatment. The total number of attendances of all persons at the clinic was 10,890, which total is made up as follows:— Syphilis. Soft Chancre. Gonorrhœa. Non.Venereal Conditions. Total Attendances. Male. Female. Male. Femaie. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. 4,005 2,102 . . 3,986 748 29 20 8,020 2,870 A few beds are provided at the Centre for in.patient treatment and the number of days of such treatment totalled : males, 0 ; and females, 9. In the laboratories associated with the Centre 7,040 specimens were examined, 20 for the detection of spirochetes, 1,326 for gonococci, and 5,694 examinations for the Wassermann reaction. The following tabulation indicates the number of patients coming under treatment for the first time from the Counties stated and also the examinations which were made for the detection of Gonococci and for the Wassermann reaction in respect of these patients :— No. of patients treated.

No specimens were submitted by general practitioners for examination for gonococci. EXAMINATION FOR PATHOGENIC BACTERIA. Any medical practitioner desiring examinations of specimens for pathogenic bacteria in cases of suspected infectious disease occurring amongst their patients residing in the City, should forward them to the Medical Officer of Health at the Guildhall. Arrangements have been made for free examination, and the results obtained are communicated as speedily as possible. During the year the following specimens were so dealt with. It will be seen that positive results were obtained in 11.6 per cent, of these cases. Result. Specimen. Disease suspected. Positive. Negative. 33 Swabbings from throats Diphtheria 4 29 10 Sputum Tuberculosis 1 9 Of the 33 swabbings from throats, 9 were received from the Central Foundation School for Girls, Spital Square, E.C. These swabs were sent to the City Pathologist in accordance with the arrangements between the City Corporation and the London County Council. This school is situate partly in the City and partly in the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, and pupils attend from many parts of the East and North.East of London, and also Boroughs and Urban districts in Essex and Middlesex. 23 DISTRIBUTION OF DIPHTHERIA ANTI.TOXIN AND ANTI.INFLUENZA VACCINE. Provision has been made for the distribution of Diphtheria Anti.toxin in accordance with the Diphtheria Anti.toxin (London) Order, 1910, and also for the distribution of Anti.Influenza Vaccine in accordance with the suggestion contained in the letter from the Ministry of Health, dated 20th December, 1919. One application for a supply of Diphtheria Anti.toxin was received during 1924, but none for Anti.Influenza Vaccine. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES. In consequence of reports by your Medical Officer of Health to the Sanitary Committee during 1923 and 1924, the Committee, after careful consideration of the circumstances, submitted the following report to the Corporation :— We beg to report that we have had our attention directed by your Medical Officer of Health to the question of housing accommodation for the working classes generally in the City, and to the fact that a state of matters exists which presents a difficult problem and one needing immediate attention. From the details supplied by your Medical Officer of Health it appears that, apart from the houses contained in the Improvement Schemes for the Hutchison Street and Queen's Court, Vine Street, Minories Areas, there exist in the City some forty other houses which at the present moment are unfit for human habitation, a similar number which are already arriving at a state of unfitness, and many houses which are available for sale, and on the sites of which business premises, rather than dwelling.houses, would be erected if the sale could be effected. This will doubtless happen when the Rent Restrictions Act ceases to be operative. The position, therefore, is as follows:— The majority of the houses of the working classes, other than the specially designed tenement houses, exist as single houses, or as small groups of two or three forming part of a court, or as a group of eight or ten forming a complete court. A few of these houses are let for the use of one family, but the majority are sub.let into tenements. The tenement houses are essentially converted houses, and by no stretch of imagination can they be assumed to possess satisfactory amenities, particularly for the residents in the upper floors. These houses constitute the remnants of Court property which at the time of the wholesale clearances of some thirty or forty years back were considered good enough to leave standing whilst the worse neighbouring houses were demolished. The result of leaving these houses has been that on the sites of the now demolished houses, warehouses have been erected. The original building lines, although perhaps straightened out to some extent, have often resulted in a lesser space between adjoining properties being left than was the original case. As a consequence, even if these residential houses were internally equipped with all the essentials necessary to make life pleasant or comfortable, they would still be handicapped by external deficiencies. External ventilation is, as a consequence, often defective ; in the majority of houses the lighting, particularly of the lower rooms, is markedly deficient, and in the course of years the fabric of most of them has deteriorated by the wearing process of age. The tenants who have entered into occupation have not been able to discriminate, since possibly they have been compelled to occupy these tenements either from the necessity of living close to work or of being unable to obtain better premises. Much of this property is three or four storeys in height. Sanitary conveniences may be found either in the basement or on the ground floor. It is the exception to find a convenience at a higher level. Water supply is similarly inadequate ; sinks are the exception ; the cooking provision, if it exists, is of a meagre type ; storage provision is limited ; there is no privacy, since doors open off small landings ; domestic washing can only be performed under difficulty, and coal must be stored in an unsuitable place. There is no encouragement to keep the place clean owing to the increased labour which obtaining water and the disposal of slops entails. Children must needs play in the streets, and as the stairs are frequently dangerous it necessitates, in the case of the very young, the mothers taking charge of them, and as a consequence the youngest children only obtain fresh air when they accompany their mothers on visits or shopping excursions. One careless tenant in such a house produces an effect on all the other occupants which is altogether disproportionate to the original evil. A number of these houses are without through ventilation. The state of repair is reflected in the windows, some of which will not open, and yet let in draughts of air. Constant attention by the Sanitary Staff to roofs, cleansing and general sanitation is the rule. The result is that many persons are housed under conditions which are not compatible with a healthy existence. Rents are very high, because the requirements of the Sanitary Authority must be attended to, and involve the landlord in constant expenditure. The social grade to which the occupants of those houses belong is that of the more lowly paid. If they reside far from their work the daily expenditure on omnibus, tram or train fares involves the outlay of a considerable part of the weekly income, not to mention the encroachment on their leisure hours by the time taken up in travel. d 2 24 Two hundred and seventy.seven houses have been inspected and fully reported upon, and they may be grouped as follows :— 1. Houses unfit for human habitation. Houses which present the before recited conditions in an aggravated form are regarded as unfit for human habitation. Of those inspected, forty.four come within that category. The statistics relating to them are as follows :— Number of houses recorded as unfit for human habitation 44 Number of separate tenements in these houses 79 Number of occupants M. F. Over 10 98 86 Under 10 10 22 Total 216 Number of families in which one or more members work in the City 86 Number of families in which no member works in the City 10 2. Houses rapidly approaching a state of unfitness. These houses, like the already unfit houses, are old and worn out, and it is due mainly to the fortune of having careful tenants that they have come to be regarded as being just fit. The remaining life of these houses is only a short one, and the future period of occupation depends to a great extent on the tenant. The statistics relating to these houses are as follows :— Number of houses recorded as rapidly approaching a state of unfitness 44 Number of separate tenements in these houses 58 Number of occupants M. F. Over 10 58 83 Under 10 13 17 Total 171 Number of families in which one or more members work in the City 52 Number of families in which no member works in the City 6 3. Houses which are let in tenements, but which do not possess the minimum amenities for the occupants, and which it is known are in the market for sale, and which, further, if the Rent Restrictions Act were non.operative, would be sold and the tenants required to find other accommodation. These houses are those which are immediately involved in the commercial spread, and in a very few years time the majority of them will be non.existent as residences. The statistics relating to these houses are as follows:— Number of houses recorded as not possessing the minimum amenities, and which are for sale or conversion into offices, &c 38 Number of tenements in these houses 68 Number of occupants M. F. Over 10 64 87 Under 10 18 23 Total 192 Number of families in which one or more members work in the City 56 Number of families in which no member works in the City 11 In addition to the above, your Honourable Court will remember that there are 885 persons resident in the Hutchison Street Insanitary Area. Of these, not less than 200 are living in houses which at the present time are unfit for human habitation, and also before this Area can be dealt with it will be necessary to find accommodation for 140 other persons, otherwise the preliminary demolitions to enable the block of dwellings, already approved, cannot be commenced, since the houses in which these latter persons reside are unfortunately not the same as those in which the 200 reside. It is necessary, therefore, that accommodation be provided for this number of persons now resident in the Hutchison Street Area. Further, the number of persons living in houses unfit for human habitation in the Vine Street Area totals seventy.two, and immediate provision is similarly necessary for these persons. The summary of accommodation required is therefore as follows :— Number of Persons who reside in the City and for whom Housing Accommodation is immediately required, or for whom it will be required in the near future. Total number of persons to be ultimately rehoused in respect of the Hutchison Street Area 885 Of these— Number of persons resident in houses now unfit for human habitation 200 Number of persons resident in houses which it is necessary should be demolished to enable the Hutchison Street Scheme to be proceeded with, say 140 Number of persons in houses in the Vine Street Area unfit for human habitation 72 Number of persons resident in houses in the City which are to.day unfit for human habitation 216 628 In addition to the above, provision will also later require to be made on the Hutchison Street Area for the following:— Balance of persons on the Hutchison Street Site not provided for as above 885 — (200 + 140) 545 Number of persons resident in houses which will be unfit for human habitation when the above work is completed 171 Number of persons who live in houses which will be demolished for business premises as soon as Rent Restrictions Act is removed, say 192 — 908 Making a total of 1,536 25 We have carefully considered the representations made to us by your Medical Officer of Health. In view of the fact that it is practically impossible whilst the Rent Restrictions Act remains in force to obtain possession of dwelling.houses, even if they are not in all respects properly habitable, unless some alternative accommodation for the tenants is forthcoming, we can see no other means of successfully dealing with the problem except by the provision of alternative accommodation. No site for this purpose can be found in the City, but we are advised by your Engineer that he has inspected various sites and has in view one within three miles of the City on which balcony.type tenement dwellings, containing about 420 rooms in all, can be erected to give accommodation to about 600 people, at an estimated cost of £95,000 inclusive of the land. The gross annual income from the dwellings, if the rents were based on the average rent now being paid by the tenants in the City who would be dehoused, viz., 2s. 9d. per room per week, would be £3,003, and after deducting 25 per cent, for maintenance, administration, empties, etc., there would be a net annual income of £2,252. The annual cost of a loan of £95,000, calculated at the rate of 5½ per cent, per annum to include interest and sinking fund for sixty years, will, it is estimated, be £5,225 per annum, so that the net loss on the undertaking for that period may be put down as £2,973 per annum, which on the present rateable value of the City represents less than 1 /9th of a penny in the £. The erection of these tenement dwellings, as your Honourable Court will doubtless appreciate, is proposed as the best solution in our opinion of the problem to be dealt with, and in the circumstances we cannot see our way to advise that it is properly an undertaking to which the Government should be expected to contribute, and as far as the rehousing of the persons from the Queen's Court, Vine Street, Minories Area Improvement Scheme is concerned, your Honourable Court will doubtless remember that it has already decided to bear the whole cost of that Scheme. Having given the whole subject our earnest and prolonged consideration, we beg to recommend to your Honourable Court that housing accommodation for approximately 600 persons should be provided on a site outside the City at a total estimated cost of £95,000, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Health, that no Government contribution be sought towards the cost, and that we be authorised to take such steps as may be required to carry the proposal into execution with as little delay as possible, including, if necessary, a compulsory order for the acquisition of the site selected. All which we submit to the judgment of your Honourable Court. Dated this twenty. fourth day of June, 1924. Signed on behalf of the Committee, S. ALDERTON, Chairman. The above report sets out the state of affairs as existing in the City at the present time. The Court of Common Council adopted the report and accepted the recommendation of the Sanitary Committee to the effect that tenement dwellings to accommodate about 600 persons be erected for the purpose, on a site outside the City, at a total estimated cost of £95,000, subject to the approval of the Ministry of Health, and that the Committee be authorised to take all necessary steps to carry the matter into execution. Subsequent to this the Committee authorised the purchase of a site in Shepherdess Walk, Shoreditch. Application has been made to the Ministry for the purpose of compulsorily acquiring this site and a public enquiry will be held in the month of March, 1925. The site chosen will house about 500 persons. The acquisition of this site and the erection of tenements as contemplated will not, however, represent the final action in respect to housing those City residents whose homes are at the present time unfit for human habitation ; further action will require to be taken on the completion of the above proposals.

HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. A system of voluntary registration of hairdressers' establishments with the Department of the Medical Officer of Health was instituted in 1904. At one time there were 32 establishments registered in the books of this Department. This number has now, however, been reduced to five. This reduction has been gradual and doubtless results from the facilities offered by the Corporation, through the County Purposes Committee, for the proprietors of hairdressing establishments to obtain the statutory registration provided for by the London County Council (General Powers) Acts of 1915 and 1920. These Acts deal with the control and registration of massage establishments and, as the business of hairdressing and massage treatment are frequently associated, the statutory registration and licensing have been regarded by the proprietors of those establishments where both trades are conducted as in substitution for voluntary registration. I understand that 123 of the hairdressers' establishments in the City have now been registered, in addition to ten chiropodists who are not hairdressers, in accordance with these Acts. As, however, the regulations for voluntary registration were designed to ensure precautionary measures with regard to the prevention of contagious diseases, and as they still serve a purpose in this direction in respect of premises not otherwise registered, I am of opinion that it is desirable that the voluntary system be continued. The following is a list of establishments at present on the register :— Alfred Kingston, 8 & 10, Ludgate Arcade. Chas. Lehman, 8 & 9, Aldermanbury Postern. Thos. W. Monk, 5, Angel Court. Ed. Hy. Prince, 36, Coleman Street. Harry C. Wicks, trading as Arthur & Co., 42a, Old Broad Street. * Not including " Unfit Houses " on two insanitary areas which are already the subject of Improvement Schemes. 27 SMOKE AND ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Thirteen instances of smoke nuisance or annoyance from chimneys were dealt with during the year. Some of these were of a temporary character and did not recur, others were abated upon service of the usual form of notice upon the offenders and there has been no occasion to take further action. As mentioned in previous Reports, the annoyance and the evil from coal smoke cannot satisfactorily be dealt with by law until the enactments at present in force are strengthened or amended. Much dirt and discomfort from smoke continues, although to a distinctly lesser degree than in former years, and for which the enormous number of the chimneys, domestic and otherwise, in and surrounding Greater London is largely responsible. Difficulties in the way of obtaining suitable coal and coke are still stated to be a source of trouble at times. A critical examination of the air in the City was commenced in the year 1914, in conjunction with the Committee for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, appointed by the International Exhibition and Conference in London, 1912. A large rain gauge is mounted upon the roof of one of the Corporation's buildings in Golden Lane, and the rain.water from a known area of surface is collected monthly. This rain.water, containing the soot, grit and dust washed from the air, has been submitted for examination to the Public Analyst and the results tabulated. For comparison the results obtained from similar observations made at the Archbishop's Park, Lambeth, by the London County Council, are shown in the attached table. The table also shows the rainfall for the months of January to December of the year 1924, and the amounts found of insoluble matter, tar, soot and dust, also the soluble matter, together with the sulphates, ammonia and chlorine in the volume collected. The results as given by the Public Analyst have been re.calculated into metric tons per square kilometre during each month. One metric ton per square kilometre is equivalent approximately to 9 lbs. per acre, or 2.56 tons per square mile. Although the presence of much impurity in the atmosphere has been long known the figures given represent a definite record of the facts. In examining the table it will be appreciated that in the month of July only, the amount of deposit registered as falling in the City amounted to 20.96 tons per square kilometre, which is equal (estimating the City as having an area of one square mile) to no less than about 53.6 tons avoirdupois. Of this mass of dirt, approximately 24.9 tons were soluble, and included the chemicals mentioned, and 28.7 tons were insoluble and consisted of tar, carbon and grit. In addition to the foregoing, a daily observation has been made at mid.day at the Guildhall of the purity of the air by a modern dry method, by which the suspended matter can be readily demonstrated. From the 1st January until the 31st December the amount of the impurity at noon has varied from half a milligramme to six milligrammes per cubic metre of air ; this latter figure includes times when there has been a fog. For many years past it has been increasingly obvious that the use of electricity and gas for heating and cooking purposes is contributing to the diminution of the nuisance from smoke. The cost of electricity is still far too great for its general use, but I believe the substitution of gas for coal and coke in restaurants and business premises is practicable and might be more generally adopted if the gas companies 28 encouraged its greater use, possibly to their own profit and certainly to the advantage of the populace, by arranging a special rate for the supply to premises of the class indicated. Were such special terms for gas as those suggested arranged, I am of opinion that the increased purity of our atmosphere, as would be observed by City workers, would be so marked than an agitation against the unnecessary use of common coal would result and public opinion might even extend to statutory prohibition being enforced.

During the year the bodies of 5 persons buried at the City of London Cemetery at Ilford have been exhumed and subsequently re.interred in other graves in the same Cemetery. In accordance with the terms of the licences issued by the Home Secretary in respect of these cases, the work of removal and re.interment was carried out in the early morning under the supervision of your Medical Officer of Health. 30 REMOVAL OF HUMAN REMAINS. 75/79, FARRINGDON STREET (Corner Stonecutter St.). During the course of excavations for a new building on land facing Farringdon Street, and extending southwards from Stonecutter Street, a considerable number of human remains were discovered. Reference to Ordnance Maps of the City, contained in the Guildhall Library, would seem to show that the building, which formerly occupied the site, was erected on a portion of what was once a burial ground attached to St. Bride's Church and which was given by the then Earl of Dorset and consecrated in 1610. It included some 750 square yards. One old Ordnance Map shows that in 1600 this area of land was part of a field, and a later map of 1667 shows it as a burial ground abutting on what appears to be the banks of a stream called the New Canal, along the course of which the present Farringdon Street is built. A map dated 1741.1745 shows the same burial ground, as abutting on to Fleet Market, a name which the thoroughfare apparently possessed before it was termed Farringdon Street. It was the practice in a large number of London Parishes to arrange for " poor grounds " where the poor could be buried, and before workhouses were established, these burial grounds were actually part of the churchyard. It is possible that this land is one of these pauper burial grounds for St. Bride's Parish. The bones which were discovered were at such a deep level that in part they represent burials of a few centuries ago. It is probable that some persons who died of plague were buried there, but it was not a recognised plague pit. When the plague was at its height, it seems more than probable that the ordinary burial grounds were rapidly filled, and that, to relieve the urgency, pits were introduced. The remains were all dry and free from any offence and the removals were carried out under my supervision, in accordance with the terms of the Home Office license, and no nuisance was created or unseemly conduct observed on the part of those engaged on the work MONUMENT SQUARE (Site of St. Margaret's Churchyard). In the course of excavations, in connection with the laying of electric light mains under the carriageway of Monument Square, a small number of human remains, in all about half.a.bushel of bones were unearthed. They bore evidence of having been previously disturbed, were quite dry, and not in an offensive condition. Monument Square stands on the site of St. Margaret's Churchyard and presumably the bones now discovered are some that were overlooked when the graveyard was cleared. The circumstances were reported to the Police and Coroner, and the remains later re.interred on the site with the observance of due decency. SUPERVISION OF FOODS AND DRUGS. During the year 1924, 972 samples of Food and Drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Of this number, 722 were taken as test samples without the formalities of the Acts being observed ; of these 19 were found adulterated, made up as follows :— 3 of Vinegar out of 40 samples taken. 2 of Condensed Skimmed Milk Sweetened out of 38 samples taken. 2 of Milk out of 34 samples taken. 2 of Strong Tincture of Iodine out of 2 samples taken. 1 of Butter out of 72 samples taken. 1 of Condensed Full Cream Milk Sweetened out of 17 samples taken. 1 of Cream out of 11 samples taken. 1 of Gregory's Powder out of 7 samples taken. 1 of Margarine out of 30 samples taken. 1 of Purified Borax out of 8 samples taken. 1 of Ground Rice out of 6 samples taken. 1 of Semolina out of 9 samples taken. 1 of Tapioca out of 2 samples taken. 1 of Malt Vinegar out of 11 samples taken. 31 Of the formal samples 24 out of 250 were found to be adulterated, made up as follows :— 12 of Milk out of 210 samples taken. 4 of Rum out of 6 samples taken. 2 of Gin out of 6 samples taken. 1 of Purified Borax out of 1 sample taken. I of Condensed Skimmed Milk Sweetened out of 2 samples taken. 1 of Cream out of 1 sample taken. 1 of Strong Tincture of Iodine out of 4 samples taken. 1 of Vinegar out of 2 samples taken. 1 of Whisky out of 6 samples taken. The above samples, in all cases except Milk and Spirits, were taken as the result of informal samples having been certified as being adulterated. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.—The percentage rate of adulteration of all foods sampled in the City was 4.4 as compared with 5.0 for 1923. BUTTER.—The recorded instance of adulteration of Butter was " excess of moisture." MARGARINE.—The adulterated sample of Margarine contained an excess of moisture. DRUGS.—Six samples of Drugs were found not to comply with the British Pharmacopoeial standards. Cautions were issued in five instances and there was one prosecution. SPIRITS.—Recent decisions in the High Court have considerably strengthened the hands of Local Authorities in relation to the sale of Diluted Spirits, and legal proceedings were instituted in all instances except one where samples of spirits had been sold at a strength below the statutory minimum of 35 degrees under proof. Penalties were inflicted in each case. MARGARINE ACT, 1887.—One sample of Margarine was sold in a plain wrapper. The vendor was cautioned. BUTTER AND MARGARINE ACT, 1907.—A contravention was recorded in one instance where a sample of Margarine was found to contain an excess of water. The vendor was cautioned. SALE OF BUTTER REGULATIONS, 1902.—One instance of an excess of moisture in Butter was found. The vendor was cautioned. The Public Health (Dried Milk) Regulations, 1923, came into operation on 1st May, 1924. Standards for varying grades of Dried Milk were established, and certain conditions of labelling are required, which include a declaration of the contents of the tin or other receptacle in which the Dried Milk is sold. The Departmental Committee on the Use of Preservatives and Colouring Matters in Foods issued its Final Report on 30th September, 1924. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS AND MILKSHOPS ORDERS, 1885, 1886 & 1899. No instance of contravention of these Orders was found during the year. The administrative supervision of the premises of milk retailers in the City is carried out under the Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act, 1922, details of which will be found under that heading on page 32. REGISTRATION OF MANUFACTORIES AND PREMISES OF WHOLESALE DEALERS IN MARGARINE AND MARGARINE CHEESE. A notification was received from a firm of Margarine Manufacturers of a change in the name of the Company. There was no alteration in any other respect and the necessary adjustments were made. No new applications for registration were received during the year. E 2 32 ICE CREAM. The customary inspections in connection with the manufacture and sale of Ice Cream were carried out during the summer months. In instances where the place of manufacture was found to be outside the City, enquiries were made in order to ascertain whether the ice cream was being produced under proper conditions. Two replies under this heading stated that either the premises or the process employed was not satisfactory, and suitable action was taken by the Authorities concerned. In one instance the barrow and utensils used by an itinerant vendor were found to be in a neglected condition, and the barrow did not bear the name and address of the vendor displayed in a conspicuous manner. Enquiries from the Authority of the district in which the address given was situated showed that the conditions there were satisfactory. This vendor was cautioned. Infringements of the regulations were found at seven premises within the City area. The occupiers were at once notified. Suitable alterations were made in six cases, and in the remaining instance the manufacture was discontinued. THE MILK AND DAIRIES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1922. The supervision of the sale of milk has been continued throughout the year on the lines indicated in my Annual Report for 1923. Twelve new applications for Registration as Retail Purveyors of Milk were received and investigated. Eleven of these were eventually approved, and one was refused owing to the premises being unsuitable. In two instances, the consideration of which was not completed before the end of 1923, liberal periods of grace were given to milksellers to enable them to make arrangements which would satisfy the requirements laid down. In two cases radical alterations were made to premises in order to complv with the minimum requirements of the Sanitary Committee for basements used as dairies or in connection with dairy work.

Licences issued under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923 4 INSPECTIONS OF PREMISES WHERE MILK IS RETAILED. During the year 1924, 463 inspections were made in connection with the supervision of the sale of milk. These included routine inspections and visits to supervise various improvements and alterations found to be necessary during the initial enquiries made under the Milk and Dairies (Amendment) Act during 1923. EXAMINATION OF MILK..CHEMICAL, BACTERIOLOGICAL AND AS TO PRESENCE OF DIRT. (A) CHEMICAL.—The percentage of milk adulteration for both formal and informal samples together is 5.7 compared with 7.5 for 1923. Of the 14 adulterated samples 12 were formal and 2 were informal samples. There were five prosecutions and penalties were imposed in each case except two, where the summonses were dismissed as the defendants each proved a warranty. 33 The following table shows the percentage of fat contained in each of the 244 samples of milk examined. Nine out of this number contained fat in amounts below the point which presumes adulteration, i.e., 3 per cent. The highest amount of fat contained in any sample was 10.4 per cent.:— Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. 2.5 4 4.0 14 2.7 1 41 9 2.8 3 4.2 3 2.9 1 4.4 4 30 5 4.5 2 31 14 4.6 1 3.2 24 4.7 1 3.3 24 4.8 2 3.4 23 4.9 1 3.5 27 5.0 1 3.6 29 5.2 1 3.7 14 5.3 1 3.8 18 6.0 1 3.9 15 10.4 1 Total 244 During the year special enquiries were made with reference to the samples which contained a percentage of fat exceeding 4.2. Four were of milks sampled in the course of delivery at Railway Stations, two were ascertained to have been milk from Jersey cows, and the amount of fat therefore was not excessive. Eight samples were taken from shop containers, and the circumstances were such as to suggest that the neglect of proper stirring by the retailer had increased the proportion of fat in the earlier sales of milk at the expense of those made later in the day. (B). BACTERIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK SAMPLES COLLECTED AT RAILWAY TERMINUS. In August, 42 samples of milk were collected on arrival in the City, and submitted to Sir F. W. Andrewes, F.R.S., City Bacteriologist, for examination and investigation as to presence of " dirt." These samples arrived from 42 different farms, viz., 16 in Norfolk, 12 in Essex, 9 in Suffolk, 2 in Hertfordshire, 2 in Cambridgeshire, and 1 in Huntingdonshire. The following is a summary of Sir F. W. Andrewes' report :— Dirt.—These 42 samples were on the whole very good in this respect. No really dirty sample was found. The " traces " noted represented a few blackish or greyish specks in the deposit, and even these were absent in 20 out of the 42 samples. Tubercle.—Three of the inoculated guinea pigs died prematurely, within the first 3 or 4 days after inoculation. These experiments are noted as " frustrate." Two further animals died of enteritis due to Gartner's bacillus, 12 and 19 days after inoculation. The absence of any inflammatory re.action at the site of inoculation, or in the regional glands, renders it almost certain that no tubercle bacilli were present. These experiments are noted as " probably negative." Deducting the three frustrate experiments, five animals out of the remaining 39 developed tubercle or 12.8 per cent. In returning an animal as tuberculous the following points have been observed :— (1) The naked eye appearances have been characteristic. (2) Acid fast bacilli have been demonstrated in the lesions, though sometimes only one or two could be found. (3) Egg.cultures have been made and have yielded no immediate growth of any organism other than the tubercle bacillus. No growth of the latter can be expected for some weeks. (Signed) F. W. ANDREWES. St. Bartholomew's Hospital. October 21st, 1924. From the following statement of results obtained since 1904 it will be seen that the improvement indicated by the decrease in the percentage of Tuberculous Samples shown in 1922 and 1923 has not been maintained. 34 Year. Percentage showing Tuberculous Infection. Year.

Enquiries were instituted by him at the several farms mentioned, and the following information obtained :— Sample No. 24.—The Council's Veterinary Inspector reports that the farm is conducted on " up.to.date " principles and possesses a herd of 21 cows. No evidence of disease could be detected, all the animals being healthy and well cared for. Several cows, however, had been sold in the interval between the taking of the sample and the examination of the cows on the 17th inst., and it is possible that the sample was that of a milk from one of these. Sample No. 30.—Forty.five cows. No evidence of disease .could be detected, but one cow, on account of suspected tuberculosis, had been sold previously. The condition of the herd was quite satisfactory. Sample No. 32.—Fifty.five cows. One cow suffering from generalised tuberculosis, is to be slaughtered, and was, in fact, being removed on the day of the Inspector's visit. Sample No. 37. The farmer has died since the sample was taken and the whole of the stock was sold on the 1st instant. The present farmer is not sending milk to London. Sample No. 41.—One cow, with a suspicion of tuberculosis is to be " put dry " and prepared for slaughter. Several other animals have recently been sold for slaughter. The herd, as a whole, is young and well looked after. 84 cows were examined. At the same time as the above milks were obtained for bacteriological examination samples were also taken for the purpose of chemical analysis. With two exceptions these samples proved to be genuine milk and all were free from boric acid or formalin. The offences in the cases of these two exceptions were :— Sample No. 636 2% of added water. Sample No. 658 4% of added water. The vendors of these samples were cautioned. Four subsequent samples were obtained from the vendor of No. 636, one of which was reported as having had 4% of the original fat abstracted. Theotherthree samples conformed to the required standard. The vendor was cautioned again. It was not possible to obtain a further sample from the vendor of Sample No. 658, as he has ceased sending milk to the City. In order that the danger of contamination during the process of sampling may be reduced to a minimum, suitable precautions are taken. On the arrival of the milk train and as soon as the churns have been deposited on the platform, certain churns are selected from which it is proposed to take the samples. The milk in these churns is thoroughly mixed with a clean plunger. A stout new indiarubber band is then twisted round the neck of the sample bottle to form a handle. The bottle is always sterilised by the bacteriologist before use. The stopper is removed and the bottle lowered into the milk and filled. The bottle is withdrawn from the churn, the stopper immediately replaced and a clean linen cover tied over it. It is then labelled. Six samples are taken at one session. In order that there shall be no transference of infection or contamination from one churn to another, through the medium of the plunger, this is thoroughly cleansed with hot water and soda before use, and after each sample has been stirred it is washed in running water, and dried with a clean cloth. Each plunger is only used twice, so that three are required to take the six samples. The cloth on which the plunger is dried is only used once. 35 TUBERCULOSIS IN MILK. Whilst the information obtained as a result of sampling at railway stations was under consideration, the Sanitary Committee instructed me to ascertain the results which certain other Authorities had obtained when examining milk bacteriologically. Through the courtesy of the respective Medical Officers of Health, the following information was obtained. It will be seen that marked variation is shown. The percentage in the City for 1923 is similar to that recorded in the area of the London County Council for 1922, but the results for the latter area have almost invariably been lower than the results in the City. One positive conclusion which can be drawn from these figures is that the presence of tubercle in milk is still far too prevalent an occurrence. TUBERCULOSIS AND MILK.

Fifty-nine samples of condensed milk were taken and submitted to the Public Analyst. Fifty-eight separate Brands were examined, as follows :— Condensed Full Cream Milk Sweetened 17 Condensed Skimmed or Machine Skimmed Milk Sweetened 39 Condensed Skimmed Milk Unsweetened 1 Condensed Full Cream Milk Unsweetened 1 Total 58 In no instance was the condensed milk found to be below the required standard, but in four cases the labels were not in conformity with the Regulations. Eighteen notifications were received from the Ministry of Health of condensed milk sampled by the Officers of H.M. Customs which infringed the Regulations, and where the addresses of the consignees were situated within the City area. Each of these was investigated and a report of the action taken furnished to the Ministry. In the majority of cases the consignment of milk referred to did not actually come into the City, the address being simply the official head-quarters of the trading concern. 36 ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION REGARDING SAMPLES Name of Article.

During 1924, 244 samples of Milk were examined under these Regulations, and all were found to be free from preservative. Twelve samples of Cream (not preserved) were purchased, two of which were certified to contain Boric Acid, though not in excess of the amount permitted by the Regulations for Preserved Cream. Of these two samples, one was an informal sample and one a formal sample, purchased from the same vendor. There were no legal proceedings. The vendor was cautioned. Ten samples of Preserved Cream were obtained and found to comply with the Regulations as to labelling and the amount of preservative permitted. In no instance did the fat content of Preserved Cream fall below 35 per cent. No contravention of the other requirements relating to Preserved Cream were found. All the samples of Cream and Preserved Cream were certified to be free from thickening substances. 1. MILK ; AND CREAM NOT SOLD AS PRESERVED CREAM.

A consignment,consisting of 170 cases of Marrowfat Tinned Peas, were landed at one of the City Wharves in the early part of the year. The consignment was exported from Belgium, and the tins were labelled:— "In accordance with the methods which have been followed for "many years past, the contents of this package have been prepared with "a small quantity of Sulphate of Copper, not exceeding 2 grains per lb." The consignment was placed under embargo and a sample submitted to the Public Analyst in order that the actual proportion of Copper Sulphate might be determined. He reported as follows:— "Crystallised Sulphate of Copper 0.48 grains per lb." The amount of copper present was not considered large enough to justify a a prohibition of sale. MEAT INSPECTION. Various matters of interest have occurred during the year in connection with inspection work, the chief of which are as follows:— CASEOUS LYMPHADENITIS IN SHEEP CARCASES. Caseous lymphadenitis is the name given to a condition which resembles tuberculosis, but from which it differs in certain important respects. It is also known as pseudotuberculosis, and mainly affects sheep, although it is said to have been found in cattle, calves, guinea pigs, rabbits and chickens. True tuberculosis is a condition of extreme rarity in sheep, and I confess to having never seen a case. Pseudotuberculosis, on the other hand, is extremely 44 common in certain countries, though not in this. The disease is found in meat inspection work, chiefly in imported carcases, and the lesions are discovered in the lymphatic glands. It is within the knowledge of your Worshipful Committee that it is an established practice to notify the Consul-General of any country importing meat when a carcase from that country is discovered at Smithfield Market containing lesions of disease, which has required, either a portion, or the whole of the carcase to be condemned. This practice is followed to enable enquiries to be made locally as to the reason why the condition was overlooked, and does not necessarily suggest that there has been wilful disregard of the meat inspection regulations, which form the basis of the agreement controlling the importation of foreign carcases. It would, however, appear to help the importing authorities to check carelessness. Occasionally conditions are observed which suggest the desirability of some improvement in the inspection work, and the following observations are submitted as an illustration. During the present year reports from the Veterinary Surgeon at Smithfield have been forwarded to me which indicate that lesions of Caseous Lymphadenitis are unduly prevalent among sheep carcases received from Argentina. The total number of carcases found infected with this disease for the nine months ending 30th September, 1924, was eighty-eight. This is not a large number compared with the total number of carcases received, the equivalent weight of which was over 70,000 tons, but it should be remembered that these lesions in the frozen carcase are not discovered except on cutting up, and it may, therefore, be assumed that carcases presenting these lesions have escaped the viligance of the Smithfield inspectors, with the result that they have reached retail shops. The location of the lesions was as follows:— Prescapular lymph gland 51 Precrural lymph gland 25 Prescapular and Precrural lymph glands together 3 Iliac lymph gland 1 In bony tissue 1 In muscular tissue 4 In the Prescapular and superficial Inguinal lymph gland 1 In two instances there have been lesions in the Precrural lymph gland, one of which had been cut out at the time of slaughter and the other had also been partially cut out, but a small infected portion remained in situ. These figures indicate that the disease becomes markedly generalized and affections such as those above necessitate condemnation of the carcase. In view of the frequency of infection of the Prescapular and Precrural glands, it becomes a question for consideration by the Argentine inspection authorities whether all sheep carcases, other than lamb carcases, should not have these glands incised on the routine examination at the place of slaughter. Mr. Young reports that it is interesting to note that your inspectors do not discover these lesions with anything approaching the same frequency in Australian sheep carcases although the disease is not uncommon in Australia, and he was informed by Captain Grant, Veterinary Officer for the Australian Government, that all carcases of adult sheep are carefully examined at the time of slaughter by palpating the lymph glands in the Prescapular, Precrural and superficial Inguinal regions. This examination always reveals any lesions present and is worth considering in connection with the above recommendation. The facts were brought to the notice of the Consul-General for the Netherlands. CHILLED BEEF FROM CANADA. A number of consignments of chilled beef from Canada have arrived in this country during the year and have been exposed for sale at Smithfield Market. In some instances chilled lambs formed part of the consignment. The meat was carried at a temperature of only two or three degrees below freezing point. At this temperature the meat remains unfrozen and has an advantage over frozen beef inasmuch as it does not require a preliminary thawing 45 before use, and there is not the same tendency for the juice to exude on cutting. Frozen beef undoubtedly has some advantages, but these are rather of interest to the trader than to the consumer. The condition of the meat when seen by me was excellent. The carcases themselves might have been of primer quality but the examples clearly showed that chilled beef from Canada, which only takes a period of twelve or thirteen days from slaughter to sale on the Markets, can arrive here in excellent condition, and that it possesses certain advantages over that which takes a longer period in transit. EXAMINATION OF MEAT INTENDED FOR EXPORT TO HOLLAND. The Netherlands Government have recently issued a general order prohibiting the importation of meat into the Netherlands from countries which have not a national system of meat inspection. Subject to certain conditions, however, they are prepared to admit meat derived from cattle slaughtered at the abattoirs at Aldgate or Islington. These conditions include the inspection of the meat by a duly appointed Veterinary Inspector both before and after slaughter, the adoption of the criteria laid down in the Minister of Health's memorandum on meat inspection issued in 1922 (Memo 62 /Food) and the marking of the meat which has been passed after inspection. Tn June, a letter was received from the Ministry of Health, asking whether the Corporation were prepared to undertake the inspection and marking of meat under these conditions and suggesting that if they were the mark used should be one which could subsequently be approved under the general system of marking proposed under Part VI. of the draft of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations. The methods of meat inspection practised at Aldgate are in accordance with those set out in the Memorandum referred to and in this connection no difficulty was experienced in complying with the requirements of the Netherlands Government. In view, however, of the fact that the Regulations referred to had not been approved at the time the matter was under consideration, it was felt that any attempt to secure the approval of a distinctive stamp would be premature. Accordingly, it was suggested that the stamp and declaration at present in use under the Order of the Netherlands Government, of date September, 1922, in regard to fat might well be utilised to meet the present needs, and that if, after the Regulations of the Ministry were approved, any modification was found necessary, the matter might be further considered. The Minister of Health, however, was of opinion that the stamp should be in conformity with the Public Health (Meat) Regulations and that it was desirable that the mark to be used should be approved on that basis. The form of stamp is, therefore, at the present time receiving consideration. The Order referred to permitted the importation into Holland of fat derived from animals slaughtered in the public abattoirs of Aldgate and Islington, and such fat has to be stamped to indicate that it had passed an official inspection. It had also to be accompanied by a declaration that it had been extracted from the bodies of animals that had been duly passed as fit for human consumption. VISIT TO HOLLAND—MEAT INSPECTION IN THE NETHERLANDS. In response to an invitation received from the Netherlands Government that a small party, representative of the City of London Corporation, should proceed to Holland, to observe the methods of meat inspection adopted in that country, a deputation, consisting of Mr. Deputy Alderton, Chairman of the Sanitary Committee; Mr. W. Leuw, C.C.; the Medical Officer of Health ; and the City Veterinary Inspector, proceeded to Holland in April of this year. The visit has been the subject of a detailed report to the Corporation and it is not necessary here to refer to it at length. Among the objects of interest which were visited were the export slaughterhouses, which are under the direct control of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the slaughterhouses under the control of the local authority in which animals are slaughtered for home consumption. Other places inspected included:— (1) A super-excellent dairy establishment; (2) The open-air school at Gravenhage; (3) The serum institute at Rotterdam; and (4) The Veterinary College at Utrecht. 46 The Corporation are much indebted to the Government of the Netherlands for having given them the opportunity of inspecting so many concerns of mutual interest and importance. TUBERCULOUS LESIONS.—On page 53 will be found a summary of the lesions discovered in tuberculous calves under the age of five months. This information, it is believed, will be of considerable interest and of increasing value as numbers accumulate. The chief object of the record is to show the frequency of ante-natal infection of calves with tuberculosis. I have previously drawn attention to this matter* and the basis of the opinion as to whether the infection of calves was derived before or after birth is somewhat as follows:— In the foetal circulation the arterial blood passes mainly through the abdominal organs; such as reaches the lungs, does so at a later stage in the circulation. The deduction one makes is that if the blood is charged with infection in such circumstances the liver, spleen and kidneys are likely to show infection before the lungs. No primary lesions will be observed in congenital tuberculosis and all the lesions will be of the miliary type. It often happens also that the size of the deposits will vary in groups, indicating different stages of growth from the release of infection at different times. Such undoubted cases as have come under observation may show the mesenteric glands free from deposits, and the number of centres in the three organs mentioned are greatest in the liver, the kidneys show the fewest and the spleen a number intermediate between the two. There are also other histological and pathological features which cannot here be described, but an attempt will be made in future to divide into sections the three groups of organs, viz.: (a) those obviously post-natal in origin; (b) those probably ante-natal in origin; and (c) all others in respect of which a definite decision cannot be arrived at. In another table on page 54 will be found the frequency of infection of the different glands and organs, both in actual numbers and percentages. The only observation it is desirable to make is to point out that in cows 29.1 per cent. of tuberculous animals showed infection of the mammary glands. This observation is of importance, not only in respect of meat inspection, but in respect of the question of the supervision of the milk supply. INSTRUCTION IN MEAT INSPECTION. "It would be of considerable advantage to the community, and to lay inspectors of meat in particular, if local authorities having charge of local markets or public abattoirs could arrange for definite demonstrations to be given at intervals, at which not only inspectors in their employment, but also inspectors from a considerable surrounding area might attend." In the above words the report of the Departmental Committee on Meat Inspection emphasizes the desirability of local authorities, in whose districts the necessary facilities exist, using such facilities for educational purposes. The opportunities which Smithfield Market offers for educational work of this nature are unequalled, and accordingly, at the end of 1922,a course of what might be termed trial lectures, having in view the object suggested above, was arranged. These lectures were so well attended that the Corporation have determined that the opportunities available should be utilised as much as possible and the educational work placed on a systematic basis. A course of lectures dealing with meat inspection problems which are encountered in the wholesale and retail markets and in shops has been arranged. The lectures, which will be essentially of a practical nature, will be somewhat out of the ordinary groove of instruction which is given for purely examination purposes. No charge is to be made for attendance. * Meat Inspection Problems. 47 Attached hereto is the report of your Veterinary Surgeon, Lieutenant-Colonel T.

The quantity of supplies which passed through the Central Markets, Smithfield, during 1924, constituted a new record, the figures being 480,520 tons against the maximum of 470,401 tons in 1923, or an average of approximately 1,900 tons daily. On one day prior to Christmas the amount of food supervised by the inspection staff was 5,000 tons. The following figures show the source of supplies, viz. :— British and Irish 104,843 tons or 21.8 per cent. Argentina 224,866 ,, 46.8 ,, New Zealand and Australia 90,972 ,, 18.9 „ Dutch and other foreign supplies 59,839 ,, 12.5 „ 480,520 „ 100.0 ANALYSIS.

BRITISH MEAT.—There was an increase of 511 tons of British beef and veal, the majority of which was of excellent quality, and was sold at high prices, but again, as can be seen by referring to Table No. 6, a large percentage was found to contain lesions of disease, thus proving a continued lack of any systematic efficient meat inspection throughout the country. The new Regulations, which have been drafted by the Ministry of Health, will come into operation on April 1st, 1925. Those require all butchers who own private slaughterhouses to notify the Local Authority of intention to slaughter any animal, so that an Inspector may be present at the time of slaughter, and marking of all meat that has been inspected is suggested. Marking is adoptive and not compulsory, but it is probable that butchers will demand marking so that they may be protected from any prosecution, where meat that has been passed in one district may be seized in another district: such cases have occurred. Where meat has been marked, the responsibility as to any disease being found in it later will pass from the butcher to the inspector. ARGENTINA.—This country which supplied approximately 75.0 per cent. of our beef and 18.7 percent. of our mutton and lamb, maintained its high standard for the quality, grading, dressing and cleanliness of meat exported. Again this year numbers of diseased quarters of beef were observed, the lesions being generally confined to deep seated lymphatic glands. 126 quarters of beef (24 fores and 102 hinds) were destroyed for tuberculosis compared with 59 quarters (13 fores and 46 hinds) for 1923. A noticeable feature during the year was the number of sheep carcases which contained lesions of Caseous Lymphadenitis. Hitherto, in meat inspection, it has generally been considered that the lesions of this disease were confined to organs, or to the lymphatic glands of carcases, but lesions were found in the bone and muscles in addition to lymphatic glands. The majority of the lesions could have been detected at the time of examination in the abattoirs by palpation of the lymphatic gland region, e.g., prescapular, precrural and inguinal. A total of 117 carcases were destroyed due to this disease. The examination of ox-tongues was continued, with results shown in Table 7. AUSTRALIA.—The quality, grading and dressing of Australian beef were, with exceptions, still far from being in the same class as Argentine beef. The improvement shown in dressing, mentioned last year, was not, except for a few consignments, which were well dressed, maintained. Some of the consignments arrived with the "bloom" gone from the beef. This was probably due to opening hatches to add to the cargo. If so, this should be carefully avoided, as chambers should never be opened after loading until opened for discharge. Many of the quarters of beef were from aged cattle, apparently seven years old; such meat can never compete with meat from cattle two to four years of age. The splitting of the 50 ischiopubic symphysis and the dressing of the buttocks were very imperfectly performed. Those defects detracted very much from the appearance of the meat. The carcases of mutton and lamb were better dressed than the beef, but many of the carcases were those of old ewes, due no doubt to the tendency to retain sheep as long as possible "for wool," very high prices being realised for this commodity; but just as beef from aged cattle cannot compete with that from young cattle, so mutton from old sheep will never establish a good name for Australian mutton in Smithfield Market. A small consignment of meat, treated by the " Bullot Process," arrived, but it did not find favour with those who saw it. Some of it was "bone tainted." The inspection of Australian meat was, as usual, good as can be observed by referring to Table No. 8. NEW ZEATAND.—Beef from this country was a negligible quantity, generally from old cows and very badly dressed. A considerable quantity of veal arrived. This was of medium quality and the dressing not very well done. The carcases of mutton and lamb were, as usual, well dressed, of good quality and well graded. Those necessary conditions, coupled with a regulating of the quantity to arrive, maintained prices at a high average throughout the year. The inspection in New Zealand was, as usual, good, e.g., vide Table No. 8. HOLLAND.—The quality, grading and cleanliness of meat sent from Holland was, as usual, of a high standard. Holland takes pride of place for depositing in Smithfield the right type of pig carcase, e.g., apparently a cross between the "Middle" and "Large" White types, from which there is derived, what the butcher desires, viz., a long back and loin and short plump legs from a pig which arrives quickly at the desired weight suitable for the market. Any British farmer intending to begin pig breeding and feeding should visit the market at Smithfield and take this type as a model. The number of carcases destroyed as unfit for food was small, when the quantity sent is taken into consideration, e.g., Holland consignors deposited in the Smithfield Market, on Christmas week, 25,000 pig carcases in 24 hours. CANADA.—A quantity of "Chilled" beef and a small quantity of " Chilled " lamb arrived from Canada; unfortunately, most of the beef was from young cows and the agents stated that they understood a loss was sustained on the attempt to establish a trade in "Chilled" beef. It appears that it is more profitable to send the animals alive to Birkenhead and kill them there. The meat from those animals need not be labelled "imported" when offered for sale in a butcher's shop. 51 UNSOUND MEAT, ETC., REMOVED FROM COLD STORES. Article. No. How Packed Origin.

An analysis of the records shows that the percentage of animals with tuberculosis was:— Bulls 4.40 per cent. Calves 0.04 „ Cows 28.00 „ Heifers 3.10 ,, Oxen 2.00 „ In observations on the extent of tuberculosis in young calves it is interesting to note how extensively they may be affected and how the situation of the lesions vary. The following Table shows the position of the lesions in the organs of 14 calves, all under five months old. In order to show which organs are most commonly affected with tuberculosis, and also where lesions are most commonly found in carcases and their lymph glands, an analysis has been made with reference to the carcases and organs of cows, all of which were under nine years of age, and other cattle, all of which were under six years of age, vide Table No. 2.

These Buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's, Queen's, Prince's, North, and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class, some of the ground floors being let as shops. The Buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 780 persons, compared with 786 in 1923. 73 per cent. are adults and 27 per cent. children (under 14 years). The number of births was five, viz., two males and three females. The birthrate was 6.4 per 1,000, which is 9.9 per 1,000 below the average for the previous five years. The death-rate for 1924 was 11.6 per 1,000 per annum. The number of deaths of children under one year, per 1,000 births, was nil, as against 117 for the City generally.

DISINFECTION—TRADE.—In accordance with the requirements of the South African Government, the disinfection of second-hand clothing prior to export to that country has been carried on as usual. The following is a copy of the certificate which is issued after disinfection has been completed:- Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C. 2. THIS IS TO CERTIFY that the following Articles, viz.:— marked shipped by have been efficiently disinfected in the manner set out on the back of this Certificate, and that on the above date the goods referred to were in a clean condition. Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. Details of the Disinfection of the Articles referred to in the accompanying Certificate. Apparatus used:—Washington Lyons. 30 lbs. pressure was registered in the outer jacket after the goods had been placed in the disinfector and the doors closed. A vacuum, equivalent to about 20" of mercury, was then created in the inner chamber. Steam was then introduced into the inner chamber at a pressure of not less than 15 lbs. per square inch, and for a period of not less than 15 minutes. After exposure of the clothing to this temperature, a vacuum equivalent to 15" of mercury was established. This vacuum was slowly released by the introduction of air heated to a temperature of 250 deg. F. The release took not less than 15 minutes. A second vacuum equivalent to 15" of mercury with subsequent refilling by hot air and a third vacuum equivalent to 20" of mercury and subsequent refilling completed the process. Each article was subsequently shaken and repacked under the control of the disinfecter. The capacity of the disinfector is as follows:— 120—150 Overcoats according to size in parcels not exceeding 5. 200—250 Tunics. 250—300 Jackets-ordinary. 120—150 Blankets, according to size, in parcels not exceeding 10. Smaller articles subject to the discretion of the disinfecter.

It has proved of considerable assistance in connection with the identification of persons found drowned in the River Thames. During the year, seven bodies were placed in the apparatus and of these six were subsequently identified. FIRE INQUEST. Dr. F. J. Waldo, J.P., Coroner for the City of London, informs me that no Fire Inquests were held by him during 1924, no proper cause having arisen, but that he had personally inquired into 189 "non-fatal" City fires reported to him during the year. DISINFECTANTS.—As heretofore, all the disinfectants used in the Public Health Department were obtained through your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for the following purposes:—Deodorising and "denaturising" condemned meat, disinfecting public conveniences, disinfecting roadways, street gullies, disinfecting premises, &c., after infectious disease, drain testing and sundries.

The Corporation, as the Sanitary Authority in the City, are required, under the provisions of Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to make and enforce Bye-laws applying to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family for the following purposes:— For regulating the number of persons and separation of the sexes. For the registration and inspection of such houses. For enforcing drainage and promoting cleanliness and ventilation. For the cleansing and limewashing of the premises at stated times. For the taking of precautions in any case of infectious disease. The Bye-laws now in force in the City for this class of property were made by the Court of Common Council on 24th November, 1904, and confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 20th January, 1905. Unfurnished lodgings, when the rent is not less than 10s. a week, and furnished lodgings when the rent is not less than 12s. 6d. a week, are exempt from the operations of the Bye-laws. Particulars relating to the registered Lodging-houses in the City now on the Register are given in the accompanying table:— District. Number of Houses on Register. Number of Lodgers.

This necessitated the service of 167 Notices during 1924. 65 In addition to the foregoing, there are eleven blocks of Dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is "selfcontained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that in these circumstances they are not subject to the Bye-laws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family:— Name and situation of Artisans' Block Dwellings.

COMMON LODGING-HOUSE, 116, MIDDLESEX STREET.—The above premises, which are known as the "Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," and is the only common lodging-house in the City, was opened on the 7th February, 1906. It was utilised during the War as a Soldiers' Hostel, but is now again in use as a common lodging-house. The premises are periodically inspected, and always found to be well kept and in a generally satisfactory condition. NEGLECT TO COMPLY WITH WATER-CLOSET BYE-LAWS.—In accordance with the Bye-laws with respect to water-closets, &c., made under Section 54 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1900, every person who shall intend to construct a water-closet, or to connect or disconnect any water-closet from any soil pipe or drain, shall, at least seven days before the work is to be commenced, deliver or send to the Corporation at the Guildhall, a plan showing the situation of such water-closet, drawn to scale, together with a section showing the proposed means of ventilation. Under Section 17, every person who shall offend against these Bye-laws renders himself liable to a penalty of £5 for every such offence, and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further penalty of 40s. for each day after written notice of this offence from the Corporation. Any infringement of such Bye-law is a serious matter, and may lead to considerable trouble and expense to the owner of the property, inasmuch as it may necessitate the condemnation of a system installed in contravention of the Corporation requirements. No instance of neglect in this respect has occurred during the year under review. 66 DRAINAGE PLANS.—In the course of the year 209 plans were submitted with regard to proposed reconstruction of water-closets or drains in the City. Of these, 192 were approved; 10 revised and approved; and 7 not approved. STREET GULLIES.—The gradual substitution of properly trapped gullies for those formerly existing has greatly reduced the number of complaints received of offensive smells arising from those appliances, especially in warm weather. In some cases this nuisance was doubtless due to want of flushing, but in the majority faultv construction was the cause of the trouble. The City Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past, and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more up-todate design will, I hope, eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil. OVERCROWDING.—Overcrowding is a nuisance to be dealt with summarily under Section 2, Sub-section 1 (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and during the year 2 cases were reported by your officers. On the service of the statutory notice of abatement the overcrowding was discontinued. SANITARY DEFECTS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE.—In every case of notification of infectious disease, the premises involved were inspected with regard to the drainage system, water supply, ventilation, &c.; and of the 51 cases so investigated in 1924, it was found necessary to make amendments to soil and waste pipes, water-closets, &c., in 25 instances. HOUSE, TRADE AND OTHER REFUSE REMOVAL.—The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1924 consisted of 21,629 cartloads of street sweepings and slops, and 43,743 loads of house and trade refuse, a total of 65,372 loads. The total for the year 1923 was 64,208. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Lett's Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. The horse manure collected from the street orderly bins is not included in the above, but is dealt with by a contractor, who sells it to market gardeners and others. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.—During the year, 483 notices have been served by the District Inspectors at the order of the Sanitary Committee, and in one case only was it found necessary, in consequence of non-compliance therewith, to refer the matter to the City Solicitor with a view to such steps being taken as he deemed necessary. SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS.—There are 279 courts and narrow passages throughout the City which were regularly flushed during the Summer months under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service and the flushing of the main streets, no less than 23,360,436 gallons of water were used. Of these courts and alleys, 20 were flushed six times a week, 10 five times a week, 2 four times a week, 27 three times a week, 126 twice a week, and 94 once a week. Disinfectants are also freely applied where desirable. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Customs House, as heretofore, required special attention. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the immediate vicinity of these places free from the nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially during hot weather. LIMEWASHING OF COURTS.—There are 89 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed frequently, become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of passengers or vehicles, together with the action of the smoke-laden atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. Of the places so dealt with during 1924, 24 were situated in the East District, 33 in the Middle District, and 32 in the West District. DEFECTIVE CONNECTIONS TO SEWER.—During the year, 38 reports were received from the City Engineer respecting the condition of connections between the drains of certain City houses and the public sewer. 67 Investigations showed that it was necessary to reconstruct 37 of the connections referred to. Of these, 31 have been completed and the remainder are, at the time of writing this report, in process of reconstruction. As a result of the inspection of the internal drainage system of these premises, reconstruction or alteration was found necessary in 25 instances. In the majority of cases these external drains were brick-barrel drains, in which rats had their breeding places, and were, undoubtedly, a source of much annoyance to the occupiers of the houses to which they were connected.

In 64 cases employers neglected to keep lists at their premises and to send copies of the same to the Corporation as required by the Act. Notice in each case was served upon the offender and in all cases complied with. No case of infectious disease was reported in connection with premises occupied by outworkers in the City. One contact with Scarlet Fever and two contacts with Diphtheria were reported. The necessary enquiries were made and suitable precautions taken.

Note —The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (S. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the administration of that Act in workshops and workplaces, and to send a copy of his Annual Report or so much of it as deals with this subject to the Secretary of State (Home Office). If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office, the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities, and the Medical Office Memorandum of March, 1912. 74 FACTORIES BILL, 1924. The Factories Bill, which was introduced during 1924, but which was not proceeded with in consequence of the change of Government, contained many excellent features, reference to which is not here necessary. It contained, however, clauses changing the fundamental principles of inspection, and these required serious consideration. The Bill abolished the distinction which exists under the present law between factories and workshops, and employed only one term "factory," and the provisions of the Bill applied indifferently to factories of all descriptions. Under existing Acts the provisions relating to the sanitary condition of workshops, cleanliness, overcrowding, ventilation and the drainage of floors are enforced in the first instance by the local sanitary authority, and not by the factory inspectors. In the case of factories, the Factory Inspectors are responsible. The provisions as to sanitary conveniences in factories and workshops are also enforced by the sanitary authorities. Under the new Bill all these provisions were to be rendered enforceable by the Factory Inspectors, except in any factory in which mechanical power was not used and which formed part of a dwelling or shop, or which was adjacent to a dwelling house or shop, in the same occupation. In these instances, which are few in number and of comparatively slight importance, the local sanitary authority would still have been the responsible administrative body. In other cases, it was proposed that the Secretary of State might arrange for the enforcement of the provisions of the Act in any factory in which mechanical power was not used, by the Sanitary Authority instead of by the Factory Inspector. It appears to be a matter of very considerable importance that the Sanitary Authority should be responsible for the sanitation of all places within its jurisdiction and I cannot conceive any advantage which would accrue by devolving this particular power on to the Factory Inspector. Instead of reducing the sphere of activity of local authorities it was contemplated when the Act was passed which established the Ministry of Health that there would be progressive delegation of the sanitary powers possessed by other departments of State to the Ministry of Health as time proceeded. Further, I believe that employers in the district, as regards such matters as sanitation, would prefer that the local authority supervised them rather than a central body. The Court of Common Council communicated with the Ministry of Health, directing the attention of the Minister to the proposals contained in the Bill, and expressing the opinion that the existing powers of control should continue to be a responsibility of sanitary authorities. SANITARY ACCOMMODATION FOR CUSTOMERS ON LICENSED PREMISES. Attention has been given to the question of the character and extent of the sanitary accommodation provided at licensed houses in the City for the use of customers. In many of the places no accommodation of the kind exists. The provision of sanitary conveniences for customers is in a totally different legal position to the question involved by the existence of sanitary conveniences for residents in the house, or workers in the business. In the case of residents the usual provisions as to occupiers of dwelling houses apply and in the case of workers the subject would appear to be controlled by appropriate sections of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. Provision for customers appears to be more a concern of the Licensing Justices and, as a consequence, the attention of the Justices was directed to the matter. 75 RAT REPRESSION. The table set out on page 79 indicates the number of investigations and inspections made and details of work carried out under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, during the year ended December 31st, 1924. From this summary it will be seen that 1,072 buildings were inspected and that those buildings were occupied by 3,344 firms. Of these buildings 383 were found to be rat infested. One or other of the ratcatchers working in the City was engaged by business firms in 130 instances; poisons were laid down by firms and traps of the break-back character were used in 610 premises, and wire traps in 97. Varnish traps which were used in special circumstances were relied upon in 274 buildings. Cats and dogs were found to be kept by 150 firms. Complaints have been received at the office, or applications for advice in 155 instances. The work done in addition to poisons and traps and the keeping of animals, included rat-proofing in 358 instances, and the repair of drainage defects in 510 instances. In this relation it should be stated that rat-proofing cannot be relied upon absolutely to exclude rodents from buildings, for reasons I have pointed out from time to time, e.g., the importation of rats into buildings in cases and crates from the docks, and ingress through open doors and windows, especially through roof doors, provided for exit in case of fire. For various reasons the value of properly carried out rat-proofing should not be under- estimated; by this means food is protected; the domestic water supply is guarded; fire risk is lessened; insanitary defects are remedied which might otherwise remain undiscovered; and rats are more easily caught, since hiding places are eliminated, and absence of hiding places results in a decrease in the rat population. I have pointed out in previous reports that the construction of many City buildings is such as to render rat-proofing practically impossible and, further, that the only persons competent to deal with these buildings (the owners) are not responsible under the Act. A large number of old buildings have been demolished throughout the City during the year, and in the course of demolition numbers of rats which were disturbed found harbourage in neighbouring buildings, many of which had not been previously infested. Mr. Engineer informs me that during the year the following sewerage and drainage works, all of which tended to reduce the number of breeding places for rats, were carried out by his department:— Pipe sewers constructed 1 Pipe sewers in course of construction Nil. Pipe sewers substituted for old brick sewers 1 Brick sewers re-inverted 1 Brick sewers in course of being re-inverted Nil. Brick sewers re-constructed 1 Brick sewers in course of re-construction 1 Disused sewers filled in 1 New drains constructed in connection with new buildings 21 Drains of existing buildings re-constructed 72 New gully drains constructed 4 Gully drains re-constructed 74 Disused drains blocked up 261 Amount of poison used in the sewers during the year 90 lbs. No. of rats killed in sewers not including those which died from poisoning 1,935 It was not found necessarv in any case either to serve statutory notices or to take legal proceedings. I am indebted to Messrs. Dalton and Sons, professional rat-catchers, for the information that they have, during the year, caught 21,202 rats in the City area. NATIONAL RAT WEEK.—National Rat Week began this year on November 3rd, and in accordance with the request of the Ministry of Agriculture a special effort was made by the department to concentrate the attention of the City public on rat destruction during the week in question. On September 29th a circular 76 letter was posted to occupiers of those premises in the City that are specially liable to rat infestation by reason of the nature of the business carried on, and these included the following:— 1.—The occupiers of refreshment rooms, tea shops, cafes, etc. 2.—The managers of railways and railway depots and stations. Seven railway companies operate in the City area. 3.—The occupiers of licensed premises (Public Houses). There are 299 of these premises in the City. 4.—The managers of 36 wharves in Upper and Lower Thames Street. 5.—The superintendents of the Markets—Billingsgate, Leadenhall and the Central Meat Markets. Letters were also sent to the City Surveyor with reference to Corporation property under his control and to the City Engineer concerning rat destruction in the sewers. With regard to the sewers, Mr. Engineer has informed me that during rat week the ordinary use of poisoned bait in the sewers was augmented by an organised drive, carried out in those sewers where rats were most likely to be found, and 78 were killed. He also states that generally the number of rats in the City sewers appears to be decreasing, and this he attributes to the reduction in the number of breeding places through the systematic bricking up of disused sewers and drains and the repairing of defective ones, and the regular use of various poisoned baits. In this connection, however, it should be remembered that the activities in rat repression above ground by the general public have led to the destruction of many thousands of rats which have emerged from the sewers and this must be considered as a very important factor in bringing about the improved state of affairs mentioned by the City Engineer. The response made by the firms circularised was very satisfactory, and all concerned were willing to help in carrying out the request made for a special effort during the week. But most of the firms pointed out that their rat repression work was organised and continuous throughout the year. As poisons were the chief means of destruction, it is of course impossible to give any estimate of the number of rats killed, as by this method the results are not always apparent. One firm of ratcatchers, Messrs. Dalton and Sons, report that during the week they captured 884 rats in City premises. The manager of one large hotel states that the building is entirely free from rats and this he attributes to the ratproofing of the premises carried out in 1921, and the instructions issued to the whole staff immediately to report the suspected presence of rats either in, upon, or adjacent to the premises. In some cases an employee is specially detailed to the matter of rat riddance, and is paid a small sum weekly for this work in addition to his wages. Varnish traps have been and are extensively used; many business firms use this exclusively as it is found to be the most effective of all traps used for inside work. One hotel manager who uses nothing else reports that 2,500 rats have been caught in the hotel on these traps in the last three and a half years, and he prefers this method to all others. A daily record of all rats caught is kept. Several firms have had good results from introducing cats into their buildings. Large numbers are kept at some of the wharves, one firm of wharfingers in Lower Thames Street, keeps no less than 50; poison is put down daily at this wharf and traps are also used with the result that the buildings are not infested to any great extent. This firm attributes its success not altogether to the methods adopted but rather to the fact that its efforts are continuous. Rat-catchers are engaged on contract in many of the multiple tea shops, restaurants, hotels and business premises. Several vacant building sites in the City were dealt with under the supervision of the Department and all necessary information was given to representatives of firms who called at the office for advice. VIRUS.—In the course of routine inspection it has been observed that virus is still being very largely used in many premises, this in spite of the discouragement of its use by the Ministry of Agriculture and representation made by the City Corporation to the Government. The experience gained in the City does not bear out 77 the claim that rats and mice die in the open after being poisoned by virus as complaints have been made of the nuisance of dead rats between match boarding and walls and under floors in premises where virus has been used. As the virus question is a serious one, I make no excuse for again referring to my printed report of April, 1920, which dealt with the subject in a comprehensive way. (A reprint of this report for further distribution is needed as requests are frequently being made for it.) By a general Army Order, dated July 29th, 1919, the use of any vermindestroying virus preparation is prohibited in all military establishments and camps, the reasons stated for their prohibitions are:— 1.—They are apt to produce a rat population which is immune to the action of the virus. 2.—There is a certain degree of risk of food contamination with resultant food poisoning outbreaks. Experience in the City has proved that both these reasons are sound. It is regrettable that the civilian population is not afforded the protection from food poisoning outbreaks as that which the Military Authorities afford to His Majesty's Army by prohibiting the use of virus. It is probably only a 50 to 60 per cent, killer and should be condemned for that reason alone. Every known preparation of poison is used in the City and although poisons have their disadvantages, e.g., causing rats to die in hidden places where the bodies are not easily accessible, it is impossible to reduce their number to any extent without them. Rat traps require very careful setting and more attention than the employees of a business firm care to devote to them, whereas poisons are easily placed about a building. A liquid or semi-liquid bait is the best inside a building—bread soaked in red squill extract for instance; the rat has to eat this on the spot, it cannot be carried away and hoarded under floors or other places of harbourage as frequently happens with solid baits. It is very seldom that a rat poisoned with squill dies in a hidden place and being a comparatively safe poison it is about the most suitable and effective for occupied buildings. Very good results have been obtained by using squill and alternating with varnish traps which are quite easily made and give better results than wire cage traps or break-backs. Dead rats under floors, etc., are not always easy to locate. Where there is a lath and plaster white-washed ceiling below the floor under which the body of a dead rat lies, an examination of the ceiling will often reveal a patch of discolouration due to moisture from the decomposing rat having percolated. A lot of time and unnecessary removal of floor boards could thus be saved by a glimpse at the ceiling beforehand, when the position of the decomposed rat can at once be located if the damp patch alluded to is seen. Boulter, in his book "The Rat Problem" (1909), and Howell in his recentlypublished book "Rats and How to Destroy Them" (1924), both suggest the following method for discovering the precise spot where the body of a dead rat is lying. In the summer month, viz., catch several bluebottle flies with a butterfly net. Then, having closed the windows and door of the room in which there is the odour, liberate the flies and notice where they all settle; that will indicate the place below which the dead animal is lying. The trouble in the City with dead rats usually arises in the winter time when neither bluebottles nor butterfly nets are readily procurable. Poisoning, trapping, and ratproofing are all necessary measures and it is no use relying on one of these methods alone. That is where rat poisoners who rely on poisons only fail to effect anything but a very temporary clearance with regard to ratproofing. Until further powers are sought and obtained in regard to the destruction of rats, not much work can be done, and in view of a discussion which took place in the Court of Common Council last year, I venture to repeat the following observations from my 1923 report:— "It is also perhaps of interest briefly to mention the standpoints from which rat repression is viewed by the owner and the occupier of a building since the Act came into operation. L 78 "Before January, 1920, the date of the Act coming into force, if rats became a nuisance the occupier usually complained to the owner who took the necessary steps to abate the nuisance, either by calling in professional ratcatchers, or by instructing his builder to see to the drains, if necessary, and to stop all holes and places of ingress. Poisons also were used, chiefly by the ratcatcher, and the building was dealt with as a whole. The chief poison in those days was generally phosphorous and from it reasonably good results were obtained. Viruses of more or less efficiency have also been in use for some years. The dangers to be apprehended from the use of bacterial preparations and their limited application were fully discussed in my report to the Corporation, dated February 24th, 1920. When the Act came into force, however, the occupier of a building or part of a building became solely responsible for rat riddance, the owner being under no obligation whatever to carry out any structural works which might be shown to be necessary to repress rats. "This is the weak part of the Act for it becomes exceedingly difficult in a large building, occupied by a large number of tenants, to get joint action, owing to circumstances connected with the business; infestation, say, of a five-storey building may only be noted on three or four of the stories. The fourth and fifth occupiers, who are not affected, are extremely reluctant to spend money in bringing about improvement which is of no benefit to themselves. "Even though premises may be only partially infested the necessary alterations are such in some cases that they can only be regarded as a charge which should be equally distributed among the whole of the occupiers. This brief illustration indicates clearly the necessity for the landlord or owner having responsibility where premises present difficulties which only structural alteration can remedy. If, however, the premises structurally are sound and separate tenancies are either accidentally infested or the nature of the business is such as to encourage infestation or render de-infestation difficult, then the occupier should shoulder the responsibility." The organised activities of rat repression, notwithstanding the unsatisfactory state of the law, appear to have resulted in at any rate preventing an increase in the rat population in the City area, and this in spite of the fact that rats are being constantly imported from the docks. I doubt if there is any other square mile in the world where so many professional ratcatchers, rat-poisoners and vendors of rat poisons gain their livelihood, not because there are relatively more rats than elsewhere but perhaps because City firms are better able to afford the cost than those of some other boroughs and towns. Of the 1,072 buildings visited during the year (see summary), 383 were found to be rat infested and in these, ratproofing work was carried out at 358. This work chiefly consisted of wiring basement area gratings, ventilators, roof openings, and the stopping of rat-holes in walls and floors. Other necessary work, such as the removal of wooden floors from basements and substituting concrete floors, the stripping of internal walls of woodwork, e.g., matchboarding, wainscoting and panelling (behind which rats nest and breed), and cementing the walls, the removal of ceilings in certain cases, etc., could only be done to a very limited extent because it would be considered a most unreasonable request to ask an occupier to carry out this very expensive, though necessary work, in a building which does not belong to him, and he would flatly refuse to do it, except perhaps in a very exceptional case. 79 RATS AND MICE (DESTRUCTION) ACT, 1919.

In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognizance of the appointment, 99 persons were examined by the Medical Officer of Health during 1924. Four of these persons were reported as physically unfit for office, and the decision with regard to two others was adjourned for six months, when they will be again examined. Twelve officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement, and all were reported to be unfit for duty.

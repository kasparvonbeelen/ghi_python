REPORT on the SANITARY CONDITION of the CITY OF LONDON for the year 1900. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Gentlemen, The conditions under which this Report of the work done by your Sanitary Staff during the year 1900 is presented are unusual. Some of the manuscript was completed during the lifetime of my predecessor, Dr. Sedgwick Saunders, and at his death, that part of it dealing with the City population and mortality, &c., was taken in hand by the Acting Medical Officer of Health (Dr. R. Dudfield). At the time I took office the Report as a whole was approaching completion, and finding it was drafted on the lines adopted in former years, I deemed it inadvisable to make any alterations in the text. Notes, however, to which I have appended my initials, will be found in several places. 8 The task of completing and seeing through the Press the work of a late brother officer with whom I was closely associated for over 20 years, and for whom I have always had the greatest admiration and esteem, is a painful one. It is due to your Sanitary Clerk, Mr. H. B. Turner, to state that nearly the whole of the Report has been prepared by him, a work which under the unusual circumstances has been one of considerable difficulty. Although one would naturally desire to disclaim authorship of any expressions of opinion published in such circumstances, I have no desire to dissociate myself from a certain amount of responsibility in this direction, more especially as the book is issued by me under the authority of your Sanitary Committee. Public Health Department, Guildhall, 1st July, 1901. 9 AREA. The “City of London” may mean either of the following:— Parliamentary Borough, Municipal City, Registration District, or Sanitary District. According to the Census Return of 1891 the areas, numbers of inhabited houses, &c., were:— TABLE I. Census, 1891. Area. Inhabited Statute Acres. Houses. Population. Parliamentary Borough 671 5,340 37,705 Municipal City 671 37,705 Registration District 672.1 5,368 38,320 Sanitary District 654 37,487 For the statistical part of this Report, the Registration District is referred to when speaking of the “City,” except it be otherwise stated. In dealing with administration, the Sanitary District is so designated. The population of the Registration District at the middle of 1900 was estimated to be 26,998. 10 The City District, or Union, is co-extensive with the municipal City of London within and without the walls, with the following exceptions, viz.—the municipal City includes the Middle Temple*, part of Staple Inn [four houses] †, part of Furnival's Inn [five houses], and a part of the Parish of Whitechapel [five houses], which for Poor Law and Registration purposes are comprised respectively in the Strand, Holborn and Whitechapel Districts, while the “Liberty of Glasshouse Yard,” with the exception of a few houses occupied by sixty-five persons, although not forming part of the municipal City §, is included in the Parish of St. Botolph Without, Aldersgate, in the London City Registration District. This ‘Liberty’ contained in 1891 69 inhabited houses, occupied by 779 persons, and in 1896 only 733 persons, according to the Imperial Census. All deaths in Glasshouse Yard are included by the Registrar-General as occurring in the * Vide Census of England and Wales, 1891. The Middle Temple has since been constituted a separate Sanitary Authority. † The ground floors only are in the City. § A new delimitation of this portion of the City is now under consideration. 11 City, but the Corporation is responsible only for the sanitary condition of the area comprised in the “municipal” City of London, from which this Yard, with the exceptions above mentioned, is excluded. The figures mentioned above, taken from the Imperial Census Return, represent the “night” or “resident” population of the City, not the “day.” The former is, and has been for some years, a diminishing quantity, while the latter is ever increasing. The changes are approximately indicated in the following Table:— TABLE II. Census Returns. Night Population. Day Population. 1861 112,063 (?) 1866 (?) 170,133 1871 75,983 (?) 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 38,320 301,384 1896 31,711 (?) It is probable that the Census to be taken this year will reveal greater rates of both increase and decrease. The statistics required for this Report can be based on the Imperial Census only, but the importance of the contrast between the 12 night and day population will be evident when dealing with the mortality returns. The 113 parishes within the City at the last Decennial Census constituted six Registration Sub-Districts, but that number has been gradually reduced until, at the commencement of 1900, there were only three Sub-Districts, viz.:— 1. St. Botolph, including 17 parishes. 2. St. Sepulchre „ 11„ 3. Allhallows Barking„ 85„ The variations in the proportions of males and females at different ages, the conditions of housing, occupation, and all the other factors which tend to favour or impair the public health, make it requisite for the purpose of measuring such influences that the statistical units should be for small areas. Consequently the statistics of the Report have been drawn up, as in former years, for sub-districts. The populations of the sub-districts at the middle of 1900 were estimated to be— St. Botolph 10,486 St. Sepulchre 8,490 Allhallows' Barking 8,022 26,998 13 It would have been desirable to include information as to the sex-age constitution of the populations of the sub-districts, but the requisite data are not available. A comparison of crude rates, be they of births, deaths, &c., is untrustworthy, not to say misleading. It is essential that account be taken of the proportions of males and females at the various ages used in the statistical records. The great differences in the composition of the populations of the areas selected for comparison with the City, will be apparent from a perusal of the following Tables:— Enumerated at Census, 1891.

To base it on the night population would misrepresent the case, and to take the day population, misleading, as the latter is largely made up of persons constantly moving about. At the Census of 1891 inquiry was made as to the number of rooms, and the number of occupants in tenements of four rooms or less. A mere statement of the number of rooms 15 forming the home of a large family is unsatisfactory, in that no account is taken of the size of the rooms, provision for lighting, ventilation, &c.—all factors of great importance. In connection with the returns of housing, it has been decided that when the occupants of a tenement average more than two per room, such tenement shall be deemed to be overcrowded. Fanciful as such a standard may appear at first sight to be, it is not without its use, and certain facts in connection with the evil effects of overcrowding have been collated, which tend to show that the standard is not altogether an arbitrary one. The differences in the conditions prevailing in the City, the Metropolis, and the Central Metropolitan Districts are indicated in the appended Tables:— 16 TABLE III.

Thus, while the number of residents in the City living in tenements of four rooms or less constituted 49 7 per cent, of the total population, in the Metropolis as a whole, the proportion was 55.3 per cent., and in the Central Districts 67.9 per cent. Similarly in none of the classes of tenements was the proportion of overcrowding in the City as high as in either of the other districts. On the other hand, the percentage proportions of those living in tenements of four rooms or less, living under overcrowded conditions, were a little higher than those for the Metropolis, but considerably lower than those for the "Central Districts." BIRTHS. During the fifty-two weeks which have been taken as the year 1900, 403 births were registered, viz., 204 of males and 199 of females. 19 The annual birth rate was at the rate of 14.9 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a decennial mean rate of 16.8 per 1,000. The birth rates last year in the Sub-Districts were— bt. Hotolph 19.3 per 1,000 St. Sepulchre 14.9 „ A.llhallows' 9.1 „ in the Metropolis the birth rate in 1900 was 28.6 per 1,000, being the lowest hitherto recorded therein; while in England and Wales the rate for the year was 28.9, and the decennial mean rate 30.1. The shrinkage in the birth rate indicated by these figures is not a recent change, but has been going on steadily since 1871 or 1872, and is common to nearly all European countries. VACCINATIOS. Of the children born in 1900, 244 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, and 51 had died before the age for vaccination. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate 20 in 18 cases, 4 infants were reported to be insusceptible to vaccination, 42 had removed into other districts, and 36 vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. During the same period only four adults, &c., were re-vaccinated, a number far below the necessities of the population. It has been clearly proved that infant vaccination does not confer a life-long immunity from Small-pox, and that re-vaccination should be performed at some time between the ages of 7 and 10 years, and again in the presence of an epidemic invasion.

NOTIFICATION FROM PORT SANITARY AUTHORITIES During the year 21 notifications in all were received from the Port Sanitary Authorities of Southampton, London, Liverpool, Bristol and Glasgow, stating that passengers landing there at various times from places infected with Plague or Small-pox were on their way to the City. The several addresses furnished were visited, and the usual precautions taken with satisfactory results in each instance. 29 *PLAGUE On the 19th September, the Local Government Board, in the exercise of powers conferred upon them by the Public Health Acts, extended the provisions of such Acts to the notification of Plague, and on the 20th issued the following circular letter to all Sanitary Authorities in England and Wales, including London: — "Local Government Board, " Whitehall, S.W., " 20th September, 1900. "NOTIFICATION OF CASES OF PLAGUE. "Sir, "I ani directed by the Local Government Board to "state that in consequence of the appearance of Plague "at Glasgow, and in view of the possible occurrence of ''cases of the disease in England and Wales, they have "decided to issue an Order requiring the immediate "notification to the Sanitary Authorities and to them"selves of all cases of Plague. "The Order, in its application to sanitary districts "outside London, extends the provisions of the "Infectious Disease (Notification) Act, 1889, to the "notification of every case of Plague occurring in the "district of a Sanitary Authority. * See Report on this subject to the Sanitary Committee of the 20th May, 1901.—W. C. 30 "As regards the district of any Sanitary Authority "in the Administrative Connty of London, and the "district of the Port Sanitary Authority of London, the "Order similarly extends the provisions of section 55 of "the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. "The Order also requires the Sanitary Authority "forthwith to send circular letters to all legally qualified "medical practitioners in the district, informing them "of their duties under the regulations, and it imposes "upon every Medical Officer of Health the duty of "reporting forthwith to the Board any case of Plague "which may be notified to him, or which may otherwise "come or be brought to his knowledge, and which may "occur in the district or area assigned to his charge. "Attention is drawn to the definitions of 'Sanitary "Authority' and 'Medical Officer of Health' in "Article I. of the Order. "Copies of the Order are enclosed, and the Board "request that you will deliver a copy to the Medical "Officer of Health, as defined by the Order. " I am, Sir, " Your obedient Servant, "JOHN LITHIBY, "Assistant Secretary. "To the Clerk to the Sanitary Authority." In compliance with the obligation to send circular letters to all medical men practising in 31 the City, a circular letter was addressed to them as under:— "Corporation of London, " Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., " 29th September, 1900. "NOTIFICATION OF CASES OF PLAGUE. "Sir, "In consequence of the appearance of Plague at "Glasgow, and in view of the possible occurrence of "cases of the disease in England, the Local Government "Board, in the exercise of their powers, have extended "the provisions of Section 55 of the Public Health "(London) Act, 1891, to the notification of Plague, and "have issued an Order, dated the 19th instant, requiring "the immediate notification to Sanitary Authorities of "all cases of this disease. "I am therefore instructed by the Sanitary Authority "for the City of London to forward you, in pursuance "of this Order, the following extracts from the Act "referred to, relating to the duties of medical practitioners "in the City under this Regulation:— "Sec. 55 (1) (b) 'Every medical practitioner "'attending on or called in to visit the patient, shall "'forthwith, on becoming aware that the patient is "'suffering from an infectious disease to which this "'section applies, send to the Medical Officer of "'Health of the district a certificate, stating the full "'name and the age and sex of the patient, the full "'postal address of the house, and the infectious "'disease from which, in the opinion of such medical "'practitioner, the patient is suffering, and stating "'also whether the case occurs in the private practice d 32 "'of such practitioner, or in his practice as a medical "'officer of any public body or institution; and where "'the certificate refers to the inmate of a hospital, it "'shall specify the place from which, and the date at "'which the inmate was brought to the hospital, and "'shall be sent to the Medical Officer of Health of "'the district in which the said place is situate.' "(2) 'Every person required by this section to "'send a notice or certificate, who fails forthwith to "'send the same, shall be liable to a fine not exceed"'ing forty shillings: Provided that if a person is "'not required to send notice in the first instance, but "'only in default of some other person, he shall not "'be liable to any fine if he satisfies the Court that "'he had reasonable cause to suppose that the notice "'had been duly sent.' "(3) * * * * 'The Sanitary Authority shall gratui"'tously supply forms of certificate to any medical "'practitioner residing or practising in their district "'who applies for the same, and shall pay to every "'medical practitioner for each certificate duly sent "'by him in accordance with this section, a fee of two "'shillings and sixpence if the case occurs in his "'private practice, and of one shilling if the case "'occurs in his practice as medical officer of any "' public body or institution.' "The Superintendents of the Metropolitan Asylums "Board's Ambulance Stations have received instructions "to remove forthwith to the South Eastern Hospital "any person duly certified to be suffering from Plague. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, "JOHN B. MONCKTON." 3o The Local Government Board in addition issued a circular letter and the accompanying memorandum to all Sanitary Authorities in England and Wales, on the 9th October last "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W., "9th October, 1900, "Sir, "I am directed by the Local Government Board to "state that, in view of the possibility of cases of Plague "occurring in England and Wales, they have thought it "advisable to issue to the several Sanitary Authorities "throughout the country, copies of memoranda which "have been prepared by their Medical Officer containing "suggestions which may be of assistance to Sanitary "Authorities and their officers in guarding against the "Plague, or dealing with any cases which may occur. "copies of these documents are enclosed. "The Board have thought it desirable that the "Sanitary Authority should be put in possession of "these Memoranda, so that the Authority and their "officers may be fully prepared to take any steps which "may be necessary, and they especially desire that "attention may be given to the arrangements under "which Medical Officers of Health may send to this "Office for bacteriological examination material from "suspected cases. At the same time the Board wish it "to be clearly understood that the action which they "have taken should not be interpreted as suggesting d 2 34 "that in their opinion there i9 canse for alarm at the "present time. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, "S. B. PROVIS, "Secretary. "The Clerk to the Sanitary Authority." "PLAGUE MEMORANDUM. "(1.) Administrative Considerations. "Plague having for the space of nearly two centuries "receded from Europe, has in recent years once more "trended westward, and has now again appeared in "Great Britain. Sanitary Authorities of England and "Wales will therefore need to be on the alert to detect "the presence of this disease in their districts, with a "view to prevent its becoming epidemic among their "populations. "It is to be anticipated, from the behaviour thus far "of the recent western extension of the disease, that "plague will not readily fasten on that section of our "population which is properly housed, cleanly, and "generally, in a sanitary sense, well to do; that rather "it will especially affect, if it obtains foothold in one "and another district, insanitary areas, such as are "peopled by the poorest class, and where overcrowding "of persons in houses and dirt and squalor of dwellings "and of inhabitants tend to prevail. 35 "In these circumstances the following facts respecting "plague deserve to be borne in mind:— "(1.) Plague has an incubation period of 3 to 5 "(in exceptional cases of perhaps 8 to 10) "days. "(2.) Plague is wont, especially in its earlier "testations, to assume a mild form, or even "to present anomalous symptoms, tending "to confound it with other and more "innocent diseases. "(3.) Plague in all its forms must needs be "regarded as personally infective. "(4.) Plague affects rats as well as the human "subject; it may, indeed, be found causing "mortality among these lower animals ante"cedent to its definite invasion of the "population. There can be no doubt that "the rat and man are, as regards plague, "reciprocally infective. "Athough local authorities should be on their guard "against plague, it is not intended to suggest that there "exists any cause for alarm. There can be no doubt "that, in this country, hygienic conditions and methods "of dealing with infectious diseases are far in advance "of those of former centuries wherein plague was "repeatedly epidemic in our populations; they are in "advance, too, as we believe, of those in localities "abroad where plague has shown itself formidable in "recent years. And in so far as, in our districts, these "conditions and methods are now satisfactory and "sufficient, there is the less likelihood of spread of "infection from plague cases casually imported. 36 "During the past 50 years there has occurred in "England and Wales a large diminution in the mortality "from most diseases of the infectious class, and in the "same period typhus fever has declined almost to "extinction. This latter disease is that which, as "regards the conditions*under which it becomes pre"valent, most closely resembles plague. Wherefore it "may be confidently anticipated that the measures of "sanitary improvement, of isolation and of disinfection, "which have been found effectual against indigenous "disease such as typhus will, if promptly and thoroughly "brought to bear, be equally effectual against plague. "First among measures requisite for control of plague "is prompt information to the local authority of all "cases of the disease occurring in their district. The "Board, therefore, have issued an order requiring, under "penalty, immediate notification to the Medical Officer "of Health of the district, and by him to the Board, of "every recognised case of plague. Meanwhile, and in "order to help towards recognition of this disease in its "obscurer manifestations, a statement of the clinical "features exhibited by this malady will be found in "Part (2) of this Memorandum. Further, and with a "view to assisting in the identification of plague newly "developing in one and another district, the Board has "arranged for bacteriological testing, without cost to "the local authority, of material submitted to their "Medical Officer by the Medical Officer of Health from "the earliest suspected case or cases.* "In the event of plague being detected in any district, "the measures to be taken to prevent its spread are, "*Directions for collecting and forwarding suspected "materials are issued by the Local Government Board to "Medical Officers of Health. 37 "generally speaking, those which are available against "the more ordinary epidemic diseases of this country, "as set forth in the accompanying ' General Memo"randum.' These measures include prompt removal of "the sick persons to hospital and their isolation therein; "the destruction or thorough disinfection of all infected "articles, with the effectual disinfection also of the "invaded dwelling place ; the keeping under observation "during 10 days after detection of each plague case all "persons who have been in contact with the patient, and "house to house visitation for the discovery of "unreported or suspicious cases; the abatement as "speedily as possible of all insanitary conditions in the "locality which may tend to the spread of the disease; "and, in the case of death, the prompt disposal of the "corpse, with all due precautions against its becoming "a source of infection. "An essential measure of precaution in view of the "observed relation between plague in rats and plague "in the human subject, will be the prompt destruc"tion of all rats in districts threatened or invaded by "plague, care being taken that their carcases are col"lected and burnt without being unduly handled. "It is to be noted that when treated in a well "appointed hospital, with plentiful fresh air and proper "attention to cleanliness and disinfection, plague, "except in its pneumonic and septicemic forms, shows "but small infective power; and that therefore doctors "and nurses in attendance on the sick run but little "risk of contracting the disease. Nevertheless, these "and other persons brought into close relation with "plague, may be afforded protection against infection "by submitting themselves to protective inoculation of "the sort practised with advantage to the inhabitants 38 "of invaded areas by Professor Haffkine, under the "auspices of the Indian Government, in Bombay. "As yet the protective material in question is not "generally purchasable in this country. For the present, "therefore, and until further notice, the Board, "having provided themselves with a supply of Pro"fessor Haffkine's plague prophylactic, will be prepared "to issue this material in limited amount to the "Medical Officers of Health of districts actually "invaded by plague, for the protection therein of doctors, "nurses, and other persons that are, under the condi"tions of the invaded area, being subjected to sustained "exposure to plague infection. "An ordinary attack of plague usually begins some "three to five days after exposure to infection. Such "attack may develop gradually, but, as commonly "met with, there is sudden onset with much fever, as "indicated by a high temperature, rapid pulse, headache, "hot skin, and thirst. The eyes are injected as if "inflamed; the expression, at first anxious and "frightened, becomes subsequently vacant and dull ; the "utterance is thick, and the gait unsteady as in one "under the influence of drink. There is at times a "distinct tendency to faint. The tongue is at first "covered with a moist white fur except at the edges, "which are red, but later on it becomes dry and of a "mahogany colour. "The most distinctive sign of plague is the presence "of swellings, or 'buboes' as they are called, in the "groin, armpit, or neck. These 'buboes,' which led ''to the disease being called 'bubonic plague,' and "which have no relation to venereal complaints, appear "as a rule about the second or third day of the disease. "They are usually painful and tender on pressure, and 39 "in size they vary from that of an almond to that of an "orange. Later on they may 'gather' and burst like "an ordinary abscess. There may, too, appear about "the body purple spots, and what are known as "' carbuncles.' "But buboes are not an essential feature of plague. "Cases occur in which these manifestations of the "disease are greatly delayed or even absent, as for "instance in ' Pneumonic,' 'Gastric,' and 'Septicajmic' "plague; forms of the malady which may be mistaken "for respectively inflammation of the lungs, typhoid fever, "and acute blood poisoning. Plague in these forms is "always grave; not only because of the fatality of the "cases, but for the reason that they, especially the "'pneumonic,' are highly infectious to other persons. "It is important, therefore, that in localities where "plague is present or is threatened, cases of anomalous "illness of the above sorts be, without loss of time, " brought under medical supervision. "Besides the forms of plague already referred to, there "is yet another, namely, the so-called 'ambulant' form. "In plague of this description the affected person is "hardly ill at all, presenting no definite symptoms "perhaps beyond indolent, though painful, swellings in "groin or armpit. Such plague cases may, nevertheless, "be instrumental in spreading the disease, and any "persons therefore who, having been possibly exposed "to plague, exhibit these symptoms, should be isolated "and watched medically until the nature of their "malady has been definitely ascertained.

The establishment at No. 6, Cotton Street, Aldersgate Street, was in operation for the whole year, pending the completion of the new buildings in Golden Lane, which were opened, but not ready for occupation, on the 29th October last. This Shelter is not intended for the use of the poor only. Any person residing in the City is entitled to accommodation there whilst his home is being disinfected. Eighteen families, comprising 37 adults and 31 children, total 68 persons, were received and provided with lodging, food, and attendance during the disinfection and cleansing of their houses after— Scarlet Fever from 7 families Diphtheria „ 10 „ Measles „ 1 family 18 families Two families came from homes consisting of four rooms each, 2 of three rooms, 7 of two rooms, and 7 of one room. In every instance the accommodation provided has been greatly appreciated. 41 DISINFECTION, &., AT CITY MORTUARY. 4,100 articles of bedding, clothing, furniture &c., were received at Golden Lane and disinfected. 98 bodies were received at the Mortuary, pending interment; the number for the three preceding years being 102, 108, and 131.

No less than 55,030 gallons of disinfectants were manufactured at Golden Lane, 54,265 of which were distributed for various purposes throughout the City, 765 gallons remaining in stock at the end of the year. MORTALITY. During the past year, 987 deaths were registered in the City, including 609 of persons dying in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, who were not residents in the City. Deducting the 609 deaths of non-residents, and adding 146 deaths of residents who died at City Institutions in outside districts, a total of 524 deaths is obtained on which the death rate has been calculated. The death rate for 1900 was 19.4 per 1,000 per annum of the population (compared with 18.5 of the previous year), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 18.8. These *Note.—To effect economy in cartage, on the suggestion of the Superintendent of Cleansing, disinfectants are now manufactured in a more concentrated form, and at a lower initial cost.—W. 0. 43 figures are not corrected for sex and age distribution.

This is the lowest London Birth Rate on record. 46 According to the Returns of the RegistrarGeneral, the decennial average annual number of deaths (1890-99) was 741, and the mean death rate 22.1 per 1,000. These averages are based on the Returns after allocation of all residents dying outside the City jurisdiction. The infantile mortality last year was at the rate of 179 per 1,000 births registered, compared with a decennial mean rate of 146. The rate for the Metropolis in 1900 was 160, the same as the decennial mean rate. [Registrar-General's Report.] Causes of Death. In Table VII. the causes of death of residents of the City have been tabulated in the new form prescribed by the Local Government Board. An attempt has been made to distribute the deaths in Public Institutions according to locality of the home of the deceased persons, but the information has not been given in a very large proportion of cases. Hence the discrepancy between the figures under " Deaths in Whole 47 District at subjoined ages," and " Deaths in Localities (at all ages)." It should also be noted that the deaths of residents which took place in Metropolitan Institutions, other than those immediately under the control of the Authorities of the City, have not been returned for inclusion among the official statistics In Table VIII. the actual numbers of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases, recorded as those of residents of the City by the RegistrarGeneral, during the ten years 1890-99, have been set out. Deaths from Phthisis since 1894 have been similarly dealt with. e 48 TABLE VIII. Deaths from the Principal Zymotic Diseases.

Of the City deaths, 7.44 per cent. were caused by injuries or violence (as compared with 6.56 in 1899), being 0.29 above the average for the previous five years. The percentage of registered deaths from violence in the Metropolis appears to have been fairly constant during the above period, but the percentage last year was 0.13 higher than the average of the previous five years. In the City of London, the ratio of deaths from violence to deaths from all causes, which had regularly diminished since 1894, rose to 7.44, being an increase of 0.88 per cent. over the figures of 1899. 50 PERCENTAGE OF REGISTERED DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE.

During 1900, 146 persons died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 27.9 per cent. of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis being 18.3 per cent. This high percentage is caused in the City by the excessive proportion the number of inmates in these places (exclusive of officers and their families) bears to the population, the ratio being about 1 : 25, as compared with 1 : 101 in 51 the Metropolis (Census 1891). In other words, these figures represent that 1 in every 25 citizens is an inmate of either a Workhouse, Workhouse Infirmary or a Lunatic Asylum, in comparison with 1 in every 101 inhabitants of the Metropolis.

In 1862, the previous ten years showed that of every 100 deaths in the City, 14.5, or about 1 in every 7 only, were paupers who died in City Workhouses. 53 . ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS, HOUNDSDITCH. These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers during 1884-1885, were opened in January of the latter year. They stand upon ground formerly the site of Mount Court, Wood Green Court, Ebenezar Square, Meeting House Yard, Angel Court, Coak's Buildings, George Court, and Petticoat Square, in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks," severally named King's—Queen's—Prince's—North—and South, of dwellings, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class. Some of the ground floors are let as shops. Exclusive of the shops and cellars, they contain 539 rooms, arranged in 260 tenements, and are at present occupied by 1,066 persons, most of whom are Jews. Fifty-three per cent. are adults and forty-seven per cent. children. The total cost of the buildings and land upon which they stand was £202,242, which are now .See Report on the w.c. accommodation at these buildings presented to the Sanitary Committee, 26th June, 1901.—W. C. 54 maintained at an annual expenditure of about £1,850. The income derived from letting the tenements is £5,550, being 1.83 per cent. interest on the capital outlay. They are much sought after, and the rooms are rarely empty. The rent varies from 4s. 6d. to 9s. per week. The death rate for 1900 was 17.8 per 1,000 per annum [of which 52.6 per cent. were children under 5 years of age]. Deaths of children under one year to 1,000 births were 146, as against 179 for the City generally. The number of births was 41, viz.:17 males and 24 females. The birth rate has risen from 37.5 in 1899 to 38.4 in 1900 ; being again much below the average for the previous five years, viz., 42.7 per 1,000 per annum. There has only been one illegitimate birth in in these buildings since 1894, a fact that speaks well for the morality of the inhabitants, who are mostly Jews. City of London.

Full details of this and every other branch of departmental work are laid before each meeting of the Sanitary Committee. 63 UNSOUND FRUIT, VEGETABLES, TINNED FOOD, &c. Three hundred and twelve cartloads of unsound food were removed by the Cleansing Department and destroyed as trade refuse at Letts' Wharf, at the written request and expense of the owners. The material so disposed of comprised:— Vegetables and Fruit - 276 loads Condensed Milk - 15 „ Fish and Tinned Meat - 16 „ Cheese - 4 „ Miscellaneous 1 „ Total - 312 loads The number of loads dealt with in the years 1897, 1898 and 1899 were 325, 250 and 452 respectively. The above included upwards of ninety F 64 thousand tins of various kinds of food, classified as under— 25,207 Tins of Fruit. 40,032 „ Condensed Milk. 3,292 „ Fish. 1,940 „ Soup. 1,260 „ Rabbits. 2,128 ,, Vegetables. 212 „ Meat. 16,560 „ Miscellaneous. Total 90,631 The remainder of the unsound food dealt with by the Sanitary Inspectors comprised— 741 Bags of Vegetables. 60 Cwts. of Potatoes. 33 „ Dutch cheese. 480 Skins of Meat. In addition to the foregoing your Officers took possession of and destroyed a large quantity of unwholesome fruit, most of which was consigned from Holland to jam manufacturers in this country. The following are the details:— 84 Bushels of Black Currants. 140 Gallons of Apricot Pulp. 120 Baskets of Cherries. 485 „ Black Currants. 3,501 lbs. (1 ton 11 cwt. 1 qr.) of Strawberries.. 131 Tubs of Raspberries. 6 Boxes of Oranges. . One consignment. 65 The whole of this material was dealt with under Sec. (47) 8 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which provides that— "Where a person has in his possession any article "which is unsound or unwholesome, or unfit for the food "of man, he may, by written notice to the Sanitary "Authority, specifying such article and containing a "sufficient identification of it, request its removal, and "the Sanitary Authority shall cause it to be removed as " if it were trade refuse." Under Section 33 of the same Act the owner shall pay a reasonable sum for such removal, which in case of dispute is to be settled by a Petty Sessional Court. In every instance this food was conveyed to Letts' Wharf, and there destroyed in the presence of the Sanitary Inspector of the District from whence it was removed. Note.—The whole of the above was removed from riverside wharfingers' premises. Suggestions for a more systematic inspection of these places will be found in my Report to the Sanitary Committee of the 20th May last, in which reference is made to co-operation with the Port Sanitary Authority, which will ensure a stricter supervision over unsound food when removed by barge for destruction on land adjoining the lower reaches of the River Thames.—W. C. F 2 66 FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. The following are the particulars of defects found in factories and workshops, and reported to me by H. M.

Bakehouses are workshops under Sections 34, 35 and 81 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878, and, as such, subject to the authority of the Public Health Department. The proposed amendment in the law relating to these places, introduced in the Factory and Workshop Bill of last Session (1900), was referred to in page 100 of last year's Report, under the heading of Factories and Workshops. This Bill did not reach a second reading, being withdrawn by the Government on the 16th July owing to pressure of public business. There are 40 bakehouses in the City of London, viz. :—14 in the West Sanitary District, 10 in the Middle, and 18 in the East District, located as shown in the following Table :— Note.—Clause 28 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Acts Amendment Bill, read a second time in the House of Commons on the 17th June, 1901, defines an " underground " bakehouse as one of which the floor is 3 feet or more below the surface of the ground.

All were formerly declared by the Sanitary Committee "nuisances'' within the meaning of Sec. 24 (b) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in consequence of the emission of " black smoke," and notices were served in due course in each instance. This work involved 409 separate inspections by the officer specially detailed for the prevention of smoke nuisances. In consequence of numerous complaints being received (including two sent by the Thames Conservancy and one by the London County Council) of dense volumes of smoke proceeding from the chimney shaft of the " Daily Mail " Publishing Company's premises in Tallis Street, a summons was obtained against the offenders, and the case heard before the Lord Mayor at the Mansion House Justice Room. h 2 98 The first hearing took place on the 19th April, 1900, with the result of an adjournment for 28 days; again on the 17th May, when the case was adjourned for 14 days; again on the 31st May, when it was adjourned for 28 days; again on the 28th June, when there was another 14 days adjournment; and finally on the 12th July, when the case was dismissed on the defendants undertaking to provide the whole of the boilers with the same make of smoke-consuming arrangement which had been experimentally tried on one furnace. On the 27th September, 1900, the Manager of the Cold Air Stores, Leadenhall Market, was summoned at the Mansion House Justice Room for causing a smoke nuisance at the premises under his charge. The case being fully proved, the Court made an order for the abatement of the nuisance within seven days, and imposed ten shillings costs. 99 PUBLIC WATER-CLOSETS AND UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES. There are now 32 Underground Conveniences in the City, of which eight are provided for the use of women. They contain 267 urinal compartments and 181 water-closets. During week days the majority are open until 11 or 12.30 p.m., the one in Cannon Street not closing until 1 a.m. On Sundays three are closed all day, the one at Billingsgate is closed at 2 p.m., and the remainder are open until 11 p.m. Both at Golden Lane and Farringdon Street free accommodation is provided for women, a boon that is unquestionably much appreciated by females of the poorer classes. 100 HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The Superintendent of Cleansing reports that t the refuse removed from the City in 1900 consisted of 28,708 cart-loads of street sweepings and slop, and 44,811 loads of house and trade refuse ; total, 73,549. Of this bulk, 24,121 loads were consumed by the Destructor at Letts' Wharf, an increase of nearly per cent, on the amount so dealt with last year.

This skip system for house refuse removal, which commenced in 1892, has been extended as circumstances demanded, and much benefit has accrued to the persons for whose relief the method was adopted. The public dust-bins, which were, from their misuse, a nuisance and a constant source of trouble, have been abolished. Up to the end of the year 807 of these skips had been supplied in the poorer neighbourhoods without charge, and 530 were paid for by ratepayers : total 1,337. SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS, & c. The flushing of the more thickly-populated and poorer parts of the City during the hot months was carried on as usual, followed by the use of deodorants in the channels running through the courts and alleys, &c. 102 In this service, but including the streets, 38,111,835 gallons of water were used, and many thousand gallons of disinfectants were employed. Forty-seven places were so treated in the East District ; thirty-six in the Middle District; and eighty-four in the West District. Total 167. The entrances to forty-one courts were cleansed and lime-washed, viz.: twelve in the East District; four in the Middle District; and twenty-jive in the West District. A list of places dealt with are subjoined. In Lower Thames Street, and especially in the neighbourhood of Billingsgate Market and the Custom House, road flushing was freely employed and deodorants subsequently used at least twice in twenty-four hours, it being always difficult to keep the place free from nuisance caused by the leakages from the fish carts, which rapidly decompose and cause great annoyance to the public unless promptly dealt with. 103 SUMMER FLUSHING OF STREETS, COURTS AND ALLEYS.

FISH SUPPLIES. 187,684 tons of fish, of which 149,615 were land-borne and 38,069 water-borne, were received at or near Billingsgate Market during the year. 120 This was an increase of 16,608 tons over the average of the previous five years, and 7,701 tons more than the total for 1899. Of the above, 144,049 tons were consigned to Billingsgate Market, the remainder, viz., 43,635, being delivered at the salesmen's shops in the neighbourhood of the Market. Year.

A dairyman was fined 40s. and 10s. costs for abstracting 46 per cent. of fat from a sample of Milk. Two other dairymen, carrying on business together, were summoned under the provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts for selling Margarine as Butter, and were each fined £10 and 4s. costs. The same persons were also summoned under the Margarine Act for selling Margarine in a package by retail, the same not being durably marked with the word "Margarine." Both were again convicted and fined 20s. and 4s. costs each. A provision dealer was summoned for selling Milk adulterated with 11 per cent. of added water. The Magistrate being of opinion that a technical offence only had been committed,' 129 fined the defendant in the mitigated penalty of 5s. and 2s. costs. A dining-room proprietor was fined £3 and 2s. costs for selling Milk containing 11 per cent. of added water. Note by Dr. Collingridge (May, 1901). The following remarks of my predecessor, who combined the office of Public Analyst with that of Medical Officer of Health, possess now historic interest, inasmuch as the point at issue has since been determined by the authorities alluded to by him, and they are only inserted here for the reason that he never wearied of drawing attention to an admitted evil, viz., a lack of any statutory standards of purity for the guidance of Public Analysts. It is sad to think that Dr. Sedgwick Saunders did not live to see his recommendations bear fruit. In his last signed Annual Report, viz., that for 1899, will be found some interesting observations on the vexed question, "What is Milk ?" k 2 130 "Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, and the Board of Agriculture. "The Board of Agriculture have recently addressed "three circular memoranda to Local Authorities in "Great Britain, directing attention to the general "provisions of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, "which came into operation on the 1st instant, and the "same have been handed to me. "These documents have received my careful considera"tion, and I find that with the exception of some "few notes relating to questions of law, &c., they supply "no information beyond that contained in my Report on "the same subject presented to you on the 28th "November last. "There is one fact, however, in connection with them "worthy of more than passing notice. They are issued "primarily for the guidance of those responsible for the "due administration of the above Act, and through"out them we find the Board of Agriculture directing "the special attention of Local Authorities to the fresh "duties thereby imposed upon them. Yet, although "almost every clause of the Act is dissected therein, one "of the most important obligations entrusted to the " Board itself is not even mentioned. "I refer to Section 4, which empowers the Board of "Agriculture to make regulations for determining the " normal constituents of milk, cream, butter or cheese. "A fourth circular, marked A 8-c5-, was received from the "Board on the 1st instant, in which the same omission "is noticeable. 131 "This latter communication is merely an amplification "of a summary of Section 3, to which they had "previously referred in their circular marked A82/c, "received on the 4th December last, and the Board "have again failed to discuss Section 4, which, in the "views of many, is considered one of the most important "provisions of the whole Act, "This is the more to be regretted, since the Sale of Food "and Drugs Act, 1899, after years of tedious cousidera"tion, was avowedly passed by both Houses of "Parliament for the advantage of English agri"culturists in general, and dairy farmers in particular. "The interests of those engaged in these industries "and the public would be better served, if the Board of "Agriculture directed their energies to more promptly "availing themselves of the opportunity the Legislature "has placed in their hands, and forthwith settle a "question of so essential importance as that of formu"lating regulations for analysis and standards of purity "in milk, cream, butter and cheese, instead of issuing a "series of extracts from an Act with which the "officials of Local Authorities should certainly by this "time be well acquainted. "I am not unmindful of the fact that the power to "issue such regulations is permissive, but it does not "require much foresight to prophesy that until the "Board in question takes the initiative, the benefit to "both farmers and the public by the new Statute will "be more apparent than real. "(Signed) Wm. SEDGWICK SAUNDERS. "23rd January, 1900." 132 In this connection it is well to state here that six days later, viz., on the 29th January, the President of the Board of Agriculture appointed a Departmental Committee to enquire and report— ''what regulations, if any, may with advantage be "made by the Board of Agriculture under Section 4 of "the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, for determin"ing what deficiency, if any, of the normal constituents "of genuine milk and cream, or what addition of "extraneous matter or proportion of water in any sample "of milk (including condensed milk) or cream, shall for "the purposes of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 "to 1899, raise a presumption, until the contrary is "proved, that the milk or cream is not genuine." The following gentlemen constituted the Committee, which held 15 sittings for the purpose of taking evidence:— Lord Wenlock, G.C.S.I., G.C.I.E., Chairman. Mr. Geo. Barham. Mr. Geo. Cowan. Major Patrick Geo. Craigie, an Assistant Secretary of the Board of Agriculture. Mr. S. W. Farmer. Mr. Shirley F. Murphy, Medical Officer of Health for the County of London. 133 Professor Thorpe, F.R.S., Principal Chemist of the Government Laboratories, and Mr. J. Augustus Yoelcker, Ph.D. The number of witnesses examined was 49, of whom 15 were analysts, 17 were dairy farmers, and 12 were representative milk traders and distributors. The subject of the enquiry was dealt with under four headings, viz.:— (a) Milk {i.e. whole or full milk). (b) Skimmed (or separated milk). (c) Condensed milk, and (d) Cream. So far as "extraneous matter"mentioned in the terms of the reference might be held to apply to the use of preservatives or colouring matter, the Committee did not think it within their province to make any recommendation in view of the fact that the subject was being investigated by a Departmental Committee appointed by the Local Government Board. 134 On the 16th January last, the Committee signed their Report, which contained the following recommendations:— "RECOMMENDATIONS. "114. The Committee beg to make the following "recommendations: — "I. That regulations under Section 4 of the Food "and Drugs Act, 1899, be made by the Board of "Agriculture with respect to Milk (including "condensed milk) and Cream." "II. (a) That in the case of any milk (other than "skimmed, separated, or condensed milk) the "total milk-solids in which on being dried at "100 degrees Centigrade do not amount to "12 per cent. a presumption shall be raised, until "the contrary is proved, that the milk is deficient "in the normal constituents of genuine milk." "(b) That any milk (other than skimmed, separated, or condensed milk) the total milk-solids in "which are less than 12 per cent., and in which "the amount of milk-fat is less than 3.25 per "cent., shall be deemed to be so deficient in milk"fat as to raise a presumption, until the contrary "is proved, that it has been mixed with separated "milk or water, or that some portion of its "normal content of milk-fat has been removed. "In calculating the percentage amount of de"ficiency of fat the analyst shall have regard to "the above-named limit of 3.25 per cent. of "milk-fat." 135 "(c) That any milk (other than skimmed, separated or "condensed milk) the total milk-solids in which "are less than 12 per cent., and in which the "amount of non-fatty milk-solids is less than "8.5 per cent., shall be deemed to be so deficient "in normal constituents as to raise a presumption, "until the contrary is proved, that it has been "mixed with water. In calculating the percent"age amount of admixed water, the analyst shall "have regard to the above-named limit of 8.5per "cent. of non-fatty milk-solids, and shall further "take into account the extent to which the milk"fat may exceed 3.25 per cent." "III. That the artificial thickening of cream by any "addition of gelatin or other substance shall "raise a presumption that the cream is not "genuine." "IV. That any skimmed or separated milk in which "the total milk-solids are less than 9 per cent., "shall be deemed to be so deficient in normal "constituents as to raise a presumption, until the "contrary is proved, that it has been mixed with "water." "V. That any condensed milk (other than that "labelled 'machine-skimmed milk' or 'skimmed "milk,' in conformity with Section 11 of the "Food and Drugs Act, 1899) in which either "the amount of milk-fat is less than 10 per cent., "or the amount of non-fatty milk-solids is less "than 25 per cent., shall be deemed to be so "deficient in some of the normal constituents of "milk as to raise a presumption, until the con"trary is proved, that it is not genuine." 136 "115. The Committee beg farther to submit the "following expressions of opinion on points raised before "them in evidence:— "(a) That it is desirable to call the attention of those "engaged in the administration of the Food and "Drugs Acts to the necessity of adopting effective "measures to prevent any addition of water, "separated or condensed milk, or other extraneous "matter, for the purpose of reducing the quality "of genuine milk to any limits fixed by regulation "of the Board of Agriculture." "(6) That it is desirable that steps should be taken "with the view of identifying or 'ear-marking' "separated milk by the addition of some suitable "and innocuous substance, and by the adoption "of procedure similar to that provided by Section 7 "of the Food and Drugs Act, 1899, in regard "to margarine." "(c) That it is desirable that, so far as may be found "practicable, the procedure adopted in collecting, "forwarding, and retaining pending examination, "samples of milk (including condensed milk) and "cream under the Food and Drugs Acts should "be uniform." "(d) That it is desirable that, so far as may be found "practicable, the methods of analysis used in the "examination of samples of milk (including con"densed milk) or cream taken under the Food "and Drugs Acts should be uniform." "(f) That it is desirable in the case of condensed milk "(other than that labelled' machine-skimmed "' milk 'or' skimmed milk, 'in conformity with "Section 11 of the Food and Drugs Act, 1899), 137 "that the label should state the amount of "dilution required to make the proportion of "milk-fat equal to that found in uncondensed "milk containing not less than 3.25 per cent. of "milk-fat." "(f) That it is desirable in the case of condensed "whole milk to limit, and in the case of condensed "machine-skimmed milk, to exclude, the addition "of sugar." "(g) That the official standardising of the measuring "vessels commercially used in the testing of milk "is desirable." The Report of this Departmental Committee is full of interest, and although largely technical, yet the subject in the main is treated in such a manner as to be both intelligible and instructive, and I commend its reading to all engaged in the prevention of food adulteration. 14th May, 1901.

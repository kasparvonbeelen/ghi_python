THE TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Honourable Commissioners of Sewers of the CITY of London. Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the statistical facts relating to the sanitary condition of the City of London for the year which ended in September last. They are appended, as usual, in tabular FORM; and you will perceive that 1,996 births, 2,025 deaths, and 1,250 marriages were registered in the City during the year. All these numbers are considerably below the averages for the last ten 8 years, and they are the annual proportion of 17.4 births, 17.7 deaths, and 10.9 marriages per 1000 of the population, according to the census of 1861. In all England the averages are .5.1 births, 22.6 deaths, and 8.4 marriages per 1000 of the people. I am not able to distribute the marriages, as I have hitherto done among the several Unions of the City, because, on the 1st of January last, the East and West London Unions were incorporated with the City of London Union, by direction of the Poor Law Board, and from that time the whole of the marriages in the City have been returned under one heading, namely, "The City of London Union;" but the births and deaths of the three Unions were as follow:— Number of Marriages, Births, and Deaths, in the several Unions of the City in 1870, and the Annual Averages for the last Ten Years. Marriages. Births. Deaths. East London Union (1870) 945 833 Annual Average of Ton Years 480 1,158 997 West London Union (1870) — 505 513 Annual Average of Ten Years 451 693 698 City of London Union (1870) — 546 679 Annual Average of Ten Years 578 847 879 Entire City (1870) 1,250 1,996 2,025 Annual Average of Ten Years 1,509 2,698 2,574 9 These numbers are at the following rates per 1000 of the population:— Number of Marriages, Births, and Deaths per 1,000 of the Population of the City, and elsewhere. Annual Rate per 1,000 Living. Marriages. Births. Deaths. East London Union (1870) 22.89 20.18 West London Union 18.89 19.18 City of London Union 11.75 14.61 Entire City (1870) 10.92 17.44 17.69 Ditto Average of Ten Years 13.18 23.57 22.48 London 10.12 35.09 24.06 England 8.46 35.35 22.48 France 7.98 26.57 23.27 Austria 8.37 40.16 30.58 As regards the marriages, these results show that the proportion has declined from an annual average of 13.18 per 1000 of the population to 10.92, which is only a little above the average for London (10.12), although it is much above the averages for the whole of England (8.46), France (7.98), and Austria (8.37). The birth-rate in the City has fluctuated to a large extent; for in the central division of the City it was but 11.75 per 1000 of the population, whereas in the Western division it was 18.89, and in the Eastern 22.89—the average for the entire City being 10 17.44. During the last ten years the average birthrate of the City has been 23'57. In the whole of the Metropolis it has been 35.09; in all England, 35.35; in France, 26.57; and in Austria, 40.16. The low birth-rate of the central division of the City is attributable to the circumstance that the population consists, in great part, of young unmarried persons, who are employed in the City warehouses, and perhaps also to a great falling off in the number of the population since the census of 1861. This, in fact, is the explanation of the apparently low birth-rate of all the districts of the City. There is, however, a remarkable feature in these statistics, namely, that notwithstanding the small proportion of births, the number of marriages is comparatively large: from which it may be inferred that those who marry in the City do not remain in it to contribute to its future population. \ Of the 1,996 chidren born in the course of the year, 1,014 were males, and 982 females. These are in the proportion of 1,032 boys to 1000 girls— the average for the last ten years being 1,036 to 1000. In all England the average proportion is 1,043 to 1000, and in the whole of London it is 1,036 to 1000. The largest number of births occurred in the winter quarter, ending in March, and the smallest 11 in the spring, ending in June : in fact, if we take 1000 as the average for each quarter, it will be found that only 944 occurred in the spring time, 996 in the summer, 988 in the autumn, and 1,072 in the winter. This is a little abnormal, for the average proportions throughout England are 1,036 for the spring quarter, 965 for the summer, 960 for autumn, and 1,039 for the winter. The death-rate in the City ranged as we have said from 14*6 per 1,000 of the inhabitants of the Central district, to 20 of the Eastern—the average for the entire City being 17.7. In the preceding ten years, the average has been 22.5. In the whole of the Metropolis it has been 24.1; in England, 22.5 ; in France, 23.3; and in Austria, 30.6. These large differences of death-rate are, as I explained in my last yearly report, attributable to similar differences of birth-rate; for as the mortality of children is excessively high (amounting to not less than 160 per 1,000 per annum, the rest of the population being only 20) it follows, as a matter of course, that wherever the birth-rate is large, the death-rate also must be large; and therefore, the death-rate alone of any place will afford no indication of its comparative salubrity. I entered very fully into this matter in my last annual report, and showed you that a high death-rate, instead of being an indication 12 of insalubrity, is often a sign of prosperity, for it generally tells of a high birth-rate, which is the unmistakeable characteristic of a flourishing community. Of the 2,025 deaths in the City during the year, 1,007 were males and 1,018 females. This is the reverse of the common proportions; for during the last ten years the proportions were 922 females to 1,000 males; and in all England they are 959 to 1,000. As regards the influence of season on the deathrate, as shewn in the third table of the appendix, the facts may be thus expressed—1,000 deaths in each quarter being taken as the average for comparison. Proportional Number of Births and Deaths in each Quarter of the Year. QUARTERS ENDING. BIRTHS. DEATHS. City of London. England. City of London. England. 1870. Average of Ten Years.

The distribution of the deaths according to age is shewn in the fourth Table of the Appendix. As I have already said, the largest mortality occurs among children of less than five years of age. In the East London Union the number of deaths at this period of life amounted to 42 per cent, of all the deaths; in the West London Union to rather less than 36 per cent; and in the City Union to only 26 per cent.—the mortality in the whole City being from 34 to 35 of all the deaths. The comparatively low mortality of children in the central district is evidently due to the small proportion of births in that district; for if we estimate the infant mortality according to the number of births in the three City Unions, it will be found that for every 100 children born in the Eastern and Western districts nearly 19 die before they are a year old, and in the Central division of the City 16. In all England the average death-rate of infants at this age is a little less than 16 per cent., whereas during the last ten years it has been just 17 per cent, in the City. 14 With respect to the causes of death, the principal facts are the following—tubercular diseases, including phthisis, tabes-mesenterica, scrofula, and hydrocephalus, have been less fatal than usual; the same has been the case with alvine disorders, continued fever, small-pox, measles, whooping-cough, and croup, but infantile convulsions, scarlet-fever, and inflammatory affections of the lungs have been more than usually fatal—the most notable increase being from scarlet-fever, which has risen from an average of 90 in the year to 127. The relative proportion 0† deaths from each of these causes has been as follows:— 15 Proportion of Deaths from each cause, in every 1,000 Deaths from all causes. CAUSES. East London Union.

For two years past the number of deaths from scarlet-fever has been excessive : last year the number was 127,and the year before it was 123, whereas in the two preceding years it was but 40 and 30. In the years 1863 and 1864, as well as in 1855, 1856, and 1859, the mortality from scarlet-fever was unusually high—in fact, it has prevailed as an epidemic on 70 ccasions during the last 16 years, and frequently with continued fevers. Last year the number of deaths from the various forms of continued fever was only 54, whereas in the 5 years from 1862 to 1866, inclusive, it ranged from 105 to 170 per annum. The causes of these fluctuations in the severity of the different kinds of zymotic diseases is entirely beyond our comprehension; for although each year has its special epidemic, yet in the aggregate the total mortality from all forms of zymotic disease remains about the same. This will be apparent from the following table:— 17 Classification of Deaths according to Zymotic Causes during the last Sixteen Years. Years. Alvine Disorders. Continued Fevers. Scarlet Fever. Small-pox. Measles. Whooping Cough. Croup and Diphtheria. Erysipelas.

The same fact is observable in all the large towns of England; and it shows that although there may be many notable fluctuations, year by year, in the intensity of certain specific diseases, yet the aggregate mortality from all causes remains at nearly the same point. In 18 the census years, for example, of 1841, 1851, and 1861, when the exact number of the population of England was known, the death-rates of the kingdom were 21.59, 21.99, and 21.63 per 1,000 of the population; and even upon the broader basis of a ten years experience, as during the last three decades, the average annual death rate has been 22.37, 22.24, and 22.24 respectively—the mean death-rate for the whole time having been 22.4 per 1,000 of the people. At first sight this does not appear to be very encouraging to our sanitary labours, seeing how much has been done during the last thirty years for the purpose of improving the sanitary condition of the country; but careful observation has shown that wherever the dwellings of the poor have been improved, and overcrowding prevented—wherever the soil has been drained, and kept free from excremental pollution— and wherever unwholesome branches of industry have been ameliorated—there has been a marked diminution in the force of certain classes of diseases. The researches of Dr. Buchanan, for example, have exposed the fact—that by draining the subsoil of a town, and so diminishing the dampness of its atmosphere, the mortality from phthisis is invariably reduced ; and the experience of every Officer of Health is to the effect that by freeing the soil from organic pollution, the force of endemic bowel complaints, and of typhoid fever and cholera is greatly 19 diminished. Small-pox, too, is a disease which is almost entirely within the control of prophylactic measures ; and these are all encouragements for the continued prosecution of sanitary works. The influence of season on the mortality from different diseases is shewn in the sixth table of the appendix; and it will be observed from the statistics of the last ten years, that hydrocephalus, infantile convulsions, measles, whooping-cough, and croup, have generally been most fatal in the spring quarters; while tabes-mesenterica, scrofula, alvine disorders, and scarlet-fever have been most severe in summer and autumn—phthisis, and inflammatory affections of the lungs, being the most marked diseases of winter. The sickness returns for the year have heen extracted from the books of the Union, and they are a little below the average for the last ten years, there having been a notable decrease of several important diseases, as, for example, continued-fever, which has declined from an average of 631 cases in the year to 439 ; diarrhoea from 960 to 527, and small-pox from 88 to 10 ; but scarlet-fever has advanced in severity, for last year there were 122 cases against an average of less than a hundred. At the beginning of the year fears were entertained of a probable severity of relapsing-fever, but only 10 cases of it are recorded in the parish medical books, and there have been no 20 registered deaths from the disease. It is very likely, therefore, that the timely warning of its approach enabled the guardians to apply successful preventive measures, as the disease is essentially duo to poverty and want. The chief facts connected with the meteorology of the year have been deduced, as usual, from the observations at Guildhall and at Greenwich— the former being under tho superintendance of Mr. Haywood, and the latter of Mr. Glaisher.

The average temperature at which dew has been deposited from the air has been 48.2 degrees in the Autumn quarter, 36.5 in the Winter, 48.2 in the Spring, and 51.6 in the Summer; and the degree of humidity has ranged from 68 (saturation being 100) to 86—the average for the whole year being 77, against a mean of 80 degrees for the last ten years. This comparative dryness of the atmosphere is referable to the small rainfall of the year, it having been but 17.95 inches, instead of 24.47; and the number of wet days has been 118 instead of 169. The first quarter of the year (that ending in December, 1869) was rather wetter than usual, but all the others have been drier—the total rainfall, for example, in the quarter ending in March, was but 3 92 inches, against an average of 6.08 inches, and that of the following Spring quarter was but 1.64, instead of 5.91. These circumstances have doubtless had their influence on the public health; for dry and warm seasons are nearly always salubrious. 22 As usual, the quality of the water supplied to the Metropolis during the year has been carefully analysed in the laboratory of the London Hospital; and the following are the average results :— Average Chemical Composition of the Metropolitan Waters for the Year 1870.

The hardness of the general supply has been about 14 degrees, and this has been reduced by boiling to rather less than 4 degrees; but the chalk water has had an average hardness of 20 degrees before boiling, and 5.2 degrees after. As to the proportion of organic matter in the water, it has been very small, for the quantity of oxygen required to act on every description of oxydisable matter has ranged from only 0.011 of a grain per gallon to 0.085; and the proportions of ammonia, and of organic nitrogen have never reached beyond the one four thousandth part of a grain per gallon of water. As public attention has been again directed to the question of supplying London with soft water, I have taken some pains to ascertain the comparative salubrity of the places in England and Scotland which are supplied with hard and soft water; and in addition to the 19 large towns, whose death-rates are constantly reported by the Registrar General, I have obtained from his office the average birth-rates and death-rates of many other cities and towns of England during the five years (1861—1866), and the general results of these inquiries are expressed in the following tables :— 24 Comparative Mortality in the Nineteen Large Towns of England and Scotland, referred to in the Registrar General's Weekly Report for 1870, arranged under the heads of Hard-watert and Soft-water Supply— 10 degrees of hardness being taken as the standard.

In the former table, the soft water districts gave a death-rate of 28.1 per 1,000 of the population, against an average of only 23.7 in the hard water; and in the last table it stands as 28.04 per 1,000, to 22.00. In point of fact, after making every 26 ance for the differences of birth-rates in the two cases there is a large excessive mortality in the soft water districts. This is quite in accordance with the facts which I submitted to your notice in in my last annual report, and it is sufficiently striking to command attention. The average daily quantity of water supplied to the metropolis during the year by the several water companies was 103,325,660 gallons; and it ranged from an average of 93,650,519 gallons per day in December, 1869, to 116,293,521 gallons per day in June last. The average number of houses supplied was 477,262; and the particulars relating to this, as furnished to me by the Companies for the information of the Medical Officers of Health of London, as well as the particulars of the water supply of Paris, so far as they have been received, are as follows :— 27 Average amounts of Water supplied daily to London and Paris during each Month of the Year ending September 1870.

That a constant service would be a great boon to the poor is admitted on all hands, for the filthy condition and exposed situation of their water receptacles is almost always such as to render the 28 water foul and offensive; besides which, they are so constantly in a dilapidated state that they rarely hold sufficient water from day to day. This has been a matter of considerable anxiety to my predecessor, Mr. Simon, and to myself from the very beginning of our office, and it has been the subject of frequent reports to you. As far back as the year 1849 Mr. Simon remarked that "in inspecting the courts and alleys of the City, one constantly sees butts for the reception of water either public or in the open yards of houses, or sometimes in their houses; and these butts, dirty, mouldering, and coverless, receiving soot and all other impurities from the air, absorbing stench from the adjacent cesspool, inviting filth from insects, vermin, sparrows, cats, and children, their contents often augmented through a rain-water pipe by the washings of the roof, and every hour becoming fustier and more offensive." At the present time, with all the improvements that have been made since Mr. Simon wrote, this is frequently the state of the water receptacles in the City; and no sanitary supervision can prevent it while the present intermittent supply of water to the houses of the poor, with the intermedium of the filthy butt, exists. I have been at great pains to examine chemically and microscopically the quality of the water in some of the worst of these receptacles; and although the dissolved impurities have not been so large as I had expected, 29 yet the filthy matters which composed the insoluble deposit were in the highest degree offensive-confirming in a most unmistakeable manner the conclusion of the Select Committee appointed by Parliament to inquire into the Metropolitan Water Bills for 1867, that "the use of cisterns for the purpose of storing water for consumption is probably a more fertile cause of impurity than any pollution of the river from which the water is drawn." So forcibly was I impressed with this when I gave my evidence before the Royal Commission on Water Supply in 1868, that, in reply to the chairman as to my views respecting a constant service in London, I said that, "as an abstract question, there can be no doubt that the constant supply is a very advantageous thing to the public, chiefly because they would get their water cooler, more grateful, less liable to the pollution to which it is now subject after it is delivered by the water companies; and if the question really turned upon the state of the water in poor people's houses, I should say that the constant supply to them, whether it be in a court by a stand-pipe, or whether it be in their own yards by a standpipe, would be a boon, the good of which is hardly to be calculated." Having regard for this matter, I have earnestly endeavoured to abolish the cisterns and butts in the houses of the poor of the City, by advising that they should be replaced by a 30 constant service from the mains of the water companies; and in this endeavour I have met with the most cordial co-operation from the two companies which supply the City with water; but in no case have I been able to overcome the objections of landlords, who fear the expense of a novel contrivance; and it is unfortunate that your legal powers do not enable you to prescribe the mode whereby such water should be furnished. In the year 1866, when cholera was prevalent in the eastern part of the City, your sanitary committee, acting on my advice, distributed among the landlords of all the poorer dwellings in the City a notice respecting the dangers of the present system of supply, and asking them to adopt the more wholesome, and in the end less expensive, method of supplying water to their tenements directly from the mains; at the same time informing them that the New River Company were ready to supply the inhabitants with water for drinking and other purposes, by means of a stand-post in each house, or in the courts, on condition that the same was provided with some effective apparatus to prevent waste—the cost of which would be much less than that of erecting separate cisterns; and with the view of demonstrating the advantages of this method of supply, the Commissioners erected at their own cost 18 of such stand-posts, with waste-water preventers, in various parts of the City; but nowhere, 31 except in the quarter occupied by the Jewish poor, was this example followed. Two years after this the matter was again brought into public notice, by a report from the engineer and myself, prepared at your request, to show the advantages of the system. At that time there were 27 of these stand-posts, with waste-water preventers, in the City—18 of which had been provided and maintained by the Commissioners, and 9 by the Jewish Board of Guardians; and the two years experience of their usefulness had been so conclusively satisfactory to us, that we recommended their employment by the landlords of the poorer class of dwellings, wherever it was practicable ; but, as in the last case, the recommendation was abortive. Very recently, in consequence of a communication from the Gas and Water Committee of the corporation, the matter has been again discussed, and we have ascertained from the New River Company that in consideration of the importance of the subject, they are prepared to lay down at their own expense a constant service into every court occupied by the poor of the City, and to provide the necessary waste-water contrivance (which will cost in each case about £2), at a rental of six per cent, on the outlay—the landlord being under the obligation to keep it in repair. It is hardly possible to meet the question in a more liberal spirit, and yet I fear, from the prejudices of landlords, which 82 tory powers do not enable you to deal with, that this much desired change will not bo effected. I am, however, informed by Mr. Liddle, the medical officer of health of Whitechapel, that there are 92 of these Stand-pipes with waste-water-preventers in his district, affording a constant supply of water to upwards of 7,000 poor people, and that numerous houses occupied by the poor of the district have for years past boon furnished with a small pipe in connection with the mam which delivers a constant supply to the house tap—to the groat comfort of the tenants, and without loss of water to the Company. But although the supply of water by constant service to the poor is admitted on all hands to bo a pressing necessity, there are grave doubts on the subject of its general applicability to all classes of the metropolis; for it would involve such a complete change in the present arrangement of fittings, pipeago, and all other appliances, as to bo both difficult and costly. Besides which, it would require a system of supervision and interference which would hardly at first be tolerated. That the public are not in want of this change is manifest from the circumstance that they do not ask for it, and that practically they consider the supply already constant. By the fifteenth section of the Metropolis Water Act of 1852, the water companies are bound to provide a constant service, reaching to the top storey of the houses, 33 whenever four-fifths of the inhabitants of a district, or rather, of the occupiers of the houses require such supply, and put their pipes, cocks, and other fittings for the distribution of water into a proper condition to receive it; and it is a very significant fact that no such requisition has ever been made to the water companies. It is very doubtful, indeed, whether, if the sense of the public were taken on this important question, any such a change from the present system would be either required or sanctioned. That, perhaps, which would be agreed to by the public would be some provision for the future, as regards a constant service, when practicable, to newly-built houses, or to houses undergoing re-construction; for, doubtless, as I have already said, a well regulated constant service is preferable to the intermittent, and would be adopted but for the expense and serious inconvenience attending the change. That there is no lack of water at the present time is shown by the returns of the water companies; the supply to each house during the year which has just expired having been at the rate of 217 gallons daily, or 32.3 gallons per head of the whole population ; and this is largely in excess of what is generally considered necessary for all public, domestic, and manufacturing purposes. In answer to this it may be said that the distribution of the water, as at present conducted, is unequal, and that the waste is enormous; but all experience c 34 shows that even with the constant service the same difficulties occur, unless the supervision of houses is vigilant, strict, and constant. At Glasgow, for example, the waste of water is frightful, and at Manchester, where the system is said to work so well, the corporation are frequently obliged to caution the inhabitants against waste, and to threaten legal proceedings. In every place, in fact, where the constant service is in operation, the most stringent rules and regulations are in force concerning the quality of the pipes, the description of tap, and the situation and construction of cisterns and waste water-pipes—over all of which the Company or local authority supplying the water, must have absolute control. I have before me the regulations in force at Norwich, Sheffield, and Rochdale, which substantially represent the rules at other places, where the service is constant, and they are, in my opinion, more severe than any authority in London could easily put into operation ; for if such power were given to the companies, it would be thought excessive and arbitrary, and if confided to the local authority, it would, as elsewhere, be disregarded. However desirable, therefore, it may be to change the present intermittent system of supply in London for a constant service, the difficulties of the case are so serious as to require the fullest sanction of the public before it is attempted. 35 As regards the sanitary work of the City during the year, there have been 18,305 inspections of houses, 1,536 of which required sanitary improvement; so that 1,191 orders have been issued for cleansing and lime-whiting; 19 for erecting and repairing dust-bins; 75 for paving cellars and yards; 120 for amending the water supply; 22 for removing cesspools; 346 for repairing sinks and drains; 48 for removing waste-water; 467 for cleansing and repairing privies; 24 for abating smoke nuisance; and 76 for various other kinds of sanitary work— making a total of 2,388 orders for the sanitary improvement of the dwellings of the poor; besides which, 2,937 notices were served by the inspectors on the owners of the lodging-houses of the City, requiring them to cleanse and lime-white the walls and ceilings in accordance with the regulations of the Sanitary Act of 1866; and there were 1,997 inspections of ships in the City division of the port of London, 29 of which required and received sanitary improvement. 260 inspections have also been made of the bakehouses of the City, and 30 notices served for cleansing and lime-whiting. The particulars of these inspections are shown in the Eighth Table of the Appendix, and the following shows the work of each inspector :— 36 Names of Inspectors. Number of houses inspected.

It consisted of 575 sheep and lambs, 242 pigs, 114 calves, 590 quarters of beef, 2,885 joints of meat, and manyhundred heads, plucks, hearts, tongues, kidneys, and livers; besides 600 tins of preserved beef, 1 case of rabbits, 13 deer, 12 quarters of venison, 175 hares, 372 rabbits, 532 head of game and poultry, 2 turtles, and 15½ chests of unsound tea, all of which were destroyed. In Billingsgate Market the fish meters appointed by the Fishmongers' Company have seized and condemned on account of putridity 808,243 fish, chiefly haddock, plaice, smelts, whiting, herrings, soles, dabs, and thornbacks; besides 8,186 gallons of 37 shrimps, 498 bushels of whelks, 1,081 bushels of periwinkles, 180 bushels of mussels, 70 bushels of sprats, and large quantities of oysters, salmon, eels, and whitebait. By far the largest proportion of the fish condemned in the market was brought to London by railway. Lastly, I have to report that eleven persons have been convicted by the Magistrates of the City during the year of having sent diseased meat to the City markets for sale as human food, and they have been fined in various sums from five pounds to twenty together with the costs of the proceedings. Two persons have been sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine; and the following are the particulars of these cases :— The Prosecutions and Convictions during the Year for sending Diseased Meat to the City Markets for sale as food. 1.—Walter Dunham, Butcher, of Harleston, Norfolk.— Fined £20 and costs. 2.—Francis Marsh, Butcher, of Head Hill, Glastonbury, Somerset.— Fined £10 10s. and costs. 3.—John Leonard, of Soham, Cambridge.— Fined £5 and costs. 4.—John Moore, Butcher, of Attleborough, Warwick.— 3 Months' Imprisonment. 38 5.—Joseph Rye, Farmer, of Irthlingborough, neai Higham, Ferrers, Nottingham.—Fined 15 guineas and costs. 6.—Henry Morris, Butcher, of Queen's Road, Chelsea. —Fined £20 and costs. 7.—"William Dunnett, Butcher, of Grundisburgh.—Fined £5 and costs. 8.—Charles Fisher, Butcher, of Mark, Somerset.—2 Months' Imprisonment. 9.—Israel Clark, Butcher, of Standford, near Farringdon, Berks.—Fined £5 and costs. 10.—Henry Killborn, Butcher, of Loddington, Northamptonshire.—Fined £5 and costs. 11.—Thomas Fisher.

To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commoners of the Corporation of London. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for the year 1898. AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 672T acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.05 miles, equal to a square of 1.0247 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,672 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.7 square miles, equal to a square of 10.8 miles to a side. The City forms one of the three central Metropolitan Districts, and is divided for civil 10 registration purposes into the following five Sub-Districts, viz.:— 1. St. Botolph, including 2 parishes. 2. Cripplegate „ 2 „ 3. St. Sepulchre „ 11 „ 4. Allhallows Barking ,, 85 „ 5. Broad Street „ 13 „ Total 113 parishes. The City District or Union is co-extensive with the municipal City of London, within and without the walls, with the following exceptions: The municipal City includes the Middle Temple*, part of Staple Inn [four houses], part of Furnival's Inn [five houses], and a part of the Parish of Whitechapel [five houses], which for Poor Law and Registration purposes are comprised respectively in the Strand, Holborn and Whitechapel Districts, while the Liberty of Glasshouse Yard, with the exception of a few houses occupied by sixty-five persons, although not forming part of the municipal City, is included in the Parish of St. Botolph Without, Aldersgate, in the London City Registration District. This * Vide Census of England and Wales, 1891. The Middle Temple has since been constituted a separate Sanitary Authority. 11 Liberty contained in 1891 69 inhabited houses, occupied by 779 persons, and in 1896 only 733, according to the Imperial Census. All deaths in Glasshouse Yard are included by the Registrar-General as occurring in the City, but the Corporation is only responsible for the sanitary condition of the area comprised in the "municipal" City of London, from which this Yard, with the exceptions above mentioned, is excluded.

No Imperial Day Census has yet been taken. ANNUAL rATEABLE VALUE. The assessed rateable annual value of property within the administrative County of London was £31,819,412 in 1891 — £36,437,810 in 1898—whilst the corresponding rateable value of property in the municipal City of London was £3,984,285 in 1891, and £4,534,313 in 1898, or nearly one-eighth of the whole County. 12 POPULATION. The first Imperial Quinquennial Census was taken in the City of London on the night of the 29th March, 1896, under the provisions of the London (Equalization of Rates) Act, 1894, 57 and 58 Vic., cap. 53, sec. 3. In the Returns prepared by the RegistrarGeneral, dated 13th August, 1896, presented to Parliament, the population on the night of the enumeration was found to be 31,711, whilst in the previous decennial Imperial Census of 1891 it was 38,320, showing a decrease of 6,609 persons in the five years (1891-6). Assuming that the annual rate of decrease between 1896 and 1898 corresponded to the rate of decrease in the decennial period 1891 and 1896, the estimated population of the City at the end of June, 1898, would be 29,121. City Population. Census of 1861 112,063 ,, 1871 75,983 ,, 1881 51,405 ,, 1891 38,320 „ 1896 31,711 13 The estimated night population of the various Registration sub-districts is as under; to which the figures returned at the last Census are added for the purpose of comparison:— 1896. 1898 (estimated of the year.) St. Botolph 6,870 6,094 Cripplegate 8,299 2,855 St. Sepulchre 9,591 8,984 Allhallows 9,059 8,494 Broad Street 2,892 2,694 31,711 29,121 The population of the City, as ascertained by the Day Census taken by the Corporation at its own expense, was found to be in 1866— 170,133; in 1881—261,061; and in 1891— 301,384, showing an increase between 1866 and 1881 of 90,928, and between 1881 and 1891 of 40,823, so that if this progressive augmentation has been maintained since 1891, a Day Census at June, 1898, would have shown a population of about 334,050. The Day Census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles 14 entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. MORTALITY. During the year under review, 957 deaths were registered in the District, including *615 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. Deducting the latter we have to deal with 342 deaths, to which we must add 132 persons who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered. The mortality, therefore, upon which our death rate is calculated is 474. DEATHS IN CITY INSTITUTIONS. During 1898, 132 persons died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 27.9 per cent. of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis being 16.8 per cent. This high percentage is caused in the City by the enormous proportion the number of * In St. Bartholomew's Hospital alone 613 deaths of non-resident occurred. 15 inmates in these places (exclusive of officers and their families) bears to our population, the ratio being about 1: 19, as compared with 1: 109 in the Metropolis. In other words, these figures represent that 1 in every 19 citizens is an inmate of either a Workhouse, Workhouse Infirmary or a Lunatic Asylum, in comparison with 1 in every 109 inhabitants of the Metropolis. Table showing the percentage of deaths occurring in Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries and Lunatic Asylums to total deaths in the City of London and the Metropolis respectively, for the five years 1894-5-6-7-8:— Year.

On searching our records I find that my predecessor stated in his Annual Report for 1862 that the results of the previous ten years showed that of every 100 deaths in the City, 14.5, or about 1 in every 7, were paupers who died in City Workhouses. The details of the deaths occurring in the City will be found in Table A., compiled in accordance with requirements of Local Government Board. DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE. Of the City deaths, 7.1 per cent. were caused by injuries or violence (as compared with 9.1 in 1897), being 2.1 below the average for the previous four years.

The death rate for 1898 was 16.3 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 19.3), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis for 1898 was 18.7.

The number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases was 18, or 0.62 per 1,000 of the population, against 2.77 for the Metropolis. The deaths of children under 1 year of age to 1,000 births come out 118, against 166 for the whole of London. BIRTHS. The number of children born in the City (see Table B) was 468. The birth rate, therefore, was 16.1 per 1,000. The birth rate for the whole of London is given as 29.5. This wide variation is due to the differences in the sex and age distribution of their populations. 1898.

Of the births, 212 were successfully vaccinated, 38 died before the age for vaccination, 25 were postponed by medical certificate, 66 removed into other districts, and 127 were pending at the end of the year. During the same period only 77 adults, &c., were re-vaccinated, a number far below the necessities of our population, it being clearly proved that infant vaccination does not confer a life-long immunity from Small-pox, and requires renewal at ages between 7 and 10, and again in the presence of an epidemic invasion.

Unless 22 rumour lies, this degradation was forced upon the Government by political exigency, but, whatever the cause, it has thrown back progressive sanitation for an indefinite period, casts an indelible slur upon its authors, and forms a curious commentary upon the dogma of their great chief who taught the doctrine of sanitas sanitatem, omnia sanitas. It needs no prophetic power to forecast the outcome of this departure from the true principles of preventive medicine. At the appointed time when the usual cycle of events brings a visitation of Small-pox, we shall see our fellow beings, some disfigured for life, others hopelessly blind. The Nemesis representing the righteous anger of the gods will in due course inevitably claim the penalty for this wicked violation of the established and abundantly proved protection afforded by vaccination, and it will be but poetic justice and in accordance with the irony of events, if its authors and their descendants are the first victims ;-and few will pity them ! 23 RETURN relating to Vaccination for the Year ending 1898. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Sub-District.

These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers during 1884-1885, were opened in January of the latter year. They stand upon ground formerly the site of Mount Court, Wood Green Court, Ebenezar Square, Meeting House Yard, Angel Court, Coak's Buildings, George Court, and Petticoat Square, in the Ward of Portsoken. They consist of five "blocks" of dwellings, intended for occupation by persons of the artizan class. Some of the ground floors are let out as shops. The blocks are severally named King's, Queen's, Prince's, North, and South. Exclusive of the shops and cellars, they contain 539 rooms, arranged in 260 tenements, and are at present occupied by 1,066 persons, most of whom are Jews. The total cost of the buildings and land upon which they stand was £202,242, and now entail Table of DEATHS DURING THE YEAR 1898 IN THE ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS, STONEY LANE, HOUNDSDITCH, classified according to Diseases, Ages, and Localities.

These buildings are inhabited by 1,066 persons, about 53 per cent. being adults, and 47 per cent. children. The death rate for 1898 was 8.4 per 1,000 per annum [of which 66.6 per cent. were children under 5 years of age]. Deaths of children under one year to 1,000 births was 65, as against 118 for the City generally. The number of births was 46, viz.: 22 males and 24 females. The birth rate is always high in our dwellings, being 43.1 per 1,000 last year, as against 16.1 for the whole of the City. 26 ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS. NAME OF BLOCK. North. South. King's. Queen's.

The time has arrived when the sanitary conveniences should be re-modelled, the experience of the last fourteen years having shown that the existing system of allotting water-closets for the use in common by tenants of a whole floor is objectionable, for many reasons—not the least of which is the use of the same closet by both sexes. These observations apply also to the wash-houses. Each tenement should be provided with separate and independent water-closet and washhouse accommodation. The Legislature insists upon such separate provision of sanitary conveniences for both sexes in Factories and Workshops, and the arguments in favour of this requirement apply with even greater force in the case of "model" tenements. 29 The alterations to effect these improvements need not necessarily cause any immediate heavy expenditure, as the work could be executed in sections, each staircase being dealt with in turn. In dwellings of a similar type elsewhere the system I am now advocating is universally adopted. Not a single bath-room is provided in your Dwellings; a condition of things not in accordance with modern requirements. Reverting to vaccination, I am strongly of opinion that no unvaccinated children should be admitted or allowed to remain in these dwellings. This is a subject to which I invite your serious attention. The military authorities in this country have seen the advisability of enforcing a similar regulation in the case of the women and children's quarters in barracks. Similar action has also been taken by the trustees of the Peabody Buildings. 30 NOTIFICATION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

A reference to Table B, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Board, shows that of the 158 cases of notifiable infectious disease reported, no less than 79.1 per cent. were removed to hospital for treatment, the remaining 20.9 per cent. being nursed at their own homes.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 60 (Sub-Sec. 4). The establishment at No. 6, Cotton Street, Aldersgate Street, continues in active operation. 33 Twenty families, comprising 36 adults and 30 children, total 66 persons, were provided with lodging, food and attendance during the disinfection of their houses after the following diseases:— Scarlet Fever - 6 Diphtheria 9 Small-pox 1 Measles - 3 Erysipelas 1 20 Of the above, 4 families came from homes consisting of three rooms, 8 two rooms, and 8 one room. On one occasion every bed in the Shelter was occupied. This establishment is not intended for the use of the poor only, any person within the district who may be inconvenienced by the process of disinfection having a right to the accommodation it affords. P 34 DISINFECTION. &c., AT CITY MORTUARY. 5,349 articles of bedding, clothing, furniture, &c., were received at Golden Lane and disinfected. 108 bodies were received at the Mortuary, pending interment; the number for the three preceding years being 113, 94, and 131. A practical difficulty was dealt with respecting the reception of dead bodies at the City Mortuary. Hitherto, in cases of sudden death, suicides, and drowned persons taken from the river within the City boundary, it had been the practice for the Police, Ward Beadles, or others, to request the Keeper of the Mortuary to send for such bodies at all hours of the day and night, and that officer had frequently to leave the building to assist in such removal, during which time the Mortuary and surrounding buildings were unprotected. 35 This practice was objectionable, seeing that we have no permanent resident subordinates on the premises, and I recommended that an Order be given directing the Keeper not to leave the building for the purpose above indicated, and that the Police, Ward Authorities, and others concerned, be informed accordingly, with an intimation that a hand hearse is always available, but that the labour of fetching a dead body, and taking it to the Mortuary, must be performed by them, and at their expense. The Committee adopted my advice, and the practice varied accordingly. It was not intended by this Order to interfere with the existing practice of our own Sanitary labourers removing bodies to the Mortuary under the directions of the Inspectors when the interests of the Public Health require it; the charges incident to such removal being borne by the Public Health Department as heretofore.

No less than 54,200 gallons of disinfectants were manufactured under my direction, at Golden Lane, and distributed for various purposes throughout the City. The actual cost of the chemicals employed was £171, as compared with £112 in 1895, £195 in 1896, and £139 in 1897, which is in remarkable contrast with the sums paid to contractors for patented articles prior to the 37 adoption of my invention, viz., £981 in 1891, £1,231 in 1892, and £1,800 in 1893, and £733 in the first six months of 1894 against £85 in the last six months of the same year under the present system. These figures speak for themselves. CORONER'S COURT. 59 Inquests were held on bodies, against 59, 61, and 68 in the years 1895-6-7. Three Fire Inquests were held, compared with 3, 2, and 3 in the three preceding years respectively. SANITARY INSPECTIONS. The Returns refer to 7,444 Inspections, including the original defects discovered by the Inspectors, as well as the re-inspection of the same property during the execution of the works required to remedy the same. Improvements were effected at 1,141 places, in many of which new schemes of internal drainage and rearrangement of sanitary conveniences were carried out from plans prepared by my Inspectors and approved by me. 38 Several large establishments in the City have been so dealt with; and the drawings connected with them carefully preserved at Guildhall. The Notices served to abate nuisances arising from defective drains, noxious trades, neglect of dung-pits, fried-fish shops, dirty bakehouses, indecent overcrowding, underground dwellings, &c., &c., amounted to 1,221 in number.

The Court of Common Council being approached thereon by certain inhabitants of the district, referred it to the Sanitary Committee to enquire into the sanitary condition of Montague Court, Bishopsgate Street Without, it having been alleged that the same was unwholesome and permanently unfit for human habitation. I was instructed to report thereon, and did so as follows:— In October, 1875, Montague Court was included in my General Report to the Commissioners of Sewers with 20 other insanitary areas under the "Artizans" and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act, 1875, but the Commissioners took no action. On the 13th of December, 1878, I further reported to the Finance and Improvements Committee on the same subject, and pointed out that the previous defects had become aggravated by delay. No measures were taken upon this representation. 40 In 1889 another survey was made and duly reported upon by me, with the same result. In June, 1894, I reported again to the Commissioners of Sewers, and gave certificates of condemnation re Nos. 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7, after a personal survey, and the houses were closed accordingly. None of these had any through ventilation, and were in a ruinous state. Agreeably to instructions by the Sanitary Committee in September last (1898), I made repeated surveys of the property, with the following results, viz.:— Nos. 1a, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, Montague Court, and No. 94, Bishopsgate Street Without, were in fair structural condition, excepting the last-named house. Some of the houses in the court had had new fronts built since 1889, prior to which they were dilapidated and shored up with timber. 41 The court consisted of 58 rooms, occupied by 41 families, numbering 122 persons of a rough class, including children, or 2.1 persons per room. The condition of No. 94, Bishopsgate Street, was as bad as it could be, the walls and ceilings of staircase were filthy, and the roof unsound, &c. The general state of the houses in Montague Court has always been under constant observation by the Inspectors, and will ere long require serious consideration, with a view to their demolition or closure. At present, however, I think they may escape such drastic treatment; in the meantime, periodical cleansing and repairs will be insisted upon, and the drainage kept in good order. In 1893 and 1894 the majority of the dwellings in Montague Court were provided with entirely new pipe drains, and the remainder had their drains properly repaired, trapped, and ventilated. Appended hereto are the details of the property and a Plan showing the existing state of things. 42 DETAILS OF MONTAGUE COURT, &c. SANITARY CONDITION. Occupants, 2-10 persons per room.

Totals- 58 41 28 41 53 122 43 In view of the conflict of opinion between the Sanitary Committee and outside persons anxious for the demolition of Montague Court, the Sanitary Committee inspected the place, and additional surveys were made with the following results:— 1. On the 21st November, 1898, twelve houses only were occupied, viz., 1a, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16. 2. A day census gave 80 persons as living in the above houses. 3. A census taken at midnight during two surprise visits on November 10th and 21st showed the number of occupants to be 91 and 103 respectively. It must be borne in mind that the numbers vary from day to day, which may explain any discrepancies between the above figures and those quoted in the Court of Common Council on behalf of the Petitioners. 44 4. The average cubical space per person provided in the above twelve houses is 522.1 feet by actual measurement, whereas the space required by your own bye-laws is only 350 cubic feet per head, and was formerly 300 only, showing an excess of breathing space in Montague Court of 172 cubic feet per person. 5. The average number of occupants per room, estimating two children under 12 years of age as one adult, was 2.03 in the daytime, but probably a little more at night. These figures must also be of varying quantity. 6. Not a single case of infectious disease had been notified from Montague Court since the end of 1896, and up to November, 1898, only two deaths from all causes: one. an infant, from whooping cough, and the other, a woman, 44 years of age, from acute bronchitis. 45 This absence from infectious disease and mortality is confirmed by the evidence of a leading practitioner of medicine, residing in Bishopsgate Street, who expressed his willingness to testify to the generally good state of health of the inhabitants of the court. Only five infectious cases were notified during the past five years 1893-8, and only 13 deaths in the same period, of whom eight were under five years of age, including six under ten months, the remainder 36, 44, 45, 67 and 87 respectively. Another indication of the healthiness of the occupants is found in the fact that the average period of residence of each family was no less than seven years, one tenant having lived there 60 years, one 16, another 19, and two 14, &c. The drainage of the court is good and modern. Inspection chambers with fresh air inlets exist between the drainage of the houses and the public sewer in the court, with upcast ventilating pipes at the backs of the houses, so that the allegation that these dwellings can be permeated 46 with sewer gas was not only misleading, but something worse. The fresh air inlets referred to were fixed under the area gratings in the pavement to protect them from wilful damage. Respecting the public sewer in the centre of the court, I suggested that a ventilating shaft be inserted at its distal end and carried up to the top of the nearest building. The water service may be also improved by the erection of cisterns for storage in addition to the domestic hydrants in the centre of the court; the present supply, derived from the East London Company, is intermittent. The present appearance of the court is prejudiced by the state of the houses condemned in 1894, which are becoming so dilapidated as to be almost unsafe; moreover, this effect is intensified by the ruinous condition of the backs of the premises fronting in Bishopsgate Street, which are as bad as any in Montague Court. Having regard to these facts, the Committee hesitated to confiscate this property as permanently unwholesome and unfit for human. Montague Court, Bishopsgate without. 47 habitation, a conclusion in which, after very careful consideration of the whole of the facts, I entirely concurred. "The Public Health (London) Act, 1891," gives a Local Sanitary Authority power to ''prohibit a dwelling-house from being used for human habitation," Sec. 5 (6), but provision is reserved for the owner to appeal to "a Petty Sessional Court" (Sub-section 8), who may, if not satisfied, cancel the closing order, and it therefore behoves Medical Officers of Health, upon whom the legislature has imposed the responsibility of taking the initiative, to observe the utmost circumspection in advising the Authority they serve. It was this latter consideration that induced me to advise the Committee to hold their hands for a time in the hope that the property might be taken down for commercial purposes. I came to this view with regret in the face of a very strong expression of opinion on the part of several influential inhabitants in Bishopsgate. 48 EAST LONDON WATER COMPANY'S SUPPLY WITHIN THE CITY OF LONDON. The difficulties which arose in consequence of the enforced suspension of the "constant" service of the East London Water Works Company did not depend exclusively upon a diminished supply, but rather from the absence of proper storage of water for domestic and sanitary purposes. The abolition of cisterns in houses of any class would be bad enough, but in those divided into tenements for occupation of the poor, the want of such receptacles involves an amount of suffering wholly inconceivable to persons possessed of such conveniences. To what extent the absence of such receptacles was responsible for the misery inflicted upon the poorer customers of the Company need not be discussed here. The area supplied by the East London Water Company in the City of London is shown by the Plan hereto attached, and the following Table 49 explains to what extent the City of London is interested:— 1. Total population (day and night.) 1,709 2. No. of houses supplied 133 3. „ without cisterns 77 4. „ with cisterns 44 5. „ on constant service 33 6. Tenement houses, or houses occupied by more than one family 43 7. Empty premises 12 The water was turned on three times a day, viz., 6 a.m., 12 noon, and 6 p.m. for two hours each time during the period of scarcity, and when we remember that a very few years ago the New River Company's general supply to the City was only turned on for one hour a day, and often less, it seems an absurdity to apply the term "water famine," more especially as the East London Water Company's representatives showed that the daily supply equalled 24 gallons per head of the population, an amount much in excess of that furnished to some of the most important towns in Great Britain. E 50 In the district shown on the Plan the 77 houses without cisterns, before mentioned, have no means of flushing the drains and w.c.'s when the water is turned off," and some of the closets were in an unspeakable condition of filth. In advocating the use of cisterns it must not be inferred that a direct supply from the main for cooking and drinking purposes can be dispensed with. No cases of infectious disease were reported from the district during the months in which we are interested,* and I learnt from the RegistrarGeneral's Returns that the health of East London compared favourably with the Metropolis generally. I have carefully analysed the water of the East London Company and the New River Company, and the following Table may be of interest:— *This refers to July and August, 1898. 51 WATER ANALYSIS. Table showing the relative composition of the New River Company's and the East London Company's supply within the city boundary. Details (Given in Grains per Gallon). New River, 23rd Sept., 1898.

E 2 52 It would appear that, of the 133 houses in the portion of the City served by the East London Company, 44 are supplied with cisterns, and therefore only 89 houses would be subject to inconvenience from the scarcity of water, and if we deduct the 12 empty premises this number would be reduced to 77. To show the small extent to which the City was inconvenienced by the suspension of the constant service it may be stated that, according to the last Imperial Census Returns, there are 5,819 inhabited houses in the City, of which only 1.94 per cent. are served by the East London Company, the remaining 98.06 per cent. being on the mains of the New River Company. It is satisfactory to note that the Public Health Department, at the request of the Whitechapel Local Authority, gave some assistance in aid of the water supply outside the City from the surplus water pumped from their artesian well in Stoney Lane. I learn from the Surveyor's Office of the Whitechapel Board that, commencing from the 9th September to the 27th November, inclusive, it furnished 187 cart- City of London. Area supplied by East London Water Compy. 53 loads of 480 gallons each, showing an average of 8,160 gallons per day. I am further informed that this supply was used for roadways, flushing gullies, drains, and w.c.'s, and that so bad was the condition of the latter in some of the houses that it took ten pailfuls to clear the stoppage. In the same Report I recommended that the powers conferred by the City of London Sewers Act, 1848-51, be put into force, and that the following Notice be served forthwith:— To the Owner of the House in the City of London. I hereby give you Notice that you are required forthwith to provide the above House with a fit and capacious cistern with a proper ball-cock and covering, and other necessary apparatus attached thereto, and to keep the same in good repair and cleanliness, and to compound or agree with some Water Company for a sufficient supply of wholesome water. And I further give you Notice that if, for the space of 14 days from the service hereof, you fail to comply with this order, I shall take such proceedings as are authorised by the said Acts, or as may be necessary or expedient. Inspector of Nuisances. The Committee ordered accordingly. The Plan attached hereto shows the area affected within the City. 54 UNSOUND FOOD. During the year 250 cartloads of unsound food were removed by the Cleansing Department and destroyed as trade refuse at Letts' Wharf at the written request and expense of the owners. The procedure prescribed by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 47 (8) is as follows: "Where a person has in his possession any article "which is unsound or unwholesome, or unfit for the food "of man, he may, by written notice to the Sanitary "Authority, specifying such article and containing a "sufficient identification of it, request its removal, and "the Sanitary Authority shall cause it to be removed as "if if were trade refuse." And Section 33 of the same Act directs that the owner shall pay a reasonable sum for such removal, and such sum in case of dispute shall be settled by the order of a Petty Sessional Court. 55 ICE CREAMS. Samples of ice creams were taken from shops and itinerant dealers, and found free from injurious ingredients, but had been prepared in dirty utensils. Upon investigation it was ascertained that most of the goods had been manufactured outside the City. It has been found impossible for the Inspectors to obtain direct evidence as to the methods of manufacture, most of the vendors being foreigners and unacquainted with the English language. A complete examination of the subject involves:—(1) a chemical analysis to determine the presence of poisonous metals or injurious colouring matters, and (2) a bacteriological examination. Respecting the former, one would hardly expect to find metallic poison to any injurious amount, and with regard to a bacterioscopic search an initial difficulty arises from the fact that the milk used in the preparation of the ice cream would probably, after standing a few hours, and before being frozen, contain millions 56 of micro-organisms, although not necessarily of pathogenic significance. Mr. Engineer reports that during 1898 10 additional shafts were fixed in front of adjacent buildings to enable the sewer ventilating gratings in roadways to be closed, thereby affording considerable relief from nuisance to residents in the vicinity. We learn from the same source that 176 premises were newly drained; but to these must be added a large number of drainage and other sanitary improvements dealt with by my own department, which relate only to the interior of buildings. Underground conveniences are now to be found in 20 places in the City, containing 219 compartments as urinals, and 143 water-closets; to which four more are now in course of construction and four others contemplated. The accommodation for women includes 28 water-closets, with lavatory appliances; and the system will be extended as opportunities afford. 57 HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The Superintendent of Cleansing reports that the refuse removed from the City in 1898 consisted of 29,745 cart-loads of street sweepings and slop, and 43,960 loads of house and trade refuse; total, 73,705. Of this bulk, 23,836 loads were consumed by the Destructor at Letts' Wharf. Return for Last Five Years. Year. Street Sweepings and Slop. House and Trade Refuse. Total.

This skip system for house refuse removal, which commenced in 1892, has been extended as circumstances demanded, and much benefit has 58 accrued to the persons for whose relief the method was adopted. The public dust-bins, which were a nuisance and a constant source of trouble, have been abolished. Up to the end of the year 753 of these skips had been supplied in the poorer neighbourhoods without charge, and 367 were paid for by ratepayers: total 1,120. SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS, &c. The flushing of the crowded and poorest parts of the City during the hot months was carried out as usual, followed by the use of deodorants in the channels running through the courts and alleys, &c. In this service, but including the streets, 26,664,882 gallons of water were used, and many thousand gallons of disinfectants were employed. Forty-eight places were so treated in the East District; fifty-nine, in the Middle District; and sixty-two in the West District. Total 169. The entrances to forty-five courts were cleansed and lime-washed, viz.: twelve in the East District; sixteen in the Middle District; and seventeen in the West District. A list of places dealt with are subjoined. 59 SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS AND ALLEYS.

In 1878, the Government of the day consolidated the whole of the Factory Acts, since which date the Legislature has added thereto, from time to time, several new Acts dealing more or less with this subject. This action resulted in an amazing complication which taxed the abilities of all but those learned in the law to understand, and it was not until the passing of the Act 58 and 59 Vict., cap. 57, operative on the 1st January, 1896, that matters were simplified. This new Factory and Workshop Act was intended to amend and extend the law relating to such places, being another attempt to consolidate without repealing all previous Acts, and in its own words is to be " construed as one " with the Factory and Workshop Acts from the " year 1878 to the year 1891, and those Acts and " this Act may be cited collectively as ' The " ' Factory and Workshop Acts, 1878 to 1895.' " The result has been to add to the obligations imposed upon Sanitary Authorities by the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. F 66 As an illustration of progressive legislation, I may remind you that by Sec. 2 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1891, Sanitary Authorities were allowed a "reasonable time" to cause the amendment of sanitary defects brought to their notice by an Inspector of Factories, but by the Act of 1895 they were deprived of any discretionary power, and a period was fixed by statute to "within one month." The following are the transformations undergone by this section during the past twenty years. In the Factory and Workshop Act, 1878 (the original consolidating "Principal Act," referred to in the opening paragraph of this section), it read as follows:— "Sec. 4. Where it appears to an Inspector under "this Act that any act, neglect, or default in relation "to any drain, water-closet, earth-closet, privy, ashpit, "water supply, nuisance, or other matter in a factory or "workshop is punishable or remediable under the law "relating to public health, but not under this Act, that "Inspector shall give notice in writing of such act, "neglect, or default to the Sanitary Authority in whose "district the factory or workshop is situate, and it shall 67 "be the duty of the Sanitary Authority to make such "inquiry into the subject of the notice, and take "such action thereon as to that authority may seem "proper for the purpose of enforcing the law. "An Inspector under this Act may, for the purposes "of this section, take with him into a factory or "workshop a Medical Officer of Health, Inspector of "Nuisances, or other officer of the Sanitary Authority." In the Factory and Workshop Act of 1891 it was extended to certain workshops and laundries, and made more stringent, it being altered as under:— "Section 4 of the principal Act shall apply to "workshops conducted on the system of not employing "any child, young person, or women therein, and to "laundries. "Where notice of an act, neglect, or default is "given by an Inspector under the said Section 4, as "amended by this Act, to a Sanitary Authority, and "proceedings are not taken within a reasonable time for "punishing or remedying the act, neglect, or default, "the Inspector may take the like proceedings for "punishing or remedying the same as the Sanitary "Authority might have taken, and shall be entitled to "recover from the Sanitary Authority all such expenses "in and about the proceedings as the Inspector incurs, "and are not recovered from any other person, and havt "not been incurred in any unsuccessful proceedings." F 2 68 Again, by the Act of 1895 the action of Sanitary Authorities was further placed under control, and the section must now be interpreted as follows:— "Where notice of an act, neglect, or default is given "by an Inspector under Section 4 of the principal Act "to a Sanitary Authority, it shall be the duty of the "Sanitary Authority to inform the Inspector of the "proceedings taken in consequence of the notice. "In Section 2 of the Act of 1891, for the words " 'within a reasonable time' shall be substituted the "words 'within one month.' " The following is an admirable précis of the work imposed upon my department by the Acts in question, and I have ventured to borrow the same from the Annual Report of the Medical Officer of Health for Lambeth for 1897:— "(a) To see that every workshop is kept in a "cleanly state and ventilated so as to render "harmless any gases, vapour, dust or other "impurities generated in the course of the "work carried on therein, and that may be "a nuisance, or injurious or dangerous to "health; 69 "(b) That no overcrowding, dangerous or "injurious to the health of the persons "employed therein is allowed, and that a "notice specifying the number of persons "who may be employed in each work room "at any one time is fixed in a suitable "position, and so as to be easily read; "(c) That all workshops are kept free from "effluvia arising from drains, closets, "urinals, or other nuisances ; "(d) That all workshops are regularly lime"washed, cleansed, and purified; "(e) That due written notice is forthwith given "to the Factory Inspector of any child, "young person, or woman employed in a "workshop; "(f) That no wearing apparel is to be made, "cleaned, or repaired in any dwelling-house "or building occupied in connection with "any workshop, or any place from which "any such work is given out, whilst any "inmate of the dwelling-house is (within 70 "the knowledge of the occupier of the "workshop or place or his contractor) "suffering from Scarlet Fever or Small"pox; "(g) That all work rooms are properly and "adequately warmed, and maintained at a "reasonable temperature; "(h) That every workshop is provided with "sufficient and suitable accommodation in "the way of sanitary conveniences, having "regard to the number of persons employed "in or in attendance at the workshop, and "also with proper separate accommodation "for persons of each sex, where persons of "both sexes are employed or intended to "be employed, or in attendance; "(i) That lists of names and addresses of out"workers in connection with places in which "the manufacture of wearing apparel, the "manufacture of electro-plate or files, or "abinet and furniture making and "upholstery work are carried on, are to be "kept by the occupiers or contractors, 71 "inspected by the officers of a Sanitary "Authority, and the places where such "out-workers reside inspected and kept in "a proper sanitary condition." It is not easy to satisfactorily enforce the provisions relating to "sanitary conveniences" referred to at (h) in the foregoing without, in many instances, inflicting hardship upon owners or tenants, and much tact and forbearance has to be exercised in dealing with this subject. The following are some of the difficulties referred to:— In buildings occupied as workshops, that were constructed before the passing of the section requiring "sufficient and separate accommodation," it is found extremely difficult to make this provision, and is generally impossible without reducing the staff. It has been a common thing for the women to be discharged where we have served Notices, and sent adrift to find a living elsewhere. 72 The section is difficult to apply in the case of a building that is occupied by more than one employer of labour and the tenants change from time to time. For instance, a landlord might provide one w.c. for a limited number of males and, say, two for women. A change of tenancy occurs, and he may be called upon to make a complete reversal of the arrangements. This is more frequently the case where one building is in several occupations. It would be straining the intention of the framers of the Act to rigidly enforce it in the case of a workshop used by women only, with the exception of one male, especially where a public convenience is in the vicinity. The same applies, but to a lesser extent, to workshops where a female clerk or typewriter is "in attendance at" a counting-house attached to a business where male workpeople are employed. Cases have occurred where the owner has fulfilled the requirements of the law, but some 73 of the lower type of workpeople of both sexes have persistently declined to avail themselves of the separate accommodation arranged for the sexes. Again, we find in instances where employers of labour occupying a portion of a building are desirous of meeting our requirements, but, unfortunately, have no power to compel their landlord or other tenants in the same building to grant the easements on their part of the premises for the necessary pipes and connections. Where only a short term of a lease is unexpired, the tenant naturally resents improving the property by building a suite of sanitary conveniences, and urgent applications for postponing the work and expense entailed are frequently made; in all cases these appeals have been carefully considered, and I have not infrequently advised the Sanitary Committee to temporise for a reasonable time. 74 The following are the particulars of sanitary defects found in factories and workshops, and reported during the year by H. M. Inspectors; also the steps taken by my department to effect improvement. Sixty-five cases were brought to my notice in the course of the year, compared with thirty-four in 1897. The places referred to were distributed as under:— East District - - 13 Middle „ - - 50 West „ - - 2 65 EAST DISTRICT. Situation of Premises.

WEST DISTRICT. 16, Long Lane w.c. cleansed. 11, 12, Rose Street, Newgate Street Additional w.c. accommodation provided. 78 It is evident from the foregoing that the work of my department involved in the inspection and supervision of the sanitary improvement of factories and workshops is yearly increasing. Indeed, at times, the proper performance of these responsibilities has been a serious tax upon the resources of my staff, but I have always gladly afforded every aid at my command in assisting the officials of the Home Office in carrying out what I believe to be one of the most necessary and salutary pieces of legislation ever entered on the statute book. The interest taken in the present day in the health of the working classes, and of workwomen in particular, is ever increasing, and the powers of local authorities are nowhere more usefully employed than in their endeavours to improve the sanitary surroundings of an important section of the industrial community that so largely contributes to the wealth of the nation, but who in the past were, unfortunately, often powerless to invoke our aid without running the risk of being thrown out of their employment. 79 The present-day fathers of the Corporation of London can recall the time when you were entreated by your responsible advisers—who merely expressed the accepted opinions of the day—to view this question from a very different standpoint, and those who endeavoured to improve the sanitary surroundings of the workpeople were held up by them to obloquy as "attempting "to harass English trade by mischievous senti"mentalism, fettered by the fantastic rules of a " visionary system of hygiene." The tendency of modern requirements has been to modify these views in the interests of the employer and employed, and both are beginning to appreciate the fact that in proportion to provisions made and enforced for better ventilation, more appliances for cleanliness, and improved methods for lighting by the substitution of electricity for gas will be the capacity for work, and the greater enjoyment of life when so employed. 80 TENEMENT HOUSES. The Register of houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family referred to in my last Annual Report, has now been completed throughout the City. The following is a summary:— District. No. of Houses on Register. No. of Lodgers. No. of Tenements. Average No. of Persons per Tenement. West 212 1,917 802 2.39 Middle 86 660 235 2.81 East 189 1,498 621 2.40 Total 487 4,070 1,658 2.45 A list of these places was compiled from information obtained by your Inspectors in response to the 648 Notices sent by them to the various owners during the previous year. Your own five blocks of Artizans' Dwellings in Stoney Lane are not included in the above figures, 81 nor do they find a place in the following list of registered tenement houses, as they are dealt with more fully in another part of this Report. The registered houses are regularly inspected, and in the month of April of each year their owners called upon to undertake a systematic cleansing of their several properties, in accordance with the provisions of your Bye-laws for the regulation of this class of dwelling. The proper fulfilment of the requirements of your regulations necessitated the service during the past year of no less than 568 Notices, 237, 234, and 97, being served in the West Middle, and East Districts respectively. A complete list of these houses is appended showing— (a) The situation of the premises. (b) Name and address of the person responsible for the wholesomeness of the premises. (c) Number of tenements.

The Corporation of London is the Local Authority in the City for the purpose of regulating the sanitary condition of Dairies and Milk Shops, under the Dairies, Cow Sheds, and Milk Shops Order of 1885, and the work of inspection is at present carried out by Officers appointed by the County Purposes Committee. I again call attention to my recommendation of former years that this duty should belong to the Public Health Department—the Sanitary Authority for the City—as at the present time there is a divided responsibility which is undesirable, especially as a legally qualified Sanitary Inspector is more competent to deal satisfactorily with the condition of these places than an Officer whose duties are more properly confined to the supervision of Weights and Measures, and possesses no certificate of his fitness to undertake work requiring a special training. During the year, 366 Dairies and Milk Shops were visited, being 16 more than in 1897. Of 111 these, 318 were registered at Guildhall, 34 were unregistered, and 14 either closed or demolished. These places are also visited periodically by the Sanitary Inspectors, with a view of discovering and remedying any defects found in the general arrangements of the premises. The following abstract from the Regulations made by the Corporation under the Dairies, Cow Sheds, and Milk Shops Order of 1885 may be useful :— Registration. 1.—Every Purveyor of milk, Dairyman or Cowkeeper, carrying on his trade in the City of London and the Liberties thereof, must be registered as such by the Corporation of London. Application for registration must be upon the form provided for the purpose, to be obtained at the Town Clerk's Office, Guildhall. Contamination of Milk. 2.—It shall not be lawful for any person following tha trade of Cowkeeper, or Dairyman, or Purveyor of milk, or being the occupier of a Milk-store or Milk-shop—(a) to allow any person suffering from a dangerous infectious disorder, or having recently been in contact with a person so suffering, to milk cows, or to handle vessels used for containing milk for sale, or in any way to take part or assist 112 in the conduct of the trade or business of the Cowkeeper, or Dairyman, Purveyor of milk, or occupier of a Milk-store, or Milk-shop, so far as regards the production, distribution or storage of Milk; or—(6) if himself so suffering or having recently been in contact as aforesaid, to milk cows, or handle vessels used for containing milk for sale, or in any way to take part in the conduct of his trade or business, so far as regards the production, distribution, or storage of milk—until in each case all danger therefrom of the communication of infection to the milk or of its contamination has ceased. 3.—It shall not be lawful for any person following the trade of Cowkeeper, or Dairyman, or Purveyor of milk, or being the occupier of a Milk-store or Milk-shop, after the receipt of notice of not less than one month from the Local Authority, calling attention to the provisions of this Article, to permit any water-closet, earth-closet, privy, cesspool, or urinal to be within, communicate directly with, or ventilate into, any Dairy, or any room used as a Milk-store or Milk-shop. 4.—It shall not be lawful for any person following the trade of Cowkeeper or Dairyman, or Purveyor of milk, or being the occupier of a Milk-store or Milk-shop, to use a Milk-store or Milk-shop in his occupation, or permit the same to be used as a sleeping apartment, or for any purpose incompatible with the proper preservation of the cleanliness of the Milk-store or Milk-shop, and of the milk-vessels and milk therein, or in any manner likely to cause contamination of the milk therein. 5.—It shall not be lawful for aDy person following the trade of Cowkeeper or Dairyman or Purveyor of milk, to keep any swine in any Cowshed or other building used by him for keeping cows, or in any Milk-store or other place used by him for keeping milk for sale. 113 Milk of Diseased Cows. 6.—If at any time disease exists among cattle, the milk of a diseased cow— (a) shall not be mixed with other milk ; and (b) shall not be sold or used for human food ; and (c) shall not be sold or used for food of swine, or other animals, unless and until it has been boiled. Regulations for securing the cleanliness of Milk-stores, Milk-shops, and Milk-vessels used for containing Milk for sale by persons following the trade of Cowkeepers or Dairymen. 25.—Every Milk-store and Milk-shop, as well as all fixtures and tables therein, used in connection with the keeping or sale of milk, shall at all times be kept in a cleanly condition. 26.—All utensils and vessels used for the reception, storage, or delivery of milk, shall be thoroughly cleansed with steam or scalding water as frequently as may be necessary for keeping such utensils and vessels perfectly clean and sweet, and only clean water shall be used for the purpose. 27.—Every person following the trade of Cowkeeper or Dairyman shall at all times employ such means and adopt such precautions as may be necessary for keeping the utensils and vessels used by him for containing milk in a clean and wholesome condition, so as to preserve the purity of such milk. I 114 Regulations prescribing precautions to be taken by Purveyors of milk, and persons selling milk by retail, against infection or contamination. 28.—Every Purveyor of milk, or person selling milk by retail, shall, immediately on any outbreak of infectious or contagious disease within the building or upon the premises in which he keeps milk, or amongst the persons employed in his business, give notice of such outbreak to the Town Clerk of the City of London, at his Office in Guildhall. 29.—Every Purveyor of milk, or person selling milk by retail, shall, immediately on such outbreak coming to his knowledge, remove all milk for sale, and all utensils for containing milk for sale from such building; and shall cease to keep milk for sale or to sell milk in such building until the same has been disinfected and declared by the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London to be free from infection. 30.—Every Purveyor of milk, or person selling milk by retail, shall not keep milk for sale in any place where it would be liable to become infected or contaminated by gases or effluvia arising from any sewers, drains, gullies, cesspools, or closets, or by any offensive effluvia from putrid or offensive substances, or by impure air, or by any offensive or deleterious gases or substances. 81.—Every Purveyor of milk, or person selling milk by retail, shall only keep milk for sale in clean receptacles ; and all utensils used in connection with the keeping or sale of such milk shall be at all times kept clean. 32.—Every Purveyor of milk, or person selling milk by retail, shall at all times employ such means, and adopt 115 such precautions, as may be necessary for preserving the purity of milk, and for protecting it against infection or contamination. MONCKTON. Guildhall, E.C., 17th July, 1885. NOTE.—Sections 60 and 61 of the 41st and 42nd Victoria, Ch. 74, provide that any person who does anything in contravention of an Order in Council or of a Regulation of a Local Authority is guilty of an offence against the Act, and is liable to a Penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds. BAKEHOUSES. The Public Health Department is the Local Authority in respect to bakehouses which are workshops under Sections 34, 35 and 81 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878. The law requires:— 1. The walls and ceilings of the bakehouse must be painted in oil or varnished every seven years, and washed with hot water and soap every six months, or be lime-washed every six months. 2. No sleeping place to be allowed on a level with a bakehouse. I 2 116 3. No water-closet may be within or municate directly with a bakehouse. 4. No drain shall have any opening within a bakehouse. 5. After the 1st January, 1896, no bakehouse shall be established anew below the level of the ground. There are 40 bakehouses in the City of London, viz. :—16 in the East Sanitary District, 11 in the Middle, and 13 in the West District, located as shown in the following Table:— WEST DISTRICT.

Fifty-nine cases liable to be dealt with under the section of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, have been reported, 4 in the East, 14 in the Middle, and 41 in the West District, respectively. All were formerly declared by the Sanitary Committee "uisances" within the meaning of the Act in consequence of the emission of "black smoke," and Notices were served in due course in each instance. No less than 272 separate inspections were made, viz., 151 in the East, 23 in the Middle, and 98 in the West Districts. 119 Police Court proceedings were instituted on four occasions, but "abatement" orders with costs only were made, and in no instance was any fine imposed. The issuing of black smoke in the City of London may therefore be regarded as a minor offence, so far as the terrors of the law are concerned. 120 SMOKE PROSECUTIONS, 1898. Date. Where beard.

MEAT INSPECTION. A staff of six specially qualified officers attached to my staff are solely engaged in the supervision of the meat supplies in the City. 125 During the past year these Inspectors seized 884 tons I cwt. of meat as unfit for the food of man. This condemned meat is classified as under:— Tons Per cent. Putrid meat 713 80.7 Diseased meat 133 15.0 Unsound from accident or causes other than above 38 4.3 884 100.0 In October last the putrid meat included a large consignment of pigs' hearts, packed in barrels in a strong solution of boracic acid, a fact shown by analysis. They were all condemned and destroyed by my order. 126 DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNENT MEAT. The 884 tons 1 cwt. of meat considered unfit for human food has been disposed of. The amount received under a contract was £2,059 2s. 5d. in 1898 as against £2,392 3s. 6d. in 1897, £2,352 4s. 4d. in 1896, and £1,572 7s. 6d. in 1895, against which must be placed the expenses incurred by the Corporation in the execution of their responsibility, to wit: Salaries of Inspectors; chemicals for disinfecting baths; cost of horses, vans and haulage; rentals of condemned meat sheds; repairs; a heavy daily outlay for porterage to convey the condemned stock from the shops of the salesmen to the sheds for disinfection before removal to the factory of the contractor at West Ham, and incidentals, &c. The Inspectors, in conjunction with myself, are responsible for the wholesomeness of the supplies delivered at the Smithfield Markets, and some idea of the magnitude of the task may 127 be obtained from an examination of the following figures compiled from the Annual Report of the the Market Superintendent:— 1897. 1898. Number of loads weighed during the year upon the Market Weighbridges for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of Toll due thereon - Tons. 197,634 Tons. 206,127 Average daily delivery into the Markets - 1,289½ 1,299 Minimum on any one day 325½ 195 Maximum delivery 3,389 2,890 The heaviest weight brought in on any one day was on the 21st December, 1896 4,159 tons. On an average, 1 ton in every 452 tone that came into the Markets last year was seized as unfit for human food.

For the same periods in 1897 the figures were 107 tons 1 cwt. 3 qrs. 18 lbs. and 115 tons 2 cwts. 3 qrs. 27 lbs. respectively. This decrease is accounted for by the fact : (1) In July, 1897. we had two very large consignments of frozen beef which reached this country in a putrid condition. (2) In August, 1897, the same thing occurred, when nearly the whole of a consignment of refrigerated beef was seized. (3) During the early months of this E 130 summer there was an abundance of feed in the pastures, and thus the meat growers avoided sending half fatted carcases to market, which frequently hang in the shops of the salesmen until they become unsound. (4) The market deliveries are now better timed to suit the requirements of the trade. The intensely hot weather, which reached its climax on the 12th and following days of August, had a most detrimental effect, consequently much meat became unsound before it could be sold. In the six days, 12th to 18th of August, inclusive, the inspectors seized 57 tons 5 cwts. 1 qr. 1 lb., involving 1,224 seizures, the largest number on record up to that date, but which has been since exceeded. The seizures during August, 1897, were 2,433, an average of 608 per week, whilst for the same period this year they were 2,672 and 668 respectively. I mention this to show the constant increase in the work of the Inspectors. Bearing in mind that the Central Markets provide animal food for millions of people, there 131 is nothing extraordinary in 57 tons of meat out of 5,914 tons, or 1 in 104, being overtaken by the "heat-wave" on its transit to market, whereas the proportion of seizures to deliveries throughout the year 1897 show only 1 in 429. The magnitude of these operations, and the enormous loss sustained by growers and consigners of meat, will be better estimated if we calculate the commercial value of 174 tons, seized as unsound, at 6d. per lb., which amounts to £9,744. It is but bare justice to add that the enormous mass of putrid meat passing through the hands of the Inspectors has been accomplished without a single complaint on the part of the salesmen, and the staff, although overworked and underofficered, have performed their duties with zeal and intelligence. I may add that the seizures for eight weeks up to and including 23rd September, 1897, were 4,797, a weekly average of 599, whilst the seizures for eight weeks up to and including 22nd September of this year (1898) were 6,655, or 832 per week.

In June I inspected twenty carcases of Australian sheep taken indiscriminately from 884 carcases seized by the Inspectors out of 1,500 which had been deposited on the market for sale. Further daily arrivals occurred up to the 11th June, until 3,040 sheep were delivered, which represented the total consignment from Queensland, as shown by a sworn statement accompanying the sheep dated from Townville, 17th December, 1897, signed by the manager of a Queensland Meat Export Company. The sheep were shipped to this country on board the vessel "Buteshire." The seizures by the Inspectors commenced on 26th May and ended on the 11th June, and out of the whole consignment (3,040) no less than 1,657, or 54 per cent., were so dealt with. 133 The notes of my personal inspection, taken on the 3rd June, describe the carcases as of small emaciated sheep averaging 35 lbs., an estimate subsequently verified on the scales. The flesh was of a pale brown colour, and there was no bloom on the bark (outside): there was great deficiency of fat, and the small quantity present had a peculiar white or pallid appearance, indicating a low condition of nourishment, and resembling the fat not infrequently seen in animals that had suffered from fluke disease. The flesh generally was anaemic and dropsical, which latter was very apparent when the carcases were thawed. In the state of health indicated by these appearances, animals would be prone to diseases of various kinds, especially those induced by parasites, and although not easily recognisable when the carcases were trimmed and dressed for sale at market, nevertheless would be quite unfit for human food under the circumstances above described. 134 The Queensland Government are evidently quite alive to the importance of dealing with meat not necessarily diseased, but of low quality. In the Live Stock and Meat Export Act of 1895, 59 Vic., No. 26, being an Act to provide for the inspection of "Live Stock and Meat intended for Export," the 3rd Clause defines "disease," as, inter alia, any defect or inferiority in the condition of any meat which, in the opinion of the Inspector examining the same, renders it unfit for the food of man. My instructions to the Inspectors are, that the utmost caution must be exercised in dealing with this sort of meat, as it is chiefly bought by coster butchers and sold to the poorest classes of the community in the public streets, mostly at night time, when the inferior quality of the meat is not easily recognised. The Agent-General for Queensland, believing these sheep ought not to have been shipped, sent several persons to examine them, including one veterinary who holds an official position of 135 great responsibility. These all concurred in that opinion, as also did a number of persons engaged in the meat trade who had examined the sheep. I have been informed that the owner gave no directions to his Agents for this lot of sheep to be shipped from Queensland, intending them only to be slaughtered and boiled down in that place. If this be true the shipment must have been made in error. To verify this statement it would occupy considerable time. I have since ascertained that some of the Australian Governments have determined that, in future, no frozen meat shall leave the Colonies without proper inspection at the port of shipment, and that meat passing this supervision shall be marked. 136 DISEASED MEAT PROSECUTIONS.

No diminution has taken place in the number of slaughterhouses in Aldgate. The several premises are under constant observation by the Inspectors of Slaughterhouses and Meat, and the following may be taken as their condition at the present time. Scales and Leuw, 44, Aldgate High Street. The front part of the premises is devoted to the sale of meat, which is exposed on the front under a roof. At the back is a spacious slaughterhouse, approached from the street by a private alley, which serves also for the adjacent premises, No. 45. There is a Pound of considerable size, divided for bullocks and sheep, behind the slaughterhouse. The premises are lofty and well-ventilated, in good repair, and cleanly and well-kept. A considerable amount of slaughtering is still done here. 138 Alfred Louisson, 45, Aldgate High Street. These are much smaller premises than No. 44, and the arrangements for the show and sale of meat similar. The slaughterhouse is small, and in fair constructive repair. At the back is a small Pound opening upon the alley previously mentioned; and also an ice safe for storage. Very little slaughtering is done. Henry Nathan, 46, Aldgate High Street. The shop in which meat is exposed for sale is large. The slaughterhouse behind is small, but in fair repair and well-ventilated, although not of modern construction. Animals for slaughter are driven in from the street through the shop. In the rear is a Pound, part of which has been converted into an ice safe for storage. The slaughtering is limited, and almost entirely confined to calves, lambs, and a few sheep. 139 Thomas Marshall Brown, 48 and 49, Aldgate High Street. Front shop small, but slaughterhouse large and adapted for an extensive trade. At the back, with a gateway leading to the slaughterhouse, is ample lairage space, access to which is obtained from Harrow Alley. The shop and slaughterhouse are in fair condition, cleanly, and well-kept. Matthew Flicker, 50 and 51, Aldgate High Street. The shop and offices in front are similar to those at Nos. 48 and 49. The slaughterhouse differs from them in being detached from the main building. It. is in good general repair, properly ventilated, and well-kept. The Pounds are outside the slaughterhouse, and are approached from Harrow Alley. 140 James Tyler, 52, Aldgate High Street. A shop and counting-house occupy the front of the building; the back part is a large slaughterhouse in good repair. Not much slaughtering is done, foreign meat being principally sold. A large ice safe occupies one corner. The Pounds are outside, with means of access from Harrow Alley. Mrs. King, 53 and 54, Aldgate High Street. The front of these premises is used for the sale of meat. At the back of the shop is a door leading by a passage to the slaughterhouse ; on the right of this passage is an elevated watertank, underneath which the sawdust and sweepings from the shop can generally be found. To the left of the passage a small railed-in space is used as a Pound. Beyond these is the slaughterhouse, which is low, imperfectly ventilated, in indifferent repair, and ill-kept. A large ice safe occupies one corner. Animals are driven in from the street through the shop, which is the only means of access — a most objectionable arrangement. 141 Nice and Hawkins, 55, Aldgate High Street. These are extensive premises of modern construction, and in excellent repair. The sale of meat is conducted in the front portion; the back part forming the slaughterhouse is divided from the adjoining one by a wall of white glazed bricks. The Pounds are on the outside, and approached from Harrow Alley. A good trade in homegrown meat is done here. James Gibbs Killby, 56, Aldgate High Street. These are companion premises to No. 55, and the same remarks apply to them throughout, except that the trade at No. 55 is chiefly beef, while No. 56 is largely devoted to the slaughter and sale of calves, lambs and sheep. I have always found the premises clean and well ordered. 142 William Haarer, 57, Aldgate High Street. The meat sold in the front shop is chiefly slaughtered at Deptford, the slaughterhouse being chiefly used for hanging beef in long sides. The premises are in fair repair, though not of the most modern construction. In the rear is a small Pound, approached from Harrow Alley by a private passage. Horwitz and Abrahams, 58, Aldgate High Street. These are small premises in which little or no slaughtering is done, the proprietors being chiefly interested in the foreign cattle trade. A large quantity of meat is sold to Jew butchers. The slaughterhouse is chiefly used for hanging meat in bulk. A small Pound at the back of the slaughterhouse opens upon a private passage leading from Harrow Alley. The roof of these premises was found in a dilapidated and dangerous condition, and repaired under the direction of the District Surveyor, and by your order slaughtering was prohibited until the structural repairs were executed. 143 L. E. White, 59, Aldgate High Street. This is a small shop and slaughterhouse in which a little killing is done during the summer season. There is a small Pound at the back with access to the passage in Harrow Alley. The premises are in fair repair. Horwitz and Abrahams, 60, Aldgate High Street. In front is a very small shop, behind which is a slaughterhouse with a door at the bottom opening upon Harrow Alley to admit animals for slaughter. A little slaughtering is done here, but the premises are in bad repair. M. Bosman, Junr., 62, Aldgate High Street. In front is a shop of fair size, and at the back a small slaughterhouse. It is in fair constructive repair, but a most objectionable feature is a door 144 from Harrow Alley through which animals are driven to slaughter. In lieu of the upper and lower panels of this, iron bars have been placed for the purpose of ventilation, and at some time it has been fitted with shutters to cover up the opening thus made. These appear to have been worn out or lost. FISH. 182,567 tons of fish [of which 135,693 were land-borne and 46,874 water-borne] were received at or near Billingsgate Market during the year, as against 175,251 tons in 1897, 138,162 tons in 1896,127,291 tons in 1895, and 128,361 in 1894. Of the 182,567 tons delivered at Billingsgate, 1,068 tons, or .59 per cent. were condemned and destroyed by the "Fish Meters" at the expense of the Fishmongers' Company. The following figures are interesting:— 145 Weight of Fish Delivered, Fish seized as Unsound, and percentage of Fish Condemned to that Delivered, at or near Billingsgate Market ddring the five years 1894-5-6-7-8.

The following is a copy of the Charter referred to:— * CHARTER. 12 Pt. of James the Ift. M. 17. "James, by the Grace of God, King of "England, Scotland, France and Ireland, "Defender of the Faith &c.

The report is to be made " to the Sanitary Authority, and. the Medical " Officer of Health himself should send a copy " of it to the Local Government Board and to " the London County Council. The Board's " copy of the report should be forwarded to them " when the original is sent to the Sanitary " Authority, except where the report is likely " to be printed by order of the Authority, when " the Board need only be supplied with a " printed copy. It is very desirable that the " Annual Report should be printed, in order " that a supply of copies may be available for "distribution among the members of the " Sanitary Authority and other persons in" terested. 152 "The sanitary history of the year under "review should include a record alike of the "proceedings of the Medical Officer of Health "himself and of the proceedings taken under "his direction or advice. "What has been said above with regard "to the information which an annual report "should contain must be understood, not as "suggesting that the report should be limited "to these subjects, or that more detailed or "differently arranged tabular statements may "not be added, but as indicating the sort of "information required by the Board's Order. "Many Medical Officers of Health will doubt"less, with great advantage to the administra"tion of their districts, furnish much more "detailed information respecting particular "questions to which they have been led by the "circumstances of the foregoing years to devote "attention, or in the investigation of which "they may have arrived at valuable con"elusions. Any information of this kind will "be appreciated by the Local Government "Board." 153 I append hereto copy of my Annual Report as Public Analyst.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE -YEAR 1906. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., March, 1907. Gentlemen, In conformity with the requirements of the Local Government Board, I have the honour to present my seventh Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. The year under review has been an exceptionally busy one, and although not marked by any special activity in dealing with one subject, there has been a difficulty at times in preventing the work getting into arrear. The recent appointment of three Assistant Inspectors of Meat, and an additional Clerk, will, however, improve the general administration of the Department. In November last your officers had to deal with a quantity of unsound tinned food which had been returned to this country from South Africa. The goods in question were stated to be returned Army Stores. Not only were the contents found in a state of decomposition, but a chemical analysis showed that they contained metallic impurity. The facts were brought to the notice of the Local Government Board and the Army Council, and it is to be hoped that steps will be taken by the responsible authorities in order to prevent in future such unwholesome food being placed on the market. Much consideration has been given throughout the year to the subject of meat inspection generally, and the importation of Foreign and Colonial meat in particular. The question of Tuberculosis in meat and milk in its relation to the human subject has been also widely discussed, and the publication of the second interim Report of the Royal Commission—at present dealing with the matter in all its bearings—will doubtless do much to promote uniformity of procedure on the part of Local Sanitary Authorities throughout the country, and definitely nullify the mischievous theory that has led many, especially dealers in meat, to believe that animal tuberculosis has little or no relation to tuberculosis in the human subject. The difficulty of carrying out the statutory duties imposed upon Sanitary Authorities by the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, is yearly increasing, and in November, 1906, a reminder in the form of a memorandum was issued by the Local Government Board that clearly indicated the Board intended to insist upon Local Authorities fully complying with their statutory obligations. The figures given on pp. 67 and 83 will show the rapid increase of the work thrown upon your officers since the passing of the Act referred to. 10 It is satisfactory to note that the results attending the appointment of Women Sanitary Inspectors have proved an unqualified success. A complete summary of their work during 1906 is contained between pages 85 and 99. The requirements of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts continue to be actively administered, and those interested in securing a pure food supply for the public will see what has been done in that direction in the City during 1906 on page 133 et seq. Milk, as heretofore, continues to be the chief article selected for sophistication by the dishonest trader, and this state of things will continue until the penalties imposed upon detection of the fraud are sufficiently heavy to act as a deterrent. The unsatisfactory state of the law with regard to warranties is another point that acts to the prejudice of the purchaser. This is a matter that was brought to the notice of the Corporation last year by the Sanitary Committee on the recommendation of your Medical Officer, and in August last a communication was addressed to the Local Government Board stating that in view of the general consensus of opinion, especially of those who were engaged in the practical administration of the Acts, that the existing warranty sections operated to the prejudice of the purchaser, and of the public health, the Corporation hoped that the Board would endeavour to promote legislation strengthening the position of Local Authorities with regard to proceedings under these sections. In March, 1906, the City of London Distress Committee, who have the administration of the Unemployed (Workmen) Act, 1905, in the City, pointed out that all cases accepted by them for employment at working colonies must be medically examined prior to their being allowed to proceed, and that such inspection must be conducted by the Medical Officer for the Borough, by a Medical Officer employed by a Board of Guardians, or by a medical man appointed by the Distress Committee. The matter came under the consideration of the Sanitary Committee, when your Medical Officer agreed to carry out such examination free of expense, such offer being subsequently accepted by the Court of Common Council. AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 672.7 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.051 square miles, equal to a square of 1.0252 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 10.81 miles to a side. DENSITY (1906). City of London, Registration District, at night 31.7 persons to an acre. „ „ „ „ during the day - *55.7 „ „ Registration London, at night 63.1 „ „ „ „ during the day not known. No Imperial Day Census has yet been taken. * This figure refers only to persons "actively engaged in the City during the daytime." The actual number of people visiting the City daily is probably nearly 1,500,000. 11 ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London was £43,486,436 on 6th April, 1906—whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London, including Temples, was £5,360,197, or nearly one-eighth of the whole County. POPULATION. The undermentioned figures are abstracted from the Registrar-General's Report, dated 30th December, 1901, on the Census of England and Wales. 1901 (County of London). TABLE A. Area. Statute Acres. Inhabited Houses. Population. 1891. 1901. 1891. 1901. City of London 672.7 5,340 3,865 37,702 26,923 For Registration, Parliamentary and Municipal purposes the boundaries of the City are co-terminous. These figures represent the population on the night of the 1st April, 1891 and 1901, exclusive of sub-district of Glasshouse Yard (see note on next Page). A Day Census—the number of persons actively engaged in the City during the daytime—has been taken on three occasions, viz., in 1866, 1881, and 1891. It is a matter for regret that no Day enumeration was made in the City during the last Imperial Census year. TABLE B. CENSUS RETURNS. Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population. 1861 112,063 — 1866 — 170,133 1871 75,983 — 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 — 12 For statistical purposes, in the following pages the "Registration" District is referred to when speaking of the "City." This consists of two sub-districts, together containing a population of at the middle of 1906, calculated on the last Census Returns:— *St. Botolph 7,277 †St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 14,091 Total 21,368 The Night population, therefore, of the City of London Registration District the middle of 1906 is taken at 21,368, and it is upon this figure that all vital statistics in this Report have been calculated. The Day population at the middle of 1906 was estimated at 374,730‡ persons. A Day Census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. In 1903 it was ascertained that in the week ending 19th July no less than 347,463 vehicles passed to and from the four City bridges, viz.:—London, Southwark, Blackfriars and Tower, equivalent to upwards of 18,000,000 vehicles per annum. BIRTHS. During the year 1906, 341 births were registered in the City. The annual birth rate was at the rate of 15.9 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 13.7 per 1,000. The birth rates last year in the Sub-Districts were— St. Botolph 21.3 per 1,000. St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 13.2 „ In the Metropolis the birth rate in 1906 was 26.5 per 1,000, being the lowest hitherto recorded therein. This decline in the birth rate has been in operation in this country since 1876, and is common to nearly all European countries. * At the date of the last Census, this District included the "civil parish" of Glasshouse Yard. The parish was transferred to the Holborn Union by the Local Government Board Order, No. 43156, which came into operation on 29th September, 1901, and to the Kegistration District of Holborn (Finsbury Sub-District) on 1st January, 1902, making the Registration District of London City co-extensive with the Municipal City of London. All the Registration Districts in London are co-extensive with the Poor-Law Parishes or Unions except the District of Fulham. † On the 1st April, 1901, the Middle Temple was transferred from the Strand Sub-District to St. Sepulchre Sub-District. ‡ This figure is based upon the assumption that the number of persons residing, occupied or employed within the City during the active hours of the day has increased at the same rate since the last Day Census in 1891 that it did between that and the previous Day Census in 1881. 13 VACCINATION. Of the children born in 1906, 214 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 25 had died before the age for vaccination, and 2 were insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 18 cases, 52 had removed into other districts, and 27* vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 6 cases of conscientious objection. Vaccination Statistics in the City of London. Year. Number of Births. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible. Had Small-pox. Died before Vaccination.

During the year under review, 901 deaths were registered in the District including *658 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table, p. 17, for details. Deducting the latter 243 deaths remain, to which must be added 36 persons who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered. The mortality, therefore, from which the City death rate is calculated is 279. The death rate for 1906 was 13.0 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 13.9), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 15.1. These figures are not corrected for sex and age distribution. Death Rates, per 1,000 per Annum. Year. City of London. Great Towns of England and Wales.

The death rate from zymotic disease per 1,000 of the population was 0"51 compared with 1.93 in the Metropolis. Infantile Mortality. The deaths of children under one year of age to 1,000 births were 88, against 131 for the whole of London. The Table of infantile mortality on p. 15 shows the deaths of children under one year arranged according to monthly age periods. From this it will be seen that no less than 36 per cent, of these deaths occurred in the first month, 50 per cent, within the first three months, and 63 per cent, during the first six months of existence. Deaths in City Institutions. During 1906, 36 persons died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries, or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 12.9 per cent, of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis (1905) being 19.7 per cent.

A careful survey was made by the District Inspector of every house where infectious disease occurred, and some details relating to the result of such inspection are given on page 50. 21 SHELTER FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION DURING DISINFECTION. The Shelter in Golden Lane, Barbican, provided in accordance with Sec. 60 (4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which enacts that "sanitary "authorities shall provide free of charge temporary shelter or house "accommodation with necessary attendants for the members of any family "in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, for the purpose of "enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the sanitary authority,has been visited by six families during the year. They numbered 27 persons, of whom nine were adults and 18 were children, and who were housed during the disinfection of their houses after:— Scarlet Fever 4 families. Diphtheria 1 family. Enteric Fever 1 „ 6 families. One family came from a home consisting of four rooms, two of three rooms and three of two rooms. 22 CONTAMINATED MILK. A further series of samples of milk, taken for bacteriological examination, was completed in January, 1906, 25 samples being collected representing the the milk supply from the following Counties:— Bedford 1 Oxford 1 Derby 3 Stafford 3 Dorset 2 Suffolk 2 Essex 3 Somerset 1 Hertford 1 Warwick 2 Leicester 2 Wilts 3 Norfolk 2 Total - 25 Dr. Klein reported upon them as under:— "February 2nd, 1906. "I beg herewith to report on the examination of the milk samples "submitted for analysis. As will be seen from the tabular statement, "two of the samples, namely, No. 7 and No. 23, caused real Tubercle "with B. tuberculosis ; this would amount to about eight per cent. "As you will see from the results stated in the tables, a considerable "number of the animals died spontaneously, but are marked as having "given negative results in the post-mortem examination, meaning "thereby that the cause of death was not ascertained. Excepted are "two such animals, that is animals dead spontaneously; namely, subcu"taneous guinea-pig No. 12, in which the cause of death was probably "infection with Proteus vulgaris, and guinea-pig peritoneal No. 23, in "which the cause of death was Septicæmia due to a virulent B. Coli. "It will also be seen from the tables that the following samples caused "no abnormal condition in the animals ; they are:— "Samples, Nos. 2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 14, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24 and 25, or about "48 per cent.

Clean and pure 20 80 Tuberculous 2 8 Unsatisfactory 3 12 Total 25 100 The results obtained in this enquiry again confirmed the unsatisfactory manner in which much of the milk trade is carried on. In the majority of the farms there is no real supervision, either of the cows or the buildings, &c. If any tuberculous animals should by chance be discovered, they are very likely got rid of in a very questionable manner, i.e., removed from the farm, either to be used on another for milking, or to be slaughtered for food. The Medical Officer of Health for Blackburn, in his Report for 1905, refers to the slaughter, at a Public Abattoir, of 44 cows with tuberculous udders, and states that "25 of these 44 cows were giving milk until the day of slaughter, "and milk from 8 of these 25 cows was being sold in Blackburn." Bearing in mind the fact that milk forms the staple foods of infants and invalids—that the birth-rate is steadily falling—and that the rate of infantile mortality is as high as it was 25 years ago, it must clearly be the duty of the Legislature to devise some practical means of dealing with this grave source of danger. The Sanitary Committee decided that the Report on this enquiry should be forwarded to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. 1906 was the third year in succession during which special enquiries as to the character of the milk supplied to the City had been conducted. The percentage composition of the three series may be classified as under:— 1904. 1905. 1906. Clean (pure) 49 per cent. 68 per cent. 80 per cent. Unclean (dirty) 43 „ 23 ,, 12 „ Tubercular 8 „ 9 „ 8 „ It will be noted that while there has been a distinct and regular improvement in the direction of cleanliness, the proportion of samples found to be tubercular is practically constant. 25 With regard to the two samples, No. 7 and No. 23 (see p. 23), found to be tubercular in this series, the following information was procured :— No. 7, Suffolk.—The Dairy Company at once discontinued the supply, and ordered an investigation by the Medical Officer of Health and a Veterinary Surgeon. It was stated that the premises were in good sanitary condition, but the Veterinary Surgeon reported: "I have examined the cows—50 cows and a "bull—for evidence of tubercular affection of the udder, and, with the exception "of five which have been turned away as showing suspicion of induration which "may be tubercular or otherwise, I detect no unhealthiness in them." The Company wrote : "We are arranging for periodical veterinary inspection of " cows as suggested in your last communication." No. 23, Warwickshire.—The supply was at once discontinued. The Medical Officer reported that the farm was in a good sanitary condition, but the examination of the Veterinary Surgeon showed that "that one cow is " suffering, in my opinion, from tuberculosis of both hind quarters of the udder." These reports were satisfactory from one point of view only, viz., that they demonstrated the value of the bacteriological examination of milk. They showed, however, very clearly, that practically no care or attention is paid to the health of the cows furnishing our milk supply. Further enquiries simply elicited the fact that there was no system of inspection, and that the Dairy Companies were quite content to take supplies from any farm without taking the trouble to supervise the farmer, who as a rule is entirely ignorant, or if he has any knowledge, prefers to remain silent on the subject, knowing that no punishment can reach him for supplying a dangerous article. No action can be taken against farmers in the country selling milk from cows affected with this disorder, as it was not included in the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act, 1878, under which the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order was instituted, nor can Section 71 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, be applied, as it is only operative where there is evidence that milk supplied within the district has been the cause of a dangerous infectious disease. Some few towns have local Acts giving the Sanitary Authority power to prevent the sale of milk from tuberculous cows, and the London County Council is promoting this Session a General Powers Bill, which includes clauses for this purpose, but these, as at present drafted, are likely to be strongly opposed by the Corporation. 26 I have repeatedly reported on the necessity for additional legislative powers for controlling the milk trade.* It is now established beyond a doubt that tuberculosis can be transmitted to the human being by the agency of milk, and the urgency for such powers is indicated by the knowledge that this disease is increasing amongst animals. It has been stated on good authority that— "† as far as we can ascertain from numerous records which have been "made, there has been a great, almost an alarming, increase in the "number of animals affected with tuberculosis during recent years." Further, that out of 500 cows examined after slaughter by the City Veterinary Inspector, some evidence of tuberculosis was found in no less than 234, or 46.8 per cent.

WINKLES. It is a well-established fact that infectious diseases, especially Enteric Fever, can be transmitted to human beings by the agency of sewage-contaminated shellfish. The oyster is the shellfish that is more generally associated, in the public mind, with this danger, but cockles, mussels and winkles are probably more to be suspected. The late Sir Richard Thorne, so far back as 1894, expressed his conviction that the distribution of shellfish from Cleethorpe and Grimsby as a centre had been concerned in scattered cases of Cholera over a somewhat wide area of England. This resulted in the appointment of Dr. Bulstrode to undertake a comprehensive enquiry into the circumstances under which molluscs were cultivated and stored along our coasts. Dr. Bulstrode's report, which was published in 1896, showed conclusively that at that date in the greater part of the layings shellfish were cultivated under conditions that rendered them specially liable to sewage pollution, and although since then some attempt has been made in some places to modify the evil, much remains to be done. Since this report public attention has been called from time to time to outbreaks of Enteric Fever through the agency of shellfish, and this danger will be an ever-present one until the State interferes and protects the public by means of statutory measures for the control of the conditions under which molluscs are cultivated and stored. In spite of the fact that a Royal Commission reported in December, 1903, that— "We (the Commissioners) have no doubt that shellfish which have "become contaminated by sewage may convey Enteric Fever and other "illnesses to human beings, if eaten either raw or in an imperfectly "cooked condition ; " * Also that— "There can, however, be no doubt that the evil is sufficiently grave to "demand a remedy;" nothing appears have been done in the direction indicated, although repeated representations have been made to the Governmental Departments directly concerned with the protection of the public health. * Fourth Report of the Royal Commission on Sewage Treatment and Disposal (Pollution of Tidal Waters with special reference to Contamination of Shellfish). 28 I regret having again to report that during the year under review 1 had occasion to investigate several cases where shellfish were implicated. In March, 1906, the Medical Officer of Health for Wandsworth had reason to connect winkles purchased at Billingsgate with a case of Enteric Fever in his district. Samples of the suspected winkles were submitted to Dr. Klein, who reported as under:— April 2nd, 1906. "I beg herewith to report on the special bacterioscopic analysis of the sample "of winkles brought here on March 17th. As in your letter accompanying the "sample, the winkles were ' purchased from a merchant in Billingsgate,' and as a "case of Enteric Fever is attributed to winkles obtained from the same merchant, "my analysis was, of course, chiefly directed to discover if any specific pollution "was present in these winkles. "After thoroughly washing the outside of the shells, about a dozen were "selected, dried on the outside, and about ten of the fish were removed with their "liquor into a sterile dish and finely cut up. The total amount of very turbid "fluid drained off the minced material was just one cubic centimetre. "The greater amount of this material was used for cultivation, thus :— "(a) For general orientation as to pollution ; for determining the presence of "B. coli communis, streptococci, and spores of enteritidis. (b) For search of "B. typhosus or of B. Gaertner. (a) Tested for B. coli communis, 0.l c.c., 0.0l c.c., 0.005 c.c.; for "streptococcus, 0.1 c.c., 0.01 c.c., 0.005 c.c., for enteritidis spores, "0.2 c.c., 0.l c.c. "The result of this part of the search was : B. coli communis was present in "0.l c.c., but not in 0.01 c.c. Streptococci were absent in all cultures. Spores "of enteritidis were present in 0.2 c.c., but not in 0.l c.c. Considering that "0.l c.c. of the fluid corresponds to one whole fish, this analysis does not denote "any marked pollution. (b) For B. typhosus. Two large Drigalski plates, each with 0.l c.c.; one "large Drigalski, with 0'05 c.c. "The number of blue colonies was extremely scanty, and could be found only in the plates which had received 0.l c.c. "These blue colonies were (1) colonies composed of motile bacilli, which liquefied "gelantine, therefore negative. (2) In each of the two plates there was one blue "colony, which might from general aspect have been taken as that of the "B. typhosus or B. Gaertner, and being composed of motile cylindrical bacilli; "but subjecting them to the agglutination test and to subcultures (in the various "media used for identifying the above two specific microbes) it became at once "evident that they are not belonging to the group of B. typhosus or of "B. Gaertner. "The conclusion to be drawn from this analysis is (1) the winkles do not "show either general pollution, (2) they do not contain the specific microbe "searched for. "E. KLEIN." 29 It will be seen that the results were negative; the bacteriological examination therefore failed to associate "winkles" with the case of Enteric Fever reported from Wandsworth. Later, however, two other cases of Enteric Fever occurred in Wandsworth, which the Medical Officer of Health for that district again connected with winkles supplied by a wholesale dealer at Billingsgate. Upon investigation it was discovered that the winkles in question came from the West Coast of Scotland, and that some of these at least had been gathered from the polluted shore of Loch Gilp within an area suspected of having contained the shellfish which originated the outbreak of Enteric Fever in Glasgow in 1903. Two other shellfish merchants in Billingsgate were found to obtain their supplies from the same source, and all three were at once warned of the responsibility they incurred unless they discontinued dealing in shellfish, the eating of which involved a serious danger to health, and advised for their own protection to insist upon being supplied by dealers with a guarantee that all shellfish consigned to them are from a source that the local Medical Officer of Health considers to be unpolluted. COCKLES. Cockles from Leigh-on-Sea again came under suspicion during the year. At the latter end of June I received information that of 52 cases of Enteric Fever notified in West Ham, 24 were distinctly found to have eaten cockles a short time previous to the onset of the illness, and that in the majority of instances the cockles were stated to have been purchased from a dealer in Billingsgate Market, who procured them from Leigh-on-Sea. As at this date there was a distinct increase in the number of cases of Enteric Fever notified in the Metropolis, it was more than ever important that the matter should be closely followed up. Six samples were therefore purchased as under:— Sample No. Date. Dealer. Particulars. Obtained from. I. 28th June P, Cooked M, Haddock Market, Leigh-on-Sea. Billingsgate.

"I received by your Inspector for bacteriological analysis, the following "samples of ' cooked ' cockles:— "Samples I. and II. "Samples III. and IV. "Samples V. and VI. on June 28th. on June 29th. on June 30th. "These cockles are supposed to have been exposed to a temperature high "enough to destroy B. typhosus, B. Gaertner, B. proteus, that is to say, undesir"able microbes, which, being non-sporing, succumb to temperatures far below "the temperature of boiling water. In this respect they stand in the same rank "as B. coli and streptococci ; as a matter of fact all these microbes have about "the same death point, viz., they are killed at 68 deg. C.—70 deg. C. in a few "minutes (154 deg. F.—158 deg. F.), or in other words they are killed at "temperatures 54 deg. F. to 58 deg. F. below boiling point of water. "The analysis was therefore directed to ascertain (1) whether the interior of "the fish contained microbes in a living state, which like B. proteus, B. coli and "streptococci are killed by temperatures ot 154-158 deg. F., and (2) whether they "contained living microbes belonging to the Gaertner-Typhoid group. "For the purpose of the analysis, of each sample 12 cockles were selected, the "stomach was cut out and finely minced with sterile scissors in about 1 cubic "centimetre of sterile salt solution ; this having been well mixed, yielded a thick "turbid fluid, of which one-fifth to one-tenth c.c. was spread over each of two "large Drigalski-Couradi plates. These were then placed at 37 deg. C. in the "incubator, and the resulting growth carefully inspected from day to day." "The result of the examination was as follows:— "All plates contained colonies of microbes which are destroyed at "a temperature of 154-158 deg. F. "Sample I.—Contained abundance of colonies of B. coli and streptococci. "Sample II.— Contained a comparatively limited number of colonies, "amongst these a fair number of B. coli and of streptococci. "Samples 111. and IV.—Were crowded with colonies of B. proteus, B. coli "and streptococci. "Sample V.—Both plates were literally one mass of colonies of B. coli "and streptococci. "Sample VI.—The plates contained a comparatively limited number of "colonies, amongst them were some colonies of B. coli and of streptococci. "The plates of Samples I., III., IV. and V. contained in addition some 'blue' colonies, which in aspect and constitution resemble those of the Gaertner-Typhoid "group, but they gave no agglutination with typhoid blood serum, nor was their "growth in gelatine sub-culture like that of the Gaertner-Typhoid group. But "the plates of Sample'VI. contained seven 'blue' colonies, which in these "respects resembled those of the Gaertner-Typhoid group, being not only in 31 "aspect like the colonies of B. Gaertner or typhosus, but were cylindrical, very "motile bacilli that gave more or less distinct indication of agglutination. Sub"cultures in the different media was then made, with the following results":— "Five could be discarded because they failed in one or the other test : A "neutral red broth culture, Lactose peptone culture, litmus milk culture, "gelatine streak and gelatine shake culture, MacConkey fluid culture, phenol "broth culture. "The sixth gave positive test in all of these until the fourth day, when "slight liquefaction of the gelatine set in. "The seventh lias so far complied with all tests characterising B. Gaertner. "This Sample VI. contained, therefore, the B. Gaertner, or at any rate a "microbe indistinguishable from it. "From the above analyses it follows that none of the six samples have been "sufficiently heated, and are therefore unsafe, inasmuch as the interior of the "cockles contained abundance of microbes in a living state, which, like B. typhosus, "are killed by temperatures far below the temperature of boiling water. In this "respect, Samples I., III., IV., V. and VI. are particularly to be condemned as "unsafe. "E. KLEIN." This is by no means the first time that Leigh cockles have been unfavourably commented upon. They have been for years, and still are, a continued menace to the public health, but in the absence of any adequate legislative powers, the only thing that can be done is to exercise a constant supervision of the methods of the men engaged in the local industry. In my Annual Report for 1902 will be found an article dealing with this question, and in which I strongly condemned the disgusting practice of relaying cockles in Leigh Creek, which directly receives the effluent from the local sewage works in addition to the discharge from drains at the waterside of the town. That enquiry had been instituted owing to some cases of Enteric Fever in Wandsworth, where there was strong evidence that implicated cockles from this place. In June of the succeeding year (1903) there was a recurrence of this evil, and four samples examined by Dr. Klein showed evidence of sewage contamination, and that in the process of cooking the temperature had not been raised sufficiently to ensure destruction of sewage bacilli. This showed clearly the impossibility of relying upon any arrangement with irresponsible fishermen to carry out precautions necessary to protect the public health. That this view was correct is evidenced by the foregoing report of Dr. Klein on the samples taken in June last in connection with the Enteric Fever cases reported from West Ham- 32 The Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Southend (Dr. J. T. C. Nash) took the same view, and issued a circular letter to the members of the local fish trade, directing attention to the risk involved in the consumption of cockles taken from Leigh Creek, and intimated that if they continued to sell or expose them for sale that they would be liable to have them seized as unfit for human food. Dr. Nash added that he had no objection to cockles being obtained from Leigh or to cockles being cooked at Leigh, but that in the interest of the public he had strong objections to cockles which have been laid in the Leigh Creek being used as food in Southend-on-Sea, because at low water there is practically undiluted sewage effluent in the Creek. On receipt of Dr. Klein's report the dealers were called upon to discontinue the sale of these cockles, and they subsequently gave an undertaking in writing to this effect. The Fishmongers' Company were also asked to give notice to the fishermen at Leigh to refrain from sending any more cockles to Billingsgate, and to seize all cockles that in the face of such notice continued to arrive at the City markets. The Company at once investigated the question, and prohibited the sending of Leigh cockles to the market. The Fishmongers' Company subsequently co-operated with the representatives of the cocklers, their attention being chiefly directed to the methods of cooking and preparing the fish for market, when it was ascertained that by a modification in the working of the steam boilers employed more satisfactory results could be obtained, the bacteriological examination of the test samples submitted after the alterations showing that the cockles were properly sterilised. The Leigh fishermen are now fully aware that if they persist as heretofore in relaying cockles in the Creek that receives the town sewage effluent they will lose their means of livelihood. Provided they entirely abandon this practice and cook the cockles properly, there can be no objection to the " fish " being sold. The Rector of the Parish and one other resident having been appointed to exercise supervision for ensuring that the directions and instructions of the Fishmongers' Company were carried out, no further action was then taken. 33 SEWAGE-CONTAMINATED WHITEBAIT. In investigating the cause of some cases of Enteric Fever suspicion was directed to the whitebait as a possible cause. In February, 1903, your Medical Officer had pointed out that the result of some experiments made at that time by Dr. Klein indicated extensive pollution of the whole estuary of the River Thames, and the consequent contamination of such shellfish and fish as are found therein. It was also * pointed out that in addition to shellfish, sprats, and especially whitebait, should be also examined, as the latter are eaten without being cleaned, and the intestines, therefore, are ingested by those eating them. In August last, it having become expedient that whitebait from the Thames estuary should be examined bacteriologically, samples were taken as under, and submitted to Dr. Klein for that purpose:— No. Date. Where obtained. Remarks. 1. August 27th, 1906 Billingsgate Uncooked. 2. „ 28th, „ Hotel in City Uncooked. 3. „ 28th, „ Hotel in City Cooked. 4.

Dr. Klein's report on the above was as follows:— " No. 1. Sample bought on 27 8 at Billing spate. "Examined 20 fish. Result: Remarkably few microbes, no typhoid, no Gaertner. " No. 2. Uncooked portion brought on 28/8. "Examined 20 fish. Remarkably abundant microbes; from Drigalski plates "isolated so far four colonies which, on preliminary tests, comply with the Gaertner"tvphoid groups. Of the four colonies I am making further cultures to see "whether they comply with the required tests. "With reference to the four different microbic colonies mentioned in my first "communication re whitebait sample No. 2 (uncooked fish delivered August 28th), "I have to report that, submitting these colonies to the various tests (Neutral red "broth, Litmus Glucose, Peptone Water, Litmus Milk, Phenol Broth, Shake Gela"tine, and Lactone Peptone), it appears that none of them give the tests either of "B. Gaertner or B. Typhosus, and that, therefore, of that sample of whitebait, no "specific bacteria have been identified. " No. 3. Fried. Brought here on 28/8. "Examined 20 fish. Sterile. 34 "No. 4. Sample bought 11/9. "Examined 20 fish. The Drigalski plates showed several colonies, which in "aspect resembled those of B. typhosus, four of these colonies being composed of "motile cylindrical bacilli (like B. typhosus), were subjected to the test of agglu"tination with typhoid serum. Two of them gave indication of clumping; but I "made sub-cultures of all four colonies. Only one of them stood this further test, "but unfortunately its bacilli would not agglutinate with typhoid serum. From "this it follows that no B. typhosus could be identified in this sample. I may add "that this sample contained a very large number of B. coli communis. "No. 5. Sample of 12/9. "This sample was less fresh. The plates were densely crowded with colonies, "amongst these enormous numbers of B. coli. Several colonies there were which "showed a faint resemblance to B. typhosus, but, on microscopic examination and "test with typhoid serum, failed to respond. So that this sample did not yield "B. typhosus, although it was crowded with B. coli. "Nos. 6 and 7. Samples of 10/10. "Sample 6. Fresh. "Sample 7. Cooked. "Of each sample, examined the viscera of 16 fish. "Minced and distributed in 2 c.c. of sterile salt solution, and made of each "sample two large Drigalski plates, each with 0*1 c.c. of thick turbid fluid. "Result: Cooked whitebait—no colonies. "Fresh whitebait—large number of colonies ; Proteus, B. coli, streptococci "and a number of blue colonies. These were tested with typhoid blood serum "and by subculture; none of them were remotely related to the typhoid "Gaertner group, all of them liquefying gelatine and giving no result with "typhoid serum. "No. 8. Sample of Cooked Whitebait of 18/10. "The viscera of 16 fish were examined by Drigalski plates. No bacteria "belonging to the Coli-typhoid group could be discovered ; the fish were "practically sterile. "(Signed) E. KLEIN." It will be seen from the above that all five samples of uncooked whitebait were contaminated, and although the B. typhosus was not discovered, there is always the possibility of such specific disease being conveyed through the agency of fish polluted by sewage. It will also be noted that the degree of contamination varied, there being remarkably few microbes in No. 1, while Nos. 3, 4 and 5 contained large quantities of the bacillus coli. Sample No. 2 was cooked at a City tavern in my presence. This sample proved sterile on examination, but the cooking occupied 65 seconds, a 35 longer period than is usually occupied in the process. Indeed, the Chef gave me as his opinion that the usual time was about 30 seconds, while Mrs. Beeton's Cookery Book gives 15 seconds as the time during which they should be immersed in the hot fat in which they are cooked. In this experimental cooking the fat was unusually hot and had commenced to burn, the temperature recorded being 300° Fahrenheit. Ordinarily the fat would be at a lower temperature, and the introduction of cold fish would temporarily lower this. It is not unlikely, therefore, that in the usual cooking of whitebait, the interior of some of the fish might not be raised to a sufficient temperature to destroy any pathogenic microbes present in them. It is evident, therefore, that unless the greatest care is exercised in preparing these fish for the table, they are not unlikely to act as an agent in producing disease. The point being clearly established that whitebait from the Thames Estuary, as ordinarily sold, is sewage-polluted, those consuming it have to take their choice between eating living or dead sewage organisms as an accompaniment. ANTHRAX. On the 13th January, 1906, a notification was received from the Home Office that a market clerk in the employ of a firm of City furriers was under treatment for Anthrax at Guy's Hospital. It was ascertained upon enquiry that the patient did not contract the disease in the City, having been employed in inspecting hides at wharves situated on the south side of the Thames. These hides were of many different descriptions, but came chiefly from the neighbourhood of Morocco and the Black Sea. He was at work as usual on the 8th January, but on the following day he went home complaining of illness. On the 12th he was removed to Guy's Hospital, at once operated upon, and subsequently made a good recovery. SMALL-POX. In June, a case of Small-pox was reported as having occurred in a suburban district in the person of a female daily engaged in a City workroom. It was found upon enquiry that 23 of the 42 employes with whom the patient had associated were not properly protected by vaccination, and that five of these had never been vaccinated at all. The necessary vaccination and re-vaccination were promptly effected, and no further case was reported. 36 CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER. Early in February, 1906, a resident at an hotel in the City was attacked with an illness that necessitated his immediate removal to hospital for treatment. The patient became rapidly worse, and died within forty-eight hours of the attack. The disease was diagnosed as one of purpura hemorrhagica, though a subsequent examination showed that the spinal fluid swarmed with the meningococcus of Weichselbaum, but the course of the disease was so rapid there had been no time for the development of the characteristic phenomena. The body was cremated and all necessary precautions taken with regard to disinfection. This case is interesting as showing that sporadic cases of Cerebrospinal Fever that are generally expected to be mild in character may assume a foudroyant type, of which the case in question was a typical example. A full account of this case was contributed to the "Lancet" of 28th April, 1906, p. 1,172, by Dr. F. W. Andrewes, Pathologist and Lecturer on Pathology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. It is also referred to by Dr. M. H. Gordon in a Report to the Local Government Board, dated 18th February of this year, on the " Micrococcus of epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis and its identification." LAUNDRIES AND INFECTED ARTICLES OF CLOTHING. In March last the Islington Public Health Committee invited the opinion of the Corporation with regard to the provisions of Section 68 (c) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which prohibits, under penalty, the removal, without previous disinfection, of infected articles to laundries. This provision, however, only extends to articles infected by a "dangerous infectious disease," as defined by Section 55 (8) of that Act, and does not include other non-notifiable disorders of a highly infectious nature, and articles therefore infected with such disease may be, and frequently are, sent to laundries without any precautions. It was also pointed out that several provincial towns had obtained powers for enforcing disinfection before transmission to laundries of articles that had been exposed to any infectious disease, and suggested that what was beneficial for other places would be equally so for London. The Committee concurred in these views, and the Islington Authorities were informed that the Corporation also advocated general legislation in the direction indicated. 37 NOTIFICATION OF ERYSIPELAS. In September last, the Deptford Borough Council sought the opinion of the Corporation as to the value of the compulsory notification of Erysipelas. The matter was referred to your Medical Officer of Health, on whose recommendation the Town Clerk of Deptford was informed that the Committee were of opinion that no good purpose was served by the inclusion of Erysipelas as a notifiable dangerous infectious disease under Section 55 (8) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. While in the City the expense of payment for notifying this disease is a small one, that is not the case in the Metropolitan Boroughs. In the City in 1905 only 23 cases were notified, representing a payment of 21. 18s., whereas in London daring the whole period 4,972 cases were notified, representing a very large expense in proportion to the benefit resulting from such notification. PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS. SANATORIA FOR CONSUMPTION. With regard to the proposal referred to in my last Annual Report that the Managers of the Metropolitan Asylums Board should undertake the duty of establishing Sanatoria for persons suffering from Consumption in the Metropolis, and the opinion expressed by the Local Government Board on the subject in their letter of the 27th June, 1905, to the effect that they were not then able to decide whether the Managers should undertake such duties, a further letter on the subject was addressed to the Managers by the Local Government Board on the 22nd March, 1906, in which the latter stated that after giving the matter the most careful consideration, the Board were of opinion that the information then before them did not appear to afford sufficient justification for the very heavy outlay which would be involved in the proposal. This subject has been considered by the Sanitary Committee from time to time since 1903, and the Corporation, in 1905, approved a recommendation of the Sanitary Committee that the provision of a Sanatorium for Consumption is absolutely essential as a reasonable precaution to public health, and that the Metropolitan Asylums Board are the proper authority for dealing with it. It is unfortunate that the Local Government Board were unable to support the proposal, especially as, as pointed out by Dr. Orme Dudfield in his Annual Report for 1905, the Board had on several occasions shown themselves 38 in sympathy with the promotion of measures for the prevention of Tuberculosis, and had entertained favourably applications by Boards of Guardians for sanction to expenditure on provision of separate accommodation for Consumption in Poor Law Institutions and on Sanatoria ; but it is evident they were greatly concerned with the heavy expenditure at issue in the case of the Metropolis. SPITTING NOTICES. The cautionary Notices against spitting first issued by the Corporation in 1902 have been found most useful in checking the disgusting practice of expectoration, and are in considerable demand by employers of labour, who are supplied with them free of charge for exhibition on their premises. NOTIFICATION OF PHTHISIS. A system of voluntary notification of Phthisis by medical men has been in operation in the City since 1902, and although the cases notified have been necessarily few in number, owing to the small resident population, the recognition of this disorder as an infectious disease has not been without an educational value in directing attention to the advisability of the disinfection not only of the premises in which the disease has terminated fatally, but also of the need for taking precautionary measures by disinfection, &c., from time to time, of the offices and other places where consumptives are employed. 39 CREMATION. On the 24th March, 1906, a Provincial Sessional Meeting of the Royal Sanitary Institute was opened at Leicester for the consideration of Cremation in all its bearings, your Medical Officer being in attendance as the representative of the Corporation. The Chairman of the Council of the Institute presided, and a feature of the proceedings was the paper on Cremation read by the Medical Officer of Health for Leicester, in which was given full particulars concerning the Crematorium established by the Corporation of Leicester. Dr. Millard also delivered an interesting address on the progress of Cremation in this and other countries. From this we learn that this method of disposal of the dead is steadily growing in favour. In Paris alone the total cremations amounted to 3,147 to the end of the year 1903, and it has since been considerably increased. In the United States of Americano less than 3,160 took place in one year, 1902; in Germany for the same year the figure was 1,074. The total for Great Britain for each year since cremation received legal sanction will be seen in the Table accompanying this Report on page 41. The Conference was a most successful one, being attended by representatives of most of the Municipal and Private Crematoria, and resulted in valuable information and suggestions being brought forward. The opportunity was taken of exhibiting the drawings of the Corporation's Crematorium at Ilford, together with the details of the progress of the work. The growing feeling in favour of cremation as a means of disposing of the dead is further shown by the increase that has taken place in the number of bodies so dealt with at the City of London Cemetery, Little Ilford. Whereas only 9 cremations took place there in 1905, the number had increased to 23 during 1906. It will be seen from the Table referred to above that a similar increase occurred at nearly all the other Crematoria mentioned therein. This is doubtless due, in a great measure, to the low fees charged as compared with the expenses of earth burial. Moreover, there is every indication that the prejudice against cremation on sentimental grounds is decreasing yearly, the numbers of cremations that have taken place annually in the United Kingdom within the last ten years having doubled. It may surprise many to hear that since this method of disposal of the dead received legal sanction in 1884, nearly 6,000 cremations have been carried out in the United Kingdom. The number of Crematoria established are steadily increasing, six having been opened during the last four years, and others are contemplated. Twelve are now in operation in England and one in Scotland. 40 The legal formalities to be observed before a cremation can take place are extremely simple, while at the same time they have been so drawn up as to thoroughly obviate any abuse or irregularity detrimental to the course of justice in criminal cases. With regard to the prejudice against cremation that undoubtedly exists, much of it is based upon religious grounds. Many eminent divines, however, have recorded their approval of cremation, notably the late Bishop of Manchester, whose utterance— "No intelligent Faith can suppose that any Christian Doctrine is "affected by the manner in which this mortal body of ours crumbles into "dust " must appeal to the majority of thoughtful minds. The medical and utilitarian point of views should also not be lost sight of, and no one has better dealt with cremation from this aspect than Dr. Alfred Hill, late Medical Officer of Health for Birmingham, who stated in "Public Health" for October, 1902:— That "No one after mature consideration can doubt that cremation is "the most sanitary mode of disposal, and it is the most economical, for "it would liberate thousands of acres of land for food production, for "building, for parks, or other useful purposes, and from the decency and "purity of the process it is the least revolting to the feelings of the "loving and mourning survivors. It offends no system of theology, and "it literally verifies the words of our burial service, 'Ashes to Ashes'; "it permits the possession or appropriate disposal of the remains, which "are practically imperishable, in a suitable manner in urns which could "be placed in crypt, cloister, church, chapel, columbarium, country "churchyard, or private grounds without the slightest risk to the living. "As old Sir Thomas Browne quaintly observes in his 'Hydriotaphia,' "'He that hath the ashes of his friend hath an everlasting treasure.' It "would allow of our dismal and neglected burial grounds being converted "into beautiful and healthy gardens. It is no more expensive than "ordinary burial, and is as free from social, scientific, and true sentimental "objections as it is from religious ones." These words are an admirable presentment of the essential facts relating to cremation as compared with earth burial, and cannot be too widely made known. The several towns in the United Kingdom where Crematoria are erected are shown in the accompanying Table, and the date of opening them indicated in the first column. 41 CREMATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, 22 Years—1885-1906.

These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's—Queen's— Prince's—North—and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class; some of the ground floors being let as shops. The buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 1,031 persons. Fifty-nine per cent, are adults and forty-one per cent, children (under 14 years). The death rate for 1906 was 5'8 per 1,000 per annum [of which 50 per cent, was of children under 5 years of age]. The number of deaths per 1,000 births of children under one year was 111, as against 88 for the City generally.

Only one illegitimate birth has been recorded in these Dwellings since 1894, which is consistent with the high reputation for morality among the Jews, by whom they are mainly occupied. 43 The birth rate in these Dwellings reached a maximum of 46.9 per 1,000 in 1896, and has since been falling, as shown by the following figures:— Birth Rate, Artizans' Dwellings. 1896 46.9 1902 45.8 1897 40.3 1903 31.2 1898 43.1 1904 30.1 1899 37.5 1905 29.1 1900 38.4 1906 26.1 1901 33.8 The Baths provided for the use of the tenants of these Buildings, which were opened in May, 1904, continue to be extensively used, the number of persons bathing during 1906 being 12,670, of whom 5,179 were males and 7,491 were females.

The reconstruction of the post-mortem room, disinfecting buildings and machinery, &c., destroyed by a fire in October, 1904, was completed in 1906. During the work of rebuilding, the opportunity was taken of making structural alterations that will greatly improve the usefulness of the buildings. 45 New fumigating chambers have been fitted, the steam disinfecting apparatus and boiler have been re-constructed, an incinerator for the cremation of infected articles has been added, and special arrangements provided for the convenience and safety of juries inspecting bodies. DISINFECTANTS. The warm and prolonged summer last year necessitated a greater demand for disinfectants, which were used freely for watering the channels of the roadways and for disinfecting street gullies and other places likely to create nuisance by the decomposition of organic matter. The wood pavements when flushed at night receive a liberal treatment of disinfectant. The material and methods adopted in 1901 has been in operation annually since that year, and appear to have given every satisfaction. As in former years, all chemicals and disinfectants supplied throughout the Public Health Department have been obtained through your Medical Officer. They are used for the following purposes:— A. Deodorizing and "denaturalizing" condemned meat. B. Disinfecting public conveniences (urinals, &c.). C. Disinfecting roadways, street gullies, &c. D. Disinfecting premises, &c., after infectious disease, drain testing, and sundries. The amounts spent during the past twelve months under these several headings were:— £ s. d.

Periodical inspections were made of the sanitary accommodation provided at the twenty-five Railway Stations in the City, and sanitary improvements have been effected at the following:— Cannon Street (District Railway).—A new sanitary system has been constructed, viz., new iron drain, new water-closets of an improved type, and six new circular backed urinals fixed. Aldgate Station.— The lavatories are being cleansed and repaved in a temporary manner, the railway company having in preparation a scheme for general reconstruction of the water-closets and urinals. Fenchurch Street.— New circular back urinals have been fixed in one lavatory on platform, and the reconstruction of the urinals on main platform is under consideration of the Company's engineer. Monument Station.— Minor defects have been remedied. Aldersgate Street Station.— New water-closets and circular-back urinals have been constructed in the men's lavatory. Holborn Viaduct Station.— The water-closets and drains have been repaired. Post-Office Station.— A new water-closet has been constructed for the porters. 49 Blackfriars Station.— Two new water-closets, manhole, and ventilating shaft are in course of construction. The Women Sanitary Inspectors exercise a regular supervision over the sanitary accommodation provided at ladies' waiting rooms in railway stations. INSPECTIONS OF SCHOOLS. Sanitary improvements have been carried out during the year at the following schools:— At Aldersgate Street Ward School.— The greater part of the drains have been relaid, and new water-closets, soil pipes, lavatory basins and urinals constructed. At St. Sepulchre's Schools.—New drains, water-closets, ventilating pipes and urinals have been constructed. At St. Bride's Infant School.—A new iron main has been laid, and new W.C. pans fixed. At Greystoke Place School.—A new water-closet and branch drain have been constructed, and 13 new W.C. pans fixed. These premises are now used as a training college. At St. Dunstan's Schools and St. Dunstan's Infant Schools.—The drains at these schools have been tested and found defective, and the lavatory and water-closet accommodation found to be defective and insufficient, and plans of proposed reconstruction have been submitted. BILLINGSGATE MARKET. Great improvement has to be noted with regard to the cleanliness and general condition of the Market, and the nuisance caused formerly by the storage of fish boxes in the basement has been abated. Some structural alterations have been carried out that have also much improved the ventilation of the basement, and works of a similar character are now being carried out in the boiling house. FISH SHOPS. Lower Thames Street and Monument Street. Complaints having been received of nuisance caused by foul water flowing over the public footway from fish shops in the above thoroughfares, notices were served on the occupiers to abate the evil. The necessary work was carried out, with the exception of three shops, two of which are now used for dry fish only, and in the remaining case the shop is now occupied by a tobacconist. 50 ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS. Harrow Alley and Stoney Lane. Periodical inspections of these Dwellings have been made, and the cleansing of the interiors of a large number of rooms is now in progress. The walls and ceilings of the staircases, sculleries and water-closets have been cleansed during the past year. SANITARY DEFECTS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE. All premises where infectious disease was notified were inspected with reference to drainage, soil and waste pipes, water-closets, water supply, ventilation, &c., and of the 112 cases, it has been necessary to entirely reconstruct the sanitary system in 11 instances ; and amendments have been made to soil and waste pipes and W.C.'s in 31 cases. One room has been ventilated, and in every case the cistern has been cleansed. PAUL'S ALLEY. Neglect of Sanitary Work. The occupier of these premises was summoned at Guildhall Police Court. The case was adjourned for him to comply with the Notice. After further adjournment this was done, and a new connection made to sewer, new drain laid, new W.C. fixed, and water laid on. ROYAL EXCHANGE. Complaints having been received of the sanitary arrangements, a systematic inspection was made of the building and the drains tested. Defects were found in nearly all the shops, and it was ascertained that the brick drain which runs round the Exchange was in an unsound condition. As there is considerable difficulty in putting in a separate drain for each shop, and as the ventilating pipes would disfigure the building, a combined system has been proposed by the Surveyor to the Gresham Committee, which appears to meet the necessities of the case. It is proposed in the new scheme to make special provision for water-closet accommodation for the women employed in the building. LLOYD'S. Several complaints having been made of the want of efficient ventilation to the underwriters' room, a number of visits and experiments were carried out, and as a result the Committee of Lloyd's installed an entirely new system of mechanical ventilation which, up to the present, appears to have acted satisfactorily. 51 In this case there were special difficulties to be dealt with. The room is situated on the first floor, and during the busy part of the day is occupied by a very large number of persons. The only way in which ventilation could be successfully carried out was to adopt a system of changing the air by mechanical means. A fan fixed in the basement draws air down a shaft from roof level; the air, heated in the winter and cooled in the summer, is then forced through a system of tubes and distributed in various parts of the room. In addition there is a fan in the roof which extracts the foul air from a number of openings in the ceiling. OLD WALBROOK SEWER, DOWGATE HILL. In the course of inspection of the drainage of premises in Cloak Lane, a portion of the Old Walbrook Sewer in a ruinous state was found to be receiving the drainage of several houses. This old sewer was on the line of the old Wall Brook, and formed the boundary of the Ward of Walbrook; for the greater part of its length it ran under the premises between Cloak Lane and Upper Thames Street. The condition being dangerous to health, arrangements have been made for the redraining of the premises in question into the sewers under the public way, the Corporation in some of the cases paying part of the cost of the new drains. The work is practically completed, and the old sewer filled in and bricked up. In this connection the following extract from "Old and New London," by Walter Thornbury, has some historical interest:— "The rivulet, or running water," says Maitland, "denominated "Walbrook, ran through the middle of the City above ground, till "about the middle of the fourteenth century, when it was arched over, "since which time it has served as a common sewer wherein, at the "depth of sixteen feet under St. Mildred's Church steeple, runs a "great and rapid stream. "It hath been a common speech," says Stow (Elizabeth), "that "when Walbrook did lie open barges were rowed out of the Thames, "or towed up so far, and therefore the place hath ever since been "called ' The Old Barge.' " The site ot this place is now known as Barge Yard. It is a cul-de-sac, entered from Queen Victoria Street. In the course of some drainage works executed a few years ago at No. 11, Queen Victoria Street, the workmen came upon some piling that apparently had formed part of this old wharf. 52 IRON DRAINS. A large and increasing proportion of the new drains in the City are now constructed in iron with caulked lead joints. Iron has many advantages over earthenware, viz., the length of the pipes (9 ft. against 2 ft.), enabling a true alignment to be kept, the small number of joints, the fact that a defective joint can be caulked at once, saving delay, the greater resistance to subsidences and vibration, and the expedition with which the works can be carried out, this being an important item in large business premises, and indeed in any case. The disadvantages are, the slightly increased cost of the material and the suggestion that the pipes are liable to corrosion, but if they are properly coated with Dr. Angus Smith's solution, this does not appear to be a real objection. On the whole, therefore, iron pipes are preferable to earthenware ones, especially when the drain has to be laid beneath a building, also when a drain has to be driven through a mass of brickwork the iron pipe offers greater facilities for laying the drain, as the joints are so far apart, and less cutting away is required in piercing the obstruction. When these advantages are more generally recognised it may be possible to require all drains to be laid in iron. HOUSES INFESTED WITH VERMIN. Two cases occurred where rooms in tenement houses were found to be infested with vermin. Upon the owners' attention being directed to the powers conferred upon the Corporation by 4 Ed. 7, cap. 244, sec. 20, they at once carried out the necessary disinfection and cleansing. The section referred to enacts that upon receipt of a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health, a Sanitary Authority is empowered to give notice in writing to the owner or occupier of verminous premises requiring him within a certain time, to be specified on the Notice, to cleanse the house, and if so required to remove the paper from the walls, and take such other steps for the destruction and removal of vermin as the case may require. Failing compliance with such Notice, the Sanitary Authority may do the work required themselves, and recover the expense as a civil debt from the person making the default. 53 REMOVAL OF HUMAN REMAINS. The removal of human remains has been carried out in four cases during the year. ST. GILES', CRIPPLEGATE. In January, 1906, in the course of re-building some ancient premises known as the "Old Shoppes," situated upon unconsecrated ground in close proximity to the churchyard of St. Giles', Cripplegate, a quantity of human remains were exhumed. Application was therefore made to the Home Secretary for a Licence for the removal and disinterment of the same at the City of London Cemetery, Little Ilford. The Licence was issued on the 26th January, 1906, and was granted subject to the following conditions:— (1) That the removal be effected with due care and attention to decency under the supervision and to the satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. (2) That the remains be forthwith re-interred in the City of London Cemetery, Little Ilford. In all fifteen sacks of bones were found. These were placed in specially constructed cases and removed to Ilford on the 1st February for re-interment as directed in the Licence. SITE OF OLD CHRIST'S HOSPITAL. In July, 1905, a number of human remains were found in the course of excavations for additional buildings to St. Bartholomew's Hospital on the site of Old Christ's Hospital. Forty cases of these were removed at that time and re-interred at the City of London Cemetery at Little Ilford, under a Licence issued by the Home Office on the 13th July, 1905. Twelve months later, viz,, in July, 1906, a further quantity of bones, filling eighteen cases, were discovered during further building operations on the same site, and these were similarly dealt with. CORNER OF GRACECHURCH STREET AND CORNHILL. In July, 1906, some human remains were discovered in excavating during the erection of a new building on a piece of land abutting on St. Peter's Church and Churchyard. In this case space was found for the bones in the Churchyard, where they were re-interred under proper supervision. 54 ST. PETER-LE-POOR. In the "London Gazette" for the 18th May, 1906, it was announced that a,n Order in Council has been issued upon the application of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for effecting the union of the Benefices of St. Michael, Cornhill (a rectory) and St. Peter le-Poor (also a rectory) with the vicarage of St. Benet Fink annexed, under the title of "The United Benefice of St. Michael, Cornhill, with St. Peter-le-Poor and St. Benet Fink. The scheme provided that the church of St. Peter-le-Poor be taken down, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were empowered to sell the materials and site together with any ground adjoining. This necessitated the removal and re-interment of any human remains found therein. The Secretary of State, on the application of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners on behalf of the Vestry Clerk, gave his consent under Sec. 16 of the Union of Benefices Act for the removal of such remains under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. At the time of writing, the necessary arrangements are being made for the exhumation of a quantity of human remains found in the vaults beneath the church, which will be removed and re-interred at the City of London Cemetery, Little Ilford, under my supervision, and in accordance with the regulations in force in the City for such removal. HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. Progress has been made during the year in effecting improvements in the conduct of the business of Hairdressers and Barbers within the City, in accordance with the recommendations approved by the Corporation. The Register of those Hairdressers who have undertaken to comply with the Regulations now includes the following establishments:— The Army and Navy Toilet Club, 35, Bucklersbury. Samuel Cohen, 1 and 2, Snow Hill. Arthur P, Cornell, 5, Birchin Lane. Lorenz Flittner, Electric House, Finsbury Pavement. Frederick G. Foerstel, 1, Telegraph Street. Franz Friedel, 35, Moorgate Street. Fox's Paragon Toilet Club, 60, Fore Street. The Gresham Toilet Co., 93a, Gresham Street. Antoine Heifer, 6, King Street, Cheapside. 55 Carl Hartmann, 5, Queen's Head Passage, Newgate Street. Frederick Heitmann, 13, Pilgrim Street. Philipp George Hoerr, 1, Cullum Street. Gustav Krajewski, 137, Fenchurch Street. Anton Kaiser, 4, Liverpool Street. Kingstone and Hubbard, 8-10, Ludgate Arcade. Charles Lehman, 8-9, Aldermanbury Postern. Gustav A. Meinhardt, 120, Cheapside. Charles Massberg, 12, Cullum Street. The New Baltic Toilet Co., 37, St. Mary Axe. Pierre Pozzi, 16, Lawrence Lane. Louis Reismann, 40, Fish Street Hill. Lucien Saulet, 5, Eastcheap. Alexander Schocke, 149, Cannon Street. Carl Schwefel, 45, Eastcheap. Henry Theobald, 201a, Bishop«gate Street Without. Arthur E. Turner, 53, Long Lane. Alfred Watkins. 6, Aldersgate Street. Frederick Woenowske, 14, Aldersgate Street. One registered establishment was closed, and in two cases the certificates were withdrawn and the names struck off the Register for non-compliance with the Regulations. Other applications for registration are under consideration. The Regulations adopted by the Corporation include only such precautionary measures as are necessary for promoting cleanliness and the prevention of any possible contamination from infected implements. The Corporation's action herein is already appreciated by many. Applications for registration continue to be received, and it is to be hoped that it will result in the proprietors of all saloons within the City availing themselves of this scheme of voluntary registration, thus rendering legislation upon the subject unnecessary within the City. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1907. In my Annual Report for 1905 was a reference to the London County Council (General Powers) Act of that year which contained certain clauses that proposed to confer on officers of the London County Council powers of controlling milk supplies, and to enable the Council to make representations to the Local Government Board as to the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Owing to the opposition of the Corporation of London and others, these proposals were either rejected by Parliament or withdrawn by the Council. 56 The Council have again this Session, 1907, introduced another General Powers Bill dealing (inter alia) with the following subjects:— 1. Milk control—in relation to the prevention of the distribution of i. Tuberculous milk. ii. Infectious milk. iii. Dirty milk. 2. The supply of water to tenement houses. 3. Accommodation for cooking and storage of food in tenement houses. 4. Prohibiting sorting or sifting of house refuse by hand. 5. Sanitary regulations for premises used for sale, &c., of food for human consumption. 6. The making of Bye-laws for regulating the conduct of the businesses of— i. Fried-fish sellers. ii. Fish curers. iii. Marine store dealers. 7. Legalising the establishment and maintenance by Local Authorities of depots for the sale of milk to infants under two years of age. 8. The compulsory cleansing of verminous persons found in Public Elementary Schools and Lodging-houses. Of these, Nos. 6, 7 and 8 are the only subjects that have not been introduced in previous London County Council Bills. The Corporation have decided to petition against the Bill on the ground that Part I., Introductory; Part IV., Milk; Part V., Sanitary Provisions; and Part VII., Cleansing of V erminous Persons, of the Bill as drafted particularly affected their interests. Any fresh legislation concerning the City that may be the result of this measure will be referred to in my next Annual Report. 57 HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1906 consisted of 31,407 cartloads of street sweepings and slop, and 51,300 loads of house and trade refuse; total 82,707. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge. Refuse Dealt with during 1906 and previous Five Years. Year.

COMMON LODGING-HOUSES. 24-25, New Street, Bishopsgate. The lease of these premises, which had been used for many years past as a registered common lodging-house, expired in September, 1905, since when they had been held on a weekly tenancy. Considerable difficulty having been experienced ever since in getting the lodging-house keeper to maintain the place in a decent condition, your Medical Officer personally inspected the premises, and as a result of this visit the owners were communicated with. The latter at once took steps to determine the tenancy, and the premises were closed on the 23rd February, 1906. 4, Vine Street, Minories. This place, which was conducted upon philanthropic methods and opened annually during the winter months, was discontinued last year, and the premises are now being renovated and will be used for ordinary business purposes. 60 116, Middlesex Street. This is now the only common lodging-house in the City. It is known as the "Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," and provides sleeping accommodation for 453 persons. All those seeking shelter therein pay 5d. and 2d. per night for a bed with bath, &c., at the Hotel and Shelter respectively. In a Report to the Sanitary Committee on the 27th February, 1906, the following passage occurs:— "The establishment of a common lodging-house of such dimensions "within the City will probably result, in the near future, in an increase "in the number of persons chargeable upon the City of London Union, "as destitute sick inmates will be removed to the Infirmary." This prediction has been amply justified by events. It does not come within my province to discuss the methods or aims of the Salvation Army other than those that are connected with the prevention of disease, but in dealing with this subject it may be well to point out that this particular "Working Men's Hotel and Shelter" in the City is not free, but is run on business lines and in competition with common lodging-houses in the neighbourhood owned by private individuals. Since this place was opened on the 7th February, 1906, up to 31st December of that year no less than 303 persons frequenting it became chargeable upon ratepayers in the City. Of these, 210 were sent to the City of London Infirmary at Bow for medical treatment, the remaining 93 being admitted as pauper inmates to the City Workhouses. This is undoubtedly a serious question. The charges made at this Shelter are lower than that made by the Salvation Army elsewhere, although the accommodation is superior. As a consequence large numbers are attracted to the City, and to the extent shown have become an unfair burden upon the Citizens. Moreover, the presence of such a place in their midst must constitute an ever-present danger to the public health, especially in times of epidemics. 61 REMOVAL OF FISH OFFAL, &c. Since May, 1906, a new system of collecting and removing fish offal from markets and fishmongers' premises has been in operation in the City. Hitherto it had been the custom for the Cleansing Department, by an agreement with the Markets Committee, to remove such material in the ordinary way as trade refuse, but Messrs. F. S. Hem pieman and Co., of West Ham, having offered to undertake this work under special conditions free of charge, a contract was entered into with that firm for this purpose on 21st May, 1906. The conditions of this contract are that the contractor shall for twelve months from the date of contract collect and remove, free of charge, between the hours of 7 p.m. and 9 a.m., all fish offal from the Corporation markets and fishmongers' premises in the City to the entire satisfaction of the Medical Officer of Health. The contractor is to provide a proper number of specially constructed galvanised iron bins, of a pattern approved by the Medical Officer of Health, and to thoroughly cleanse and disinfect such bins before returning them to the markets or shops. Provision is made in the contract for requiring that the offal collected shall not be used for human food or food for animals, and for entitling the contractor to convert it into manurial products. The contract also contains penalty clauses for ensuring its due performance. The above arrangement has been found a great improvement upon the former method, and has been of special advantage at Leadenhall Market, particularly during the prevalence of warm weather. The approved bin has two covers, one of which is fitted with an indiarubber ring inside, and can be so fastened down as to form a hermetically sealed joint, thus preventing any smell emanating in course of removal. This form of bin has been found well suited for the purpose, and no complaints of nuisance have been received. The experiment has not only been a success, but the City Engineer has estimated that it will probably result in a considerable saving. 62 SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS. During the summer months all the courts and narrow passages throughout the City were regularly flushed under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service and the washing of the main streets last year no less than 60,730,990 gallons of water were used. Disinfectants were also freely applied where necessary. Special attention was given to the condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Custom House. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the neighbourhood of these places free from the nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially in hot weather, when it has been found necessary to treat the roadways freely with disinfectants three times a day. The following is a list of the places that were flushed, so arranged as to show the number of times they were washed down weekly:— Flushed Six times a week. Cavendish Court Cobb's Court Church Row (Fenchurch Street) Church Row (Houndsditch) Aldgate Avenue Back Court (Cloth Fair) Back Passage (Cloth Fair) Botolph Lane Church Entry Cloth Street Cotton Passage Cotton Street Dolphin Court Botolph Alley Church Passage (Eastcheap) Abchurch Lane Acorn Street (part) Bolt Court Cherry Tree Court Clarke's Place Crane Court Cross Lane Crown Court (Chancery Lane) Crown Court (Fleet Street) French Ordinary Court Harrow Alley Huggin Lane Flushed Five times a week.

There are seventy-five courts and narrow passages in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed regularly, become dirty and unsightly through the traffic of passengers or vehicles and the action of a smoke-laden atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. The following is a list of the places so treated during 1906:— EAST DISTRICT. Black Horse Yard, Aldgate.

The number of observations recorded amounted to 595, as against 554 noted at 21 premises in 1905. In all cases the service of the usual Notices resulted in the abatement of the nuisance, and in no instance has the evidence been sufficient to justify the institution of legal proceedings for abatement of smoke nuisance. Judging from the number of complaints received there appears to have been a marked improvement of recent years in the reduction of smoke nuisances from business premises, but this can only partially remedy the evil so long as no action can be taken with regard to smoke from domestic premises, and it is very doubtful whether it would be practical to deal with these by legislation. Much of the improvement noted in the case of premises where motive power is required is due to the substitution of electricity for steam as a generating force, but until electricity is supplied at considerably less cost than at present, it will be but sparingly used, either for heating or cooking purposes. Complaints are frequently made of annoyance from chimneys that cannot be strictly dealt with as causing "smoke" nuisances, and considerable tact is 66 required in inducing those responsible for the evil to take measures to relieve their neighbours of the annoyance. Cases of this kind that have occurred during the year may be classified as under, and in most instances they have been satisfactorily dealt with:— (1) Annoyance from ordinary chimney built at a lower level than the complainant's windows. (2) Annoyance from smell of burning and cooking from eating-houses (3) Annoyance from deposit of grit from furnace chimney. (4) Deterioration of records and papers from products of combustion, &c. In one case a recurring nuisance was caused through several flues at a large block of offices catching fire from time to time. The owners of the premises were ignorant of the cause, which, upon investigation, was ascertained to be, in a great measure, due to faulty chimney construction. All places where steam engines are installed, and all restaurants and diningrooms, are kept under observation, and in almost every case where they create nuisance, it has been found to be due either to use of unsuitable fuel, improperly constructed grates or careless firing—even in those places where suitable coal and efficient furnaces are employed. 67 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, AND WORKPLACES. In a previous Report a short account was given of the operationsjof the Department with respect to these places both before and since the passing of the Act, which came into force on January 1st, 1902. The staff engaged upon the Workshop inspection now consists of three Workshop Inspectors and two Women Inspectors; any defects of drainage or construction being dealt with by the District Inspectors. The Assistant Inspector has also been engaged making enquiries with respect to outworkers and other special points. It will be seen from the appended tables that the clerical work forms a large item in a work of this nature, but this has been now reduced to a minimum. The following will give some idea of the amount involved. During the past year 2,944 entries were made in the book recording references to the Workshop Inspectors, together with letters, &c., received; 14,376 names and addresses of outworkers were transmitted to other Local Authorities, whilst some 2,300 notices were issued in respect of various matters under the Act. This represents only a portion of the work. A Register of Workshops is required to be kept under the Act, in addition to which Registers of Factories and Workplaces are also kept, these greatly facilitating the work of reference. New Workshops and Workplaces are continually being established, whilst others fall out or change their character. It therefore is of great importance that the records should be kept in the best manner possible to economize as much as possible the time of the Inspectors in re-inspections. This is evidenced in this year's record by the increased number of inspections made (6,348 as against 3,614 in 1905), which is in a large measure due to the system of record and reference. The increase in the number of inspections may also in some measure be accounted for by the fact that a number of the inspections were periodical re-inspections, which should not, as a rule, occupy so much time as initial inspections. The system of record and registration is the result of the experience gained in carrying out the provisions of the Act, and is so arranged as to enable reference at any time to every detail of the work. 68 The number of Factories, Workshops, and Workplaces at present registered is as follows:— Premises. Workrooms, &c. Factories 454 1,595 Workshops 1,816 2,836 Workplaces:— Kitchens of Restaurants, &c. 599 861 Kitchens of Tea Rooms, &c. 262 Stables 31 31 Other places 56 56 Totals 3,218 5,379 During the year the names of 241 firms were added to the Factory Register and 33 removed for various reasons. In the case of Workshops, the names of 694 firms were added and 391 removed. With respect to Workplaces (including Kitchens of Restaurants and Tea Shops, &c., &c.), 138 names were added and 47 were removed. The total number of Workrooms in Factories, Workshops, and Workplaces inspected during the year was (including stable yards) 5,379 as against 3,443 last year. Public Conveniences at Railway Stations, &c., &c., inspected by the District Inspectors and Women Inspectors are not included in these figures. The inspections of the Women Inspectors are included, although some of the inspections would be in duplicate, it being the custom for the Women Inspectors to precede the Workshop Inspectors where women are employed in addition to men, but the details of their work appear under a separate heading on page 85. In the Memorandum issued by the Local Government Board dated November, 1906, Medical Officers of Health are reminded of their duties in the compilation of their Annual Reports. The following are quotations as affecting the Factory and Workshop inspection:— i. "The Medical Officer of Health is required to report on the "administration of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, in Workshops "and Workplaces only in so far as this administration is in the hands "of the Borough Council (i.e., the City of London) and is concerned "with matters in his Department." 69 ii. "In reporting on the sanitary administration of workshops and "workplaces he should also include an account of the action with respect "to factories, workshops, and workplaces taken under the Public Health "(London) Act, 1891, as well as under the Factory and Workshop "Act." iii. "In reporting on the sanitary condition of workshops and work"places the Medical Officer of Health should state what action has been "taken to remedy any defective conditions met with under each heading." iv. "He should state as regards sanitary accommodation what "standard of sufficiency and suitability is adopted locally." As regards Underground Bakehouses, the Memorandum says:— v. "It is desirable that the Medical Officer of Health should record "how many certificates of suitability have been given by the Borough "Council {i.e., the Corporation of London), and what were the conditions "required to be complied with in the granting of such certificates." vi. "The Medical Officer of Health in reporting his proceedings "should advise and put on record whether he has made a systematic "inspection of his district." vii. "In making systematic inspections, as in much of his other action, "the Medical Officer of Health will usually have required the assistance "of the Sanitary Inspectors, and the Medical Officer should include in his "report an account of the action which, at his instance, the Inspectors "may have taken for the removal of nuisances injurious to health." Such information has always been supplied 'in all the Annual Reports of your Medical Officer of Health. With respect to the standard of suitability for sanitary accommodation the Corporation adopted in 1903 "The Sanitary Accommodation Order, dated 4th February, 1903,"issued by H.M. Secretary of State, as governing the provision of sufficient and suitable accommodation under Sec. 37 and 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, within their jurisdiction. (See Appendix A for standard of suitability—sanitary accommodation.) The following is a summary of inspections made annually since the passing of the Act:— Factories. 1904—Inspections during the year - 78 1905 ,, „ „ - 735 1906 „ „ „ - 1,708 2,521 70 Workshops. 1901 745 1902 481 1903 547 1904 1,293 1905 2,025 1906 3,481 8,572 Workplaces. 1902 468 1903 357 1904 93 1905 854 1906 1,159 2,931 Totals.

This year sees a large increase in the number of Factories registered, no less than 241 firms having had their premises inspected for the first time. The defects found are similar in all respects to those found in workshops. *Details of Factory Inspections, 1906.

The inspection and re-inspection was proceeded with as usual, but most of the work done this year was in periodical re-inspections. The work done in the past is beginning to tell, so that more time should be available in the future for initial inspections. As in the case of factories, there is nothing of special importance to report. H.M. Factory Inspector forwarded notification of the establishment of 224 new workshops—four of these were not in the City, and were forwarded to the proper quarter, some were already on the register, whilst others had ceased to be occupied, although the Inspector's visit was made almost immediately after the receipt of the notices. 72 * Details of Workshop Inspections, 1906.

(Underground.) « It is now generally known that bakehouses cannot now be newly established "except where the floor surface is not more than 3 ft. below the surface of the "footway of the adjoining street or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the "room." By the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (Sec. 101 (4), all underground bakehouses were after January 1st, 1904, required to be certified by the Local Authority to be suitable. The following is a list of bakehouses now existing in the City :— ABOVEGROUND BAKEHOUSES. The following is a list of bakehouses in the City situated aboveground:— 90, Bishopsgate Street Without. *18-19, Leadenhall Market. †61, Middlesex Street. *155, Minories. †85, Middlesex Street. *4, Water Lane. †l3, Widegate Street. *93-94, Upper Thames Street. *Established during 1903. † These have been established at least 21 years. 74 UNDERGROUND BAKEHOUSES. 188, Aldersgate Street. 81, Bishopsgate Street Without. 59 to 62, „ „ †4, Broadway. 95, Cannon Street. 8, Copthall Avenue. 15, Corn hill. 15, Duke Street. 85, Fore Street. †67, Farringdon Street. †88, †93, Fetter Lane. †l2, Gracechurch Street. †21, Holborn. 8 to 14, King Street, Snow Hill. 48, Knightrider Street. 8, Lambeth Hill. 18, Long Lane. †37, Middlesex Street. †63 to 65, „ †22, 31, Newbury Street. 3, Pancras Lane. 21, Stoney Lane. 68, St. Mary Axe. †75, St. Paul's Churchyard. 194, Upper Thames Street. SUMMARY. Underground bakehouses 27 Aboveground bakehouses 8 Total number of bakehouses in the City 35 During the year 94 inspections of bakehouses were made, and they were found to be up to the standard required by the Act. In several cases a state of general and unnecessary untidiness existed, which was immediately remedied on the Inspector calling attention thereto. Two aboveground bakehouses were discontinued. WORKPLACES (Kitchens of Restaurants, &c.). The usual inspection of these places was made, and there is practically nothing to add to what has been stated in my previous Reports. A number of complaints were received during the summer months of nuisance from the smell of cooking, burning fat, &c., &c., entering the windows of offices and other places, and where practicable a remedy was suggested to occupiers of kitchens. In one case a pipe-shaft was taken from the basement to the roof level, whilst in another case a shaft was connected to an existing flue at the first-floor level. There seems no reason why occupiers of offices, &c., should have to put up with the smell of cooking from restaurants, when by a proper system of mechanical ventilation all the smell of cooking could be discharged above the roof level without annoyance to anyone. †These have been established at least 21 years. 75 The question of larder accommodation has been kept well in view. An abstract of various conditions obtaining in the whole of the registered City Restaurants, &c., shows that out of a total of 599 kitchens, larder accommodation exists at 231, or about 38 per cent. The abstract further shows as follows:— Situation of kitchen—basement 464 „ „ top floor 167 ,, ,, other floors 230 861 Fuel used in cooking—coal 136 „ „ gas 386 „ „ coal and gas 339 861 Artificial light used—gas 605 „ „ electric 255 „ „ oil 1 861 Premises where W.C. accommodation is provided for customers— Men 205 Women 189 394 Dividing the kitchens into classes shows the following result: — A.—Tea shops 228 B.—Coffee shops, &c. 203 C.—Hotels and public-houses, &c. 209 D.— Restaurants with licence 71 E.— Restaurants without licence 150 861 PLACES WHERE FOOD IS STORED OR PREPARED. A commencement was made in the inspection of places where food is stored or prepared other than in kitchens of restaurants, &c., and between 50 and 60 were inspected. The pork butchers and sausage makers received special attention, and a number of suggestions for the improvement of the methods of conducting the business were carried out. It is hoped that further substantial progress will be reported during the coming year. UNSOUND FOOD. Several cases of unsound food were dealt with by the Workshop Inspectors, but in only two was it necessary to bring the matter before a Magistrate, when the articles—consisting of ox-tails and several joints of meat—were condemned and ordered to be destroyed. In no instance did the facts justify further proceedings. 76 During the periodical inspection of kitchens, various articles of food which appeared unfit for human consumption were surrendered and destroyed in the presence of the Inspector. *Details of Workplace Inspections, &c., 1906.

Inspectors of Factories. Where sanitary defects (which are remediable under the Public Health Act, 1891, but not under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901) are found by H.M. Factory Inspector in the course of his work, it is his duty to notify the Local Authority of the same. During the year 39 such notifications were received. The number is above the average of the last two years, although more defects have been remedied under the direction of your Inspectors during that period than in any previous year. Many of the defects reported were of a minor character, want of cleansing, &c. The Factory Inspector was notified of defects in factories coming under the observation of the Workshop Inspectors. With few exceptions, the sanitary defects reported at the 39 places referred to above were remedied before the end of the year, and the works required at those then outstanding have since been completed. A comparison of the number of such notifications received in past years with the year under review shows as follows :— Year. No. of Complaints received. 1897 34 1898 65 1899 55 1900 49 1901 51 1902 54 1903 66 1904 31 1905 32 1906 39 Annual average 47.60 On investigating the reports of H.M. Factory Inspectors, defects other than those notified have been remedied when necessary. The additional defects found included:— (1) W.C's opening directly into workshops, &c. (2) Gas stoves, &c., not ventilated. (3) Defective drains. (4) Defective soil pipes. (5) Defective urinals. (6) Defective waste pipes, &c. 78 VOLUNTARY SANITARY CERTIFICATES FOR KITCHENS AND ABOVEGROUND BAKEHOUSES. Certificates of fitness are granted by the Corporation in respect of kitchens and aboveground bakehouses upon applicants complying with a standard of sanitary requirements, but up to the present, on account of the stringency of the requirements, only three such certificates have been granted, viz., two for kitchens and one for a bakehouse. Two applications were received during the past year, and one was granted provisionally on the understanding that the kitchen, when in working order, was approved by your Medical Officer of Health. The other application was not proceeded with. OUTWORKERS. Very great difficulty has been experienced in getting employers of outworkers to send in lists as required by the Act, and had it not been for the vigorous action of the Corporation, most of the persons concerned would probably have ceased to send them at all. It cannot be too widely understood by City employers that the lists required to be sent to the Corporation and kept by themselves upon the premises where the work is given out are for their own benefit as well as in the public interest. By this means principally work is prevented from being given out by employers to or received from premises where infectious disease exists. For some time past it has been the custom of the Corporation to forward a printed notice giving necessary particulars to all persons known to employ outworkers shortly before the lists become due. The first notices were issued in 1905, when 376 firms were communicated with ; only 162 replied, leaving 214 who neglected or refused. In January, 1906, about 600 notices were sent out. It was found that a number of the firms had ceased to exist, and others had discontinued to employ outworkers ; but 82 neglected to comply. The matter was referred to the City Solicitor, who sent a cautionary letter to each, with the result that lists were subsequently received from the defaulting firms. In July, 1906, a similar number of notices were again dispatched; 269 firms failed to comply. The matter was again referred to the City Solicitor, who succeeded, with the assistance of my Department, in getting lists from all defaulting firms but one. The case mentioned above was taken to the Mansion House, when the defendant was convicted and fined 1l. and 21s. expenses, and afterwards sent in the required list. Information was supplied to the Board of Trade respecting outworkers notified through the City, for the purposes of their enquiries into the condition of the sweated industries, as well as to other Local Authorities for public purposes. There were no cases of infectious disease at homeworkers' premises in the City. In 12 cases enquiries Avere made where workers or outworkers had been in contact with infectious disease, and all necessary precautions taken. As indicating the importance of the "outworker"question, a letter recently received from the Home Office is here reproduced :— "Home Office, "whitehall, "4th October, 1906. "HOMEWORK PROVISIONS OF THE FACTORY ACT. "Sir,—I am directed by the Secretary of State to say, for the information of the "Council, that he desires to bring specially before them the question of the "enforcement by the Council and their officers of the provisions in the Factory Act "which deal with the subject of homework, that is, work in the manufacture, "repair, &c., of articles by the worker in his or her own house. Those provisions "which are contained in sections 107 to 111 of the Act will be found summarized "in the memorandum on the duties of local authorities under the Factory Act "which was issued to the Council in December, 1904, and of which further copies "can be obtained from Messrs. Wyman and Sons, Fetter Lane, E.C., either directly "or through any bookseller. "As the Council are aware, section 132 of the Act requires the Medical Officer "of Health to send to the Secretary of State a copy of his annual report to the "Council on the administration of the Factory Act in workshops and workplaces. "The information with regard to homework contained in the Tables for 1904, "supplied by the Home Office for the use of the Medical Officer of Health, has "been tabulated, and presented to Parliament as a Return during the present "session. A copy of the Return is enclosed for the information of the Council, and "the Secretary of State would direct their special attention to the remarks in the "introduction to the Return. Not only were the tables often omitted or very "imperfectly filled up, but the inference cannot be avoided that in a considerable "number of districts little use has been made by the local authorities of their "important powers under the Homework provisions. "The Secretary of State would most earnestly press upon the Council the impor"tance, in the interests of the large class of workers engaged in homework, of a thorough administration of those provisions. Outworkers form the weakest "section of the labouring class, and the class in respect of which the State from "the nature of the circumstances is least able by its Officers to control the conditions "of work. If these conditions are to be effectively controlled, the local authorities, "to whom Parliament has entrusted the duty of supervising them, must make a full "use of their powers. The Secretary of State may remind the Council that in 80 "addition to the ordinary sanitary inspection under the Public Health Act of out"workers' dwellings, which is even more necessary in their case than in the case of "ordinary dwellings, the following special obligations are placed on the Council:— "(1) The lists of outworkers should be duly received from employers and the "necessary steps taken to enforce them in case of default. "(2) Addresses of any outworkers in the lists who reside in other districts "should be communicated to the Councils of those districts. "(3) Where insanitary conditions or dangerous infectious diseases are found "on outworkers' premises, action should be taken if necessary under sections "108, 109 and 110 of the Factory Act which give power to the Council to "prohibit outwork in such premises. For this purpose outworkers' premises "should be systematically visited. "(4) The annual report of the Medical Officer should be sent to the Home "Office. "The Secretary of State trusts that if in the past any of these duties have been "imperfectly fulfilled in the Council's area, steps will be taken to remedy the "omission in future. "First, as regards the list of outworkers, the Secretary of State would urge the "Council to take every possible step by inspection and otherwise to see that the lists "of outworkers are duly kept by employers and copies sent to the Council twice a "year as required by the Act. The second list for the current year was due to be "sent to the Council on the 1st August. In this connection, he would remind the "Council that the requirement in the Act applies not only to occupiers of factories "and workshops but to any person, e.g., contractor, shop-keeper or the like, who "gives out work to be done. It follows that if in any case the employer's list shows "that work has been given out to a contractor (the prescribed form of list requires "the employer to state whether the person to whom work is given out is a workman "or contractor) the Council should see that the Contractor also furnishes lists of the "persons to whom he passes on the work. Further, the attention of the Secretary "of State has been called to the fact that in many cases the employers' lists include "names and addresses of workers who have long since ceased to be employed. He "may point out that the obligation on the employer is to keep lists of the persons "in fact employed by him, and the list should not include any names of persons who "have not been employed, say, during the 6 months previous, i.e., since the last list "was due to be sent in. Every possible step should be taken to see that these lists "are properly kept by the employers, and in case of default it is always open to the "Council to enforce the obligation by legal proceedings. "The information which these lists convey as to the names of the outworkers, the "places where they live and work, the character of their employment, and the "persons by whom the work is given out to them, is of the greatest importance not "only to the local authority in supervising the sanitary conditions under which the "work is done, but also to the Factory Inspectors in enforcing (a) the provisions of "the Truck Acts (especially those which relate to deductions from the wages of the "outworkers for bad work or for materials supplied by their employer) and also "(b) those provisions of the Factory Act which (in respect of certain branches of "industry) require particulars of the work and wages to be given to the outworkers "to enable them to know what sum they will be entitled to receive on taking the 81 "work back. These provisions, and the power which the local authority possesses "under section 108 of the Factory Act of prohibiting homework in unwholesome "premises, constitute the chief statutory protection of this class of workers against "'sweating'— but it is impossible to enforce them unless full information as to the "names and addresses of the outworkers is available. I may add here that the "Secretary of State would gladly welcome the co-operation of the local authority "and its officers in calling the attention of the Factory Inspectors to any apparent "breach of the Truck Acts or 'Particulars' section in the case of outworkers in "their district. The notes appended may be of interest to the Council and their "officers as showing broadly the irregularities which may be remediable if brought ''to the notice of the Factory Inspector. "Secondly, the Secretary of State would call the special attention of the Council to their powers under section 108, which was introduced into the Factory Act with the object of preventing industrial work being carried on in dwellings under "less wholesome conditions than are required by law in workshops, and thus dealing "with some of the worst features of what is known as the ' sweating' system. The "Return enclosed shows that for the whole of the United Kingdom only 99 notices "are recorded as having been issued under this section, 41 of which are accounted "for by the County of Wiltshire alone. "Finally, as regards the preparation of the figures and other information for "insertion in the Tables of the Medical Officer of Health. These Tables are the "only means by which any exact statistical information as regards the homework "of the country can be obtained. The figures if correctly filled in will afford "information of the greatest value to the State in dealing with the subject of home"work. The preparation of the Return presented to Parliament has shown that in "several respects the Tables can be made clearer and simpler. They will accordingly "be revised before being issued, as usual, in December, but in the meantime, I am "to enclose a form showing the particulars the Secretary of State will ask the "Council to furnish at the end of the year through their Medical Officer of Health. "Several headings in the previous Tables have been omitted, and one addition of "importance has been made. He proposes to ask the Council to classify the "information as to lists of outworkers, &c., according to the nature of the business "carried on by the employer. The list furnished by the employer to the local "authority is required to state this. "The Secretary of State would ask that special care should be taken in com"piling the figures regarding the lists of outworkers and the number of outworkers. "In some cases in the 1904 Tables, the number of lists was given without the "number of outworkers, or vice versa. Also, the figures of addresses of outworkers "furnished to and received from other local authorities were very defective. For "the whole country the totals of these two sets of figures instead of nearly balancing "as they should have done, showed a divergence of over 7,000. One very impor"tant point is the manner in which the case of an occupier who only furnishes one "list in the year instead of two, as required by the Act, should be dealt with in "filling up the Tables. The figure asked for in the first two columns of the Table "is the total number of lists received and the total number of outworkers included "in the lists. Thus, to take a simple instance, if there are 100 employers in the "district giving outwork to, in all, 1,000 outworkers, there should he 200 lists and "2,000 outworkers returned in the Table. If, therefore, an occupier has, for "whatever reason, only furnished one list, a source of error is introduced which 82 "over the whole country largely vitiates the totals. In order that due allowance "may be made for this in the compilation of statistics the Council is asked to keep "a separate account of occupiers furnishing one list only, and of the outworkers "employed by them, and to enter them separately in the third and fourth columns "provided for the purpose in the Table. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, "HENRY CUNYNGHAME. "The Medical Officer of Health "for the City of London." NOTE AS TO THE TRUCK ACTS. The Truck Acts require that wages shall be paid in money only. Payment in goods therefore or otherwise than in coin is illegal. Any express or implied agreement as to the manner or place in which wages are to be spent (for the worker's private use) is illegal. All fines, or deductions or charges in respect of (a) bad work or (6) damaged goods or (c) materials or articles to be used in relation to the work, are illegal unless made in pursuance of a contract between the employer and the worker. The contract must be in writing and signed by each worker, and a copy must be given to each worker when the contract is made. In the case of fines, the contract must specify clearly the matter in respect of which a fine may be imposed, and the amount of the fine. In the case of materials or articles used in relation to the work, the charge must in no case exceed the cost thereof to the employer. No fine or deduction or charge (nor any contract respecting the same) is legal unless it is fair and reasonable. Written particulars must he given to the worker on each occasion when a fine or deduction or charge is made. A copy of the contract must be given to any worker on demand. A breach of the Truck Acts not merely entitles the worker to recover the fine or deduction or the wages paid in goods, but is also punishable by penalty on summary conviction. NOTE AS TO THE "PARTICULARS"SECTION AFFECTING OUTWORKERS. The Particulars Section (s. 116) of the Factory Act has been extended by five Orders to outworkers employed in the making of (1) locks, latches and keys: (2) iron and steel cables, chains, anchors and grapnels, and cart gear; (3) wholesale tailoring; (4) the making of felt hats; and (5) the making, altering, ornamenting, finishing and repairing of wearing apparel, other than boots and shoes, and any work incidental thereto. The effect of these Orders is to require the employer for the purpose of enabling each worker who is paid by the piece to compute the total amount of wages payable to him, to furnish him with a written or printed statement of the rate of wages applicable to the work to be done and such particulars of the work to be done at affect the amount of wages. The particulars must not be expressed by symbols. 83 None of these remarks relating to default or neglect apply to the City, all information asked for having been supplied annually in the form suggested by H.M. Secretary of State. Obviously, there can be but comparatively few premises in the City where homework is done, which after all is the principal object of the clauses in the Act relating to outworkers. At present there are 229 premises registered in the City where work is received to be done for others, constituting the persons who receive the work "outworkers" under the Act. Most of these are contractors having workshops in the City, which, of course, appear in the Workshop Registers. Out of the total of 229 registered outworkers, only 64 may be said to be homeworkers, i.e., persons who do the work at their own homes. These places are inspected periodically by your Women Inspectors, and any structural defects dealt with. Some account of this work appears upon another page of this Report, under the heading "Women Sanitary Inspectors." The principal obligation of the Corporation in the matter of outworkers is to transmit the names and addresses of outworkers received from firms in the City to Local Authorities outside, and from the Home Office Return it would appear that work was given out in the City in 1904 to a larger number of persons than in any Metropolitan Borough except Finsbury; the figures being for the City 3,334, and for Finsbury 3,891, the next highest figure being Hackney with 1,579. The following figures show the yearly increase in the number of outworkers received and notified to outside districts by the Corporation from 1904 to the present date, viz.:— Outworkers notified. 1904 3,334 1905 7,891 1906 14,376 It will be seen that the numbers are greatly increasing, and this will continue to be the case until all employers of outworkers are registered. The Tailoring trade, employing the largest number of outworkers, has received special attention in the City, and recent visits to a large number of these firms show the need for constant supervision to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act. The greatest difficulty experienced is in getting employers to keep the List of their outworkers at their premises in the prescribed form. A recent investigation into this question showed that out of a total of 105 firms visited, only six kept the List as required, and a number have failed to send in any List at all. 84 In future, the classification of Trades required by H.M. Secretary of State will be carried out, and for this purpose it will be necessary that the employers' Lists should be kept and transmitted in the prescribed form. A special effort is being made to acquaint employers of outworkers, who have hitherto failed to keep and send in Lists, of their obligations under the Act. This is being done by your Officers in the course of their periodical inspections. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The City Solicitor was instructed to take proceedings in respect to the following matters, viz. :— Premises. Defects needing to be remedied. 87, Gresham Street Kitchen insufficiently ventilated, &c., &c. 16, Laurence Pountney Lane Want of cleansing of approaches to workshops 3, Lawrence Lane Kitchen insufficiently ventilated, and no separate W.C. accommodation for sexes. 10, Miles Lane Want of cleansing of approaches to shops, and nuisance from waste pipes. 6, Rangoon Street Water-closet connecting directly with shop. In no case was the summons proceeded with, the orders of the Sanitary Committee having been complied with. 85 WOMEN SANITARY INSPECTORS. The premises inspected by your Women Sanitary Inspectors include:— (I.) Under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901— Factories. Workshops. Domestic workshops. Outworkers (occasional workers). Laundries. Workplaces (Kitchens of Restaurants, &c.). (II.) Under Public Health (London) Act, 1891— Houses where births and deaths of infants under one year occur. Offices. Railway Stations (Ladies' Waiting Rooms). Underground Conveniences for Women ; besides premises inspected on complaints as to insanitary conditions affecting women workers. The number of women employed in the 90 different industries represented reaches a total of 12,231. The factories inspected number 212, 130 being initial and 82 periodical inspections. In 25 of the factories women only were employed. These include the following trades:— FACTORIES. Blouses. Book Folding. Collars. Costumes. Cushions. Etching. Frilling. Lace. Mantles. Perfumery. Pickles. Surgical Instruments. Underclothing. Underskirts. The number of women employed in the above 25 factories is 871. 86 The defects found in the factories generally are in respect of the sanitary accommodation, and fall under the following heads :— Sanitary Accommodation— Dirty. Unsuitable. Defective. Not kept separate for sexes. Badly ventilated. Insufficient. Not properly cut off from workroom. WORKSHOPS. Workshops (including domestic workshops, &c.) inspected during the year:— Initial inspections 340 Periodical inspections 680 Re-inspections 273 Total 1,293 Defects Found. Workrooms— Dirty 104 Insufficiently ventilated 68 Overcrowded 25 199 Sanitary Accommodation— Dirty 90 Defective 68 Unsuitable 2 Not kept separate for sexes 23 Insufficient 2 Badly ventilated 13 Not properly cut off from workroom 18 216 Other Nuisances 79 Total number of defects found 494 Nearly three-fourths of these defects occurred in mixed workshops or were of a structural nature. They were consequently referred to the Workshop or District Inspectors. The remainder have for the most part been remedied; in some cases the work required was not completed by the end of the year, but is now in hand. 87 DOMESTIC WORKSHOPS. The following is a list of the Domestic Workshops now on the Register:— Premises. Trade. Workers. Remarks. M. F. Total. 32, Aldersgate Street Millinery — 1 1 Not Outworker.

Part VI. of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, which deals with Outworkers is headed "Home Work," and its provisions mainly refer to dwellinghouses in which work is carried on. This would seem to imply that an Outworker is necessarily a Homeworker, but in the City this is not the case; the large majority of City Outworkers carry on work in premises apart from their homes, and employ workers other than members of their own families. They are in fact occupiers of ordinary workshops or factories, and their premises are inspected in the ordinary routine. In visiting the addresses sent in by employers, several workshops, hitherto unknown, and in which the prescribed Abstract of the Factory Act was not affixed, were discovered, and have been accordingly notified to His Majesty's Inspectors of Factories. The small proportion of Outworkers who are Homeworkers fall into three classes:— (1) Those working at home and employing workers other than members of their own families. In this case the premises are Workshops. (2) Those working at home and employing only members of the family. These premises are Domestic Workshops. (3) Those working at home and employing only members of the family, but whose labour is exercised at irregular intervals, and does not furnish the whole or principal means of living to the family. These are exempt from the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, with the exception of:— Section 108, which prohibits work being carried on in unwholesome premises; Section 109, which prohibits the making of wearing apparel where there is scarlet fever or small-pox; Section 110, which prohibits work being given out to any person working or living in a house any inmate of which is suffering from a notifiable infectious disease. No name is given to this class of Outworker in the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, but they may for convenience of reference be designated "Occasional Workers." 89 The following Table shows the various trades included. It will be seen that only 27.9 per cent. of the total number of outworkers are homeworkers:— Wearing Apparel. Furniture. ElectroPlating. Umbrellas. Miscellaneous Totals. Tailors. Furriers. Ties. Mantles. Caps. Costumes. Collars and Shirts. Clothiers. Blouses. Embroidery. Boots Belts. Millinery. Children's Bonnets. Children's Clothes. Underskirtsand Dressing Gowns. Gloves. Muslin Caps. Gold Blocking. Finishing Ties. Chiffon Tucking. ; Frilling. Shoe Bows. Laundry. House Linen. Frames. Polishing. Engraving. Doll Dressing.

LAUNDRIES. There are only four laundries in the City, two workshop and two factory. The latter are "hosiers' laundries,"i.e., places where new shirts, &c., are washed before sale. There are besides some few laundries attached to shirt and collar factories ; these are included under the heading "Factories." The four laundries were found on inspection to be in a fairly satisfactory condition. WORKPLACES (KITCHENS). Twelve new teashops and cafes and one new restaurant have been inspected during the year, and 234 periodical inspections have been made. 90 The defects found include:— Kitchens— Dirty 42 Insufficiently ventilated 63 105 Sanitary Accommodation— Dirty 3 Defective 12 Not kept separate for sexes 4 Badly ventilated 10 Not properly cut off from kitchen 25 54 General defects 7 Total number of defects found 166 The deficiency in ventilation was mainly in the case of basement kitchens, where no means had been provided to carry off the injurious products of combustion from the gas stoves used for cooking. The entire unsuitability of basements for use as kitchens cannot be too often insisted on. The unhealthy conditions are accentuated when, as too frequently happens, the basement used is one obviously intended originally for use as a cellar only. It is to be hoped that as the public generally become more acquainted with the primary laws of health, the use of such places for the carrying on of work of any kind, more especially the preparation of food, will be voluntarily abandoned. SANITARY ACCOMMODATION FOR WOMEN IN OFFICES. The need of separate and suitable sanitary accommodation for women employed in offices has received considerable attention during the past five years. All cases of complaint are promptly dealt with by the Women Inspectors, and, in addition to this, the District Inspectors endeavour to secure that proper accommodation shall be set apart for women at all premises coming under their notice where women are or are intended to be employed. Through the action of the District Inspector in the Middle District alone, in 17 cases new sanitary conveniences were constructed for the exclusive use of women employed in offices. 91 During 1906 your Woman Inspector has inspected 40 offices, 37 on complaints and 3 in the course of the routine inspection of workshops and workplaces. One hundred and twenty-seven women clerks were employed in these offices. The result of inspection may be briefly summarised as follows:— In 7 cases the offices were satisfactory and the sanitary accommodation suitable. „ 28 „ there was no separate sanitary accommodation. „ 1 case the office was dirty and there was no separate sanitary accommodation. „ 1 „ the sanitary accommodation was separate, but unsuitable. „ 1 ,, the office was insufficiently ventilated, the women's convenience was unventilated and damp, and one of the men's conveniences opened directly into the office. „ 1 „ the office was badly ventilated. „ 1 „ the office ceiling was dirty and the convenience was dirty and badly ventilated. Showing 33 cases in which action was necessary. Result of action taken:— In 18 cases separate sanitary accommodation has been provided. „ 1 case the office has been cleansed. „ 1 ,, the office ventilation has been improved. ,, 1 „ where there was no separate accommodation, the girl clerks have been moved to other premises occupied by the same firm, where there is separate sanitary accommodation. „ 12 cases the owners have undertaken to make the necessary improvements and alterations, and some of the work is now in hand. In view of the very large number of women employed in offices in the City, it may be of interest to consider the legislation bearing on the subject of sanitary accommodation in offices. So long ago as 1848, the City of London recognised the importance of this question, and in the City of London Sewers Act of that date it is enacted:— "That it shall be lawful for the Commissioners, if they shall think fit to do so, "by notice in writing to the owner or occupier of any house or building in which "persons of both sexes above twenty in number are employed, or intended to be "employed at one time in any manufacture, trade, or business, to require such 92 "owner or occupier to provide within a time to be limited in such notice, a sufficient "number of water-closets or privies for the separate use of each sex ; and if any "such owner or occupier shall neglect or refuse to comply with such notice, he shall "forfeit a sum not exceeding Twenty Pounds, and a further sum of Forty Shillings "for every day during which such neglect or refusal shall continue.'' (11 and 12 Vie., cap. 163, sec. 101.) The Public Health Act of 1875 (which did not extend to the Metropolis) has the following enactment (section 38):— "When it appears to any Local Authority by the report of their surveyor that "any house is used or intended to be used as a factory or building in which persons "of both sexes are employed or intended to be employed at one time in any "manufacture, trade, or business, the Local Authority may, if they think fit, by "written notice, require the owner or occupier of such house within the time "therein specified to construct a sufficient number of water-closets, earth-closets, "or privies and ashpits for the separate use of each sex. "Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any such notice shall be "liable for each default to a penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings for every day "during which the default is continued." This permissive clause became obligatory in the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890. Section 22.—(I.) "Every building used as a workshop or manufactory, or where "persons are employed or intended to be employed in any trade or business, "whether erected before or after the adoption of this part of this Act in any district, "shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of "sanitary conveniences, having regard to the number of persons employed in or in "attendance at such building, and also where persons of both sexes are employed, "or intended to be employed, or in attendance, with proper separate accommodation "for persons of each sex." (2) "Where it appears to an Urban Authority on the report of their surveyor "that the provisions of this section are not complied with in the case of any "building, the Urban Authority may, if they think fit, by written notice, require the "owner or occupier of any such building to make such alteration and additions "therein as may be required to give such sufficient, suitable, and proper accommo- dation as aforesaid." (3.) "Any person who neglects or refuses to comply with any such notice shall "be liable for each default to a penalty not exceeding Twenty Pounds, and to a "daily penalty not exceeding Forty Shillings.'' (4) "Where this section is in force, section thirty-eight of the Public Health "Act, 1875, shall be repealed." Adverting to London Acts we find that the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 37 (1) (3) enacts that:— "It shall not be lawful newly to erect any house or to rebuild any house pulled "down to or below the ground floor without a sufficient ashpit furnished with proper "doors and coverings, and one or more proper and sufficient water-closets, according "as circumstances may require, furnished with suitable water supply and water "supply apparatus, and with suitable trapped soil-pan and other suitable works and "arrangements, so far as may be necessary to ensure the efficient operation thereof." 93 "If at any time it appears to the Sanitary Authority that any house, whether "built before or after the commencement of this Act, is without such ashpit or "water.closet as aforesaid, the Sanitary Authority shall cause notice to be served on "the owner or occupier of the house, requiring him forthwith, or within such "reasonable time as is specified in the notice, to provide the same in accordance "with the directions of the notice; and if the notice is not complied with, the said "owner or occupier shall be liable to a fine not exceeding Five Pounds, and to a "further fine not exceeding Forty Shillings for each day during which the offence "continues; or the Sanitary Authority, if they think fit, in lieu of proceeding for "a fine, may enter the premises and execute such works as the case may require, "and may recover the expenses incurred by them in so doing from the owner of "the house." And in section 141, the expression "house" includes schools, also factories and other buildings in which persons are employed. Further, section 38 reads: — "Every factory, workshop and workplace whether erected before or after the "passing of this Act shall be provided with sufficient and suitable accommodation "in the way of sanitary conveniences, regard being had to the number of persons "employed in or in attendance at such building and also where persons of both "sexes are or are intended to be employed or in attendance with proper separate "accommodation for persons of each sex." There is no definition of the term "workplace," but in the case of Bennett v. Harding, 1900, 2 Q.B. 397, it was held that the word "workplace" is not to be limited to places where something is being manufactured or made, but includes "any place where work is done permanently, and where people "assemble together to do work permanently of some kind or other." LADIES' WAITING ROOMS AT RAILWAY STATIONS. One hundred and sixteen inspections have been made of the ladies' waiting rooms at the railway stations in the City, and the various minor defects found have been remedied. At Cannon Street (District Railway) new wash.down closets have been substituted for the old valve closets, and at Ludgate Hill a hood and flue have been fixed to the gas stove in the attendant's room. Cleansing of walls and ceilings and closet.pans, repairs to defective flushing cisterns and other fittings, &c., have been carried out at other stations. Generally speaking, there is a decided improvement in the sanitary condition of these waiting rooms. The 29 ladies' waiting rooms are distributed among the 22 railway stations as follows:— 4 ladies' rooms at Liverpool Street Station. 3 „ „ „ Fenchurch Street (Main Line). 2 ,, „ ,, Cannon Street (S.E.&C.R.). 2 „ ,, „ Holborn Viaduct. 2 „ „ „ Moorgate (Metropolitan Railway); 94 and 1 ladies' room at each of the following:— Aldersgate. Aldgate. Bank (C.L.R.). Bank (C.&S.L.R.). Bishopsgate Street. *Blackfriars. Broad Street. Cannon Street (District). Ludgate Hill. Mark Lane. Monument. Moorgate (C.&S.L.R.). Moorgate (C.&G.N.R.). Post Office. St. Paul's. Snow Hill. * Owing to alterations at Blackfriars Station the ladies' waiting room there has lately been closed. UNDERGROUND CONVENIENCES FOR WOMEN. There are at present 11 underground conveniences for women in the City situated at:— Aldersgate Street (North). Aldersgate Street (General Post Office). Circus Place (Finsbury Circus). Farringdon Street (North). Farringdon Street South (Ludgate Circus). Golden Lane. Guildhall Buildings. Holborn. Minories. Upper Thames Street (near London Bridge). West Smithfield. As mentioned in last year's Report, the Corporation decided to provide free accommodation at each convenience, in accordance with the recommendation of your Medical Officer. This was effected early in 1906, and there is now one free W.C. at each convenience, Avith the exception of Golden Lane, where three are free, and Farringdon Street South, where there are two free ones. At Circus Place one W.C. is now kept free for women in addition to the one reserved for children. The suggestions of the Medical Officer of Health with regard to the other existing free W.C's have also been carried out. Doors without inside bolts but with locks under the control of the attendants have been substituted for the doors without locks and the curtains previously in use. 95 The same system has been adopted in the case of all free conveniences. The new doors are a great improvement, and considerably aid the attendants in keeping proper order, not always an easy task. It has since been farther resolved to take steps to provide more accommodation for women in the Eastern District; and the Court of Common Council, on the 1st March, agreed to the proposal to add accommodation for women to the existing conveniences in Aldgate High Street and Bishopsgate Street Without. These are now in course of construction. COMPLAINTS. The complaints dealt with by your Women Inspectors during the year include 14 received from H.M. Inspector of Factories and 22 general complaints. The work required in respect of the complaints from the Home Office has been completed, and the result duly notified to H.M. Inspectors. One of the several complaints received necessitated the inspection of 12 shops. Four defects were found, and were referred to the District Inspectors. INFANTILE MORTALITY. During the year 1906, 341 births have been notified, 42 of these having occurred in public institutions, the parents being non.resident in the City. These cases have been notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the district to which they belong. In 19 cases the parents had removed from the addresses given before being visited. In all cases when the notification of a birth is received and the parents reside in the City, the home is visited and the mother advised as to the care and feeding of the infant. Special attention is paid to the sanitary condition of the home and notes taken as to the number of rooms occupied by the family, the number of persons living and sleeping in those rooms, whether the child sleeps with the parents or in a cot, and whether the mother goes out to work. Any sanitary defects found are handed over to the District Inspector to be dealt with. During the year 79 defects have been discovered, chiefly relating to dirty walls and ceilings (in some cases verminous), overcrowding, damp walls, and defective sanitary arrangements. The total number of visits paid during the year was 556. 96 Below is appended a copy of the card on which the particulars are entered:— (Front of Card.)

The following Table will show the methods of feeding employed, and the percentage of infants fed on the breast, cow's milk, &c.:— Methods of Feeding for First Six Months. Per cent. Breast.fed entirely 78.1 Do. and Cow's Milk 8.1 Do. and Condensed Milk 4.5 Do. and Proprietary Foods 4.8 Cow's Milk entirely 1.8 Do. and other Foods 1.8 Do. and Condensed Milk 0.9 Total 100.0 At the age of 12 months the infant is again visited, and in this way full particulars as to the feeding of the child for the first year is obtained. It was found that— 57.89 per cent. were entirely breast.fed for first nine months. 21.05 per cent. were breast.fed with the addition of other foods, such as bread and butter, soup, proprietary foods, &c., and in a few cases bits of any food partaken of by the rest of the family were being given to the child. 21.05 per cent. were not breast.fed at all, but brought up entirely by hand from birth on cow's milk principally. It is satisfactory that the percentage of infants fed on cow's milk this year is comparatively small, as it was found in several cases that the milk given to the child was obtained from a dirty and unsatisfactory general provision shop instead of from a reliable dairy. The dangers threatening a child fed on such milk is well understood when we realise the careless manner in which such milk is handled and kept stored. Even under the most rigid supervision it is almost impossible for milk stored in such shops to be kept reasonably pure. A large number of the deaths of infants each year are due to summer diarrhoea. It is a very small percentage of the babies who die from this complaint that are breast fed, the majority being infants fed on cow's milk. 98 One of the chief points to impress upon the mother when visiting is the great necessity for obtaining the milk for her baby from a reliable source, and having obtained it, to keep it stored in her home in a cool place and well covered so that it may not become contaminated by dust, &c. On visiting it has frequently been observed that the milk for the infant's use is kept in the living room in an uncovered vessel, open to pollution from flies or the dusty atmosphere. Leaflets on the care and feeding of infants have been distributed to the mothers, but it has been found that these papers, being small, frequently get mislaid or destroyed in the home. It is therefore being arranged to have the advice to mothers printed on large cards which can be hung upon the wall, and to distribute these during the coming year instead of the leaflets. A number of these cards are to be printed in the Yiddish language, as there are many mothers in the City who cannot read or speak English. Much more satisfactory results might be obtained in the work if a system of earlier registration was in force. According to the Registration Act, 1874, births must be registered within 42 days of their occurrence. The majority of births are not registered until the child is from one to two months old. Several cases have occurred where the death of the child takes place before the notification of the birth has been received. In view of the importance of the matter, the Sanitary Committee in March, 1906, on the suggestion of your Medical Officer of Health, addressed a letter to the Local Government Board, pointing out the desirability of the Board promoting legislation for reducing the time allowance for registration of birth in England and Wales from forty. two to twenty days, as obtains in Scotland. The number of deaths under 12 months during the year was 30. (For details, see Table on p. 15.) On receiving the notification of an infant's death, the home is visited and enquiries made as regards the cause of death, the feeding of the child at the time it was taken ill, and the sanitary condition of the premises. The following particulars were obtained as regards the feeding of the infant. At the time of being taken ill— 9 were breast.fed entirely. 12 were having cow's milk. 1 was partially breast.fed, also having condensed milk. 1 was fed on humanised milk. 99 Of the other seven cases two infants died at birth, and one at the age of three days. In three cases the parents had removed from the addresses given. One infant found dead—cause of death unknown. It is interesting to note that while in 1906 the birth rate in the City increased, the death rate of infants under one year declined. The figures for the two years compare as follows:— Births. 1905 302 equal 13.4 per 1,000 of the estimated population. 1906 341 „ 15.9 Deaths—Infants under One Year. 1905 42 equal 139 per 1,000 births. 1906 30 „ 88 „ „ EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES. The Court of Common Council, being the Authority for carrying out in the City the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 5 Edw. VII., cap. ccvi., on 31st May, 1906, made Bye-laws with regard to Employment Agencies, "pursuant" to Sections 47 and 53 of the said Act. A copy of these Bye-laws will be found in Appendix E. Your Women Inspectors were duly authorised, on 20th July, 1906, to carry out the provisions of Bye.laws 12,13, which deal with sleeping accommodation for women at Employment Agencies. So far no Employment Agency where accommodation or lodging is provided for women seeking employment has been registered. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901 (AMENDMENT BILL). This was a Bill for amending certain provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, relating to Laundries, and proposed that those of Religious and Charitable Institutions should be placed under supervision under certain conditions. 100 The Bill was an exact reproduction of that introduced under the same name last year, and upon which I reported in my Annual Report for 1905. It was pointed out that as the majority of those charitable institutions known to be trading in laundry work were willing to be placed under supervision, and as the object of this control was merely intended to ensure: (1) Reasonable hours of work, (2) Healthy conditions of employment, and (3) Prevention of accidents from machinery, it seemed not unreasonable to prescribe that the protection of the existing Act should be extended to the workers employed in laundries attached to Religious and Charitable Institutions. The Sanitary Committee approved this principle, and recommended that the Bill should be supported by the Corporation. The promoters subsequently allowed the Bill to be dropped, as there was no probability of its being reached during the Session. 101 THIS TABLE WAS ISSUED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD BY REQUEST OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

A further Memorandum, on the Home Work Provisions of the Factory Act, was issued to all District 104 DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS "ORDERS." There are now 581 purveyors of milk registered in the City of London under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops "Orders," as compared with 567 in 1905—an increase of 14. Ninety.eight of those on the Register are foreigners. In the course of the year the sale of milk was discontinued at 20 premises, and the owners' names removed from the Register, 34 new premises were added, and 46 changes in ownership, necessitating re.registration, occurred. The whole of the premises where milk is sold within the City are periodically and systematically inspected, and a great improvement in the conditions under which milk is sold to the consumer has been effected since the revised regulations for milkshops, &c., in the City became operative in September, 1903. In no case has there been occasion to take action owing to lack of cleanliness of vessels or utensils, and in one case only was milk found deposited in a coverless vessel; in this instance the owner's attention was directed to the matter, and a cover was at once provided. There is, however, a good deal of carelessness on the part of employes, &c., in failing to re.close the lids of milk pans after serving customers, and thereby exposing the contents of the vessels to contamination from dust and other impurity. In 28 cases of such neglect no less than 20 of the offenders were foreigners. In all cases cautionary letters were sent to the offenders. Only one case of infectious disease (scarlet fever) was notified in a shop occupied by a registered purveyor of milk. In this case there being no efficient means of isolation, the occupier was required to either remove the child (to which the parents had previously objected) or to cease the business of milk purveyor, in accordance with the Regulation No. 20 for the conduct of milk stores and milk shops, viz.: — "20.—Every purveyor of milk, or person selling milk by retail, shall, "immediately on such outbreak coming to his knowledge, remove all milk for "sale, and all utensils for containing milk for sale, from such building ; and shall "cease to keep milk for sale or to sell milk in such building until the same has "been disinfected and declared by the Medical Officer of Health for the City of "London to be free from infection." Faced with this alternative, the parents placed no further obstacles in the way of the removal of the child to hospital, where it subsequently made a good recovery. 105 ICE CREAM. Ice cream was offered for sale at 233 shops during the summer season, of this number 79 are in the hands of foreigners. In 1905 there were 249 shops, of which 85 were kept by foreigners. The 72 places in the City where ice creams are made were kept under observation during the season with a view to ensuring that the regulations with regard to its manufacture were properly carried out. Enquiries were also made respecting the conditions under which ice creams were manufactured at the 96 places in other districts supplying the article to tradesmen in the City and to itinerant vendors. In all cases the replies were satisfactory with one exception. In this case the Medical Officer of Health for Holborn reported that a person selling ice cream at No, 175, Fleet Street, manufactured it in a basement at No. 14, Great Turnstile, which was overflowing with sewage. The sale of ice cream at both premises was at once prohibited, and the proprietor was not allowed to resume the sale of ice cream until the premises in Great Turnstile were in a sanitary condition. As anticipated, it has been found that legislation with regard to the sale and manufacture of this commodity has been of considerable advantage to the public without placing undue restriction upon the traders. The co.operation with the City police has much lessened the difficulty of exercising control over itinerant vendors of ice cream, and the prosecution of those who fail to exhibit on their barrow the place of manufacture of the ice cream has had a good effect, eight of such vendors having been summoned by the City Solicitor, and fines amounting in the aggregate to £3 16s. with £2 8s. 6d. expenses imposed. No case of illness attributed to eating ice cream has been reported in the City during the year. A further decrease in the number of itinerant ice cream vendors in the Citv has to be noted. The number which had been 47 in 1903, decreasing to 37 in 1905, fell to 32 in 1906. Either the public taste for ice cream is depreciating or the sale is less profitable, as it was found that many foreigners last season had discontinued selling it. 106 The premises where ice creams are sold in the City may be classified as under, the corresponding figures for 1905 being given in italics— Number.

On the 27th November, 1906, a visit was paid to some auction rooms in Barbican and samples taken from a consignment of Essence of Beef, returned from South Africa, catalogued for public sale. Two of these samples were submitted to the Public Analyst, who, on the 6th December, certified them to contain .037 and .039 per cent. of tin respectively, equivalent to 2.59 and 2.73 grains of tin per pound. A number of these tins were then opened, and the contents found to be in an abnormal condition owing to deterioration by age and climatic influences. These facts, coupled with the large proportion of tin present rendering the material quite unfit for the purpose for which they are largely used, viz., as food for invalids, the owner was informed that the whole consignment would be seized for destruction. To this he readily assented, and the stuff was removed and destroyed as trade refuse in the usual manner. These tins were notable as showing externally no signs of decomposition, and might, therefore, have been sold in the ordinary course of business as being in sound condition. In a Report presented in November last to the Local Government Board, Dr. Buchanan directs attention to the liability of such goods to become metallically contaminated when kept for a considerable time, but in this connexion it is satisfactory to read in Dr. Buchanan's Report that" the trade "custom in this country makes it extremely unlikely that tins of Beef "Essence remain in stock on the premises of middlemen or retailers (even in "country districts) for more than a few months. Their practice of supplying "their customers with fresh material at frequent intervals appears to have "been adopted for trade convenience, and not on account of any suspicion that "the essence may become unsound if kept too long. Changes in the "appearance of meat essences, such as those observed in the samples returned "from South Africa, are said to be quite unusual in the ordinary experience "of manufacturers and retailers in this country. The firm in question has "now adopted the praiseworthy precaution of stamping the date of manu. "facture on the wrapper of every tin of meat essence which they issue. They "have also circulated to their customers information as to certain differences "in outside appearance between tins of recent manufacture and those made a "few years ago, which would enable British dealers or traders readily to "recognise essences returned from South Africa, should such be offered "to them." Dr. Schryver, who made chemical analysis of such meat essences, states in the Report referred to above: "If products of the nature of meat extracts 108 "and essences be put on the market in glass vessels, there is no reason why "they should not remain in good condition for indefinite periods, especially "when it is remembered that they can be sterilised in small bulk." A further inspection being made of the tinned goods stored on these premises a large quantity was found, when opened, to be of a very questionable character. The contents of the majority of the tins were in a state of decomposition, and all showed very considerable corrosion of the tin. These goods were advertised for sale by public auction of the 29th November. These were therefore seized, and the owners, who were apparently unaware of their condition, agreed to surrender them for destruction. Later, acting under legal advice, they withdrew their consent, and an application, therefore, was made on the 3rd December, at the Guildhall Justice Room, for an order for the destruction of the goods. At the hearing the Alderman adjourned the case for four days in order that a detailed inspection should be made of the whole consignment. At the further hearing on the 7th December, an order was made for the condemnation and destruction of 12,833 tins containing the following material:— 554 tins of Melton pork pies. 12,685 tins brought forward. 1,595 „ Blue.back fish. 6 tins of Roast turkey. 9,304 „ Choice tripe. 32 „ Curried rabbit. 697 „ Jugged hare. 8 „ Roast duck. 105 „ Apple pie. 13 „ Sheep's tongue. 256 „ Apple pudding. 21 „ Camp breakfast. 80 „ Lobster. 8 „ Duck in jelly. 5 „ Turkey. 6 „ Chicken in jelly. 4 „ Roast chicken. 6 „ Brawn. 25 „ King Cole pudding. 1 „ Cow.heel. 6 „ Roast goose. 7 „ Calves' cheek. 37 „ Miners' lunch. 5 „ Beef sausages. 6 „ Goose. 13 „ Rabbit and bacon. 11 „ Roast fowl. 23 „ Various vegetables. 12,685 tins carried forward. 12,833 tins. The importer of these goods stated that they formed part of a quantity of surplus military stores from South Africa, some of which were in this country and some in course of transit. Information was at once given to the Medical Officer of Health for the Port of London and the Metropolitan Borough of Bermondsey, where some was supposed to be stored. The importer further stated that he held a certificate from the Medical Officer of Health from Pretoria that any unsound tins had been destroyed under the supervision of this officer, also that the sale was direct from the Military Authorities, payment having been made by cheque direct to the chief accountant at Bloemfontein or Pretoria. 109 The goods were sold "with all faults and errors of description and without question on the part of the buyer," and the purchaser, therefore, had no guarantee as to their soundness. An account of this seizure having been published in the public Press, the following letter appeared in the Daily Teleg7'aph of the 7th December:— "TINNED MEAT SEIZURE. " To the Editor of ' The Daily Telegraph.'' " Sir, "Referring to the article in your issue of to-day respecting certain tinned "meats condemned by the City of London Authorities, we beg to point out that the "statement that these goods formed a portion of surplus Army stores purchased by "us from the Government in Pretoria is incorrect. "We believe that most of the goods in question were purchased from the "National Bank of South Africa in London, and are not connected in any way with "the surplus stocks purchased by our Company from the Government in Pretoria. "We shall be glad if you will kindly publish this letter, as we would like it to "be distinctly understood that all the surplus stocks purchased by us from the "Government were examined by the Medical Officer of Health at the various depots "in South Africa, under instructions from the chief office in Pretoria, and none but "perfectly sound goods were delivered to us by the Military Authorities. "Yours faithfully, "p.p. Maisel Bros, and Co. (Ltd.), " L. Prechner, Secretary. "62, London Wall, " December 6th" Upon enquiry at the Bank referred to the following disclaimer was received:— "It should be remarked that the documents for a portion of these "goods were attached to Bills drawn by a South African firm on a "London House: that these Bills being in the hands of the National "Bank of South Africa, Limited, the latter were not directly concerned "in the matter beyond that proceeds of the goods sold under their "instructions through an intermediary, were applied by them in "reduction of the Bills in question." As in the case of the meat essence before referred to, these tins showed no external indication of the dangerous nature of their contents. The auctioneers, who in this case had themselves purchased the tins in question, advertised them for sale in perfect good faith. In this connection a question was asked in the House of Commons on the 6th December, 1906, when the President of the Local Government Board was 110 asked whether the facts as reported in the Press with regard to the seizure of unsound tinned food returned from South Africa were correct, and what steps would be taken to prevent a recurrence. 1 he question was answered in the affirmative by the responsible Minister, who added that: "Where possible, steps have been taken to obtain such "action as local authorities have been able to take to deal with the matter. "Moreover, inquiries are being made regarding other foodstuffs returned "from South Africa. Further legislation, however, of the kind contemplated "by the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Bill, now before Parliament,* "is necessary to guard effectively against the introduction of consignments "of unsound food." In view of the statement that the goods were sold by the Military Authorities, the Sanitary Committee addressed a communication to the Army Council, asking for information as to whether any survey had been made before sale to ensure that none but wholesome tins should be disposed of; and what other steps had been taken, or are being taken, to protect the public health by preventing the importation of unsound food. Dr. Charles Porter, Medical Officer of Health for Johannesburg, South Africa, in his Report for the year ending the 30th June, 1906, also refers to the sale of unsound tinned food by the Army Authorities. In some notes on canned foods Dr. Porter states :— "Enormous quantities of Army canned food remained over at the "close of the war in June, 1902, and an immense amount is imported "from England, America and Germany. Much of the Army surplus "was sold cheap by auction, apparently without guarantee as to quality, "and fell into the hands of persons who disposed of it at a low price to "coloured people. ... A vast quantity of tinned fish, meat, and "meat extract, and a lesser amount of vegetables and fruits, have since " been condemned." Two other parcels of returned tinned foods were subsequently dealt with last year. In one case, 4,512 tins of Christmas puddings, which were part of a parcel of 100 cases each containing 48 tins, were the subject of enquiry. Of these, 94 cases were found to be sound, the remainder having been condemned and destroyed as unfit for food by the Port Sanitary Authority. In another instance a case of tinned soup was implicated. The owner stated it was a sample returned from South Africa "to see what he could do "with them, and that if they were satisfactory there were several hundred "cases to come over." * This Bill was not proceeded with in 1906, but was re.introduced in February of this year. 111 A chemical analysis of the contents of samples sent to the Public Analyst showed them to contain considerable quantities of tin. Upon the owner being informed of the facts, he consented to sign an order for their destruction as "trade refuse." It was subsequently ascertained that this sample case had proved part of a consignment arriving at the Port of London from South Africa on the 14th December, which had been landed at a riverside wharf within the jurisdiction of the Stepney Borough Council. Samples were submitted by the Medical Officer of Health of that district to the local public analyst, who also found evidence of metallic poisoning by tin, and the sale of the goods was consequently forthwith prohibited. Precisely the same occurrence of metallic contamination of tinned food sold by the Army was experienced by the Sanitary Authorities in South Africa. Again quoting from the Report previously referred to, Dr. Porter writes:— "The sale by the Army people of 15,000 tins of Oxo to a Johannes. "burg dealer also gave rise to difficulty. Practically all the tins were "' blown' and corroded, and some were leaking; but in about 7 5 per "cent. there was little, if any, obvious change in the contents, owing, "presumably, to the amount of salt used in preparation. Five per cent. "(750) of the tins were picked out, and the contents of 30 of these were "examined at the Government Laboratory. Tin equal to 0.33 per cent. "of contents (or about 1.9 grains of oxide of tin to the ounce) was "found in all, and a variable amount of copper in 16 of these. Another "100 tins were emptied, the contents thoroughly mixed, and a fair "sample taken therefrom was found to contain 0.22 per cen. of tin. ''Although there is some question as to the noxiousness of copper and "tin in small quantities, it was felt that the public should get the benefit "of any possible doubt, and that under all the circumstances of the case "it would not be right to pass this consignment, which was accordingly "condemned, with the knowledge and approval of the military medical "authorities." This is a further illustration of the danger arising from the sale of surplus food supplies that have not been properly surveyed. 112 MEAT SUPPLIES AT THE CENTRAL MEAT MARKET. Deliveries of meat to the Central Market again show an advance, the total of 421,927 tons being 6,012 in excess of any previous year's record, but, satisfactory as it is to find the current of trade still flowing so freely in its accustomed channel, it is to be feared that the increased weight consisted chiefly of second and third class meat, and that there has been, if not an absolute decrease, at least no increase in the tonnage of best meat sent to Smithfield. This view will be confirmed by an examination of the Table on p. 125 showing the variations from the different sources of supply. It will be seen that there is a decrease in the home.grown, and also in American meat killed in this country, which two classes comprise most of the best meat, the increase being in Australasian and North and South American dead meat, from which sources those butchers who sell low.priced meats are mostly supplied ; thus the figures confirm the opinion, expressed by a careful observer, that the feature of the year has been an abundance of meat somewhat poor in character. That this not altogether satisfactory condition of things will continue seems more than probable; the increase both in population and wealth in the United States goes on a rapid rate, and the consequent use of an increasing proportion of their own agricultural productions has brought home to their graziers the necessity for adopting the most up.to.date methods of forcing their cattle, so as to bring them out as beef at an early age; consequently, during the autumn, we have seen at the Foreign Cattle Market, Deptford, very fine animals, which have never been allowed to lose their calf flesh, having, in fact, been fed for beef from the moment they were born, and finally fattened and ready for slaughter at 20 to 22 months old, thus emulating the finest practical achievement of the British agriculturists. It is evident that this is not done without care and expense, and that animals so prepared ("works of art," to use the words of a well.known Norfolk feeder) cannot be sold at the same rate as those which have run about the prairies and ranches until they have become beef, and which if they have lived longer have cost but little in preparation; and it is significant as showing that the food of the American citizen is no longer that which comes without an effort, but they have to use the best scientific means of increasing the supply for their own consumption, the portion sent to this country being merely what they do not want for themselves. The moral of all this, from one point of view, is that the United States beef is of good quality and too expensive an article to be dumped on the English market regardless of price, and we have heard of carcase butchers buying home.grown cattle "because Americans were so dear; "the reverse side of the picture being that if this high standard of quality was not maintained the meat would, if sent alive, be in competition with Canadian ranch cattle, or, if sent dead, classed with Argentine, in either of which cases the price would not be remunerative. 113 It must not be inferred from this that there is any sign of an era of dearer meat close at hand; the Canadian supply has again been heavy, though it can hardly be said there has been much improvement in quality, there have been various indications that we shall ere long have an importation of Canadian beef so large as to make us independent of the United States. Meanwhile, all the world seems anxious to sell us beef, one Company, consisting largely of English carcase butchers, is formed to import cattle from Roumania, while another, got up by persons who appear to be authorities in Mexico, proposes to send us chilled beef from thence, and professes its ability to supply us at a cheaper rate than Argentine, pointing out also that its productions should arrive in better condition, as the sea journey is so much shorter. It would be premature at present to say anything as to either of these, but the names of those who "make things go" appear in connection with both, and it seems by no means unlikely that both the above.named sources of supply will form the subject of comment in next year's Report. The further diminution in the proportion of home.grown meat passing through the Central Market referred to above makes the ratio approximately one part of British to four of foreign, or rather sea.borne meat, and even this does not represent the whole of the facts, inasmuch as many large customers are now supplied with foreign produce from the Cold Air Stores or direct from the ship. This condition of things may well furnish a subject for the thoughtful, and it is devoutly to be hoped some means will be devised of galvanising our home producers into activity before home.grown meat has become a negligible factor in the London Market. The Canadian cattle have been mostly large framed animals, "ranch trotters," not well made up nor overburdened with quality, yet furnishing a lot of nutritious food, and, on account of the small proportion of fat, free from the objection of " wastefulness." It would scarcely be possible in this Report to avoid some reference to the scare caused early in the year by the publication of some "blood.thrilling" statements as to the condition of things existing in the American stockyards and slaughterhouses, especially as, in order to reassure the British public, an exhaustive enquiry was made by the Local Government Board, who naturally commenced their inquiries at the Central Market, as the greatest emporium of the meat trade in this country'. United States produce comes on the London market in the form of hind and forequarters of beef, chilled, to which little objection can be taken; the quality is ''fair to good," the condition almost invariably good, and the evidences of health in the live subject too palpable to be called in question, but most of the other productions have to be taken largely on trust, as the conditions under which they are sent scarcely admit the possibility of any inspection worth the name on this side of the ocean: these are pigs frozen hard so that the inspector cannot examine them; they 114 are wrapped in a cloth which usually bears either the label or stamp of inspection in the United States, the value of which is at present unknown. They also send pork loins, pork cuttings, ox tails and tongues, pig and ox kidneys and livers, sheep and lambs' plucks, all of which are packed into boxes while soft, frozen hard, shipped here, and sold to the retailer, like the pigs, in a frozen state and generally without the boxes being opened, though it is only fair to say that the objection to the opening often comes from the retailer, who wants to present his goods to the public as fresh as possible; boneless chucks are the greater part of the forequarter of beef, the bones removed, the soft mass packed into boxes and frozen hard, in which state it is sold to sausage. makers, keepers of cheap restaurants and others; chopped sausage.meat has come in small quantities, also a compound cooked sausage. All these bear the United States label of inspection, the value of which has been already reported upon, but there is no possibility of a thorough inspection in this country. Chilled Argentine beef has been coming in larger quantities than ever, and with such regularity that any break in the supply, as a day or two delay owing to a sea fog, will seriously affect the whole trade of the market. The time occupied in transit is so severe a strain on the keeping qualities of the meat and the tendency to rapid deterioration after leaving the refrigerator, if at all out of condition, so great, that from the first your officers have felt it incumbent on them to be somewhat strict in the inspection of this meat. Subsequent experience has confirmed the necessity of this course, the result being the adoption to a greater degree of the facilities afforded by the mail and other faster steamers, and the consequent arrival of the meat in better condition, the ultimate result thus being that the importer benefits by the rigid inspection. The supply of New Zealand mutton and beef continues the "even tenor of its way" almost without incident, and Australian meat is again reasserting its rights to a place on the market. The system of grading has been brought so far into touch with English ideas and requirements as to make it both safe and easy for dealers to give large buyers orders on the Cold Air Stores for what they may chance to require, and there is no denying the economy of the practice, as cartage and market tolls are both saved, as well as the loss of condition consequent upon exposure in the market, but it opens up the question as to whether Meat Inspectors should not be afforded by law some greater control, and also whether the owners of these Cold Air Stores should not be required to take out a licence annually as is the case with slaughterhouses. An increasing number of pigs have come from Australia; these, as a rule, were very good, but some parcels in the early part of the year were imperfect. Pigs have also come from Argentina, many of which proved to be tuberculous; and in small numbers from Russia. Danish pigs have been few in number, and during the latter part of the year usually conspicuous by their absence; and of Dutch pigs there has also been a diminished supply. Considering the high prices realised for those sent, this points to the conclusion that much of the meat from both the last named countries has gone to make good the shortage in Germany. We are informed that a Bill has passed the Netherlands 115 Parliament making compulsory the inspection and labelling of all meat exported from that country, but it is not yet in operation. The necessity for very stringent regulations as to the movement of pigs which may convey the virus of swine fever, combined with the rigid inspection for Tuberculosis, has had the effect of still further reducing the pig stock of this country by 100,000 —a deplorable fact, as the pig plays so important a part in the live stock of the smallest farmers; moreover, the case seems so far one without a remedy, as manifestly the stringency must not be relaxed. We can only strive on, hoping that the scientists who are now engaged in making experiments and studying the details of these diseases may eventually discover some means of stopping their ravages. A separate account has been kept of seizures on account of Tuberculosis during the year ; these are as follows : — 2,506 pigs weighing 103,851 lbs. 2 sides 8 quarters Beef „ 2,134 lbs. 4 pieces 3 calves „ 265 lbs. 3 pigs' heads sent without) the carcases 2 sides bacon „ 60 lbs. Total 47 tons 9 cwts. 2 qrs. 9 lbs. One good feature for the British farmer is the condition of the mutton trade, which, for the best sheep, has been good throughout the year, and bids fair in the one on which we are entering to be as good, if not better. The seizures of meat from all causes have amounted to 1,916 tons 13 cwts. 0 qrs. 16 lbs., a decrease of 212 tons from last year; this is attributable in a large degree to the greater care in the preparation and transit of Argentine meat. Some idea of the magnitude of the work may be formed from the fact that it was comprised in 42,113 seizures, of which the attention of the Inspector was called in 13,094 cases, or about 31 per cent. A Report by your Medical Officer as to the sufficiency of the Inspectorial Staff to discharge the duties cast upon it was presented in August last, with the result that it has been decided to relieve the Wharf Inspector of that portion of his work which was done at the Central Market and the riverside Cold Stores, and to appoint three Assistant Inspectors; these, with a rearrangement of the work, will add greatly to the efficiency of the staff for the present, but the work is still growing. The foundation stone of another Market section has been laid, and it is clear that if there is any one subject in which more than in any other it is imperative that we should keep abreast, or, if possible, ahead of the times, it is that which concerns the public health. 116 The Wharves and Cold Air Stores have been kept under systematic inspection, the necessity for so doing being obvious, and the result encouraging. The following naval officers have reported themselves at the Inspectors' Office, Central Market, for instruction in meat examination, in accordance with orders from Whitehall, viz.: One Deputy Store Officer, eight Fleet Paymasters, four Staff Paymasters, nine Paymasters, and four Assistant Paymasters, to all of whom the Certificate of Competency has been granted. There have been seven prosecutions against senders of bad meat to the City markets ; of these, two were dismissed, and in the other five convictions were obtained. (See Table on page 129.) MEAT INSPECTION. The question of Meat Inspection has been largely under consideration by the Sanitary Committee during the year. The chief points that have been discussed are as follows:— I. The Inspection and Marking of Foreign and Colonial Meat imported into this country. II. Tuberculosis in Pork and Dr. Buchanan's Report thereon to the Local Government Board. III. The Tuberculosis (Animals) Prevention and Compensation Bill. IV. Meat Inspection in the Central Meat Markets. V. The conveyance of Meat to and from the Markets. I.—THE INSPECTION AND MARKING OF FOREIGN AND COLONIAL MEAT IMPORTED INTO THIS COUNTRY. II.—TUBERCULOSIS IN PORK AND Dr. BUCHANAN'S REPORT TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD. With regard to Nos. I. and II., it is convenient here to deal with these two subjects together. A considerable quantity of foreign and colonial meat supplies at the Central Markets bears a label or mark, indicating that it has undergone inspection before being exported to this country. 117 This applies at present to meat coming from the following countries :— Argentine Republic. Holland. Belgium. New Zealand. Denmark. United States of America. A Bill for enforcing the inspection and marking of meat intended for export was read a first time in the House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada on the 12th December, 1906. In November last, on my recommendation, the Sanitary Committee decided that the whole question of the inspection and marking of foreign and colonial meat should be the subject of a detailed investigation, for the following reason. Having had occasion to report upon the nature of the inspection carried out in Belgium, Denmark and Holland, full particulars of the regulations in force in these countries were procured, and representations made from time to time to the authorities concerned on the Continent with a view to a revision of their regulations, so as to bring those applying to meat intended for export to this country into line with the recommendation of our Royal Commission on Tuberculosis of the 4th April, 1898. So far as Denmark and Holland are concerned, the authorities there have made regulations that are now in complete agreement with the recommendation of the English Commission, including those relating to pigs. With regard to Belgium, however, up to the present no assurance has been received that their Government will take similar action, and an illustration of the necessity for the inquiry referred to above is shown by the fact that the labels on pigs imported here from that country is valueless as an indication of the freedom from Tuberculosis in the carcase and organs. Respecting the nature of the inspection of meat coming from the United States of America, the Consul.General for that country was kind enough tc place at my disposal a copy of the Code of Regulations governing meat inspection now is force issued by the Department of Agriculture. These are of comparatively recent date, and have in all probability been brought about in consequence of the disclosures with regard to the stockyards of Chicago, with which everyone is familiar. These Regulations are made under the Meat Inspection Amendment Act of the 30th June, 1906, but on referring to those relating to Tuberculosis in Swine, it appears that the American Government does not require such a high standard of quality as obtains in England, and this again is a matter that calls for further enquiry. Much disturbance of the pig trade has taken place owing to the spread of Tuberculosis amongst swine in later years. So acute did the matter become that the Local Government Board directed one of their Medical Staff to investigate and report on administration in London with regard to meat of pigs affected with that disease. 118 Dr. Buchanan, the Expert selected for this purpose, reported very fully upon the matter in a Blue Book issued in January, 1906. Trade Associations, representing the interests concerned, also sent deputations to the Sanitary Committee of the Corporation, and stated the case from their point of view, pointing out the disadvantages under which members of their Associations labour, owing to the want of co.ordination amongst the several Authorities dealing with the subject of Tuberculosis throughout the country. It must be remembered that the relations between human and animal Tuberculosis has for some time past been under the consideration of a Royal Commission. This Commission was specially appointed for the purpose on the 31st August, 1901, and submitted an interim Report upon the subject, dated the 16th May, 1904. This Report was made owing to the striking results obtained from the experiments conducted under their directions. It stated that the Commission had arrived at the conclusion that tubercle of human origin can give rise in the bovine animal to Tuberculosis identical with the ordinary bovine Tuberculosis, and that it therefore indicated that it would be most unwise to frame or modify legislative measures in accordance with the view that human and bovine tubercle bacilli are specifically different from each other, and that the disease caused by one is wholly different from the disease caused by the other, as asserted by Professor Koch at the London Congress on Tuberculosis in July, 1901. In view of this authoritative pronouncement, those responsible for the well. being of the community are bound to carry out to the letter the instructions of the Local Government Board with regard to Tuberculosis in meat, and especially in pork. As there was reason to believe that in some cases persons in the country, who—either through carelessness or ignorance of the appearance of the disease in living animals, or the indications of disease in carcases after slaughter—had consigned tuberculous pork to the City Markets, the Corporation, in March, 1903, directed the issue of a circular describing in detail the signs of Tuberculosis in the carcase and organs and also the symptoms in the living animal. The former were drawn up by your Medical Officer, and the latter by Mr. James King, Veterinary Inspector to the Corporation. Upwards of 6,800 of these circulars were sent out, of which 3,050 were supplied in response to written applications to the Town Clerk for further copies, and since then a very large number of copies have been supplied to those interested in the question. The salesmen in the Central Meat Market are also supplied, upon application, with copies to send to their customers in the country, and there can now be little or no excuse for raising the plea of ignorance, and until the Local 119 Government Board expresses some other view as to how your advisers should act, their recommendations must be carried out in their entirety, especially at such an important trading centre as the market under your control at Smithfield. There is no reason whatever, and no argument has been brought forward that will in any way warrant your relaxing the existing procedure, and in this connection it is well to remember that the Corporation has from time to time been attacked by outside Authorities for not carrying out the recommendations more stringently.* III.—TUBERCULOSIS (ANIMALS) PREVENTION AND COMPENSATION RILL. This was a Private Bill, that proposed to give compensation to the extent of two.thirds of the value to the owner in cases of animals found to be tuberculous after slaughter. Half this compensation was to be paid by the Local Authority of the district where the animal is slaughtered, and the other half out of monies voted by Parliament. It was proposed that the Sanitary Authority where the animal is slaughtered should be reimbursed by the Authority where the animal was fed, unless it could be shown that the latter were carrying out proper regulations with regard to the keeping of animals. There were three main objections to the Bill. In the first place it would have been unworkable on account of the difficulty of adjusting disputes between Sanitary Authorities. Secondly, every case of seizure for Tuberculosis would have to be heard before a Magistrate, and in the City this would involve a daily hearing at the Guildhall. Thirdly, the Local Authorities would have been empowered by the Bill to make Bye.laws at variance with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis previously referred to. * The Second Interim Report of the Royal Commission appointed to enquire into the relations of human and animal tuberculosis, issued while this Report is in the Press, has fully established the identity of human and bovine tuberculosis, and therefore the possibility of infection of man from tuberculous meat. This emphasises the importance of not countenancing any relaxation of the existing restrictions in dealing with tuberculous meat, and the recommendations of the Local Government Board on this point must remain as the standard by which meat in this country must be judged. There is now no room for any difference of action, and want of uniformity can only arise if this standard is not adopted, or is modified in any detail as the result of individual opinion, for which at present there is no justification. The standard may, or may not be altered hereafter, but in the meantime the only reasonable course is to accept it absolutely. 120 One argument in favour of giving compensation with regard to pigs is that it is difficult in the early stages of Tuberculosis to detect the disease in the living animal, and that in consequence a dealer buying a pig for slaughter may be subject to a heavy loss, but this argument practically applies to all trades, risks of a similar nature being unavoidable. The Bill never reached a second reading, being dropped by the promoters. IV.—MEAT INSPECTION AT THE CENTRAL MEAT MARKETS. The Sanitary Committee dealt generally with the question of meat inspection in a Report presented by me on the 25th June last, when the following Resolutions were agreed to, and laid before the Court of Common Council on the 28th of the same month, when it was ordered to be printed, and the consideration adjourned:— "Recommendations of Sanitary Committee. "(1) The necessity of forthwith promoting legislation for the com"pulsory inspection, at the time of slaughter, of all animals (together "with the viscera) intended for the food of man,. as the only reliable "system for the protection of the public, and ensuring such inspection "being made by a Veterinary Surgeon or other recognised expert. "(2) That all meat found free from disease after such inspection shall "be officially stamped. "(3) That all foreign meat be required to comply with the same "standard as that of home.killed meat, and that the Government should "be responsible for the maintenance of such standard." "(4) That, with regard to boxed and boned fresh meat, arrangements "should be made for the exclusion from the United Kingdom of any "class of meat which is packed in such a way as to prevent inspection "or the possibility of the detection of disease, or which contravenes the "recommendations of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis ; and "(5) That the Report of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis "should be issued at the earliest possible date." At the Court of Common Council held on the 26th July, No. 5 was agreed to, and the debate further adjourned with respect to the remaining recommendations. At the resumption of the debate on the 20th September, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were agreed to. On the consideration of a further recommendation that in the opinion of the Committee public abattoirs should be provided and private slaughterhouses be abolished, the Court did not express any opinion, the Previous Question being moved and carried. With regard to this latter recommendation, it should be noted that Dr. Buchanan in his report strongly favoured the provision of: public 121 Abattoirs, and the principle has been confirmed by the London County Council and twenty.five Metropolitan Borough Councils. It is also recommended in the Report of the Royal Commission on Humane Slaughtering. The Royal Sanitary Institute, the National Health Society, the Humanitarian League, and other bodies have also supported this principle, and in my own opinion, the substitution of public for private slaughterhouses is essential to any system for the proper and efficient inspection of meat. One of the obvious objections to private slaughterhouses is that slaughtering of animals takes place in them at all hours, and it is therefore impossible to properly supervise them. So far back as 1900 the Corporation came to the decision that slaughtering in the City should cease, and it was at that time referred to the Sanitary Committee to consider and report as to the best means of getting rid of the existing slaughterhouses at Aldgate. Since that time five slaughterhouses have been closed, and there are now only eight remaining. In support of their views, the Corporation have recently decided to abolish the private slaughterhouses at the Market under their control at Islington, and are now erecting in their place a public Abattoir on the most approved system. This new departure offers a very favourable opportunity for the Corporation to institute a system of marking all meat slaughtered there that is found by their Inspectors to be wholesome, and is a step that would in all probability be followed by every Municipality alive to modern requirements where the public health is concerned. What can be carried out in our Colonies—Canada for instance—can be equally well done, if not better, in this country, and although one may expect to meet with strenuous opposition on the part of the Trade, I have little doubt that in the end common sense would prevail, and the interests of the consumer be studied rather than that of the trader. Interests of British Cattle Breeders considered. The foregoing suggestion will, if adopted, greatly promote the interests of British agriculturists. Anything that is likely to be of practical assistance to a declining industry should receiVe the most careful consideration, and there seems to be good reason to suppose that the public would be more likely to give the preference to English beef bearing a mark that is not only a guarantee that it was British produce, but also conclusive proof of its having been inspected at the time of slaughter. That British farmers are in need of such encouragement is shown in the rapid decline that is taking place in the amount of both country and town killed meat. It will be seen from the Table on page 125 that the proportion of British country.killed meat delivered at the Central Markets has fallen from 22.7 per cent. in 1903 to 17.2 per cent. in 1906, while that of British town.killed has declined from 6.8 per cent. in 1903 to 3.4 in 1906. There is every indication that the practice of official inspection and marking of meat intended for export by foreign and colonial competitors to this country 122 Will increase, and the English pig breeder's business has already been seriously affected by the import from the Continent of carcases of pigs so marked. As before stated, when the new abattoirs are established at the Metropolitan Cattle Market at Islington, the Corporation will be afforded an exceptional opportunity of dealing with the proposition of marking meat. If put into effect it could do no possible harm by causing any disturbance of trade, and the cost will be practically nothing. When the public became aware of the true significance of the mark on pork, it is only reasonable to believe that such meat would be in demand. V. THE CONVEYANCE OF MEAT TO AND FROM THE CITY MARKETS. Special attention has been directed to this matter, and one of the Sanitary Inspectors was detailed to make daily observations as to the conditions under which supplies were transported both to and from the market. In only one case out of over 2,000 carts that came under observation was the carman seen to be sitting on the meat. The owners having been written to, at once gave instructions that will obviate any further ground for complaint. A large number of vans employed by meat carriers are tilt vans with curtains back and front to enclose the entire contents of the vehicle. Unless these curtains are properly drawn and securely fastened, the meat cannot be said to be properly protected from dust and other impurities, and in every case when this has been neglected, the owners have been written to. This has involved very considerable correspondence, and it is satisfactory to note that in nearly all cases the owners have undertaken to see that this essential precaution is not neglected. A noticeable improvement in this respect has been observed, and taken generally it may be safely said that, in the absence of compulsory powers to compel carriers to transport food supplies in vehicles of special construction, cases of abuse in this respect are now comparatively rare. In Dublin the Sanitary Authority have power to make bye.laws, inter alia, with regard to the conveyance of carcases through public streets. Bye.law 21, made under the Towns Improvement Act, 1847, the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and the Dublin Corporation Act, runs as follows:— "Every carcase, or portion of a carcase of meat conveyed through the "public thoroughfares shall be conveyed in a properly constructed cart "or other suitable vehicle, and shall be properly covered and not "exposed to view." The Irish are to be congratulated upon their good sense in securing power to make such a reasonable bye.law, and the sooner their example is followed elsewhere the better it will be for the public. One other point in connection with meat conveyance remains to be noted, viz., the condition and construction of some of the refrigerating vans used in the carriage of meat. That these are not all that might be desired is shown in the Report for 1905 of the Intelligence Division of the Board of 123 Agriculture and Fisheries. In this Report a case is particularly referred to in which some carcases of mutton, conveyed by rail from the North to Leadenhall Market by a well.known breeder in Eastern Ross, had been damaged in transit by dirt and dust. It is evident that such must occur from time to time unless the vans employed are of a suitable type, and this is a matter to which the railway companies should direct their attention. STORAGE AND REMOVAL OF CONDEMNED MEAT. A new departure was made in 1906 in the abolition of the large slate tanks at the meat shed at the western end of the Market in which the condemned material was immersed pending its removal to the contractor. These receptacles had been in use for many years, but experience had shown that they involved much expenditure in time and labour in the amount of handling their use requires in the transfer from the tanks to the meat carts. The present modification of the old system is the result of a full consideration of the matter by the City Engineer and myself, and consists in the substitution of horse.drawn wheeled iron tank vans for the fixed slate tanks in the meat sheds. The condemned meat will be placed into these iron receptacles treated with preservatives and denaturalised. When filled, they will be horsed and taken direct to the contractor's works. Two of these tank vans are already in use, and two more have been ordered. When the latter are delivered the old slate tanks will be removed and the new system will be in operation.

During the year 1,030 articles of food and drugs were analysed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, 1875 to 1899.

In spite of the efforts made in the City during the last six years to stop the adulteration of milk, a point appears to have been reached which fixes 135 the proportion of permanent adulteration at about 7.6 per cent. of the milk sold. This is indicated by the following figures:- Year. No. of Samples Examined. Found Genuine. Found Adulterated. Percentage of Adulteration. 1901 392 209 83 21.2 1902 599 519 80 13.3 1903 517 457 60 11.6 1904 452 417 35 7.7 1905 481 445 36 7.5 1906 556 513 43 7.7 The Metropolis (1905) 10.9 From this it is evident that a class of trader exists that no reasonable amount of supervision will suppress, and experience has shown that they are also quick to take advantage of what are known as the "warranty" clauses in the existing Adulteration Acts. As shown above, 43 cases of milk adulteration were certified, but many of them were taken informally, and in respect of these no proceedings could be instituted, while in several instances your Solicitor advised that a caution would meet the case. Twenty-three milk prosecutions were instituted during the year. Of these, three were dismissed owing to proof of warranty—in one case the exhibition of a notice was found sufficient disclosure that the milk was not sold as genuine, in another instance the summons was dismissed upon technical grounds, and in each of the remaining 18 cases a conviction was recorded. In three of the latter the offenders had been previously convicted for similar offences. In the case of sample No. 950, 32 per cent. of fat had been abstracted. This was a third conviction, and entailed a fine of £5 and 12s. 6d. expenses. With respect to sample No. 964, where a similar amount of fat abstraction had taken place, the offender was mulcted in £2 and 12s. 6d. expenses, this being his second offence. Another second offender who had added 7 per cent. of water had reason to think himself somewhat fortunate in being fined 5s. and 18s. 6d. costs. With regard to the remainder—all first offenders—the penalties imposed varied from £10 and 13s. 6d. expenses to an order to pay 17s. 6d. expenses asked for by the prosecution. As to the relation between place of purchase and amount of milk adulteration the following figures are not without interest:- Where taken. No. of Samples taken. No. Adulterated. Percentage of Adulteration. At shops 439 32 7.3 In the street 73 7 9.6 During delivery 44 4 9.1 Total 556 43 7.7 136 In no less than 123, or 21 per cent., of the 581 registered milk shops in the City a notice is exhibited which protects the vendor from the consequences of selling a sophisticated article of food on the statutory grounds that he has made a sufficient disclosure of the nature of the same under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875. In all cases it is a question of fact whether the disclosure is sufficient or otherwise to protect the vendor, but a card exhibited in some part of the shop bearing an inscription to the following effect has been found generally a bar to taking action in cases of adulteration:— "Milk Notice. "We purchase all milk sold under a warranty of its purity and "genuine quality, and take all possible precautions to ensure its supply "to our customers in proper condition, but we are unable to guarantee it "as either new, pure, or with all its cream, and to meet the requirements "of the Food and Drugs Acts do not, therefore, sell it as such." The importance of ensuring that milk—especially that intended for the use of children—should be of unquestionable purity has long been insisted upon by responsible advisers in public health matters, and some observations on the relations between milk and disease in human beings will be found on page 22 in the section of this Report dealing with the subject of contaminated milk. PRESERVATIVES IN MILK. On 11th July, 1906, the Local Government Board issued a circular letter urging Sanitary Authorities to adopt the recommendations of the Departmental Committee appointed in July, 1899, by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, to enquire into the use of preservatives and colouring matter in the preservation and colouring of foods. Attention was directed to the recommendations of this Committee in my Annual Report for 1901, a Report to the Sanitary Committee in September, 1904, and also in my Annual Report for that year. The Departmental Committee, in the course of their enquiry, heard much evidence on the subject of preservatives in milk, and from that given by milk traders, were satisfied that the addition of preservatives to milk was quite unnecessary, as there was evidence to show that a very large number of milk vendors conducted their business without the use of these substances, even when the milk came long distances by train. There appearing to be some differences of opinion amongst local authorities as to whether the use of preservatives should be permissible or not, the Local Government Board were strongly of opinion that the time had come when the recommendations of the Departmental Committee should be adopted generally. 137 With regard to milk and milk products, the Departmental Committee made the following recommendations:— "(b.) That the use of any preservative or colouring matter whatever in milk "offered for sale in the United Kingdom be constituted an offence under the Sale of "Food and Drugs Acts. "(c.) That the only preservative which it shall be lawful to use in cream be boric "acid or mixtures of boric acid and borax, and in amount not exceeding 0.25 per "cent. expressed as boric acid. The amount of such preservative to be notified by "a label upon the vessel. "(d.) That the only preservative permitted to be used in butter and margarine "be boric acid or mixtures of boric acid and borax, to be used in proportions not "exceeding 0.5 per cent. expressed as boric acid. The Local Government Board suggested in their circular letter of 11th July, 1906, that Public Analysts should be requested— "(a) To record in their quarterly reports how many milk samples have been "examined during the quarter, with a view to ascertaining the presence of substances "commonly in use as preservatives, and with what result; and to draw the attention "of the Council to instances where the use of preservatives in milk, other than the "boron preservatives and formalin, have come under notice. "(b) To report, on completion of analysis, the facts as to samples of milk which "have been found to contain any added preservative." With a view of ascertaining to what extent preservatives were used in milk and cream sold in the City, the Public Analyst was asked to report as to their presence or otherwise in 100 samples. Of these, 94 were milk and 6 cream. Only 7 of the milks, or 7.4 per cent., were found to contain preservatives, a small quantity of boracic acid being the agent employed in each instance. Boracic acid was present in all the samples of cream, but in only one case was the amount found to be in excess of the limit—0.25 per cent.—suggested by the Departmental Committee on the use of Preservatives in Cream. This instruction of the Local Government Board as to prohibiting the use of preservatives in milk appears, however commendable in other respects, to be ultra vires. The recommendations of the Departmental Committee on Preservatives have no legal value, and the only authority at the present time having statutory power to make regulations with regard to milk products is the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and on this point I reported to the Sanitary Committee in September, 1904, to the following effect:— "The Local Government Board have no power to make regulations of this nature, "this being a matter that the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries alone has power 138 "to deal with. The latter authority can act, while the Local Government Board "can only give an expression of opinion. "It appears to me that the time has arrived when the recommendations of the "Departmental Committee referred to above should be given a legal value and be "adopted by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries under the provision of "Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899." The views of Dr. F. L. Teed, Public Analyst for the City, were invited, and he expressed the following opinion:— "Local Government Board Circular of July IDA, 1906. "The above circular alludes to the Report of the Departmental Committee on "Preservatives and Colouring Matters in Food, one of whose recommendations was "that no preservatives should be added to milk. "The Local Government Board then further on recommends that proceedings "should be taken where preservatives are reported in milk. "Since neither a Departmental Committee nor the Local Government Board has "the power to change the law, the point for consideration is whether such proposed "proceedings are authorised by the Acts. "Such proceedings, if taken, would have to be under Section 6 of the 1875 Act, "for the sale of an article to the prejudice of the purchaser which is not of the "nature, substance and quality of the article demanded. But this section goes on : "' Provided that an offence shall not be deemed to be committed under this section "' in the following cases ; that is to say— "'(1) Where any matter or ingredient not injurious to health has been "' added to the food or drug because the same is required for the production or "' preparation thereof as an article of commerce, in a state fit for carriage or "' consumption, and not fraudulently to increase the bulk, weight or measure "' of the food or drug, or conceal the inferior quality thereof; ' "It has been held that this proviso means that the introduction of the injurious "ingredient must be in such amount as to render the article injurious to health in "order to constitute an offence. "To my mind this proviso allows the addition of preservatives and colouring "matters in any proportion provided that the article is not thereby rendered injurious "to health. This view is confirmed by reference to the Schedule of the 1875 Act, "footnote ' (d) Here the Analyst may insert at his discretion his opinion as to "' whether the mixture (if any) was for the purpose of rendering the article "' portable or palatable, or preserving it, or of improving the appearance, or was "' unavoidable, and may state whether in excess of what is ordinary, or otherwise, "' and whether the ingredients or materials mixed are or are not injurious to "' health.' "This footnote is just a paraphrase of the proviso quoted, and includes the word "' preserving,' which I consider comes under the heading of ' preparation thereof "as an ' article of commerce, in a state Jit for carriage or consumption.' "That the Acts contemplated and approved the employment of preservatives is "again shown in the Margarine Act, 1887, Section 3 :—' The word " butter" 139 "' shall mean the substance usually known as butter . . . with or without "* salt or other preservative, and with or without the addition of colouring " matter.' "In further support of this view, I would refer you to Section 1 of the 1899 "Act, last paragraph:— "' Provided that an article of food shall not be deemed to be adulterated "' by reason only of the addition of any preservative or colouring matter of "' such nature and in such quantity as not to render the article injurious "' to health.' "As the whole section is headed ' Precautions against importation of agricultural ''and other produce insufficiently marked,' it might be contended that it was "only to agricultural produce from abroad that the above proviso applied. "There is, however, nothing in the wording to show that this is so, and, more. "over, it is difficult to imagine that the legislature contemplated that the foreigner "should be expressly allowed to add preservatives to milk and other ^articles, the "presence of which after importation should be an offence under the Sale of Food "and Drugs Acts. "I would now like to draw attention to Section 4 of the 1899 Act, which gives "absolute power to the Board of Agriculture to prohibit or limit the amount of "any preservative or other addition to milk, cream, butter or cheese. "'The Board of Agriculture may . . . make regulations for determining . . . . what addition of extraneous matter . . . shall for the purposes of "' the Sale of Food and Drugs Act raise a presumption until the contrary "'is proved, that the milk ... is injurious to health, and an Analyst shall "' have regard to such regulations in certifying the result of an analysis under "' those Acts.' " I am not aware that the Board of Agriculture has exercised these powers. "There is no need for fresh legislation, the Acts are clear that the addition of "any ingredient which would render an article injurious to health is an offence, "and power is given to the Board of Agriculture to state what ingredients, and "in what quantity, when added to milk would render it injurious. "All that is wanted is that the Board of Agriculture should make its "pronouncement." The Sanitary Committee concurred in the suggestions made by Dr. Teed and myself, and directed that in reply to their letter the Local Government Board should be informed that the Corporation was of opinion that the time had arrived when the recommendations made in January, 1901, by the Departmental Committee appointed by the Board of Agriculture in July, 1899, to enquire into the use of preservatives and colouring matters in the preservation and colouring of food—so far as they relate to milk, cream, butter and cheese—should be adopted by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries as regulations under sec. 4 (1) of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, and that legislation as to the use or restriction of preservatives and colouring matter in other articles of food should be promoted at the earliest opportunity. 140 The fact that local authorities have successfully sustained prosecutions in cases where boracic acid has been added to milk as a preservative in no way lessens the obligation of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries to make regulations as suggested. BUTTER. Three hundred and twenty.eight samples were taken, of which 17, or 5*18 per cent., were certified to be adulterated. The figures for 1906 and five preceding years are given in the following table:— Year. No. of samples taken. No. of samples found Genuine. No. of samples found Adulterated. Percentage of Adulteration. 1901 241 226 15 6.2 1902 299 292 7 2.34 1903 368 367 1 .27 1904 442 429 13 2.94 1905 354 350 4 1.14 1906 328 311 17 5.18 The Metropolis (1905) 9.48 The 328 samples taken during the year included 87 that were taken in coffee and eating houses. The samples were collected during the first five months of the year with a view of checking the practice which was known to prevail amongst keepers of these places of substituting margarine for butter when slices of bread and butter were asked for. This form of fraud was first investigated in the City in 1903, when out of 71 samples taken at coffee houses, it was found that in 19 cases, or 26*7 per cent., margarine had been used as a substitute for butter. Some correspondence with the "London Coffee, Restaurant and Dining Room Keepers' Trade Protection Society" took place, and on the understanding that a notice should be conspicuously exhibited, no further proceedings were then taken. Further series of samples were taken both in 1904 and 1905, with the result that the number of cases in which this deceit was detected was reduced from 26 7 per cent. in 1903 to nil in the three years. There was, however, a revival of this form of fraud during 1906. It is a particularly mean deception, as it not only gives an unfair advantage to the dishonest trader, but also prejudices the poorer class of customers who are unable to protect themselves. 141 Of the 87 samples of butter served upon slices of "bread and butter" purchased at coffee and eating houses during 1906, it was found that in 12 cases margarine had been used as a substitute for butter. The following summary shows the amount of this deception that was discovered in the four years 1903.6:— Date. Samples taken. Cases of substitution. Percentage of substitution. 1903 71 19 26.7 1904 101 12 11.8 1905 16 Nil. Nil. 1906 87 12 138 As to the remaining 241 samples of butter examined during the year, 6, or 2.4 per cent., were certified as adulterated. REPORT OF SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE BUTTER TRADE. On the 15th March, 1906, a Select Committee was appointed to consider whether any, and if so what, legislation is required in order to secure the better conduct and control of butter and butter substitutes. The Report was ordered to be printed on the 9th July in the same year, and states that the Committee met 17 times, and took the evidence of 49 witnesses. The enquiry embraced the consideration of the following subjects :— (1) The law relating to trade in butter and butter substitutes. (2) The trade in butter— (a) Natural butter. (b) Blended or factory butter. (c) Manufacture and sale of milk.blended butter. (d) Butter mixed with fat not derived from milk. (e) Milk.blended butter. (f) Imported butter. (3) The trade in butter substitutes— (а) Moisture in margarine. (b) Manufacture of mixtures. 142 (4) Suggestions for the control of trade in butter— (a) Increase of penalties. (b) Voluntary control. (c) Ear-marking margarine. (d) Legislation as to sale. (e) Control of factories. (f) General power of entry. (g) Control of importation of butter. (5) Suggestions for the better control of the trade in butter substitutes. (6) Facilities for Analysis. One of the most important features of the enquiry was the evidence taken in relation to so.called "milk-blended butter." This is a form of sophistication that I have already directed attention to in my Annual Reports for the years 1903.4.5. It was ascertained in the course of the enquiry that this so-called butter is made in this country by five firms, and it was also given in evidence that it is composed of butter and milk, with the addition of boracic acid, that have been mixed together by machinery, one firm alone making from 80 to 85 tons a week. Upon its first introduction, some years ago, it was sold as butter, such description being, of course, a fraudulent one. This abuse was checked to some extent by the imposition of fines in cases where the firms manufacturing it were proceeded against under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, for selling butter containing an excessive amount of water. For some reason or other this mixture appealed to a certain section of the community that did not know butter when they saw it, and who were readily imposed upon by cleverly worded advertisements. This stuff is now sold as "milk.blended butter," a title cleverly designed to mislead. It is further placed in a wrapper, bearing an artfully worded declaration that purports to describe its real nature. This statement protects the manufacturer from prosecution, as it is a sufficient disclosure that the article is a mixture. It professes to be a "blend" of butter and milk, but the ordinary buyer can hardly be expected to know that the milk so added itself contains about 87 per cent, of water as a natural constituent. Nor do the public know that this "butter," as a result of such blending, when completed may contain as much as 28 per cent. of water. 143 A sample purchased in the City on the 16th May, 1906, was certified by the Public Analyst for the City to contain the parts as under:— Butter Fat 64.8 per cent. Water 280 „ Curd 5.7 „ Salt and Ash 0.8 „ Boric Acid (H3B03) 0.7 „ 100.0 It was first placed on the market some seven years ago. An attempt to deal with it by legislation was made in 1902; other Bills for the same purpose followed in the years 1903.4.5. If the recommendations contained in the Report now under review are adopted in any new legislation, the sale of this article under the description of butter will be prohibited. Much evidence was collected by the Committee in connection with Margarine. There can be no possible objection to the sale of Margarine when it is honestly sold for what it is. It is a most wholesome article of diet, and is able to compete with butter on its merits when sold as such, but in the past it has frequently been sold under somewhat misleading names. Some manufacturers, having produced an article that they consider of special excellence, believe it has established sufficient merit to justify them selling it under a distinctive name. There is no objection to their doing this provided it is labelled in accordance with the provisions of the Act, but many of them have selected names for their products which, to say the least of it, are liable to mislead. Such names as "Butter.pat," "Creamo," "Churno,"and the like have been Minutes of adopted, and these are likely to lead the purchaser to imagine that the seiect com margarine was the produce of a dairy or farm. One firm even went so far as ™°"rad to print an illustration of a cow on the label, and when it was pointed out to Q.4458 and r ' Q. 6806. a witness who was under examination that an ox would have been more appropriate, considering that the material was made from the fat of that animal, the Committee were told that it was an error on the part of "the man who cut the block." It will thus be seen that the time has arrived when, in the interests of the public and English Agriculturists in particular, steps must be taken to stop such abuse by suitable legislative measures. I submit a copy of the recommendations made by the Committee as a result of their investigations, and which have since formed the basis of the "Butter and Margarine Bill" introduced this Session by Sir Edward Strachey, Bart. 144 The following were the recommendations:— "(1) That Inspectors of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Depart"ment of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland should have power to "enter any premises where they have reasonable grounds for believing that butter "is made, blended, re-worked, treated by any process, adulterated, or stored. "(2) That premises where butter is blended, or re-worked, or treated by any "process, or where abnormal butter is habitually produced, shall be registered with "the local authority of the district as a butter factory. "(3) That no fat, other than butter fat, and no vegetable or other oils, nor any "substance capable of being used as an adulterant of butter should be brought into "or stored or allowed to be in any registered butter factory. "(4) That no substance be added to butter whereby the percentage of moisture "in the butter is increased. "(5) That the addition to butter at any stage of the process of manufacture of "any fat not derived from milk be expressly and directly prohibited. "(6) That margarine, when sold by retail, should be handed to the purchaser in "a wrapper, on which the word 'Margarine' shall be printed in black solid capital "letters, not less than ½-inch square, and if more than one wrapper is applied to the "margarine, the word 'Margarine' shall be printed as above on the inner wrapper; "that no fancy name or description shall be permitted which refers to butter or "anything connected with the dairy industry; that the outside wrapper, as well as "the inside wrapper, should contain nothing but the word 'Margarine' in type as "aforesaid; and if any fancy name is printed on any other wrapper, the word "'Margarine' should be suffixed or affixed to the fancy name in letters of the same " size, colour and type as those in which the fancy name is printed. "(7) That no margarine made in any margarine factory shall, when the process "of manufacture is complete, contain more than 16 per cent. of water, and no "margarine shall be imported containing more than 16 per cent. of moisture. "(8) That premises where margarine is re-worked or submitted to any process "shall be registered as margarine factories. "(9) That Sub-section 3 of Section 20 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, "be amended so as to provide that a warranty or invoice given by a person resident "outside the United Kingdom shall not be available as a defence to any proceedings "under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. "(10) That penalties for the importation of adulterated butter should be "proportionate to the magnitude of the consignment. "(11) That all practicable steps should be taken to bring about international "agreements as to the prevention of adulteration. "(12) That Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, should be "amended so as to give the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Depart"ment of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland power to fix standards "for curd and to give the Local Government Board power to fix standards for "preservatives. 145 "(13) That the Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction for Ireland "should have power to take proceedings under the Merchandise Marks Act. "(14) That nothing shall be sold under the name of butter which contains more "than 16 per cent. of moisture. "(15) That substances other than butter (not being margarine) containing butter "fat should be sold, with a limit of 24 per cent. of moisture, under a name approved "by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries; provided that such name should not "be calculated to prejudice the sale of the article. "(16) That such substances when sold by retail should be delivered to the "purchaser in a wrapper approved by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, "containing a description of the nature, substance and quality of the article; and "as far as possible under the same conditions as apply to the sale of margarine. "(17) That the provisions of the Margarine Act of 1887 as amended by the Sale "of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, should apply to all such substances. "(18) Inspectors acting under the special direction of the local authority "should have power to enter butter factories, to inspect any process, and to take "samples. "(19) That butter having been treated by any process shall not be allowed to "be replaced in the original packages." COFFEE. Twenty.eight samples of coffee were taken, of which 2, or 7.1 per cent., were adulterated. One prosecution resulted, and the vendor, who, when asked for coffee had sold a mixture of coffee and chicory containing 20 per cent., or one.fifth of the latter, was fined 10s. and 17s. 6d. expenses. I had occasion last year to point out that it was most discreditable that the proportion of adulterated samples of coffee in the City was as high as 13.9 per cent. It will be noted there is a considerable reduction in the percentage discovered daring 1906, when it fell to 7.1 per cent.; but it is not unlikely to reach a higher figure in the future if it costs a dishonest dealer only 1l. 7s. 6d. for indulging in this fraud at the expense of the citizens. The amount of coffee adulteration in the City for the past six years is here given :— Year. Samples taken. Found genuine. Found adulterated. Percentage of adulteration. 1901 11 10 1 9.0 1902 27 26 1 3.7 1903 21 21 Nil Nil. 1904 20 18 2 10.0 1905 79 68 11 13.9 1906 28 26 2 7.1 Metropolis (1905) 10.9 146 DRUGS. Forty.seven samples of drugs were taken, of which 5, or 10.6 per cent., were adulterated or not up to standard. Those reported against included two of purified cream of tartar and three of iron pills. The samples of purified cream of tartar, Nos. 332 and 376, were certified to contain 1.75 and 1.22 grains of lead per pound respectively. The vendor of No. 376 was prosecuted and fined £5 and 17s. 6d. expenses. Sample No. 332 was taken informally. In the cases of the iron pills, one contained no ferrous carbonate and the other two were deficient of that ingredient to the extent of 25 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively. One of the vendors was cautioned. The other two samples had been taken informally. The accompanying Table shows the extent of drug adulteration in the City for the last six years:— Samples taken. Found genuine. Found adulterated. Percentage of adulteration. 1901 111 103 8 7.2 1902 79 74 5 6.3 1903 65 60 5 7.7 1904 52 48 4 7.7 1905 61 56 5 8.2 1906 47 42 5 10.6 Metropolis (1905) 8.4 It will be seen from the above that there has been a progressive increase in the proportion of drug adulteration discovered during the past five years. It is stated in the last published Report of the Local Government Board that during 1905 the percentage of adulterated drugs found was 8.4 in the Metropolis and 9.0 in England and Wales. It is disappointing to find that after six years' energetic efforts in the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts this form of adulteration should be apparently increasing instead of decreasing. Many drugs in common use are liable to deteriorate with age, and chemists, therefore, should be careful to see to the condition of their stock of such preparations. 147 Other drugs purchased by them for making up prescriptions may contain injurious metallic impurities; they should, therefore, take steps to ensure the entire absence of such contamination from all materials they may be asked for by their customers. The remaining 71 articles examined comprised 14 of tinned meats, 10 of shrimps, 8 of mustard, 6 of cream, 5 each of cocoa, cheese and cider, 4 of pepper, 3 of lard, 2 each of olive oil, essence of beef and chopped meat, and 1 each of honey, sacramental wine, gin, and feeding extract. All of these, with the exception of one sample of cream, were returned by the Public Analyst as genuine. One of the creams was certified to contain 3 per cent. of starch in the form of starch paste. A prosecution resulted, the Cream Dairy Co., Ltd., who were the vendors, being the Defendants. The case was dismissed as against the Cream Dairy Company, who successfully relied upon a warranty given them by the Etchingham Dairy Co., Ltd. The addition of 3 per cent. of starch to cream may appear a small matter, and that it would not be greatly to the prejudice of the consumer. There is, however, at present no legal definition of cream, and as its consistency depends largely upon the proportion of fat it contains, and the public rely upon its thickness as a criterion of its quality, the addition of starch or gelatine becomes of considerable importance. It gives the cream a fictitious appearance of richness much to the advantage of the vendor, who by the aid of such agents can make an inferior article (cream adulterated with milk) look like a high-class product. The Departmental Committee appointed so long ago as January 29th, 1900, to determine standards for milk and cream recommended, inter alia, on January 16th, 1901:— "That the artificial thickening of cream by any addition of gelatine "or other substance shall raise a presumption that the cream is not "genuine." This case is particularly referred to here as it emphasises the need for early legislation with regard to the warranty clauses in the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. Moreover, each of the samples of cream taken during the year were found to contain boracic acid, but only in one case exceeding the amount (0.25 per cent.) recommended by the Preservatives Committee, the actual amount present in this case being 0.3 per cent. On this point, in his last Quarterly Report for 1906, Dr. Teed remarks, in referring to these cases: "Here again the working of the Acts would be simplified if the Board of "Agriculture would exercise its powers in regard to preservatives either by adopting the recommendations of the Preservatives Committee or by issuing "Regulations of its own." 148 BORACIC ACID IN SHRIMPS IMPORTED FROM HOLLAND. The shrimps referred to were examined under the following circumstances. It appears that there is a considerable trade done in the importation of picked shrimps from Holland. These are chiefly used by restaurant and hotel keepers for making shrimp sauce and by manufacturers of potted shrimp paste. A sample of these was taken at the request of a dealer in Billingsgate, there being reason to believe the shrimps were treated with some preservative. The Public Analyst certified them to contain no less than 1.49 per cent., or 104.3 grains per lb., of boracic acid. As such an excessive quantity of this drug rendered them unfit for food, two other samples were taken in the neighbourhood of Billingsgate. These, upon analysis, were certified as containing 0.49 per cent., or 34.3 grains per lb., and 1.12 per cent., or 78.4 grains per lb. respectively, of boracic acid. The lesser amount found in the last two samples was found upon inquiry to be due to their having been washed, whereas the first sample taken was examined when in its condition on arrival in this country. The firm chiefly engaged in the sale of these shrimps, and the agents representing the consignors abroad, were at once informed that these shrimps would not be allowed to be sold in the City if they contained more than ½ per cent., equivalent to 35 grains per lb., of boracic acid, and the nature and amount of the preservative used marked on each consignment. After some experiments had been made in Holland, two trial samples submitted by the consignor were analysed, but these were found to contain boracic acid in considerable excess, containing 1.5 per cent., or 105 grains per lb., and .75 per cent., or 52.5 grains per lb., respectively. Further experiments were then undertaken, which proved more successful, and two samples that were examined were found to be well below the limit, the amount of boracic acid found being '11 per cent., or 7.7 grains per lb., and 0.26 per cent., or 18.2 grains per lb., respectively. The dealers were informed that as their results were satisfactory no further objection would be raised with regard to the sale of these shrimps in the City, and that samples would be taken from time to time for control purposes. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS.—WARRANTIES. The question of Warranties having become of such serious importance as affecting an efficient control of food supplies by a satisfactory administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, I recommended to the Sanitary Committee, in January, 1906, that a statement be submitted by the Corporation to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture and 149 Fisheries, showing the necessity for an early amendment of the Acts now in operation. The Committee concurred, and it was referred to the City Solicitor and myself to prepare such statement for transmission to the abovementioned Authorities. The following is a copy of the representation which, after approval by the Sanitary Committee, was in due course forwarded to the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries:— "The Corporation has for some time past had its attention called to "the ease with which the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts can be evaded "by reason of the unfair protection afforded to offenders who are able to "prove a warranty under the Acts. "This has become a question of serious importance, and affects the "proper control of food sold to the public (especially milk), and prevents "a satisfactory administration of the Acts. "The Corporation is advised that the only way of dealing successfully "with the objects which the Acts have in view is the entire repeal of "the warranty sections. "These sections provide in effect that where a retailer is prosecuted "for selling adulterated articles, if he prove to the satisfaction of the "Justices or Court that he has a warranty in respect of that article, and "that he sold it in the same state as that in which he bought it, having "no reason to suspect it to be otherwise, he shall be entitled, under "certain conditions, to be discharged from the prosecution. "Retail milksellers generally obtain their supplies under a warranty "from a Dairy Company, who purchase from farmers by contract, also "under a warranty. Should the retailer be prosecuted for selling "sophisticated milk, and give due notice under Section 20 (1) of the "Act of 1899, the summons is dismissed. If samples from the whole"sale dealer who sold the milk are taken on delivery at the retailer's "premises and found adulterated or impoverished, the case against him "is also dismissed for similar reasons, the wholesale dealer relying upon "the contract with the farmer, against whom no proceedings can be "taken after the expiration of six months from the date of the warranty, "even if the delivery by the farmer was within the jurisdiction of the "Authority. "Attention is called to the fact that, since 1901, 19 summonses tor "offences under the Acts taken out in the City have been dismissed "upon the proof of warranties, viz., six in 1902, two in 1903, two in "1904, and nine in 1905. Other Local Authorities have had similar "difficulties, and the evil seems to be increasing. "Milk from the country delivered at a London terminus is frequently "mixed on arrival at the station, and, as the Sampling Officer employed 150 "by one Local Authority cannot take samples in any but his own "district, he is therefore unable to ascertain what farmer (if any) is at "fault. "There is a general concensus of opinion among the Metropolitan "Borough Councils as to the urgent necessity for the repeal of these "clauses. "In July, 1904, at a conference convened by the London County "Council, on the administration of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, "and the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, Ac., attended by delegates repre"senting some twenty-five of the Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities, it "was resolved that Section 25 of the Act of 1875, and Section 20 of the "Act of 1899, operated to the prejudice of the purchaser and of the "public health, and ought to be repealed. "This view is one that has been always held by the Corporation of "London, and is further confirmed by the following quotation from the "report of the Intelligence Division, addressed to the Secretary of the "Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, and dated the 5th June, 1905:— "'Numerous representations have been received from Local "'Authorities, particularly the Metropolitan Borough Councils, as "'to the operation of the warranty sections in the Foods and "'Drugs Acts. Two recent decisions have tended to weaken their "'position with regard to proceedings under these sections. "'In Whitaker v. Pomfret Brothers, February, 1902, it was laid "'down that no proceedings can be taken under Section 20 of the "'Sale of Food and Drugs Act of 1899 in respect of false warranty "'when such warranty was given more than six months before the "'commencement of the proceedings. "'In the case of milk, it has been suggested that the period of "'six months runs, not from the date of the warranty, but from "'the date on which the warranted milk was delivered, but not"'withstanding this suggestion, many Local Authorities regard "'this case as a serious obstacle to proceedings under the warranty "'sections. "1 Another decision which is regarded as an obstacle is that given "'in Manners v. Tyler, May, 1902. Section 20, Sub-section (5) "'of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, provided that "'proceedings under the warranty sections of the Acts may be "'taken as well before a Court having jurisdiction in the place where "'the article of food or drug to which the warranty relates "'was purchased as before a Court having jurisdiction in the place "'where the warranty was given. In Manners v. Tyler it was "'decided that this provision applies only to the first or immediate 151 "'warrantor, and not to the second or any more remote warrantor. "'Thus, if a farmer in Somerset sells milk with a warranty to a "'dealer in Paddington, who sells it with a warranty to a milkman "'in Clerkenwell, proceedings might be taken under the warranty "'sections against the Paddington dealer in the Clerkenwell Court, "'but if the case against the dealer was dismissed and the Local "'Authority decided to take similar proceedings against the "'Somerset farmer, it might be necessary that those proceedings "'should be taken in Somersetshire." "'Several suggestions have been offered by various Local "'Authorities for the amendment of the law. Two of these "'suggestions may be mentioned. The one is that whenever "'a warranty is pleaded the Local Authority can have the "'summons adjourned in order to apply for a summons, or in the "'case of successive warranties, for summonses against the "'warrantor or warrantors, and the Magistrate shall then hear the "'two or more summonses as one case, so as to decide who is the "'guilty party. The other is that the warranty sections should be "'repealed, and the seller of the milk be left to his remedy at "'common law against the person from whom he purchased it. "'There is little doubt that the latter of these two suggestions "'is the one that would commend itself to the agricultural "'community.' " SACRAMENTAL WINE. In August, 1906, a request was received that a particular sample of wine should be analysed. The circumstances were as under. It appears that a considerable difference of opinion prevailed with regard to the nature of the sacramental wine used in one of the churches in Inverness. The wine in question was purchased direct from a Wine Merchant in the City, who was stated to have largely advertised it as non-alcoholic pure grape juice. The authorities at Inverness, however, had reason to believe that it was not a natural wine, but had resulted from an artificial process. The request was acceded to, and a sample taken, with the result that the Public Analyst for the City certified it as "a sample of grape juice, unfer"mented and sterilised." That wine was, therefore, found to be exactly as represented by the vendor. 152 SPIRITS. Pending the settlement of the "What is Whisky ? "question, it was not considered advisable to take samples last year. The interests involved in this matter are very great and far-reaching. The present absence of any legal definition of what whisky should really consist has reacted even in South Africa, as shown by the following extract from a Report of the Medical Officer of Health for Johannesburg dated 31st October, 1906. Alluding to a conviction at the North London Police Court on the 27th February, 1906, and the subsequent abortive appeal to Quarter Sessions, Dr. Chas. Porter remarks:— "Till Mr. Fordham's judgment has been confirmed by a higher Court, "it would be merely throwing away money to institute proceedings in "Johannesburg, especially as a recent attempt to do so at Capetown was "dismissed by the Resident Magistrate." The same view may be taken of the present state of the question in this country. In the last published Report (1905) of the Local Government Board on the working of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, is a note referring to the exhibition of notices in public-houses relating to the spirits sold therein. "Spirits.—The practice of placing in the bars of licensed houses "notices that all spirits in the establishments are diluted has extended "considerably in late years. In Finsbury about 32 per cent. of the "publicans are said to exhibit the notices. In West Suffolk the percentage is 49, and in Dorset it is 73. It is said that many of these "notices are not readily visible to the public, and that when they are "seen their legal significance is probably not often fully appreciated." A house-to-house visitation was recently made of all public-houses in the City—333 in number—when it was found that in 135 of them, or upwards of 40 per cent., notices of some kind or another were exhibited for the express purpose of protecting the vendors from the consequences of infringing the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. This inquiry in the City was limited to "public-houses,"and licensed restaurants, &c., are not included in the above figures. It is only right that any trader who makes a bona fide disclosure of the quality of the articles sold by him should be protected, and each case must necessarily be decided on its merits. It should, however, be remembered that publicansstandon a different footing from other traders. If a milkman were to exhibit notices that all 153 milk sold at his establishment was sold as milk and water, he would damage himself more than anyone, and there would be nothing to prevent a rival starting against him who sold pure milk. A publican is, however, possessed of a monopoly, and is licensed to sell certain intoxicating drinks which other people are not allowed to sell. It is surely an implied bargain that he will sell these drinks, and having obtained his licence on the unwritten understanding that he will do so, his licence should be taken from him when he deliberately, although openly, sells adulterated articles. In this connection Dr. Teed has suggested, and I am quite in accord with his view, that in any future alteration of the law it would be desirable that it should be enacted that no licensed vendor of intoxicating drinks should be allowed to plead a notice or disclosure as a defence if charged with selling diluted or otherwise adulterated articles. Those concerned with the administration of the Acts are frequently placed in a very difficult position with regard to these notices, and hesitate to try conclusions with powerful trade associations in cases where samples are found to be adulterated or not up to standard. REGISTRATION OF WHOLESALE DEALERS IN MARGARINE. At the end of 1906 there were 46 dealers in margarine, and 15 dealers in margarine and margarine cheese, on the Register. In September, 1906, a case was discovered where some wholesale dealers in imported margarine were handling their goods at a railway goods yard in the City without being registered as wholesale dealers, as provided in the Margarine Act, 1887, and the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899. Their attention having been drawn to this omission, they at once registered as wholesale dealers in margarine, and the facts were duly reported to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Another case of a similar description was reported in September, 1904. 154 155 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875.1899. Articles examined during each Quarter of the year 1906.

The foregoing bye-laws were made by the Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London, in Common Council assembled, on the 29th day of November, 1906, and were submitted to and confirmed at a subsequent meeting of the Common Council, held on the 13th day of December, 1906, and are in substitution for those made and confirmed respectively on the 10th and 31st May, 1906, which are hereby repealed. Examined, HOMEWOOD CRAWFORD, City Solicitor. I hereby approve the foregoing Bye-laws. H. J. GLADSTONE, One of His Majesty's Principal Whitehall, Secretaries of State. 20th December, 1906. N.B.—By sec. 47 (4) of the Act under which these bye-laws are made, it is provided that any officer duly authorised by the Corporation in that behalf, shall at all reasonable times be afforded by the person registered full and free power of entry into the registered premises for the purpose of inspecting such premises and the books required to be kept by such person. 185 Appendix F. [.Extract from Annual Report of Medical Officer of Health for the City of London for 1902.] SANITARY ACCOMMODATION IN WORKPLACES. Section 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, requires that:— "Every factory, workshop and workplace, whether erected before "or after the passing of this Act, shall be provided with sufficient "and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveniences, "regard being had to the number of persons employed in or in "attendance at such building; and also where persons of both sexes "are or are intended to be employed or in attendance with proper "separate accommodation for persons of each sex." Failure to comply with these requirements renders the offender liable to a fine not exceeding £20, and a further fine of £2 for every day after conviction during which non-compliance continues. With regard to the standards of sufficiency and suitability, the Home Secretary has issued the following "Sanitary Accommodation Order":— "The Sanitary Accommodation Order of 4th February, 1903. "In pursuance of Section 9 of the Factory and Workshop Act, "1901, I hereby determine that the accommodation in the way of •' sanitary conveniences provided in a factory or workshop shall be "deemed to be sufficient and suitable within the meaning of the said "section if the following conditions are complied with and not "otherwise:— "1. In factories or workshops where females are employed or in "attendance there shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 "females. "In factories or workshops where males are employed or in attendance "there shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 males: provided "that "(a) in factories or workshops where the number of males employed or "in attendance exceeds 100, and sufficient urinal accommodation "is also provided, it shall be sufficient if there is one sanitary "convenience for every 25 males up to the first 100, and one for "every 40 after; "(b) in factories or workshops where the number of males employed or "in attendance exceeds 500, and the District Inspector of Factories "certifies in writing that by means of a check system, or otherwise, "proper supervision and control in regard to the use of the con"veniences are exercised by officers specially appointed for that "purpose it shall be sufficient if one sanitary convenience is provided 186 "for every 60 males, in addition to sufficient urinal accommodation. "Any certificate given by an Inspector shall be kept attached to the "general register, and shall be liable at any time to be revoked by "notice in writing from the Inspector. "In calculating the number of conveniences required by this order, "any odd number of persons less than 25, 40 or 60, as the case may be, "shall be reckoned as 25, 40, or 60. "2. Every sanitary convenience shall be kept in a cleanly state, shall "be sufficiently ventilated and lighted, and shall not communicate with "any work-room except through the open air or through an intervening "ventilated space: provided that in work-rooms in use prior to 1st January, 1903, and mechanically ventilated in such manner that air "cannot be drawn into the work-room through the sanitary convenience, "an intervening ventilated space shall not be required. "3. Every sanitary convenience shall be under cover and so partitioned "off as to secure privacy, and if for the use of females shall have a '' proper door and fastenings. "4. The sanitary conveniences in a factory or workshop shall be "so arranged and maintained as to be conveniently accessible to all "persons employed therein at all times during their employment. "5. Where persons of both sexes are employed, the conveniences for "each sex shall be so placed or so screened that the interior shall not be "visible, even when the door of any convenience is open, from any place "where persons of the other sex have to work or pass; and, if the "conveniences for one sex adjoin those for the other sex, the approaches "shall be separate." "6. This order shall come into force on the 1st day of July, 1903. "7. This order may be referred to as the Sanitary Accommodation "Order of 4th February, 1903. "A. AKERS DOUGLAS, "One of His Majesty's Principal Secretaries of State. "Home Office, Whitehall, "4th February, 1903." It is important to note that although the "Order "does not apply to the Administrative County of London (in which the City is included), nor to any place where Sec. 22 of the Public Health Amendment Act, 1890, is in force, it will certainly be the standard generally adopted throughout the country. On the recommendation of your Medical Officer of Health it has been accepted by the Sanitary Committee as governing the provision of sufficient and suitable accommodation under Secs. 37 and 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the way of sanitary conveniences for both sexes in all premises where persons are employed or in attendance. 187 Appendix G. [Extract from Annual Report of Medical Officer of Health for the City of London for 1903.] BAKEHOUSES. (Underground.) Bakehouses have been the subject of special legislation for many years, and since the 1st January, 1896, it has been unlawful to establish any new one underground. The Factory and Workshop Act of 1901 introduced some stringent measures with regard to these places, and it was therein enacted that after the 1st January, 1904, no existing underground* bakehouse should be used unless certified by the Sanitary Authority to be "suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects"(Sec. 101 (4)). The evident intention of the Legislature was their abolition, and it therefore became the duty of the Sanitary Authorities to adopt a high standard of sanitary requirements in connection with them before granting certificates. Immediately after the passing of the Act referred to above, due notice was given to the owners of the underground bakehouses then in the City, stating the requirements of the Corporation that would have to be complied with before a certificate would be issued. It would, of course, have been unreasonable to rigidly enforce standard requirements in every case, as the circumstances in no two instances were identical. In was therefore considered advisable to deal with each one upon its merits, and as far as possible the accompanying standard was kept in view. (1) Construction. Floors, walls, and ceilings to have suitable hard, smooth, and jointless surface. The joints of any drain passing beneath the floor of any bakehouse to be gas and water-tight. Any covers necessary to inspection chambers to drains to be of metal, and be double covers with double sealed joints. The floor of the bakehouse to be laid to proper falls from the sides to the centre and be drained by means of a suitable channel to a gully, over which a draw-off tap shall be fixed, the gully being surrounded by a kerb and properly dished. Where possible the said gully shall be fixed outside the bakehouse. No certificate should be granted for any bakehouse which is liable to be flooded with sewage owing to the public sewer becoming surcharged. * An underground bakehouse is one in which the floor surface of any baking room is more than 3 feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. 188 (2) Light. The bakehouse shall, if possible, be lighted naturally, either by windows, floor lights, or in any other manner possible. This could in some cases be effected by areas opening on the footway glazed with reflecting prisms, the walls of the areas being built in white glazed bricks. Electric light only to be used for illuminating purposes. (3) Ventilation. "Through "ventilation to be insisted upon; but this is not to be obtained from the footway surface or the stall board of the shop front, except at a height of at least 12 inches above the footway surface; and not even then when ventilation can be had in other ways (shafts, &c., at higher level, &c., &c.). (4) Walls. The walls of all bakehouses must be absolutely free from dampness. (5) Furnaces. The furnace in connection with any oven is to be provided with an efficient outlet or flue to carry off sulphurous fumes generated in the process of baking. An outlet for heat and steam is also to be provided immediately in front of and above the oven door. The outer doors of furnaces and the oven door to be perfectly close fitting. Where gas is used in the process of baking efficient means of ventilation is to be provided to carry off any fumes generated. (6) Lavatory Accommodation for workpeople outside bakehouse. (7) Generally. All dough troughs and benches, &c., in bakehouses to be fixed on wheels to facilitate cleansing of floors, walls, &c., as well as the troughs, &c. Section 97 of the Act to be strictly enforced.* Any special case to be considered on its merits by the Authority before deciding as to grant of certificate. * This Section refers to certain specific sanitary requirements in relation to drains, water-closets, water supply, &c.

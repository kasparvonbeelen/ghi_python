Jan., 1928 Lawrence, Charles J Feb., 1928 annual report of the medical officer of health for the year 1930. To the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C. May, 1931. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present a report on the work of my Department for the year 1930. It is with regret that I have to record the sudden death of Mr. G. G. King, one of the meat inspectors engaged at Smithfield Market, who entered the service of the Corporation in 1910. I also have to announce the retirement of Mr. W. H. Ralph, one of your sanitary inspectors, after 32 years of faithful service. Both these officers will be missed. Consequent upon the death of Mr. E. A. Pinchin, F.I.C., the Public Analyst, referred to in my report for 1929, Mr. A. J. C. Lickorish, F.I.C., was appointed in April last to the position thus rendered vacant. In this connection, I should like to place on record my appreciation of the assistance rendered to the Department by Mr. Arthur E. Brown, B.Sc., F.I.C., who so ably undertook the analytical work pending the appointment of the permanent analyst. STATISTICAL INFORMATION. Area.—The City of London (excluding The Temple) comprises an area of 661 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.032 square miles, equal to a square of 1.016 miles to a side. The area of " Registration London " is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1169 square miles, equal to a square of 1081 miles to a side. Density (1928).—City of London, Registration District, at night, 17.3 persons to an acre; City of London, Registration District, during the day, *644.1 persons to an acre; Registration London, at night, 59 .5 persons to an acre. Annual Rateable Value.—The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London (including the City) was £54,659,409 on April 6th, 1930, whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London was £8,195,572, or about one-seventh of the whole County. The sum receivable from a penny rate is £34,682. Population.—The undermentioned figures are extracted from the Report of the Registrar-General on the Census of England and Wales, 1921:— Area, Inhabited Houses. Population. Private Statute Families. Acres. 1911. 1921. 1911. 1921. 1921. City of London (Not including the Temple) 661 2,784 2,398 19,657 13,709 3,174 These figures represent the population on the nights of the 3rd April, 1911, and the 19th June, 1921. The following table shows the progressive decline which has taken place since 1861 in the number of inhabitants who reside within the City boundaries, and the progressive increase in the number of workers who are daily employed in the City :— Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population. 1861 112,063 — 1866 — 170,133 1871 75,983 — 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 — 1911 19,657 364,061 1921 13,709 436,721 (Imperial Census). There is only one registration district in the City. * This figure refers only to persons " actively engaged in the City during the daytime," and is based upon the Imperial Census taken in June, 1921. B 2 8 The estimated population of the City for the year 1930 is not yet available, and in accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Health, the estimated population for 1929 is used in this Report. This figure is 10,700. The day Census taken in 1911 showed that the day population was 364,061 persons, and also that 1,077,155 persons and 94,095 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the count was taken. Births.—During the year 1930, 436 births were registered in the City, 389 of which, however, did not belong thereto. To the remaining 47 must be added the births of 42 children born to citizens temporarily residing outside the City boundary. The number of births, therefore, on which the rate should be calculated is 89, four of which were still births. The annual birth-rate was 8.3 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 7.6 per 1,000. In the Metropolis the birth-rate in 1930 was 15-7 per 1,000. Mortality.—During the year under review, 667 deaths were registered in the District, including 598 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See table, p. 9, for details. Deducting these latter, 69 deaths remain, to which must be added those of 64 persons who died in institutions in outside districts, where they were registered ; the total, therefore, on which the City death-rate is calculated is 133. The death-rate for 1930 was 12.0 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 14.0), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 11 .4. Deaths from Violence.—Of the City deaths, 8.5 per cent. were caused by injuries or violence, as compared with 2.8 in 1928 and 2.7 in 1929. This is 4.6 above the average for the previous five years. percentage of registered deaths from violence. Year. City of London. Per cent. Metropolis.

The deaths from Phthisis correspond to a rate of 0.74 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 0.87 in the Metropolis. Infantile Mortality.—The deaths of children under one year of age were at the rate of 89 per 1,000 births, as against 59 for the whole of London. 9 CAUSES OF, AND AGES AT, DEATH DURING THE YEAR 1930.

Vaccination.—Of the 436 births notified to the Vaccination Officer during 1930, 96 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 10 had died before the age for vaccination and in 1 case a child was reported as insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 2 cases, 213 had removed into other districts, or the vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 114 instances of conscientious objection. The Public Vaccinator performed 784 re-vaccinations during the year, and in addition to the 96 successful vaccinations referred to above, 141 adult persons were vaccinated for the first time. vaccination statistics in the city of london.

No new work has been undertaken in connection with Infant Welfare Work, as it is found that the needs of the City are amply fulfilled by the arrangements already in operation. The small resident population of the City and the consequent few births enables a close personal touch to be maintained between my staff and the City mothers. The Infant Welfare Centre, administered by the Corporation at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, has had a satisfactory attendance at the weekly Wednesday session, and supplies of milk and dried milk, at cost price, under cost price, and free, according to circumstances, have been provided in accordance with the practice which has been in operation for some years. Cod Liver Oil Emulsion is also given where its administration appears to be advisable. In one case home help was provided for 17 days. 411 notifications of birth, made in accordance with the requirements of the Notification of Births Act, were received. Of these, 68 referred to City mothers, and the balance were transferred to the appropriate authorities. The Woman Inspector, who undertakes the work arising from these notifications, reports that 323 visits were made as a consequence of notifications received, and also that 302 special visits were made in connection with infant welfare. Six visits were also made in respect of cases coming within the scope of the Children Act, 1908, all in relation to nurse children. No verminous school children were notified under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. CHILDREN UNDER SCHOOL AGE. In the early part of the year, the Ministry of Health and the Board of Education addressed a circular letter to Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities and Local Authorities, directing attention to the opportunities which exist for supervising the health of children up to five years of age, and urging local authorities to use the powers they already possess, but which only some exercise. The small resident population in the City and the comparatively large number of women beyond child-bearing age, together with the fact that during 1930 only 68 births have occurred amongst City mothers, indicates the care which should be exercised before any broad scheme such as the establishment of day nurseries, etc., should be embarked upon. In the special City circumstances, it is a comparatively easy matter for your woman sanitary inspector to maintain the intimate personal touch which has always been a factor in the administration of Maternity and Child Welfare work in the City, and an extension of the activity formerly displayed in connection with children up to two years of age, to those between two and five is the direction in which I am of opinion development should proceed. No difficulty is ever experienced in obtaining such medical assistance as is necessary by reason of the fact that the City is well served by St. Bartholomew's Hospital within its area, and other large hospitals adjacent, to which any apparent needs of the children can be referred. MATERNAL MORTALITY. The investigation into maternal deaths which the Ministry of Health now require to be conducted has not called for any particular organisation in my department. There are very few deaths per annum among the City resident population, and the few maternal deaths are investigated by me. In 1930 the number was one. It may be of interest to note that, from 1900 to 1930 inclusive, only 15 maternal deaths have occurred among City residents. 12 BIRTH CONTROL. One of the Metropolitan Borough Councils approached the Corporation with the request for support for a resolution on birth control, couched in the following terms:— " That this Council recognises that the question of family limitation is one to be settled by the individuals concerned. It further recognises, however, that a demand exists among the working class married women for reliable and private information as to methods of family limitation, and places on record its opinion that such married women should not be prevented, by lack of means, from obtaining the help they desire. It, therefore, calls upon the Ministry of Health to allow those Municipalities who wish to do so to provide facilities for such information through the public services." The Corporation were unable to give the support desired, as it was felt that no genuine demand existed which could not be satisfied by medical agencies already in existence dealing directly with the individuals, or that lack of means was a bar to proper advice in cases of medical desirability. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Few comments are necessary with reference to the incidence of infectious disease during the year 1930. Diphtheria was prevalent to the extent of 19 cases compared with 21 in 1929. The number of Scarlet Fever cases was 20, compared with 31 in 1929. There were 6 cases of Erysipelas. Measles and German Measles are not notifiable diseases. Forty-two cases of the former illness were brought to my notice by medical practitioners and through the medium of the school medical service. Twenty cases of Chicken-pox were notified, 6 of Acute Primary Pneumonia, 10 of Smallpox, 1 of Puerperal Fever and 2 of Enteric Fever. The percentage of cases removed to hospital for treatment continues to be satisfactory. In each instance of notified disease a detailed examination is made of the sanitary condition of the premises where the case occurred and a summary of defects found by the District Inspector is given on page 66. Notification of Infections Diseases.—In the following tables will be found particulars relating to cases of infectious disease, and information as to the removal of patients to hospitals and sanatoria. 13 statistics of notifications and removals to hospital.

The prevailing type of Small-pox, after long watching, has proved to be a definite type which keeps its own characteristics even when occurring among populations which have not been vaccinated, and in which the epidemic is consequently extensive ; it has deserved to be separately named from the deadlier Small-pox, and is termed Variola Minor. Fatality in this disease is insignificant, as is seen in the following comparison of Small-pox mortalities:— England and Wales, Year 1929, fatality .26%. United States of America, Year 1927, .47%. Canada, Year 1929, .25%. Belgian Congo, Year 1929, 2.46%. Bombay (one week, 1930), 2,013 cases, 1,068 deaths, 53.05%. British India, Year 1929, 23.2%. "... judging by epidemiological observations, the varieties of Variola, major and minor, do not seem to be interchangeable." (Extract of Report from L'Office International d'Hygiene Publique, quoted in Report of the Vaccination Committee, Ministry of Health, 1930.) Variola major is extremely dangerous, and variola minor can simulate the major disease exactly as regards the eruption ; since the population has become used to Variola minor, which is not dangerous, there is a possibility that contempt of Variola as a whole may be engendered, with a corresponding contempt of the measures which successfully combat either variety. Primary amongst preventive measures is vaccination, and secondary, the observation of contacts. The infectiousness of Variola minor is sufficiently low that vaccination is even of greater preventive power in incidence of this disease than in Variola major. One notices with satisfaction that the affected public, to some extent, realises that the unvaccinated persons in a family or community are picked out by Variola minor, with a corresponding realisation of the value of vaccination. As to observation of contacts, however, the unvaccinated person (i.e., the person most liable to infection) strongly objects to being " stood off " from work as a contact with a case during the incubation period of the disease. It is characteristic of the employers in the City that " standing off " of a contact, in the vast majority of cases, has been accompanied by full pay. Of course, there is no necessity to " stand off " a contact during the long incubation period. It is, however, for a trader to decide whether he will or will not do this without considering dates of possible infection and outbreak in the contact employee, which are sometimes problematical. I have never advised and would not sponsor such a course as " standing off." From the trader's point of view, however, the fear of possible dislocation of trade, consequent on the removal of a case of actual Small-pox from the place of business, is formidable to many a business undertaking. On the one hand, it would be neither fair or preventive that the head of the firm should not know the possibilities ; on the other, lies the resultant possible disability to the contact. Any contempt of the disease in the minor form may lead to severe difficulty should the major form appear concurrently with this in the community ; such a state may obtain at any time, although knowledge and application of vaccination as the one great preventive measure has spread with astonishing rapidity in those endemic Small-pox centres in the world which can at once demonstrate the efficiency of the measure, and afford fire for the touchwood want of vaccination affords. "... it is difficult and imprudent to be dogmatic when confronted with the early cases as to what kind of Variola one is dealing with." This quotation from the said report is in reference to an area newly infected with either type of disease, but would apply with redoubled force to every case if concurrency of the major and minor disease were threatened or in being. The conclusion of the report quoted, in reference to Post Vaccinal Encephalitis, emphasizes the extreme rarity of its occurrence and "... that it should not be allowed in any way to diminish the confidence placed hitherto in the use of vaccination as a preventive of Variola " ; further, seeing that the majority of cases occur in children of school age, "... unless children of school age have been exposed to infection from Small-pox patients, it is undesirable that they should at that age be vaccinated for the first time." The approved technique of vaccination now requires one mark only, without cross hatching, of ¼ inch in length, confined entirely to epidermal tissue and in the long axis of the limb. c 2 16 SUMMARY OF SMALL-POX FOR THE YEAR ENDING 31st DECEMBER, 1930. The customary disinfection, where necessary, was carried out, and those persons, resident or employed in the City, who had been in contact with cases of Small-pox were supervised. The total number of cases (including missed cases) notified or reported to this Department during the period ended 31st December, 1930, was 287, made up as follows:— Resident and removed from City premises 6 Resident in the City but removed from premises or institutions outside the City 4 Non-resident but removed from City premises 0 Non-resident but removed from O.P. Dept., St. Bartholomew's Hospital 25 Non-resident but employed in the City 228 Non-resident but who attended the O.P. Department, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and who were diagnosed as suffering from Chicken-pox and sent home, being subsequently removed by local Medical Officers of Health as suffering from Small-pox 4 Non-resident but employed in the City, who were contacts to other cases, and who, for the latter reason, had been instructed by their employers to remain away from work 52 Returned as " Not Small-pox " :— (a) Non-residents but employed in the City 4 (b) Non-residents removed from O.P. Department of St. mew's Hospital2 The total number of persons in contact with cases ascertained or notified during the period ended 31st December, 1930, was 7,516, made up as follows:— Notified to this Department by Medical Officers of Health of the districts from which the cases were removed :— (a) City residents 34 (b) Non-residents employed in the City 2,285 In contact with cases resident in the City or removed from City premises (including St. Bartholomew's Hospital):— (a) City residents 975 (b) Non-residents 38 In contact with cases not resident but employed in the City and notified to the appropriate Medical Officers of Health if resident outside the City:— (a) City residents 24 (b) Non-residents 4,160 RECEPTION AND TREATMENT OF MEASLES AND SCARLET FEVER. In consequence of the demand for hospital accommodation in London, resulting from the many cases of Small-pox notified, the Metropolitan Asylums Board were compelled to put into operation a scheme of selection of cases of measles and scarlet fever. Consequently these cases could only be admitted to hospital after they ha d been referred to the appropriate medical officer of health, with a view to his selecting those cases which, in his opinion, should be removed to hospital having regard to all the circumstances. The following were the considerations which were set out as a guide to assist in selection in regard to cases of measles :— 1. Where, because of the type of house, proper care is not possible. 2. Where the age of the child is that of high mortality, viz., at, or about, two years. 3. Where broncho-pneumonia co-exists with the measles. In regard to scarlet fever, the selection depended largely on the home conditions, i.e., whether the patient resided in a tenement, a house attached to a shop, a boarding-house, or an hotel. Measles is not a notifiable disease, and medical men, therefore, are not always aware that hospital accommodation is available at all, either conditionally or unconditionally, and I, therefore, addressed an appropriate communication to members of the profession practising within the City, and inviting them to communicate with me in cases where hospital treatment was desired in cases of measles, and drawing their attention to the conditions under which admission could only be secured for measles and scarlet fever patients. The necessity for selection ceased in May, and medical men were informed accordingly. 17 nursing provisions. Measles, etc.—The Corporation has approved of the expenditure of £25 per annum in respect of the nursing of complicated cases of Measles, Encephalitis Lethargica and Cerebrospinal Fever, and have also agreed to expend the sum of £30 on provision of medical assistance and nursing attendance in necessitous cases of Influenza. No action was necessary under this heading during 1930. TYPHOID FEVER AND SHELLFISH. One instance of suggested association of Typhoid Fever with the consumption of shellfish was brought to my notice during 1930. A resident in one of the adjoining metropolitan boroughs was reported as suffering from Typhoid Fever and, through enquiries made locally, it was ascertained that the patient had eaten winkles some little while before being taken ill. The winkles in question were purchased in Billingsgate Market, where it was found that it was not possible to identify the source, since the dealer received his supplies from various parts of England, Scotland and Ireland. The attention of the Fishmonger's Company was directed to the incident, however, as that Authority are conducting a special examination of raw winkles on their arrival in London. I am informed by the Clerk to the Company that in no instance was there any suggestion of the presence of any members of the Typhoid Group in the raw winkles examined. distribution of diphtheria anti-toxin and anti-influenza vaccine. Although City medical practitioners are well aware of the facilities available, no applications for supplies of diphtheria anti-toxin or anti-influenza vaccine were received during 1930. Examination for Pathogenic Bacteria.—During the year the following specimens were so dealt with. It will be seen that positive results were obtained in about 24 per cent, of these cases. Result. Specimen. Disease suspected. Positive. Negative. 46 Swabbings from throats Diphtheria 8 37 23 Sputa Tuberculosis 5 18 This is the first year since the practice was adopted that no swabbings from throats were received from the Central Foundation School for Girls, Spital Square, E.C. provision of insulin. In accordance with the request made by the Authorities of the University College Hospital, Insulin has been supplied to one patient residing in the City, who attended that hospital. The Corporation has power to make this provision under Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, but, so far as I am aware, this is the first occasion on which those powers have been put into operation. The sanction of the Ministry of Health was obtained, but this was limited to a period of twelve months, and certain requirements were attached to the consent. At the moment of writing this report, application is being made to the Minister for extension of the period. The arrangement has worked very satisfactorily. temporary isolation accommodation. The removal of the Special Centre for the treatment of Venereal Diseases from 20-21, Golden Lane, has enabled that building to again revert to the purpose for which it was originally erected, i.e., a shelter for temporary accommodation in connection with infectious diseases, and for isolation and observation purposes in connection with Small-pox contacts. The premises reserved for this purpose during the past few years at 29, Middlesex Street, have now been vacated. Part of 20-21, Golden Lane are also used as residential quarters for one of the Sanitary Inspectors attached to my staff, in order that there shall be such an officer readily available in case of emergency. TUBERCULOSIS. The hours at which the Dispensary was open for diagnosis and treatment of Tuberculosis during the year was subject to slight alteration to those at which it was open in past years, and such alteration has been found to be both convenient to the Hospital and an advantage to the patients. The new hours are:— Tuesdays 12.30 p.m.—2.30 p.m. 2.30 p.m.—4.30 p.m. For the Artificial Pneumothorax Clinic. Wednesdays 5.0 p.m.—7.0 p.m. Fridays 11.30 a.m. (New cases only.) „ 2.0 p.m.—3.0 p.m. 18 In all, 260 sessions have been held, and, in addition, the Tuberculosis Officer has visited cases at their homes when necessary. New Patients.—The number of new patients examined was 407, as compared with 346 last year. Patients Referred to the Hospital.—The following is the summary of patients referred to the various departments of St. Bartholomew's Hospital for help in diagnosis or treatment:— Resident. Non-Resident. Total. Referred to X-Ray Department 42 150 192 „ Surgical „ 4 7 11 „ Dental „ 1 3 4 „ Throat „ 4 16 20 „ Pathological „ - 3 3 „ Other „ 10 19 29 61 198 259 Patients Admitted to the Hospital for Diagnosis.-—The wards of the Hospital are available for the reception of cases presenting difficulties of diagnosis, which can only be overcome by observation as In-patients. Eight resident and 17 non-resident patients were admitted for this purpose. Examination of Sputum.—The following is a summary:— City Residents. Non-Residents. Total. Positive 2 32 34 Negative 20 113 133 Residential Treatment.—The number of patients for whom residential treatment was Arranged was 82. Admitted to L.C.C. Institutions. Hospitals of Local Authorities.

This system has worked satisfactorily. Persons Treated and Supervised at the Dispensary.—(i.) Patients resident in the City. All persons suffering from Tuberculosis who are resident in the City may be supervised and treated at the Dispensary. The total number of cases so treated and referred to as patients on the register in Table on page 21 is 54. In addition, 74 contacts are kept under observation. (ii.) Patients non-resident in the City. (a) Who work in the City. On diagnosis, these patients are informed that they can be treated and advised at the Dispensary or transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. The majority decide to remain patients at the Dispensary. (b) Who do not work in the Citv. On diagnosis, these patients are usually transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. The total number of cases so transferred was 123. Total Attendances:— Total. Residents 407 Non-Residents 1,118 1,525 In view of the fact that the cases in the last stages of the disease are extremely infectious, especially in crowded houses, the Corporation have made arrangements to pay for the maintenance of selected City cases at St. Columba's Hospital, Swiss Cottage. These facilities were not utilised in 1930. 19 Artificial Pneumothorax.—Artificial pneumothorax treatment has been used again during the year. Artificial pneumothorax was induced in three cases and 144 Refills done in connection with the Dispensary. The Tuberculosis Nurse.—As an adjunct to the work at the Tuberculosis Clinic, the outside work of the Tuberculosis Nurse has been continued on the same lines as former years. Seventy-six homes have been visited, and 637* visits made in connection with after-care and following up. In addition to the above, patients, some of whom were in an advanced stage of the disease, have been nursed in their own homes. For this purpose 88 nursing visits were made. General.—The following information is supplied in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health :— (i.) The Tuberculosis Dispensary is at St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the Tuberculosis Officer is Dr. F. H. Young, O.B.E. ; one Tuberculosis Nurse is engaged in the work. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for insured and uninsured persons by the London County Council. (ii.) Patients are referred to the Tuberculosis Dispensary from hospitals, school clinics and other institutions, with all of which there is close co-operation. The services of the Staff and all the resources of St. Bartholomew's Hospital are available for diagnosis and treatment. Many patients are referred to departments of the Hospital for these purposes. (iii.) The Tuberculosis Officer is in constant consultation and communication with general practitioners, so that there is close co-operation between them and the Dispensary. He reminds them when reports are due on insured patients under domiciliary treatment and provides them with copies of the form with names and addresses inserted. (iv.) When the diagnosis is in doubt and the patient is under the care of a practitioner, arrangements are made with him for re-examination ; in other cases arrangements are made with the patient, but should he fail to attend, either the Tuberculosis Nurse calls upon him or he is reminded of the appointment in writing. (v.) The Tuberculosis Officer explains to the patients the importance of the examination of home contacts, and in addition to the necessary visits of the Sanitary Inspectors, the Tuberculosis Nurse visits the homes of City residents periodically for the same purpose, and arranges for the attendance of the contacts at the Dispensary at times convenient to them. The supervision of these contacts and the re-examination of suspects among them is secured by the home visits periodically made by the Nurse. (vi.) Considerable use is made of X-rays from the point of view of diagnosis and decision as to method of treatment to be recommended. The usual methods of treatment have been continued in the Dispensary. Tuberculin has been used in a few cases. In addition, 18 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are attending for the continuation of their treatment by artificial pneumothorax and inductions of the treatment have been performed in several cases in the wards of the Hospital. (vii.) Experience shows that when the disease is active, residence in an institution more quickly and certainly brings about arrest than when the treatment is attempted at home on sanatorium lines, and that the lessons learnt in the sanatorium are sometimes put into practice by the patient on his return home to his permanent advantage. (viii.) Dental treatment is provided by the Dental Department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the Corporation defrays the whole or part of the cost of artificial dentures for necessitous cases. (ix.) Nursing in their own homes of patients resident in the City is one of the duties of the Tuberculosis Nurse. Milk has been provided for necessitous persons requiring extra nourishment and in this connection the sum of about £31 has been expended. (x.) Patients suffering from Non-pulmonary Tuberculosis receive advice and treatment from the Surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, to whom they are referred from the Dispensary. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for as pulmonary cases. The Corporation supplies surgical apparatus free of cost for necessitous residents in the City. (xi.) The arrangements for " care " and " after-care " are carried out by a subcommittee of the Sanitary Committee, on which two ladies are co-opted as members.† It receives detailed reports on all cases of Tuberculosis occurring among City residents. * It will be apparent that the number of visits paid by the Tuberculosis Nurse in 1930 are considerably higher than in previous years. This is accounted for by the fact that during the early part of 1930 a Locum Tenens was appointed in consequence of the illness of the Tuberculosis Nurse, and this Officer, in order to make herself acquainted, with as little delay as possible, with the City Patients, concentrated on home visitations. On the Nurse's return to duty, a further concentration was made on visits in order to pick up the work again. † The present lady members of the Committee are Lady Cooper, O.B.E., Miss Crosby, M.B.E., and Lady Smith. 20 (xii.) No local arrangements exist for providing employment for patients. (xiii.) No opportunity has arisen for the use of a shelter, but arrangements would be made for any suitable case if a site was available. (xiv.) No special points have been noted as to the incidence of Tuberculosis; the records do not show that the disease is specially prevalent among any class of workers in the City. (xv.) The usual method for preventing the spread of infection is adopted, and pocket sputum flasks are provided free of cost. (xvi.) The principal difficulty encountered occurs on the discharge of a patient from a sanatorium with the disease quiescent. The home environment to which he returns is often unsatisfactory; suitable occupation near his home may be practically unobtainable, even when remuneration is not the main consideration, and the very considerable benefit gained is in some cases soon lost and the treatment in the sanatorium largely wasted. (xvii.) Difficulties also arise with regard to advanced cases. These are usually very infectious and do not care to go to the Infirmary. This has been largely remedied by the arrangement made by the Corporation already referred to. The following table sets out the number of cases both of Pulmonary and Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis, which were brought to my notice during the year 1930, and also the total number of deaths from Tuberculosis among City residents during the same period:— Age Periods.

Arrangements have been made that the facilities available at the Tuberculosis Dispensary shall be placed at the disposal of the College of Nursing, in order that that body can give to their Health Visitor Students a short course of practical experience in Tuberculosis work as undertaken by a Tuberculosis nurse. These will doubtless prove of considerable value in the future training of Health Visitors. PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1925. It has not been necessary during the year to take any action in regard to the above. mentioned Regulations, which provide for the exercise of some control over persons suffering from Tuberculous affections and who are engaged in certain occupations associated with the milk trade. 26 VENEREAL DISEASES. The Special Centre for the Treatment of Venereal Diseases which, in accordance with the powers under the Public Health (Venereal Diseases) Regulations, 1916, the City Corporation established at 20/21, Golden Lane—previously occupied as a shelter and specially altered to meet the requirements—was transferred to St. Bartholomew's Hospital on the 17th February, 1930. This step was deemed expedient for economic and other reasons, and it is satisfactory to note that the number of persons availing themselves of the opportunity afforded has, since that date, shown marked increase, the total number of new cases in the year being 1,073, as compared with an average, during the previous four years, of 456. This exceeded the peak period of 1920. The following is a brief summary of the work carried out during the year 1930 :— At the beginning of the year 417 males and 123 females were registered on the books as being under treatment or observation, which compares with 324 males and 98 females at the beginning of the previous year. Of these patients 234 males and 92 females were under treatment for syphilis and 183 males and 31 females for gonorrhoea. No patients were under treatment for conditions other than venereal disease. New patients admitted totalled 1,073 as compared with 498 in the previous year, and 476 in 1928 and 476 in 1927. 61 males and 19 females suffering from syphilis discharged themselves before completing the first course, and 32 males and 10 females after completing the first course, but before completion of treatment. 19 males and 12 females completed treatment, but failed to submit themselves to final test; 11 males and 3 females were transferred to other centres after treatment for syphilis, whilst no males and no females were discharged after completion of treatment and observation. In the case of gonorrhoea, 195 males and 21 females, out of the total of 516 and 60 of the respective sexes coming under treatment during the year for the first time, discharged themselves before completion of the first course of treatment. There were 11 in.patients The total number of attendances of all persons at the clinic was 20,694, which total is made ud as follows :— SyDhilis. Soft Chancre. Gonorrhoea. Non.Veneral Conditions. Total Attendances. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. 7,423 3,353 . . 8,631 881 292 114 16,346 4,348 In the laboratories associated with the Centre, 8,212 specimens were examined, 33 for the detection of spirochetes, 1,167 for gonococci, 6,840 examinations for the Wassermann or Sigma test, and 172 for other examinations. The following tabulation indicates the number of patients coming under treatment for the first time from the Counties stated, and also the examinations which were made for the detection of Spirochetes, of Gonococci and for the Wassermann or Sigma test in respect of these patients :— For Syphilis.

The above.mentioned Act has thrown upon the Department of the Medical Officer of Health two principal additional duties. 1. The execution of the functions lately performed by the Board of Guardians in respect of Vaccination, and 2. The extension of the scope of the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, to embrace relief formerly given under the aegis of the Poor Law. In regard to 1, the Sanitary Committee, in varying the control, determined not to alter the practice which had been in successful operation for many years, and Dr. H. J. Sequeira was appointed to continue to act as Public Vaccinator, and Mr. J. G. Wall as Vaccination Officer. The problem of the provision of a suitable Vaccination Station offered no difficulty, as ready facilities were available in the Shelter building at Golden Lane, only just vacated by the Special Centre for the treatment of Venereal Diseases. In regard to No. 2, under the Act, although the London County Council have responsibility in cases in which assistance is sought, it has power to make arrangements with the Corporation for the provision by them under the Maternity and Child Welfare Act, 1918, of any assistance which would be provided either by way of Poor Relief or by the Maternity and Child Welfare Act. From enquiry I was satisfied that there had been little or no demand for Poor Law assistance in connection with Maternity and Child Welfare of recent years. I formed the opinion that the majority of such claims as did arise could be dealt with as part of the existing organisation controlling the work, with the exception of possible demands for lying.in accommodation for expectant mothers. I accordingly approached the Authorities of St. Bartholomew's Hospital and an agreement has been entered into for the provision of :— 1. Lying.in accommodation for such persons residing in the City as may claim it, as Poor Law relief, at a fee of £2 2s. 0d. per week for in.patient treatment. 2. Consultation at the Hospital Ante.Natal Clinic for such persons at 10s. 6d. for each case, irrespective of the number of attendances, and 3. Medical and nursing attention at confinements at the patient's home at £1 1s. 0d. for each case, irrespective of the number of attendances. The Hospital Authorities were not able to provide such ambulance service as might in emergencies be required, and, although I do not anticipate that there will be any call for it, I have entered into an agreement with the London County Council whereby the Ambulance service of that Authority will be available at a fee of 10s. per case, plus 5s. if the services of a nurse are needed. CONGRESS—ROYAL SANITARY INSTITUTE—MARGATE. CONGRESS OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTE PUBLIC H EALTH—PORTSMOUTH. The above.mentioned two Congresses were held at Margate and Portsmouth from the 21st to the 28th June, and from the 4th to the 9th June, respectively, and the Sanitary Committee of the City Corporation were represented on both occasions by their Chairman, Mr. Bertrand Johnson, now Mr. Deputy Johnson, the late Chairman, Mr. H. J. Gower, and your Medical Officer of Health. Many papers were read on public health and kindred subjects, and both Congresses may be regarded as complete successes, affording, as they did, opportunity for discussion and the interchange of view of those interested in the health problems met with in every part of the world. CONGRESS—SANITARY INSPECTORS' ASSOCIATION—ILFRACOMBE. The Sanitary Inspectors' Association Conference, held at Ilfracombe from the 1st to the 5th September last, was attended by one of the Officers of my Department, in accordance with permission granted by the Sanitary Committee. E 30 HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. A system of voluntary registration of hairdressers' establishments with the Department of the Medical Officer of Health was instituted in 1904. The following is a list of establishments at present on the register :— Alfred Kingston, 8 and 10, Ludgate Arcade. Charles Lehman, 8 and 9, Aldermanbury Postern. Thos. W. Monk, 5, Angel Court. Ed. Hy. Price, 69, Fore Street. Samuel & Harry Cohen, trading as Cohen & Co., 120, Newgate Street. SMOKE AND ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Six complaints of smoke nuisance or annoyance from chimneys were dealt with during the year. Some of these were of a temporary character and did not recur. There has been no occasion to take further action. A critical examination of the air in the City was commenced in the year 1914, in conjunction with the Committee for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, appointed by the International Exhibition and Conference in London, 1912. A large rain gauge is mounted upon the roof of one of the Corporation's buildings in Golden Lane, and the rain.water from a known area of surface is collected monthly. This rain.water, containing the soot, grit, and dust washed from the air, has been submitted for examination to the Public Analyst and the results tabulated. For comparison the results obtained from similar observations made at the Meteorological Office, South Kensington, on the west, and Victoria Park, on the east of the rain gauge at Golden Lane, are shown in the attached table. The table also shows the rainfall for the months of January to December of the year 1930, and the amounts found of insoluble matter, tar, soot, and dust, also the soluble matter, together with the sulphates, ammonia and chlorine in the volume collected. The results as given by the Public Analyst have been re.calculated into metric tons per square kilometre during each month. In addition to the foregoing, a daily observation has been made at mid.day at the Guildhall of the purity of the air by a modern dry method, by which the suspended matter can be readily demonstrated. From the 1st January until the 31st December the amount of the impurity at noon has varied from half.milligramme to ten milligrammes per cubic metre of air ; this latter figure includes times when there has been a fog. 31 SUMMARY OF MONTHLY OBSERVATIONS AND REPORTS DURING THE YEAR 1930.

The Greater London Joint Smoke Abatement Committee, in the early part of the year, recommended for adoption by Local Authorities, under Section 2 of the Public Health Smoke Abatement Act, 1926, a draft bye.law, of which the following is a copy :— "Bye law made in pursuance of Section 2 of the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, by the (Name of Authority) "Whereas Section 2 of the Public Health (Smoke Abatement) Act, 1926, provides that any Local Authority may make Bye.laws regulating the emission of smoke of such colour, density or content, as may be prescribed by the Bye.laws, and that where such Bye.laws are in force for such period as may be prescribed in the Bye.laws, either from buildings generally to which the enactments relating to smoke nuisance apply, or from such classes of those buildings as may be so prescribed, shall until the contrary is proved be presumed to be a nuisance:— "The (Name of Authority) do by this Bye.law prescribe that the emission of black smoke for a period of two minutes in the aggregate within any continuous period of thirty minutes from any one chimney of a building other than a private dwelling house shall until the contrary is proved be presumed to be a nuisance." This was the second occasion on which a similar bye.law has been considered by the Sanitary Committee of the City Corporation, who are of opinion that such a bye.law is undesirable in the City of London, inasmuch as it is clear that it would permit, without penalty, the continuous emission of smoke for one and three quarter minutes in every halfhour, and that in a congested area this would create a very real nuisance. In view of the fact that every infringement of the requirements of the Act is to be dealt with on its merits, the setting up of any hard.and.fast rule as to the time during which the emission of smoke might be permitted, would appear to me to be very undesirable. In certain areas, doubtless, a time limit such as that suggested by the proposed bye.law might be of assistance, and perhaps be regarded as a compromise between the needs of the manufacturer and the requirements of Public Health, but if it were put into operation in the City of London, it would quickly become generally known that practically any kind of smoke could be emitted for nearly two minutes in any half.hour ; restaurateurs in the City might take that opportunity of burning rubbish, etc., with an effect that can well be imagined. The Act, as it stands, gives power to deal with cases of nuisance created by chimneys which come within its scope, and in this condition the matter might well be left. 33 CREMATIONS. The following table shows the number of cremations which have taken place in the several crematoria in Great Britain since the practice was permitted by law in 1885. Although a steady rate of progress is maintained, one would prefer to see cremations adopted on the more general scale which exists in some of the Continental countries. In Germany, for instance, 53,979 cremations took place during 1930, and it will be seen that this figure is actually more than a thousand in excess of the number cremated in Great Britain in 45 years. This method of disposal is largely in use in Czecho.Slovakia, Scandinavia and Switzerland, and one feels that it is only a matter of time before education will overcome the sentiment, natural prejudice and tradition, which are responsible for the difficulties experienced in impressing upon the public the advantages of cremation.

Samples Collected at Railway Stations. A further series of samples of milk arriving in the City of London from the country was collected at Liverpool Street Station in September and October last, and submitted to Sir Frederick Andrewes, K.B.E., the City Bacteriologist, for bacteriological examination and investigation as to the presence of dirt. A duplicate of each sample was submitted to Mr. A. J. C. Lickorish, F.I.C., the Public Analyst for the City, for chemical examination. Every precaution was taken in collection to ensure that the samples were not contaminated during the process. Forty.eight samples were collected, and these were sent from different farms, situated in the following counties :— Norfolk 28 Suffolk 14 Essex 4 Cambridgeshire 2 Total 48 The following is a summary of Sir Frederick Andrewes' report on the result of bacteriological examination :— Summary and Remarks. Of 48 samples, 25 or 52% were microscopically clean. „ „ 20 or 41% showed a small trace of blackish deposit, which I have charted as " a trace of dirt." „ „ 3 or 6% had a more definite trace, and could not be regarded as perfectly clean milks. This result, as regards cleanliness of the milk, is, I think, satisfactory, and is in marked contrast with what one used to see twelve or fifteen years ago. One guinea.pig was missing at the close of the experiment, but this in no way vitiates the results in the remaining 47—on which the percentage of tubercle must be calculated. Two guinea.pigs were found suffering from tubercle as the result of injecting the milk (deposit and cream)—4.2%. One other animal had a non.tuberculous abscess. The details in connection with the samples from which the guinea.pigs, found to be affected with tubercle, were inoculated, were forwarded to the appropriate Medical Officers of Health, and the following are extracts from reports which have been received indicating the conditions subsequently ascertained at the farm from which the milk was despatched. Sample No. 9.—I made an inspection of the herd, together with one of our Veterinary Surgeons. Five samples of milk were taken, and I have to.day received the results, which are as follows :— Samples marked Redwing, Snap and Spikehorn.—The samples of milk have been examined by animal inoculation and tubercle bacilli have not been found. Samples marked Ella and Muriel.—The samples of milk have been examined by animal inoculation and tubercle bacilli have been found. The post.mortem examination of both guinea.pigs inoculated with milk from the two above samples showed marked tubercular lesions of inguinal, popliteal and lumbar glands, with spleen infection. This information has been transmitted to the Suffolk Diseases of Animals Act Committee. I was subsequently notified that the two animals, Ella and Muriel, were slaughtered, and the following report of the veterinary inspector indicates the conditions found on post.mortem examination :— Red Cow "Ella."—Good condition. Super.mammary glands. Inguinal glands and mesenteric affected—very slight on thorax wall. Cow in milk. Giving tuberculous milk and showing lesions of tuberculosis. Post.mortem examination showed that disease was advanced. Roan Cow " Muriel."—Good condition. Glands as above affected, thoracic wall affected. Cow in milk. Giving tuberculous milk and showing lesions of tuberculosis. Post.mortem examination showed that disease was advanced. Sample No. 11.—I have to.day inspected the herd of 46 cows. Have sent a sample of milk from two cows slightly suspicious only to the Ipswich Laboratory for microscopical and biological examination. Am quite prepared to believe, however, that the cow giving tubercular milk on Sept. 29th is already dead. For, on October 8th, I inspected a cow on this farm, named " Honeysuckle," affected with pneumonia. As I had reasons to believe it was tubercular pneumonia, and as she had an indurated udder suspicious of same disease, I advised the immediate slaughter, and when post.mortemed the report was that she had generalised tuberculosis. 35 Also, on Oct. 10th, six cows were sold to a dealer, whilst on October 17th another cow was slaughtered owing to her being unthrifty. Consequently, as there is some doubt as to whether the diseased cow is still in the herd, I wonder if you would like me to send you (or have tested) another bulk sample, so if the two samples I have sent away prove negative, we shall know about the same time whether the herd is still giving tubercular milk or not. The examination of the samples from the two suspected cows shows :— No. 1. G.P. showed no lesions. No. 2. The guinea.pig inoculated with this milk showed tubercular lesions of spleen, but not glandular involvement. This may be due to a pre.existing disease of the pig. Further samples are to be taken from cow No. 2. For purposes of comparison the following summary of results, obtained since the examination of milk on arriving in the City was first considered in 1904, is here inserted. Year.

In one case the sample was found to be deficient in fat to the extent of 17 per cent., and proceedings were instituted against the consignor. The case was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act, with three guineas costs against the defendant. The other case showed 2 per cent. of extraneous water. A further sample was taken, which proved to be of genuine milk. MEAT INSPECTION. The report under this heading has been prepared by your Veterinary Officer, Lt..Colonel T. Dunlop Young.

For some years past, it has been recognised that the method of transport used in connection with unsound meat has not been in accord with modern public health ideas, and negotiations have been conducted with the object of effecting improvement in this department of food control in the City. These have resulted in the substitution of the old horse. drawn vehicles by modern steel tank vans drawn by a tractor, the advantages of which may be summarised as follows :— 1. Ease of loading and unloading. 2. Ease of cleansing. 3. Increased carrying capacity (5 tons in comparison with 1 or 2 tons). 4. Rapidity of transport. 5. Security in transit, as vans are provided with a lock. 6. No leakage of offensive liquid. The illustrations inset will clearly indicate these advantages.

The Corporation is recognised to have valuable material and educational resources at its disposal at Smithfield Market, access to which is of great importance to students desiring to qualify for any of the public appointments requiring a knowledge of meat and its several affections. A scheme has been prepared under which facilities are made available to the several teaching institutions in London and its vicinity. 44 FISH SUPPLIES. 228,707 tons of fish, of which 207,121 were land-borne and 21,586 water-borne, were received at or near Billingsgate Market during the year.

The supervision of the meat markets and other premises within the scope of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, has continued on lines similar to past years. Smithfield Market.—The general conditions at Smithfield Market in respect of the transport and handling of meat continues to show steady improvement. Carriers.— In this class of transport considerable advancement has been made, and this is evidenced by the number of specially designed new vehicles which have been placed in commission during the past year. In general the cleanliness of these vehicles is of a high standard. It should be pointed out that this improvement has been obtained owing to the direct supervision it is possible to maintain with these vehicles, which are seen daily at the market. Butchers' Own Vehicles.—The majority of the vehicles in this class leave much to be desired with regard to cleanliness, the general attitude being to observe scrupulous cleanliness with regard to the outside of the vehicle at the expense of the inside, it often being considered sufficient to cleanse the inside of the vehicle once a week, and in some cases once in 14 days, and then sometimes with a hose pipe only. Difficulty is experienced in keeping an efficient supervision over these vehicles, owing to their number and the varying hours at which each individual vehicle appears at Smithfield Market, some vehicles not being observed for nearly two years. In this respect considerable help could be given if all Local Authorities instituted periodical inspections of butchers' vehicles when carrying out their routine inspection of the shops. It has been noticed that often the butcher with the dirty vehicle vends his commodities in a satisfactory shop. Sufficient thought is not given to the question of contamination by butchers; the general observation that is made by the butcher when confronted with evidence of contamination in his vehicle and on his meat is to the effect that it is only road dust. G 2 48 Private Cars.—This class of transport is showing a gradual increase despite the efforts that are made to eliminate the use of such vehicles, which vary from the " baby car " to the high-priced limousine. In each case it has been observed that uncovered meat has been thrown carelessly on the upholstered seats and on to the floor mat, no thought being given to the contamination that must arise from such methods. It is difficult to accost the butchers who transport their meat in this manner owing to the quickness with which the operation is carried out. Railway Vehicles.—The conditions under which meat is conveyed by the Railway Companies has not given much need for action, although occasionally observations have been made which point to lack of supervision on the part of responsible persons. These, however, have not been numerous and have been rectified immediately they have been reported. Handling.—(a) Licensed, Porters.—The improvement reported last year has been maintained. (b) Retail Butchers and their Employees.—These continue to be responsible for the majority of the contraventions in respect of the requirements in regard to the wearing of clean and washable overalls and head coverings, and supervision is being kept in this regard. Aldgate Market.—The general condition of this market shows considerable improvement. Occasionally minor contraventions occur which are pointed out and remedied immediately. With regard to the transport, it has been observed that the use of the zinc-lined handbarrows is diminishing and that more butchers are employing the meat carriers to transport their meat from the market to their shops. Handling of meat by persons not wearing clean and washable overalls is still prevalent, in spite of the exhibition of an extract of the Regulations in Hebrew, which appears in each shop. Wholesale and Retail Butchers' Shops.—Further improvements have been made in several of the above premises, and the high standard of cleanliness reported last year has been maintained. It has been reported that certain butchers lend meat to City Restaurants for show purposes. This matter is being dealt with on the special merits of each case, but it is generally found that the meat is conveyed and stored under such conditions that comply with the Regulations. Distribution Centres for Restaurants.—These premises continue to be conducted in a satisfactory manner. Although in practically each case the premises are not sufficiently extensive to cope with the amount of business carried on, no serious contravention has been reported. Premises Used for the Manufacture of Sausages and Meat Products.—These premises continue to improve, and it can be said that the Food Factories in the City are clean and hygienic. In the case of one factory, improvements are now in course of completion which will bring it as nearly to the standard of a model factory as possible. The type of employee is improving, and the question of personal cleanliness is found to be satisfactory, every endeavour being made by the employers to ensure that this is maintained. Premises Used for the Curing of Hams and Tongues.—These premises are in a satisfactory state of cleanliness and periodical inspections help to maintain this standard. Bacon Shops. In respect of this class of shop there is still room for improvement, sufficient care not being taken to protect the bacon from exposure and contamination by other commodities. Bacon Stores and Curing Stoves.—These businesses continue to be carried on in accordance with the requirements of the Regulations, and in the case of one firm, new vehicles have been put into commission, which compare favourably with the best type in use at Smithfield Market. Transport and Handling of Irish Meat.—This trade has not shown any appreciable improvement since last year's report. General Observations.—The method of transport and handling of meat at the City Markets shows a steady improvement, but conditions are still a long way from the standard aimed at when the Regulations were first instituted.

During the year under review, 1,012 samples of Food and Drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Of this number, 749 were taken as informal or test samples, without the formalities of the Act being observed. Seventeen of these informal samples were reported against, as follows:— 4 of Cakes (containing cream), out of 13 samples. 4 of Sausages, out of 55. 2 of Vinegar, out of 21. 2 of Medicated Tablets, out of 5. 1 of Butter (on bread), out of 19. 1 of Crushed Linseed, out of 5. 1 of Sulphur Ointment, out of 5. 1 of Tincture of Iodine, out of 2. 1 of Crystallised Fruit, out of 10. Of the formal samples, 23 out of 263 were reported against, as follows:— 13 of Milk, out of 206 samples. 2 of Butter (on bread), out of 2. 2 of Sausages, out of 3. 1 of Rum, out of 10. 1 of Whisky, out of 13. 1 of Crushed Linseed, out of 1. 1 of Medicated Tablets, out of 1. 1 of Cakes (containing cream), out of 2. 1 of Vinegar, out of 2. The above-mentioned samples, with the exception of Milk, Rum and Whisky, were taken as the result of informal samples having been reported against. General Observations.—The percentage rate of adulteration of all foods and drugs sampled in the City was 3.9, as compared with 3.8 in 1929. Butter.—All of the 23 samples of butter taken were certified to be genuine. The butter factories were visited at various times and samples taken from the packing tables and from bulk awaiting dispatch. Twenty-one samples of butter spread on bread or scone, or served with rolls, were purchased for analysis, of which three samples were reported against, one being an informal sample and two formal samples. There were two prosecutions relating to such purchases, one sample containing 25 per cent. of fat not derived from milk, whilst the other was certified to be 100 per cent. margarine. In each case the vendor was fined £2 and £2 2s. 0d. costs. Drugs.—Of the 132 samples procured, seven were reported against. With reference to two informal samples, where the deficiencies of the essential ingredients were found to be small in amount, the formal samples taken in connection with them proved to be genuine. One vendor was prosecuted where the article sold was found not to comply with the requirements of the British Pharmacopoeia, and legal proceedings were also successfully taken against the vendor and the manufacturers of an article sold which was deficient in the amounts of ingredients stated on the container. Spirits.—Twenty-nine samples of spirits were taken. Two of these were certified to be below the minimum strength of 35 degrees under proof, and legal proceedings were taken against the vendors. One case was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act on payment of costs, and in the other instance a penalty was imposed with costs. Cream.—None of the 11 samples of cream sold in tins or cartons was reported against. The following details show the percentage fat content found in each sample:— Description of Article. Percentage of Fat Content. Tinned Cream 24.68 Average Fat Content, 24.28%. ,, ,, 23.18 „ ,, 26.05 „ „ 23.24 Fresh Cream sold in carton 56.04 Average Fat Content, 46.96%. ,, ,, ,, 48.19 ,, ,, ,, 36.66 Devonshire Cream 59.54 „ ,, .... .... .... 64.39 (Average Fat Content, 62.32%. ,, ,, .... .... .... 62.71 ,, ,, .... .... .... 62.64 51 This analysis shows in average fat content of cream—this fat, of course, being the delectable, nutritionally important and desirable ingredient—that the cream labelled "Devonshire" is about three times the worth of tinned cream, and the fresh (in cartons) about twice, the ratios of intrinsic value bulk for bulk being something like 25: 45: 60. This disparity in intrinsic values in the substance labelled cream is startling, although, of course, the fewness of the samples does not permit a stressing of the fat content in the classes named. The methods of manufacture of the finished product are, however, such as would lead to an enhanced value, as suggested by the samples. Eight informal samples of articles, such as cream pastries, declared to contain cream, were purchased, and four were certified to be genuine. A formal sample which was taken in connection with an informal purchase previously reported against, was found to be genuine; whilst in two instances it was not possible to obtain formal samples, as the sale of the article had been discontinued. One formal sample, taken in respect of an informal sample which had been reported against, was the subject of legal proceedings. The case was part heard and adjourned pending the result of a High Court appeal in a similar case. The proceedings were still outstanding at the close of the year. Ice Cream.—Five samples were submitted for analysis and none were reported against. The samples were found to contain butter fat in amounts varying from 11.02 to 15.05 per cent. Public Health (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations.—All samples of food taken were examined for the detection of food preservatives, and only in two classes of food, sausages and crystallised fruit, were the Regulations contravened. Fifty-eight samples of sausages were procured, and six of these were reported against as containing the permitted preservative without declaration, but in no case was the maximum amount allowed by the Regulations, viz., 450 parts per million, exceeded. The attention of the vendor was drawn to the breach in each case. In three instances, the printing of the statutory declaration on the label on the sausages did not conform to the requirements of the Regulations, and the attention of the vendors was drawn to the matter. In the case of the sample of crystallised fruit, which was certified as containing 40 parts per million excess of Sulphur Dioxide, a formal sample had not been taken at the close of the year and could not, therefore, be included in this Report. Self-raising Flour.—It is well known that a considerable amount of lead sometimes exists to the extent of several hundred parts per million in imported calcium phosphate, which is used for various purposes. Such low-grade calcium phosphate, if converted into acid calcium phosphate, and sold for the purpose of being used as an acidium constituent of self-raising flour, would contribute an undesirable amount of lead to the finished product. It was felt to be necessary that enquiries should be made and samples of various baking materials procured for analysis within the City of London area, with a view to ascertaining the nature and purity of the articles employed. Accordingly, eight samples of self-raising flour and four samples of baking powder were purchased informally from different retail tradesmen. In addition, all the City bakers were visited, and they readily gave every assistance in these enquiries as to the aerating powders, baking powders and bread improvers used in their businesses. Ten samples of baking powder, six of aerating powder, four of bread improvers and three of cream of tartar were taken, a total of 35 samples. In only one case was calcium acid phosphate found to have been used in the preparation of the article, and it is satisfactory to report that all of the samples were certified as genuine and with a lead content only ranging from none to 12.5 parts per million. EXAMINATION OF MILK. Chemical.—Of the 206 samples of milk, all of which were procured formally, 13 were certified as adulterated, giving a percentage of milk adulteration of 6.3, as compared with 4.1 for 1929. There were seven prosecutions and penalties were imposed in five cases. One summons was dismissed and another was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act on payment of costs. In those instances where samples were reported against and the circumstances did not warrant legal proceedings being instituted, the vendors were either cautioned or further samples taken which proved genuine. 52 The following table shows the percentage of fat content in each of the 206 samples of milk examined. Nine of this number contained fat in amounts below the point which presumes adulteration, i.e., 3 per cent. The highest amount of fat contained in any sample was 4.7 per cent. The average percentage of fat was 3.5:— Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. 2.3 2 3.7 25 2.5 1 3.8 11 2.6 3 3.9 6 2.8 2 4.0 9 2.9 I 4.1 5 3.0 6 4.2 4 3.1 9 4.3 3 3.2 14 4.4 1 3.3 23 4.5 1 3.4 31 4.7 1 3.5 28 - 3.6 20 Total 206 Thirteen purveyors of milk from whom samples had been taken served notices upon this Authority requesting samples of milk to be procured from their suppliers in course of delivery to them. On two occasions it was necessary to ask another Authority to comply with the request, the place of delivery being outside the area of the City of London. In one of these cases legal proceedings were successfully taken against the retailer, whilst the other case was dismissed. The samples procured of the wholesalers were certified to be genuine. THE MILK AND DAIRIES ORDER, 1926, AND THE MILK AND DAIRIES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1922. Thirteen new applications for registration as retail purveyors of milk were received during the year, all of which were approved. Seven of these were from persons who have no premises within the City of London, but purvey milk within the area. Registration Statistics. Number of Retail Purveyors of Milk on the Register at end of 1929 273 New Applications for Registration received 13 Applications granted 13 Applications refused — Names of Retailers removed from Register 13 Number of Retail Purveyors of Milk on the Register at end of 1930 273 Number of Milk sellers (other than Retail Purveyors of Milk) on the Register at end of 1930 20 Licences issued under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923 10 Inspections of Premises where Milk is Retailed.—During the year 223 inspections were made in connection with the sale of milk. Advice was given and suggestions made where necessary for the improvement of conditions in the distribution and storage of milk, and in all cases such suggestions were complied with. It was necessary, however, on one occasion to take legal proceedings against both a registered purveyor and his roundsman for failing to cause all milk delivered in bottles to be bottled and closed on registered premises. The summons against the employer was dismissed, but the employee was fined £1. THE PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1923 AND 1927. Five samples of different brands of Condensed Machine-skimmed Milk were taken and submitted for analysis. All were certified to be genuine as regards equivalent contents and composition. The attention of the importers of one brand was called to a minor contravention of the Regulations regarding the printing on the label, which was remedied. 53 THE PUBLIC HEALTH (DRIED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1923 AND 1927. Apart from the usual proprietary brands of dried milk, which have been sampled from time to time, no dried milk was found to be on sale. REGISTERED PREMISES. Butter Factories.—No new application for registration was received during the year, the number of premises on the register being two. Wholesale Dealers in Margarine and Margarine Cheese.—One new application for registration was received during the year. Artificial Cream Act, 1929.—Two premises are registered under this Act.

When the above-mentioned Acts came into force, it was hoped that the work arising under them would not entail the appointment of additional Officers in the City, and the responsibilities were accordingly divided between the members of the existing staff. Experience, however, showed that the careful and systematic following-up of the duties imposed by these Acts took up too much of the time of these Officers, and a special Officer, Mr. E. A. Johnson, has, therefore, been appointed. This Officer did not commence his duties until 1931, and the effects of his work are not therefore referred to in this Report. Each of the three Acts has been dealt with during the year so far as I was able to spare the staff. The Fertilisers and Feeding Stuffs Act required most attention. As a result of correspondence, received from time to time from outside Authorities, and of correspondence which passed between the Corporation and parties interested, visits have been made to certain firms who were not complying with the requirements of this Act. In practically every case, non-compliance was due to ignorance of the somewhat intricate clauses of the Act, and such visits were a means of not only indicating to the offenders the particular infringement, but also of advising on and securing prompt rectification and abatement of the offence. The Quarterly returns required under this latter Act by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have been made. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. Artizans' Dwellings, Stoney Lane, Houndsditch.—These Buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's, Queen's, Prince's, North, and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class, some of the ground floors being let as shops. The Buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 709 persons, compared with 738 in 1929. 83 per cent. are adults and 17 per cent. children (under 14 years). In addition to these Artizans' Dwellings, the Corporation, in connection with a slum clearance scheme, erected:— (1) In December, 1927, a block of buildings, Bearsted House, in Hutchison Street, which contains 88 rooms, arranged in 24 tenements, and housing at the end of 1930 103 persons (91 per cent. adults and 9 per cent. children). (2) In January, 1929, a similar block of buildings, Dutton House, in New Street, containing 52 rooms, arranged in 16 tenements, and housing at the end of 1930 68 persons (51 per cent. adults and 49 per cent. children). There are 7 shops, each with a large and well lighted basement, in Bearsted House, and 8 shops, similarly provided with a basement, in Dutton House. The total population of these dwellings is 880. The number of births was 2, viz.: 1 male and 1 female. The birth-rate was 2.3 per 1,000, which is 4.0 per 1,000 below the average for the previous five years. The birth-rate in these Dwellings reached a maximum of 46.9 per 1,000 in 1896, and has since been falling irregularly, but almost progressively. The death rate for 1930 was 11.4 per 1,000 per annum.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 94 ; and Housing Act, 1925, Sec. 6. The Corporation, as the Sanitary Authority in the City, are required, under the provisions of Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Section 6 of the Housing Act, 1925, to make and enforce Bye-laws with respect to houses intended or used for occupation by the working classes and let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family for the following purposes:— For regulating the number of persons and separation of the sexes. For the registration and inspection of such houses. For enforcing drainage and promoting cleanliness and ventilation. For requiring adequate and accessible and, where necessary, separate provision of closet accommodation, washing accommodation, and accommodation for the storage, preparation and cooking of food. For the keeping in repair and adequate lighting of any common staircase. For the cleansing and redecorating of the premises, and for the paving of the courts and courtyards. For the provision of handrails for staircases. For securing adequate lighting. For the taking of precautions in any case of infectious disease.

This necessitated the service of 75 notices during 1930. In addition to the foregoing, there are twelve blocks of Dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is "self-contained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that in these circumstances they are not subject to the Byelaws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family:— Name and situation of Artizans' Block Dwellings.

(None built during the last 2 years). 66 Common Lodging-House, 116, Middlesex Street.—The above premises, which are known as the "Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," and is the only common lodginghouse in the City, was opened on the 7th February, 1906. It was utilised during the War as a Soldiers' Hostel, but is now again in use as a common lodging-house. The premises are periodically inspected, and always found to be well kept and in a generally satisfactory condition. Neglect to comply with Water-closet Bye-laws.—No instance of neglect in this respect has occurred during the year under review. Drainage Plans.—In the course of the year 240 plans were submitted with regard to proposed reconstruction of water-closets or drains in the City. Of these, 209 were approved ; 26 revised and approved; and 5 not approved. Street Gullies.—The gradual substitution of properly trapped gullies for those formerly existing has greatly reduced the number of complaints received of offensive smells arising from those appliances, especially in warm weather. In some cases this nuisance was doubtless due to want of flushing, but in the majority faulty construction was the cause of the trouble. The City Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past, and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more up-to-date design will, I hope, eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil. Overcrowding.—Overcrowding is a nuisance to be dealt with summarily under Section 2, Sub-section 1 (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and during the year one case was reported by your officers. Sanitary Defects and Infectious Disease.—In every case of notification of infectious disease, the premises involved were inspected with regard to the drainage system, water supply, ventilation, &c.; and of the 158 cases so investigated in 1930, it was found necessary to make amendments to soil and waste pipes, water-closets, &c., in 33 instances. House, Trade and other Refuse Removal.—The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1930 consisted of 19,839 cartloads of street sweepings and slops, and 44,354 loads of house and trade refuse, a total of 64,193 loads. The total for the year 1929 was 71,070. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Lett's Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. The horse manure collected from the street orderly bins is not included in the above, but is dealt with by a contractor, who sells it to market gardeners and others. Legal Proceedings.—During the year, 338 notices have been served by the District Inspectors at the order of the Sanitary Committee, and in no case was it found necessary, in consequence of non-compliance therewith, to refer the matter to the City Solicitor. Summer Flushing of Courts.—There are 161 courts and narrow passages throughout the City, which were regularly flushed during the summer months, under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service, and the flushing of the main streets, no less than 23,166,104 gallons of water were used. Of these courts and alleys, seven were flushed four times a week, six three times a week, three twice a week, 21 once a week, five once a month, and 119 every two months. Disinfectants are also freely applied where desirable. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Customs House, as heretofore, required special attention. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the immediate vicinity of these places free from nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially during hot weather. Limewashing of Courts.—There are 60 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed frequently become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of passengers or vehicles, together with the action of the smokeladen atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. Of the places so dealt with during 1930, 19 were situated in the East District, 24 in the Middle District, and 17 in the West District. 67 Defective Connections to Sewer.—During the year, 30 reports were received from the City Engineer respecting the condition of connections between the drains of certain City houses and the public sewer. Investigations showed that it was necessary to reconstruct 28 of the connections referred to. As a result of the inspection of the internal drainage system of these premises, reconstruction or alteration was found necessary in 24 instances. In the majority of cases these external drains were brick-barrel drains, in which rats had their breeding-places, and were, undoubtedly, a source of much annoyance to the occupiers of the houses to which they were connected. BASEMENT ROOMS USED FOR SLEEPING PURPOSES. Some consideration was given during the year to a suggestion, made by one of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, that legislation should be promoted requiring architects and others proposing to construct basement rooms for sleeping purposes, to obtain the approval of the appropriate local authority before the construction of such rooms. The legal position, as I understand it, in regard to this matter, is that underground rooms used for sleeping purposes are required to comply with certain conditions, but there does not appear to be any power to prevent their construction. In other words, action can only be taken after an offence has been committed, and it is the intention of the suggested legislation to enable control to be obtained before construction. Very little difficulty is experienced in the City in this matter and, so far as I am aware, there is only one underground sleeping place therein. The difficulty is, in all probability, however, one of considerable moment in thickly-populated areas, and the suggested legislation would greatly aid those responsible for the local administration of public health law. In these circumstances, the Corporation were pleased to make a representation to the Ministry of Health advocating the desirability of legislation on the lines suggested. PIGEONS. I have continued to receive numerous complaints of damage and nuisance caused by the congregation of pigeons within the City Area. In these circumstances, a campaign on similar lines to that adopted in 1928 was put into operation, and a total number of 1,404 birds was caught by the Contractors, engaged by the City Corporation under the powers conferred by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1927. Of these birds, six were ringed birds, and in accordance with the arrangement entered into with the Homing Union, who are naturally desirous that private and perhaps valuable homing pigeons should not be destroyed, these were despatched to the Secretary for return to their owners. The balance of the birds were destroyed by dislocation of the vertebrae, under supervision of my officers. The elaborate trapping methods which the contractors had originally intended to use were found by experience to be not so successful as had been anticipated, mainly, I am informed, on account of interference by misguided, though possibly well-intentioned, persons. Hand-catching had to be resorted to, and this has, of course, resulted in a slowing down in the rate of capture. It might be well again to emphasize the fact that it is not the intention of the City Corporation to entirely clear the City of these birds, but rather that a balance shall be struck between the aesthetically beautiful and the hygienically sound. These birds were captured principally in the neighbourhood of St. Paul's Cathedral, Guildhall, Mansion House, Royal Exchange, Carpenters' Hall, Fishmongers' Hall, and Finsbury Circus. THE FLY NUISANCE. Although very few complaints were received during the year, possibly because of the climatic conditions, attention was again directed to the Fly Nuisance as it affects workers and residents, and especially restaurant premises in the City. Leaflets were distributed, indicating certain precautionary measures which should be taken in order to minimise the danger and nuisance as far as practicable, and drawing the attention of residents and others to the necessity for the strict observance of cleanliness, frequent removal of dust, other refuse, and particularly of waste foodstuffs. In all, some three thousand leaflets were distributed. Special attention was also given to conditions existing in the several stables 68 situated in the City. It was satisfactory to note that those in charge of these stables appeared to appreciate the necessity for maintaining these premises in such a condition as to prevent, as far as possible, the breeding of flies in the accumulated material associated with this class of building. Assistance in this matter was afforded, as in the past, by the several Ward Beadles, whose knowledge of their areas enabled the circulation of information in regard to precautionary measures to be carried out at the minimum of expense and delay. BROKEN GLASS IN THE PUBLIC HIGHWAY. At the suggestion of one of the Metropolitan Borough Councils, the possibility of danger to pedestrians and others from the presence of broken milk bottles on the Public Highway has been the subject of enquiry, and it was suggested that one means of meeting this danger was the provision of receptacles on all milk barrows in which the broken glass might be placed. In the City, no reports have been received indicating that there exists such a danger as is suggested, although, in some of the more thickly-populated residential areas, it may be a difficulty which necessitates some kind of action being taken. The Sanitary Committee, however, were of opinion that now that special care is being paid to the cleanly handling of milk, it would certainly be retrograde to suggest that milk barrows should be made receptacles of glass debris picked up from the Public Highways, and expressed the view that the best method of dealing with the matter would be by an extension of police regulations. So far as I am aware, the matter has not advanced any further. EXHUMATION AND RE-INTERMENT OF BODIES. City of London Cemetery.—During the year the bodies of 12 persons buried at the City of London Cemetery at Ilford have been exhumed and subsequently re-interred in the same Cemetery. In accordance with the terms of the licences issued by the Home Secretary in respect of these cases, the work of removal and re-interment was carried out in the early morning under the supervision of your Medical Officer of Health. HUMAN REMAINS. 41 and 42, Cloth Fair. There has only been one case during the year of the discovery of human remains within the City Area. This occurred during building operations at 41 and 42, Cloth Fair, when a small quantity of human remains was disinterred. The site was in the neighbourhood of the old burial ground of St. Bartholomew's Church, and the bones, which bore evidence of orderly interment, were of great age and probably the remains of some person originally buried in the churchyard. The circumstances were reported to the City Coroner in the usual way. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901, &.C.

Outworkers and Homeworkers.—The provisions of the Act relating to "Outworkers" were carried out as heretofore, and the lists of the names and addresses of workers receiving work from the City firms were duly received without the necessity for legal proceedings. K 70 In eight cases employers neglected to keep lists at their premises and to send copies of the same to the Corporation as required by the Act.

A footnote should be added to show that this has been done. † 1 he figures required in columns 2, 3 and 4 are the total number of the lists received from those employers who comply strictly with the statutory duty of sending two lists each year and of the entries of names of outworkers in those lists. The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted. The figures in columns 3 and 4 will usually be (approximatly) double of the number of individual outworkers whose names are given, since in the February and August lists of the same employer the same outworker's name will often be repeated. 76 4.—Registered Workshops.

WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health. Note.—The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (S. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the administration of that Act in workshops and workplaces, and to send a copy of his Annual Report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State (Home Office). If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office, the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities, and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Memorandum of March, 1912. INVESTIGATION INTO THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF SHOP ASSISTANTS. An investigation was conducted into the conditions under which shop assistants work in the City of London. Simultaneously a similar investigation was conducted by others of my colleagues in the Metropolis. In the City, 190 shops, in 19 different categories as to trade, were dealt with, and an extensive classification of the conditions found was made and tabulated. The several Medical Officers of Health concerned arrived at practical unanimity on all the main points, and the results were incorporated in a joint report to a Committee of the House of Commons, before whom, at a later date, your Medical Officer of Health had the privilege of giving evidence. I should like to place on record my appreciation of the courtesy which was extended to me by the proprietors of the various businesses affected, without whose co-operation the enquiry would have been almost impossible. 77 SUPERVISION OF THE ICE CREAM TRADE. Inspections in connection with the manufacture or sale of Ice Cream within the City have been carried out. The barrows or stalls of itinerant vendors were visited from time to time during the summer season, and in any instance where lack of cleanliness or other defect was observed, the issue of a caution resulted in appropriate steps being taken to remedy the defect. No additional premises were registered during the year in accordance with the requirements of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1928. CITY MORTUARY.

The following table gives the details of the work of disinfection carried out at the Disinfecting Station during the year in connection with the export trade:— Number of Certificates issued.

In addition to the foregoing, some assistance was rendered to the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury during a period when the disinfection apparatus operated by that authority was out of use. Preservation of Bodies of Unknown Dead.—The De Rechter apparatus for the preservation of the dead, installed at the City Mortuary, in March, 1909, was fully described in the Annual Report of that year. It has proved of considerable assistance in connection with the identification of persons found drowned in the River Thames. During 1930 four bodies were placed in the apparatus. One was subsequently identified. Fire Inquests.—Dr. F. J. Waldo, J.P., Coroner for the City of London and Southward has kindly furnished me with the following list of places in the City which were the subject of Fire Inquests held by him during 1930 :— INQUESTS HELD UNDER THE CITY OF LONDON FIRE INQUESTS ACT, 1888. Date of Inquest. Premises Burnt. 29th December, 1930 7, Love Lane. In addition to the above, the City Coroner personally inquired into 197 " non-fatal " City fires reported to him during the year. 78 DISINFECTANTS. The disinfectants and other chemicals in use in the Public Health Department and in other branches of the Corporation's service, have, as in the past, been supplied under a contract prepared by your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for deodorising and denaturising unsound meat, disinfecting public conveniences, streets and roadways, premises after infectious diseases, etc. Special attention was given to the thoroughfares in the vicinity of the Billingsgate and Smithfield Markets, the former of which presents certain difficulties in the matter of deodorisation in the summer months. Very few complaints were, however, received of offensive odours necessarily associated with the fish trade. RAT REPRESSION. The tables set out on page 79 indicate investigations and advisory work which has been undertaken under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. From this summary, it will be seen that 983 buildings occupied by 2,134 firms were inspected, and that 348 were found to be rat infested. One or other of the rat catchers working in the City was engaged by 155 business firms. Poisons were laid down in 397 cases, varnish traps were used in 212 cases, breakback, wire and other traps in 368 premises, Cats or dogs were kept by 151 firms. Complaints or applications for advice have been received in 140 instances. The work done in addition to the use of poisons, traps, and animals, included rat proofing in 303 instances, and the repair of drainage defects in 1,076 instances. Ready compliance with the suggestion to rat proof has been a feature, and when this is properly carried out, combined with the elimination of hiding places, it has proved a valuable factor in combating the rat trouble. It cannot, however, be relied upon absolutely to exclude rodents from buildings. The receipt of crates and cases from the docks is a frequent source of rat infestation, and ingress through open doors and windows, especially roof doors provided for exit in case of fire, is readily obtained. The Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, lays the duty of disinfesting premises upon the occupiers ; this is one of the difficulties experienced in regard to rat proofing, which so often involves structural alterations, and is logically the work of the owner. It is not possible to report even approximately the total number of rats killed. Messrs. William Dalton & Sons, one of the firms principally engaged in this work in the City, inform me that they killed 19,215 rats in the City during 1930. The substitution of old buildings by modern structures, and the constant attention to drainage and sewage work, have probably resulted in a decrease in the rat population. So far as palliative measures are concerned, we have continued to obtain very satisfactory results from the Varnish Trap. The following figures have been supplied to me by the City Engineer:— Brick sewers reconstructed 8 Brick sewers constructed 10 Brick sewers in course of reconstruction (1st Jan., 1931) 2 Disused sewers filled in and abolished 11 Brick sewers reinverted, pointed and repaired 21 Pipe sewers reconstructed 4 Miscellaneous repairs to sewers, drains, etc 25 House drains constructed in connection with new buildings 27 Drains of existing buildings reconstructed 29 House drains partlv reconstructed in connection with sewer works 20 House drains reconstructed in connection with the reconstruction and reinverting of certain sewers 83 Gulley drains constructed and reconstructed in connection with the reconstruction and reinverting of certain sewers 27 New gullies and drains constructed 11 Gulley drains reconstructed 63 House and gulley drains repaired 180 Disused drains bricked up 315 Rats killed by sewer foreman and his men 909 No poison was used in the sewers during the year. The number of drainage reconstructions carried out under the supervision of inspectors of this Department is set out on page 79. 79 RATS AND MICE (DESTRUCTION) ACT, 1919.

In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or of any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognizance of the appointment, 61 persons were examined by the Medical Officer of Health during 1930. Three of these persons were reported as physically unfit for office, and the decision in regard to one is pending. Twenty-two officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement. With six exceptions, all were reported to be unfit for duty. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W. M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London.

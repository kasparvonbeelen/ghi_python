LONDON: m. lownds, printer, 148½, fenchurch street, city. 1862. At a Meeting of the Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, held at the Guildhall, of the said City, on Tuesday, 21th January, 1863:— The Medical Officer of Health laid before the Court his Annual Report, which was ordered to be Printed, and a Copy to be sent to every Member of this Court, and of the Court of Common Council. JOSEPH DAW, Principal Clerk. THE SANITARY CONDITION OF THE CITY OF LONDON. THE FOURTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH. To the Honourable Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London. Gentlemen, In the course of the year which has expired there were 3,046 births, 2,726 deaths, and 1,540 marriages in the City of London. These occurred among a population of 114,472 persons. The births, therefore, have been in the proportion of 26.4 for every 1,000 of the inhabitants; the deaths of 23.8; and the marriages of 13.4. In all England the average birth-rate is 33.1 per 1,000 of the population, the death-rate 22.3, and the marriage-rate 8.2. While, therefore, the proportion of deaths and marriages in the City has been, 6 in each case, above the standard, that of the births has been somewhat below it; the number of marriages, indeed, has been nearly 64 per cent, greater than the common average: in other words, while only 164 persons out of 10,000 marry every year in the whole country, 268 marry in the City. The highest of the City birth-rates has been in the Eastern Union, where it has reached to 31.8 per 1,000 of the people, and the lowest has been in the Central Union, or City proper, where it has amounted to only 21.4 per 1,000. The distribution of the deaths has also been very unequal; in the Eastern and Western Unions the general proportions have been at the rate of 25.8 per 1,000 of the population, whereas in the Central district it has been but 20.6. The cause of this has been, not so much the difference in the character of the population, as in the density of it. In the former districts the number of persons upon an acre ranges from 200 to 266, whereas in the latter the number is but 105. This, however, is an excessive density when compared with the town districts of England where, upon an average, there are scarcely five persons to an acre; and contrasted with the mortality of those districts, which amounts to 24.8 per 1,000, the death-rate of the whole City is remarkably small. 7 The births, deaths, and marriages in the City during the year have been below the averages for the last ten years. In the course of that time the births have declined from an annual proportion of 3,412 to 3,046; the deaths from 3,105 to 2,726; and the marriages from 1,733 to 1,540. These numbers represent a falling off of 11 per cent, of the births and marriages, and nearly 13 per cent, of the deaths. If, therefore, the number of births, deaths, and marriages in the City, has declined to the extent of 11 per cent, in consequence of the falling ofl" in the number of the resident population, it is manifest that some other circumstance has influenced the death-rate by reducing it an additional 2 per cent. This is undoubtedly the fruit of sanitary measures. The influence of the seasons on the several rates has been much the same as in the rest of England. The number of marriages, for example, is largest in the autumn quarter, and smallest in the winter. The births are most numerous in the winter months, and least so in the autumn. While the death-rate is largest in winter and smallest in summer. It might, however, have been expected that there would have been a considerable variation in these returns, from the circumstance that a very large proportion of the City population migrates into the country during summer and autumn, when 8 the people find employment in the market gardens, the com-fields, and the hop-grounds of the neighbouring counties. At these times, their births, deaths, and marriages are recorded elsewhere. Of the 3,046 births in the year, 1,573 were boys and 1,473 girls; and of the 2,726 deaths, 1,408 were males, and 1,318 females. There is nothing remarkable in these numbers, for they closely approximate the average proportions of former years, and are not largely different from the average proportions in the rest of England. In the City, for example, there are 104 males born for every 100 females; and there are nearly 109 male deaths for every 100 female. In all England the proportion of male births is about 105 for every 100 female, and of male deaths only 103 for every 100 female. Male life is, therefore, sacrificed in the City to a larger extent than in the rest of the country; in the City proper, in fact, the number of male deaths is 11 percent, more than that of the female. The ages at death are classified in Table IV.; and you will observe that nearly 18 per cent, of all the deaths occur among infants of less than one year old; 38 per cent, are among children of less than five years of age; 49 per cent., or nearly half ate under 25 years of age; and only 16 per cent. 9 had reached the age of 65. 190 persons, however, had passed the age of 75; 33 had exceeded the age of 85; and there were 5 persons who had reached the age of 95. The infant mortality in the City is unquestionably large. It can hardly be estimated by the proportion of children's deaths to the total mortality, because the proportion of children in the City population is comparatively small, but it may be seen by observing the number of children that die before they are a year old. Last year there were 3,046 births in the City, and there were 475 deaths of infants that had not reached the first year of their age. In the course of the last ten years the annual proportion of births has been 3,412, and the annual proportion of infant deaths has been 556. This is at the rate of 16 per cent., or, in other words, 1 in 6 of all the children born in the City die before they are a year old. In the rest of London the proportion is only about 15 per cent., and in all England it is only 14 per cent., or about 1 in 7. I have frequently discussed the causes of this, which are chiefly to be found in the density of the population, and the bad condition of the homes of the poor. Among the causes of death, the principal facts are the following: phthisis has been fatal in 357 10 cases, tabes and scrofula in 173, and hydrocephalus in 43: bronchitis and pneumonia have caused 441 deaths, teething and the convulsions of infancy 139, and violence, privation, and poison 167. Of the zymotic class of maladies, there have been 174 deaths from continued fever, 95 from scarlet fever, 127 from whooping cough, 71 from croup and diphtheria, 92 from measles, 48 from the diarrhoea of children, and 15 from diarrhoea and dysentery among adults, 14 from erysipelas, and 4 from smallpox. Altogether, therefore, there have been 573 deaths from tubercular diseases, 441 from inflammatory affections of the lungs, and 640 from diseases of the zymotic class. The first of these numbers is considerably below the average (636); the second is also below it (520); but the third is greatly above it (601). The chief increase in the zymotic maladies has been from measles and continued fever, the former of which has advanced from an average of 78 in the year to 92, and the latter from 106 to 174. These facts have already been discussed in the Quarterly Reports, and I have informed you how, step by step, these several diseases have advanced until they reached the limit of their course, and then they have as gradually declined. I have also directed your attention to the fact, that the sickness returns of continued fever have been most numerous among the poorer classes of the City, while the mortality returns have 11 been largest among the richer. Lastly, I ought to state that the number of deaths from violence, &c., in the City has been gradually increasing during the last few years. In 1860, the number was only 126; in 1861, it was 148; and this year it is 167; the average for the last seven years being 155. I do not know the precise causes of this, but it manifestly deserves attention, as the greater part of this class of deaths is entirely of a preventable character. The sickness returns for the year, show a considerable falling off in the proportion of cases attended among the poor. Last year, the number of cases on the books of the City Unions, was 10,937; whereas, in the preceding year, it was 12,998. Fever, however, has increased from 154 cases in the year, to 691; but diarrhoea has declined from 798 to 538. All these latter cases have been the subject of special sanitary inspection. The meteorology of the year is recorded in Table V. of the Appendix. It shows that the weather has been somewhat warm and damp. The mean temperature of the air in the City, has been 50.6 of Fahrenheit. This is nearly 2 degrees above the average of 43 years' observations at Greenwich by Mr. Glaisher. Fxcepting the months of July, August, and November, the mean 12 ture has commonly ranged from 3 to 7 degrees above the average for the season: in those months, however, it was generally below the average; in fact, in July and November, the temperature was about 3 degrees under the average. The highest temperature of the year has been 76 2 degrees. It was reached on the 27th of July; and the lowest temperature (25.2 degrees) was on the 30th of December. The humidity of the air has ranged from 75 to 93 per cent, of saturation, and the proportion of rain has amounted to 26.5 inched. This is about 4½ inches above the usual quantity; and the number of wet days have been considerable (164). The highest temperature of the river, has been 67T degrees; and from the circumstance that a large proportion of fresh water has been supplied to it by the excessive rain-fall, the condition of the water has been good. Excepting in the months of October and November of I860, and of August and September of the present year, the proportions of saline and organic matter dissolved in the water has averaged only 29.2 grains per imperial gallon, of which 3.4 grains were organic. In the autumn months, as usual, the quantity of dissolved matter was excessive. In September it amounted to 149.6 grains per gallon, of which 14 were organic. For several days, the water had a disagreeable odour, but the temperature being low, the putrefactive change was soon arrested 13 and the offensive smell abated. I have given three tables in the Appendix, which exhibit the composition of the river-water during each month and quarter of the year. These facts have been systematically followed out for several years past, and I place them upon record in order that the condition of the river may be known for comparison in future time, when the scheme for the drainage of the Metropolis shall be completed. The mode of examination of the river-water is always the same. Samples are taken, about every ten days, from the river at high-tide at London Bridge, and they are at once examined in the laboratory. Already it has been remarked that the quality of the water has been much improved since the conservators of the river have used their authority in preventing the discharge of noxious matters from gas works and other factories into the river; and fish are coming nearer and nearer to the City confines of the stream. It is hoped that when the sewage of London is discharged into the river below the tidal-flow of the stream, the condition of the water will be still further improved. One thing, however, is manifest, that as during three months of the year there is little or no water flowing downwards in the river, but on the contrary a rather large supply of sea-water upwards to compensate for the enormous evaporation which goes on in the summer and autumn 14 months, that some process of complete and safe deodorization of the sewage must be effected before it is discharged into the river; for though it may be poured in at high tide, and at a point low down in the course of the river, it will return during those months to the higher bed of the stream, and be carried upward beyond the Houses of Parliament. At that time, if the sewage is not carefully treated, and its solid constituents removed, the offensive decomposition of it and the sea-water with which it is mixed will be unbearable. I have had sewage under such circumstances fermenting continuously in the Laboratory for more than two months, and the volumes of foul gas evolved from it have been enormous. This must be provided for, or the mischief of the present system will not only be not abated, but will be seriously aggravated. The sanitary work of the year is exhibited in Tables X. and XI. of the Appendix. It may be expressed thus:—5,548 houses have been inspected, and 3,145 visits have been made to the 130 common lodging-houses of the City. These have resulted in the issuing of 2,461 orders for sanitary improvement. The Markets and Slaughter-houses have also been duly inspected, and the officers have seized 15 111,961 lbs., or nearly 50 tons of meat, and 6,844 head of game and poultry as unfit for human food. It consisted of 542 sheep and lambs, 34 calves, 152 pigs, 735 quarters of beef, and 766 joints of meat. 57,544 lbs. were diseased, 13,579 lbs. were putrid, and 9,513 lbs. were from animals that had died from accident or disease. All of it was at once treated with the creosote of coal tar, which prevents its use as food, and it was then sent to the boilers. In addition to the preceding, the Fish-meters of the Fishmongers' Company have seized at Billingsgate, and in the boats lying off the market, 725,266 fish, 5,773 gallons of shrimps, 1,390 lbs. of eels, 1,131 bushels of sprats and smelts, and 238 bushels of shell-fish. All these were seized on account of putridity, and were destroyed. There have been ten persons convicted during the year for unlawfully exposing unwholesome meat for sale. They are as follows:— George Bruce, Slaughterman, of Fox and Knott Yard, Snow Hill, who was fined forty shillings. Stephen Clarke, Meat Salesman, of Aldgate High Street, who was fined ten shillings and costs. 16 Thomas Stevenson, Butcher, of Millstone Lane, Leicester, who was sentenced to six months imprisonment. John Jarvis, Carrier, of Towcester, Northampton, who was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Daniel Cotton, Butcher, of Belgrave Gate, Leicester, six months imprisonment. Geohge Hill, Butcher, of Mansfield Street, Leicester, six months imprisonment. George Worrins, Butcher, of Belgrave Gate, Leicester, six months imprisonment. William Crust, Butcher, of Ashford, in Kent, fined ten pounds and costs. William Samuel Speller, Harness-maker and Horse-slaughterer, of Woodford, in Essex, six months imprisonment. William Neville, Butcher, of Kingston, in Surrey three months imprisonment, and a fine of fifty pounds. The effect of these and preceding convictions, has been to lessen the quantity of diseased meat supplied to the City markets. In 1861, there were 31,412 lbs. of meat seized beyond the amount of the present year; and the quantity of meat from animals-that had died from natural causes has declined from 33,619 lbs. in the year to 13,941 lbs. 17 The last point connected with the sanitary work of the quarter has been the examination of the water supply of the City. The water from the mains of the New lliver Company has been examined on several occasions, and the average amount of solid matter dissolved in it has been 18.94 grains per imperial gallon, of which 1.24 grains were organic matter. The saline matter consisted of corbonate of lime and magnesia, with a small proportion of sulphate of lime, alkaline chloride, nitrate, and sulphate. These results are satisfactory, for they not only indicate a good quality of water, but they also show how great has been the improvement thereof during the last ten years: in fact in 1851, when the Government Commission inquired into the condition of the water supply of London, the amount of organic matter in the New River water was nearly three grains per gallon. At the present time it rarely exceeds half that quantity. There is, therefore, but little cause for complaint as regards the quality of the water. I wish I could report to you as favourably of the quantity of the supply. In the aggregate, without doubt, there is abundance, but the means of storing the water, and the appliances for distributing it are so defective in the poor localities of the City, that there are constant complaints of a deficiency of water. Indeed, the water is on for so short a time in many districts that the poor have but little 18 opportunity for collecting it. I have had a return made to me by the inspectors, of the time that the Avater is usually on in the courts and alleys of the City, and I find that it varies from a quarter of an hour to an hour, the average time being half an hour. This is too short a time for filling butts and cisterns; and, therefore, during the greater part of every day they are without water: on Sundays they are nearly always without it. It would be a great boon to them if the daily supply was continued for an hour instead of half an hour, and if there was a like supply on Sundays. The drinking fountains are resorted to in many cases ; for the poor have a wholesome dread of the City pumps. It is estimated that upwards of a quarter of a million of people take advantage of the drinking fountains in this metropolis on a summer's day; more than 8,000 persons have been known to drink at one of them in a single day. The water presents so marked a contrast to that from the City pumps, that it is always preferred; and it is to be regretted that the funds of the Drinking Fountain Association are not sufficient to maintain a larger number of fountains. Already there are about one hundred of them in this metropolis, but there is need of at least a hundred more. The necessity is all the more urgent from the circumstance that in many localities the unwholesome water of the City pumps is the only supply at hand, and this 19 water, as T have already explained, is highly charged with noxious matter. I have continued the examination of this water for nearly two years, and I submit the results to you in Table XII. of the Appendix. Of the thirty-six pumps in the City, there is hardly one which supplies a drinkable water. When examined in large volume, it presents a deep sea green tint from the quantity of organic matter dissolved in it, a quantity that in some cases reaches 10 grains in the gallon; and the amount of saline matter is frequently above one hundred grains in the gallon. The nature of both the organic and saline constituents indicates most unmistakably the source of the supply. It has its origin in the porous soil which is saturated with the soakage from sewers, drains, and grave-yards. Almost every well indeed has its speciality. Those in the neighbourhood of the markets are known by the soakage from the surface ground; the pump in Leadenhall Market for example, is enormously charged with common salt from the pickled hides, which are exposed for sale upon the ground of the market. It will be seen in fact, by the table that there is hardly a pump in the City which furnishes water as good as the average supply of the river at high-tide at London Bridge; and yet, there are persons who still advocate the use of such water for domestic purposes, and who will not be 20 vinced of its unwholesomeness until it causes an outbreak of disease, like that occasioned by the pump in St. James', Westminster, and by the pump at Stratford. Such a calamity might happen at any moment in the City by a slight failure in the filtering powers of the soil, or by the irruption of sewage from a neighbouring drain. It is time that the water of the City pumps should be disused, except for the purposes of street cleansing, and that the filtered water of the drinking fountains should take its place. The other tables in the Appendix require no explanation; I therefore submit them without comment, And remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, HY. LETHEBY. 41, Finsbury Square, January 22nd, l»63.

To the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commoners of the Corporation of London. 55/61, Moorgate, London, E.C. 2. July, 1952. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following report on the work of my Department during the year 1951. Vital Statistics. I must again make the observation that owing to the small resident population of the City, the vital statistics are of little or no value as an indication of the health of the community or for comparison with the statistics of the county as a whole or any other area. The birth rate appears as 7.59 per 1,000 which is about half that for England and Wales. The death rate appears as 12 91. In 1950 the death rate for the County of London was 11.3. The infant mortality rate appears as 75 per 1,000 live births. The corresponding rate for the County of London in 1950 was 26. For legitimate infants the mortality rate was 27.05. The rate for the County in 1950 was 24.81. The mortality rate for illegitimate infants was 666.67 per 1,000, which appears alarming until it is observed that there were only three illegitimate births, of which it happened that two died. With only three illegitimate births the mortality rate could only be 0, 333, 666 or 1,000, all of which are ridiculous figures. The death rate for illegitimate infants in the County in 1950 was 35.48. Infectious Diseases. The incidence of infectious disease in the City during the year calls for no special comment. There was no case of polio-myelitis. The number of notifications of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (17), gives an annual rate per 1,000 living of 3.2 which is twice the rate for the County of London, but six were amongst the staff of a large general hospital, and three from the Salvation Army Hostel. The rate amongst ordinary residents in the City was about the same as that for the County. As usual there were a number of enquiries from business firms in the City as to the action to be taken in regard to cases and contacts of infectious diseases amongst their staffs. Mass Radiography. In my last annual report I referred to the fact that the Corporation had made available to the North East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board, accommodation at 20, Golden Lane for a Mass Radiography Unit, and that every occupier of premises in the City was being notified of the existence of this service. The response of both employers and employees has continued to be very satisfactory. The Medical Director of the Unit has kindly supplied the following preliminary report on the work of the Unit during 1951. His full annual report will not be published till later, so I am not able to say how many of the 44,457 persons examined were from the City and how many from the adjacent Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. "From the 1st January to the 15th June and from the 1st August to the end of the year, excluding the holiday period (13th August to 3rd September), Mass Radiography Unit 6D was operating at the Mass Radiography Centre, 20, Golden Lane, E.C. I. From the 18th June to 27th June the Unit carried out a Survey at The Amalgamated Press, Ltd., Fleetway House, Farringdon Street, E.C. 4. Altogether 1,646 firms were examined at the Centre during 1951, but it should be pointed out that this figure includes a number of firms in the Metropolitan Boroughs of Finsbury, Shoreditch and Stepney, which attended the Mass Radiography Centre as the latter is conveniently situated for these Boroughs. The Medical Officer of Health has continued his circulation of firms in the City, and this valuable co-operation is greatly appreciated. The table hereunder gives details ol the total number examined, and the active tuberculosis found during 1951. Total No. of Persons examined at— Males. Females. Total. (a) Mass Radiography Centre 24,612 19,845 44,457 (b) The Amalgamated Press, Ltd. 518 549 1,067 Recalled for large films . 711 350 1,061 Examinees called for investigation by Medical Director of Unit 267 133 400 Referred to Chest Clinics or Hospitals 211 100 311 Active Tuberculosis 56 30 86 The Mass Radiography Service which is free, speedy, reliable and confidential, enables large groups of people to have a Chest X-ray with a minimum amount of inconvenience. Its purpose is to discover tuberculosis and other chest ailments in their early stages when they are more easily curable. A notification of the result of the examination is sent to all examinees who bring to the Unit a stamped envelope bearing their name and private address." 2 Food Inspection. The total amount of meat delivered at Smithfield Market was 273,736 tons, which was 63,721 tons less than in 1950. Two hundred and thirty-three tons were found by the inspectors to be unfit for human consumption and were voluntarily surrendered. At riverside wharves and premises in the City, 167 tons of various foodstuffs were condemned as unfit for human consumption. In addition, 112 tons were placed under stop and subsequently released to be dealt with under the supervision of other local authorities. Every effort is made to ensure that food which is unfit for human consumption is utilised in some other way, but there is always a quantity, particularly of vegetables and fruit, for which no use can be found. Considerable trouble arose by reason of the unsound condition of consignments of canned ham from several continental countries. In many cases the unsoundness was obvious on external examination of the cans ; in others it was not apparent till the cans were opened, and in some not until the ham was cut through and the centre examined. It appeared that, because of the good market for ham in this country, many continental firms embarked on the canning of hams without experience and without appreciating that the successful canning of large hams is by no means easy. It is necessary to get just the right degree of curing and just the right temperature in the centre of the ham to achieve commercial sterilisation (i.e., the destruction of all organisms likely to cause spoilage), without spoiling the texture and flavour of the meat. The circumstances were reported to the Ministry of Food, who received similar reports from other districts and from Port Health Authorities. Food Poisoning. No formal notification of a case of food poisoning was received during the year, but your Medical Officer was informed of two extensive, but mild, outbreaks in commercial canteens by the business houses concerned. There are probably many cases of this mild type of food-poisoning which are never formally notified because no doctor is called in. The symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhœa of varying degrees of severity, there is no vomiting, they occur in the late evening or during the night, some 6 to 18 hours after a luncheon meal, and by the next morning the symptoms are beginning to abate and the patients decide that it is unnecessary to seek medical advice. As individuals they escape detection, unless it happens that a number are employed at the same place of work and have their mid-day meal at the same canteen; in which case they exchange news of their troubles and may subsequently complain to the canteen manager; or some of them may be late on duty or even be away from work for a day, and then the management makes enquiries and communicates with the Medical Officer of Health. By this time some twenty-four hours or more have elapsed since the suspected meal was eaten. The practice is to get a complete menu of the meal, and ask each person who has suffered to mark the items of which he or she partook. Since nearly all the patients are in the building, the particular food or foods common to all who were ill are quickly identified. Some of these items can be ignored as most unlikely sources of infection, and probably the responsibility can be fixed with a fair degree of certainty on one single item. Unfortunately there is rarely any of the suspected food remaining for examination. The origin of the suspected food, its subsequent history and details of its treatment before it was served are carefully traced. At the same time the canteen staff are interviewed by the Medical Officer of Health, and efforts are made to obtain specimens of faeces from any who may have infected the food. In some cases rectal swabs have been taken, but it is not easy to persuade canteen staff, most of whom are women, to collect and bring samples of faeces or to submit to the indignity of rectal swabbing. It is easier for these samples to be obtained in the homes of cases or suspected carriers, and in several instances local Medical Officers of Health have kindly acceded to requests to undertake the necessary investigations. The kitchen and ancillary rooms are carefully inspected, and the opportunity is taken to emphasise the importance of food hygiene. Perhaps the most important departure from good standards of food hygiene is the practice of cooking the main dish the day before and warming it up on the day it is served. It is easy to criticise this practice, but in central London at least, the staff do not live close to their place of work, and when they arrive in the morning they are busy preparing to serve lunch at noon, so it is not always possible to cook the main dish in the time available. It is therefore often cooked in the afternoon and stored overnight. If this must be done, the conditions of storage are of vital importance. If they are unsatisfactory, the food remains for some 15 hours at temperatures suitable for the growth and multiplication of organisms which have escaped destruction by the heat of cooking, with the result that a toxic dose of organisms and their products may be served at luncheon next day. It is essential that the cooked food should be cooled rapidly and kept cool till it is reheated shortly before it is to be eaten. In canteens the total bulk of the cooked food is large and cooling is a slow process unless either it is divided into relatively small portions which will cool rapidly, or there are special means for rapid cooling before it is stored over-night in a refrigerator or cold room. In domestic cooking the bulk of meat dishes is small, consequently heat penetrates more thoroughly and sterilisation is therefore more complete, and also subsequent cooling is quicker. Consequently time and temperature conditions are less favourable for the multiplication of any organisms which survive the cooking process. This is one reason why food poisoning is more common in canteens and restaurants and in connection with large parties, than in ordinary feeding at home, and why high standards of food hygiene must be more strictly observed in such places and on such occasions. I am indebted to Dr. Betty Hobbs, of the Central Public Health Laboratories, for informing me that symptoms of food poisoning such as I have described may be caused by heat-resistant strains of Clostridium welchii. It seems possible that such organisms may gain access to the meat at any stage from the slaughterhouse to the kitchen, and it may be that we sometimes blame the kitchen, when the fault is really in the slaughterhouse or in the transport and handling of the meat before it reaches the kitchen. Even if the symptoms of this type of food poisoning are comparatively mild and transient, they occasion pain, discomfort and anxiety, with the loss of a night's sleep and possibly a day's work to a large number of people. They cannot, therefore, be passed over as unfortunate incidents which are unavoidable. Standards of hygiene in relation to meat should be raised all along the line; clean kitchens and clean cooks are not enough. 3 I have previously reported to the Public Health Committee and to the Ministry of Health on the two outbreaks of food poisoning, and it is not necessary for me to report again in detail. One involved 360 persons and the suspected food was imported rabbits, the other involved 90 persons, the suspected food being boneless veal. Food Hygiene. In March, 1951, the Corporation resolved to adopt the Model Bye-laws Series 1 (Handling, Wrapping and Delivery of Food and Sale of Food in the Open Air) issued by the Ministry of Food in 1949. The Minister of Food confirmed the bye-laws on 31st July, 1951, and they came into operation on 3rd September, 1951. Copies of these bye-laws with an accompanying letter were delivered to the occupiers of premises engaged in the distribution of food in the City, including Smithfield, Leadenhall and Billingsgate Markets. As regards the hygiene of catering establishments, I have dealt with this subject at some length in my last two Annual Reports. Two of your Inspectors devote their whole time to the inspection of catering establishments in the City, and this year I have asked them to submit their own impressions of the progress achieved during the year. Mr. Flynn reports as follows:— "As a result of the co-operation of the Food Office, it has been possible to ensure that a satisfactory standard of structure and design has been obtained so far as all new premises have been concerned. In this connection it has been noted that there has been a marked reduction in .the number of applications for new catering licences and the Inspectors have been able to devote an increasing proportion of their time and attention to the routine inspection of existing premises. A steady improvement in conditions generally is being secured but the rate of progress has been adversely affected by factors beyond the control of this Department. Difficulties and delays have occurred in the obtaining of building licences, shortages of essential materials have become increasingly acute, and in some cases in which extensive war damage repairs have been involved, prolonged negotiation has been necessary with the War Damage Commission before a start could be made in the execution of works required by this Department. The trade, on the whole, has been co-operative in the endeavours which have been made to secure improvements, as evidenced by the fact that it was not necessary to resort to legal proceedings in a single instance. In an area where basement kitchens predominate, particular attention has been paid to the question of ventilation, which of the various problems arising, is technically the most difficult to resolve. In most cases it has been found that there is no alternative to the installation of specially designed mechanical ventilating plant, as it is not practicable to effect adequate air movement by natural means. Apart from financial considerations which incline a caterer to procrastinate before undertaking such a commitment, there is now a delay of anything from six to twelve months in the delivery and erection of this type of plant. For the most part, catering in the City is confined to the service of lunches, and to make his business financially successful, a City caterer must fill his premises several times during the course of the lunch period. It is obvious, therefore, that crockery and utensils must be used several times during a relatively short period, and washing-up cannot be a leisurely operation carried out between lunch and dinner, but is necessarily a rush job, repeated as often as required. If washingup is to be efficiently executed, especially under the unique conditions which exist in the City, it is very important that suitable facilities, consisting of an adequate number of sinks and ample supplies of hot water, should be provided. The attention of the Inspectors has been focused on this aspect of food hygiene and improvements in many premises have been secured. Criticism has been made of the practice of washing-up in movable containers, and proprietors of cafes and restaurants have been encouraged to provide fixed sinks complete with running hot water. Of course difficulties of the trade in connection with frequently changing and often untrained staff are recognised, and it has been observed that even when up-to-date equipment is provided, constant supervision is necessary to ensure its proper use by the staff employed. Some of the larger larger caterers, as a matter of policy, are now installing washing-up machines, but this does not necessarily mean cleanly washing-up, as intelligent operation of the machine is essential, and all too frequently such important aspects as temperature of the washing-up and rinse waters, and the regular addition of detergents tend to be overlooked. Apart from normal repairs and routine cleansing and redecoration of premises and equipment. special emphasis has been laid by the Sanitary Inspectors on the importance of providing suitable personal washing facilities for the staff. The provision of running hot water to lavatory basins has been enforced as a routine measure, although the incidence of purchase tax now makes the installation of a small unit heater an expensive proposition. In some of the older City premises the kitchens have been found to be so dilapidated that there was no alternative but to gut and reconstruct the interior completely. In such cases the proprietors of the premises concerned were advised as to the most advantageous means of construction and design, which would not only provide a satisfactory basis for the maintenance of cleanly and hygienic conditions, but in addition, facilitate the smooth flow of work in the kitchen. In one case, the kitchen was in such a state of disrepair that the use of the premises for catering purposes was discontinued, and in another the kitchen was so basically inadequate and unsuitable that the proprietor was persuaded to find alternative premises. He was successful in his quest and the new premises are now in course of adaptation. Whilst, as indicated above, the trade has been, on the whole co-operative, the continued decline from the peak of prosperity of the catering industry, together with the ever rising cost of building work, has increased the difficulty of securing the execution of extensive works, and it is probable that the relatively spectacular improvements of the last few years will not be maintained." 4 Mr. Thompson reports:— "Looking back over the year to which this report relates, it is pertinent to ask what has been achieved in real progress towards seeing that food served to the public in City catering establishments, is sound and wholesome. Taking the actual material achievements, most premises visited under routine inspections require some work carried out. There has been a steady improvement in the facilities available for the washing of crockery. I have laid down as a minimum that 3 to 4 sinks, with the necessary hot and cold water supplies, should be provided where the premises and circumstances permit. This has been achieved in some instances, although the proprietors are not always impressed by the argument that separate facilities are necessary for washing-up, rinsing, and vegetable preparation. Hot water supplies in sufficient quantities are not always available, and the universal geyser very often fails to give the required quantities at crucial times. Other methods of heating and storing hot water have been installed in some places. While there has been some progress in this direction, there is a lot of leeway to make up, and there will probably be some resistance owing to the high cost of efficient water-heating equipment. A number of kitchens have had floor and wall surfaces tiled. There is a marked tendency for proprietors to use cheaper methods where possible, but there does not seem to be any real substitute for tiles for kitchen finishes. We have had a number of substitute floors laid, but no real satisfaction has been obtained from them during use. The atmospheric condition of many kitchens in the City cannot be regarded as satisfactory, especially those in basement kitchens. Some progress has been made during the past year with several large firms in re-designing and overhauling some of their existing ventilation equipment. Owing to the cost of such equipment we have not achieved completely satisfactory results in some smaller premises, the owners rather regarding the ventilation problem as one of providing a fan and ducting without expert advice, instead of regarding it as a matter of air conditioning needing expert design. There is some advance in the City in this direction, but it must of necessity be rather slow. In mobile canteens the standard of food hygiene attainable is generally below that required in fixed catering establishments, and they are only justified where facilities for obtaining refreshments are locally and temporarily insufficient to meet a considerable demand. Such conditions do not exist in the City and therefore mobile canteens have been discouraged. Nevertheless one has been established in Harp Lane. In this instance the proprietor has met all the conditions laid down in the Food and Drugs Act, even to the extent of providing two W.C.'s, etc., for staff on the site. As he conscientiously carried out the conditions laid down, there was no alternative but to recommend the issue of a catering licence. While this may not be regarded as a desirable achievement, it has, however, established a minimum standard for this type of business, and a number of would-be caterers of this sort have been deterred from any further activity in the City when referred to this particular canteen as the minimum we will accept. In our resistance to the establishment of mobile canteens on war-damaged sites, the Town Planning Department has not been able to give us the assistance for which we had hoped. The number of applications for new catering licences has fallen off considerably, and towards the end of the year were more and more confined to staff canteens. In the case of new canteens some good work has been carried out, and the Department has been able to exert influence on the fittings, planning, etc., although sometimes we have been called in rather late in the proceedings, especially in the case of new buildings. Generally speaking, we receive good co-operation from the firms involved, and of course the Ministry of Food invariably seek the opinion of the Department prior to the issuing of any new catering licences. In spite of the works which have been carried out, can we say that this has resulted in the food reaching the customer in a better condition ? This unfortunately is difficult to assess, owing to the fact that there is no practical way of ascertaining whether the working staff have improved in proportion. On many occasions it is possible to demonstrate to them effectively that the success of all endeavours to produce cleaner and safe food are finally dependent upon them, but it is difficult to know whether the argument has been appreciated to the extent that our precepts are put into practice day after day. Much as we would like to claim spectacular results in these efforts, it does seem that it is a process of evolution rather than a sudden and marked change for the better. We can only hope—and it appears to be well founded—that our efforts to get the catering staffs interested, will produce results in the long run. Public Houses.—A number of licensed premises have, as a result of activity by this Department, had better facilities installed from the point of view of protecting their prepared foods, and additional washing-up arrangements have been provided where these have been found to be inadequate. L.C.C. Restaurants.—The L.C.C. still have a few restaurants in the City. They have ceased to operate at Fishmongers Hall. The Department undoubtedly helped to hasten the closure of this kitchen, as conditions there were below a reasonable minimum standard, and were the subject of a fair amount of agitation by the Inspectors concerned. Open Air Feeding.—One or two proprietors of restaurants have acquired adjoining bombed sites and have placed tables and chairs on them—after the plot has been effectively cleansed and suitably improved—so that their customers can spread out in fine weather. This has not been discouraged, as we feel that this is a step in the right direction and achieves the dual purpose of improving a war-damaged site, and enabling the customers of what may be at certain times an over-crowded business, to sit and eat in comfort and in the open air. Conclusions.-—Much of the work in the past year has been achieved by reasoned approach and discussion with the trade and the people concerned. Owing to the general financial situation it may not be possible in future to achieve so much by these methods, and it may well be that when reluctance is shown to the making of improvements voluntarily, more use will have to be made of the legal powers available." 5 FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1938, AND FOOD REGULATIONS. Mr. G. E. Harrington, Food and Drugs Inspector, reports as follows:- 447 samples have been submitted to the Public Analyst; 20 of these were formal samples and 427 were informal samples. Nine samples were reported against. The percentage of adulterated samples was 1.6. Legal proceedings were instituted in three cases and in three other cases cautions were administered. Two samples of sweets were found on analysis to contain certain medicaments in small quantities and particulars were forwarded to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain inasmuch as the sales did not comply with the requirements of the Pharmacy and Medicines Act, 1941. Milk. Eighteen samples of milk were examined by both the Phosphatase and the Methylene Blue Tests and two samples by the Methylene Blue Test only. The Phosphatase Test is designed to check the efficiency of the heat treatment applied to the milk whilst the Methylene Blue Test gives an indication of its keeping quality which has some relation to general cleanliness. Adverse reports on the Methylene Blue Test were received in respect of six of these samples. In four cases where the milk was supplied from two premises outside the City, the matter was taken up with the suppliers. In the two other cases where the milk was sold from premises within the City, the vendors were interviewed, cautioned and advised regarding method of sale and storage. The average composition of milk samples taken during the year was milk fat 3.43 per cent.; solids-not-fat 8.86 per cent.; water 87.71 per cent. No milk samples were found to be adulterated. Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950. This consolidating enactment came into operation on 1st January, 1951. It repealed a large part of the Food and Drugs (Milk and Dairies) Act, 1944, and the whole of the Milk (Special Designations) Act, 1949, but made no change in the law. The Milk (Special Designations) (Specified Areas) Order, 1951. The Minister of Food by virtue of his powers under the Food and Drugs (Milk, Dairies and Artificial Cream) Act, 1950, made this Order on 27th July, 1951, to come into operation on 1st October, 1951. It specified certain areas (including the whole of the County of London) in which it would be illegal on and from 1st October, 1951, to sell by retail for human consumption any milk other than milk which may be sold as specially designated milk in accordance with the provisions of the Milk (Special Designation) (Raw Milk) Regulations, 1949, or the Milk (Special Designation) (Pasteurised and Sterilised Milk) Regulations, 1949. Retailers selling milk in the area specified (whether or not their premises are situated in such area) are required to be licensed by the appropriate licensing authority to use a special designation in relation to milk. Supplementary licences authorising the use of special designations in relation to milk to be sold in the City of London have been issued to twenty-eight firms with premises outside the City, and Dealer's licences to twelve firms with premises within the City. Cream. The Food Standards (Cream) Order, 1951.—This Order came into operation, in April, 1951. It prescribed standards for cream made from cow's milk but the production and sale of such cream during the year was of short duration owing to the unfavourable circumstances prevailing. Ice Cream. The Food Standards (Ice Cream) Order, 1951.—made in January, came into operation on 1st March, 1951, and prescribed, for the the first time, a standard for ice-cream to be sold in this country, viz., that it shall contain not less than 5 per cent. fat, 10 per cent. sugar and per cent. milk solids other than fat, with exceptions for certain types of ice-cream. The suggestion was made that this was in the nature of an interim standard and that it would be improved progressively as supplies became more plentiful. The average composition of samples of ice-cream taken in the City was: fat ll.7 per cent.; sucrose 13.4 per cent.; and non-fatty milk solids 8.7 per cent. Ten samples of ice-cream were examined by the Methylene Blue Test: Six were placed in Grade I, one in Grade II, two in Grade III and one in Grade IV. The last-mentioned three samples were taken on two separate occasions from the same shop. The particulars were communicated to the Local Authority of the District where the ice-cream was manufactured. A good deal of attention has been focussed on the production of icecream since the end of the War and along with an ever-increasing demand for this foodstuff, it would appear that there is a tendency for more retailers in the City to draw their supplies from large scale manufacturers, who, with the supplies available are able, by improved methods, to place a higher quality product on the market. Generally samples of ice-cream have shown much improvement since the commencement of sampling in 1946. Fourteen new registrations of premises for the sale and storage of ice-cream were granted during the year. WATER SUPPLY. The main supply of water to the City is obtained from river sources by the Metropolitan Water Board, who undertake regular chemical and bacteriological examinations to ensure its purity. In addition, water, for both public and private supplies, is abstracted from underground sources in the Thames Basin. The total number of deep-water wells in the area of the Metropolitan Water Board is at least 4,000, of which about 250 are for public supplies. The number of private wells serving industry, offices, etc., in the City is 134. A complete survey of the position in the City was undertaken in 1948, but no cause for anxiety emerged as a result of it. Since that date the periodical examination 6 of samples taken direct from the wells show that the water is normally of a high standard of chemical quality and bacterial purity. The results of the examinations indicate the water to be wholesome in character and suitable for drinking and domestic purposes. With few exceptions the water is also subjected to precautionary chlorination. The possibility of the pollution of the water-bearing strata below the London Clay is always kept in mind, particularly from the fractured bore tubes of abandoned wells. No official guidance has been given on the most effective method of sealing such wells, but during the year, after consideration of suggestions from various sources, the following method was adopted for the sealing of an abandoned well in the City. The problem is to prevent impure water from the strata above the impervious clay draining down the disused bore tubes to the chalk below, whence the deep well water is drawn. This particular well was bored in 1907 to a depth of 551 feet. The internal diameter of the bore was 8½ inches. The level of the water in the bore was approximately 151 feet from the adjoining road level compared with the level of 159 feet when the well was originally sunk. The strata sheet, prepared during the course of the boring operation, showed that the chalk was reached at a depth of 329 feet. Immediately above the stratum of chalk and flints was a bed of Thanet Sand and a bed of impervious clay which holds up the contaminated water in the gravels above. It was decided to fill the lower part of the bore with ¾ inch washed shingle to a point just above the bed of chalk and flints, but below the bed of impervious clay, to provide foundation for the concrete. From this point the remainder of the bore was filled in with concrete made with 4 parts of 1½ inch shingle, to 2 parts of sand and 1 part of cement , mixed with a waterproofing compound. There is a consensus of opinion that this method is the most satisfactory, and it is proposed to adopt it for the sealing of other disused wells. It would be of advantage if it were made compulsory for the owner of any private well to notify the local authority of his intention to discontinue its use. This would ensure that it is satisfactorily sealed off. Many such wells have been sealed off merely by covering the top of the bore with a slab of concrete, but this method becomes useless if, in the course of time, the bore tubes are fractured through rust or other causes, thus allowing impure water to drain into and contaminate the underground water supply. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. I am indebted to Mr. McGrath for the following report:— "The year 1951 was the third complete year of the recommencement of observations since the original deposit gauge was destroyed in 1940. The Table sets out the results obtained in 1951 by the various methods employed in the City for the measurement of atmospheric pollution. These methods were fully described in my Annual Report for the year 1949, The averages for the last three years are set out at the foot of the Table. The average rainfall for 1951 was much higher than in the previous two years, and although increased rainfall usually results in a higher soluble deposit the figure for total solids was 0 40 tons per square mile less than that of 1950. It will be seen, however, that the sulphur pollution estimated by the lead peroxide and volumetric methods is in excess of that for the two previous years. The suspended impurity, i.e., soot and tar pollution principally due to the burning of raw coal in domestic fires, also shows an appreciable increase, but insufficient time has elapsed since observations were recommenced to enable any significant conclusions to be drawn about the rate of emission of pollution. As I pointed out in my last Annual Report, conclusions of any value cannot be drawn from observations extending over less than five years. The appearance on the sky line in recent months of the tall chimney stack of the large electricity generating station in course of construction at Bankside on the south side of the River focuses attention on the sources of pollution by sulphur; on the fact that it is impracticable to remove sulphur compounds from the chimney gases of any but the largest coal-burning installations ; and that it is still impossible for economic reasons to stop this pollution entirely. It is well known that these compounds cause damage to the fabric of buildings, metal work, textiles, etc., and it will be recalled that the proposal to construct the generating station at Bankside caused considerable concern that the emission of sulphur fumes would cause an undue acceleration of the damage by atmospheric pollution to the fabric of St. Paul's Cathedral and other public buildings in the City. This concern will be readily understood when it is remembered that it has been calculated that for the country as a whole, electricity generating stations are responsible for some 17 per cent. of the total amount of sulphur emitted. For the London Area the corresponding figure is about 28 per cent. This does not mean that the generating stations are responsible for this proportion of the local pollution of the atmosphere at ground level. Their flue gases are emitted at a height of some hundreds of feet and are dispersed into the upper air to an extent much greater than the gases from domestic fires at very much lower level. Parliament has stipulated that the greater part of the sulphur compounds should be removed from the chimney gases of the Bankside Station, and to secure this a large and expensive plant is to be installed. Simply stated, the process—a modernised type of the one in use at the Battersea Generating Station-—enables the chimney gases to be washed with very large volumes of river water to which a little chalk is added. The sulphur dioxide is absorbed by the water and oxidised and neutralised. When the new station is in operation, the results obtained from the various methods for measuring atmospheric pollution will be studied with interest. The British Electricity Authority, no doubt with a full appreciation of its responsibilities in the matter, has established in the City three observation sites for the measurement of sulphur dioxide by the lead peroxide method. These are similar to those in use at the Corporation's sites at Golden Lane and Finsbury Circus." 7 Results obtained in 1951 of the monthly observations of rainfall and total solid deposited matter, the monthly observations of sulphur dioxide by the lead peroxide method, and the daily observations of the concentration of smoke and sulphur dioxide by the volumetric method.

From time to time one sees and hears facetious remarks about the designation "Rodent Officer," coupled with an enquiry as to why the old name "rat catcher" is not good enough. Such remarks display both ignorance of the duties of a rodent officer today and lack of appreciation of the skill and the conscientious work necessary to reduce to and maintain at a minimum the numbers of rats and mice. A rodent officer does not simply set cage- or spring-traps to catch rats. First of all he must by inspection ascertain the fact and the degree of infestation, then he must consider which of the various methods available is likely to be most effective, in the particular circumstances, for the destruction of the existing colony of rats. Then, knowing that rats will always return if means of access, good nesting places and food and water are available, and will breed up to the limits of the means of subsistence, he must ask himself where are the rats coming from?; what are they coming for (nesting, food, water) ? ; how are they getting in ? ; is it practicable to deny access ; to eliminate harbourage ; to make food and water unobtainable ? Many years ago I wrote, "the only way of keeping the rat population permanently down to a minimum is to present them with a housing problem and a high cost of living." Methods to these ends are called rat-proofing, and though it will always be true that they provide the only permanent cure of the rat problem, it is not always practicable to apply them, indeed at the present time it is often more difficult to do so than it was before the war, owing to scarcity and high cost of labour and materials. Methods of rat destruction must therefore be actively and constantly pursued, but rats, if not intelligent, are at least observant, suspicious and cautious and they quickly learn what has proved dangerous to life, or even health, and avoid it. It is therefore necessary to be able to employ a variety of methods of rat destruction, to choose the one most suitable under all the circumstances and to change it when the rats have recognised the danger. There is therefore much more in the work of the rodent officer than just rat-catching. If anyone can find a better designation by all means let it be adopted, but rat-catcher won't do; it is hardly less appropriate than calling an orthopaedic surgeon a bone-setter. Mr. Carter, your Rodent Officer, has submitted a report which I have reproduced below in full because of its special value in regard to the use of two new poisons "Warfarin" and " 1080." It is a high tribute to Mr. Carter that the City has been allowed by the Infestation Division of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to carry out during the year four full-scale treatments of the sewers with the deadly poison "1080." It is the first time this has been done in this country. The results, as Mr. Carter's report shows, appear to have been highly satisfactory, there have been no untoward results and permission has been given for the experiment to be continued for a further twelve months. Mr. Carter reports as follows:— "Organisation and procedure during the year was similar to that of previous years, and in compliance with the requirements of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, comprised inspections of properties to ascertain the presence of rats and mice, treatment of any such properties found to be infested, and periodical maintenance treatments for the destruction of rats in sewers. It has not been necessary to serve Statutory Notices under the Act, as occupiers and owners of properties have readily co-operated, it being generally realised that the primary factor in achieving the maximum results in work of this nature, was the co-ordination and application of measures by operators whose sole concern is the destruction of rats and mice, as opposed to haphazard and spasmodic attempts at control. 8 Pre-baiting followed by poisoning has again been the principal means of extermination with trapping as a secondary measure, and the methods officially recognised have been adhered to. During the period under review, 3,545 premises were inspected and these comprised blocks of offices, riverside warehouses, markets, restaurants and kitchens, workshops and domestic dwellings. A total of 651 infestations were treated and these consisted of 82 major and 266 minor rat infestations, and 182 major and 121 minor infestations by mice. This work entailed 9,529 revisits for operational purposes. In the process of pre-baiting, 33,712 initial points were selected, 124,789 pre-baits and 25,291 poison baits were laid. These measures resulted in a minimum estimated kill of 3,436 rats, and of this number 1,308 bodies were found. Trapping was the means of destroying 775 rats, and adding those found as the result of poison, a total of 2,083 bodies were removed from premises. In addition 643 mice were found as the result of poison and traps. In 85 instances structural rat-proofing was carried out by occupiers or owners, and in four instances defective drainage resulting in rat infestation was remedied. During the latter part of the year the use of Warfarin as a rodenticide was, with reservations, officially recognised by the Infestation Division, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Warfarin (3 Alpha-phenyl-beta-acetylethyl-4-hydroxycoumarin) is a blood anti-coagulant which, when ingested regularly in small doses over a period of time, induces fatal haemorrhage in rats and mice. It is slow acting and a sufficient time must elapse for the animals to suffer capillary damage and to develop a hæmorrhagic condition. During this time they seem neither to feel pain nor to undergo physiological disturbance with which they could associate resulting illness. The time between the commencement of feeding and death varies, but is usually within 5-10 days. Both sexes appear to be equally susceptible, but pregnant females and young rats usually die first. The toxicity of Warfarin varies for the different species of rodents. The Ship (black) rat and House mouse are said to be some 3.4 times more resistant than the Common (Sewer) rat. The concentrations recommended are 0.025 per cent. and 0.005 per cent. for use against Ship rat and Common rat respectively. Owing to the difficulty of hand-mixing such small quantities, a master mix of fine oatmeal containing 0.5 per cent. and 0.1 per cent. by weight is obtainable and when mixed with the bait base to be used at 5 per cent. by weight, produces the concentrations advised. Pre-baiting is unnecessary and the bait should be left in position undisturbed, more being added as required until feeding ceases. Since the bait must be left down for a relatively long period, it is necessary to use a dry bait and medium oatmeal is advised. If this bait is readily taken it is not necessary to visit daily, and usually three times a week to replenish is sufficient. If, however, the dry bait is not acceptable and a moist bait is used, these must be replaced daily. Although the use of Warfarin against mice has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, many infestations of this nature have been treated in the City and the results appear satisfactory. The introduction of Warfaren does not mean that the methods employed in the past are obsolete; its use provides an additional means of rodent control. Following the initial treatment for the destruction of rats in sewers, December, 1943, it has been the practice, in accordance with legislation, and in conjunction with Metropolitan Boroughs contiguous to the City, to carry out a six-monthly maintenance treatment. It is the purpose of these treatments to check the build-up of the common rat population in the sewers, and thereby assist in preventing infestations of surface properties from this source via defective drainage. Such treatments comprised a two-day pre-bait, followed by poisoning at entrances where pre-bait was taken, and recording of the result on the fourth day. On completion of maintenance treatment No. 13 December, 1950, analysis of the result showed that the upward trend of the pre-bait 'takes' had continued. Unfortunately little is known scientifically of the movement of rats in sewers, but it appeared to indicate that the low basic level of the residual rat population attained by maintenance controls up to May, 1948, was not being maintained, and that there was increased distribution over a wider area, plus the breeding increase during the intervening period. It was considered that efforts should be made to effect a further reduction, and discussions were held with the Technical Officers, Infestation Division, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. As a result, it was suggested by them that a series of four treatments at quarterly intervals be carried out; such treatments to comprise direct poisoning with Sodium Fluoro-acetate technically known as Compound '1080' This compound is produced in the U.S.A. and was supplied by the Ministry, who, it is understood, hold the entire stock in this country. By using the direct poisoning method the time taken for a treatment would be halved by reason of the elimination of two days pre-baiting, so that four controls per year would involve approximately the same number of man-hours as was required by the two six-monthly treatments. The compound is in powder form and as a precautionary measure is tinted blue with nigrosene dye. It is extremely lethal to man and animals, there being no known antidote. It should never be handled without rubber gloves being worn, and its use should be controlled by a responsible person, both in its dispensing and distribution. It has been used experimentally against surface infestations on several occasions by the Ministry, and to a larger extent by the Port of London Health Authority, but the treatments recently concluded are the first to be undertaken in the entire sewer system of any area. 9 For the application of the treatments the sewer area was divided into sewer sections each having approximately 63 entrances. It was decided not to bait every entrance in each sector, and 306 of a total of 427 usually pre-baited were selected. This number comprised 225 entrances where pre-bait 'takes' were recorded during the December, 1950, treatment, plus 81 entrances which showed a negative result at that time, but where ' takes ' were recorded on either of the two previous treatments. Every precaution necessary was taken during the mixing of the bait and rubber gloves were worn. The bait comprised sausage rusk and water in equal parts by weight, evenly mixed with '1080' which is soluble and odourless, at a concentration of 1 per cent. by weight. The bait was mixed in batches of 100 ozs., the required amount of rusk being added to the solution and well stirred to obtain an even mix. After each mix every utensil was thoroughly washed under a running tap. The bait was carried in large tins with lids, and the operator depositing the bait wore rubber gloves which he put on before leaving the depot. Each bait was 4 ozs., this amount being measured by means of a mug holding that amount. As each sector took approximately 5½ hours it was obvious that a break would be necessary, and the operators were instructed to adjourn to a public convenience, where the recording operator who had not touched the poison would turn on the wash basin tap to enable the depositing operator to wash his gloves before removing them and so avoid touching any object before doing so. The labour needed to work a sector comprised a sewerman to raise the covers and two operators. One operator deposited and picked up the baits, and the other recorded, lowered and raised the container when the poison was cleared up. The baiting and examination of four sectors was observed by officers of the Ministry. In the treatments prior to this series, when Zinc Phosphide and Arsenious Oxide were used, it was the practice to take a recording from the top of the entrance, and leave the bait to decompose, but in the instance of this series it was imperative that the poison be cleared up. This entailed descent of the shafts, and also enabled a reasonably correct recording to be made. The method of treating was to bait three sectors on Monday, examine and pick up on Thursday ; three sectors on Tuesday, examine and pick up on Friday ; and one sector on Wednesday, examine and pick up on Saturday, thus covering the whole area in the week. The poison 'takes' of the half-yearly pre-bait treatments from May, 1949-December, 1950, were 126, 109, 158 and 153 respectively, each bait being 8 ozs. and the 'takes' ranging from good to small. In the May, 1951, treatment by direct poisoning with '1080,' 150 'takes' (3 complete, 12,X¾, 25X½, 103X¼, total 150) were recorded. In the second of the series September, 1951, 142 'takes' were recorded (6x¾, 25X½ and 111X¼). The third in December, 1951, produced 89 'takes' (1 complete, 2X¾, 7X½ and 79X¼). The final treatment completed on the 15th March, 1952, produced only 53 'takes' (1 complete, 2X¾, 6X0½ and 44X¼ or less). Of the 44X¼ or less 'takes,' 20 were so small as to be hardly perceptible and could only be seen on close examination. During these treatments, 121 bodies were found at the base of the shafts, or in the flow close to the base. This does not include those found subsequently by the sewermen along the lengths of the sewers and in dead ends during their routine work. In one instance, 15 bodies in one group were found, close to the entrance where a complete 'take' of poison was recorded in the final treatment. The final result appears to be very satisfactory, there being a reduction of 97 poison 'takes' from the May, 1951, '1080' control, and 100 poison 'takes' from the normal pre-bait control of December, 1950. From these facts it can be reasonably assumed that the entrances and lengths of sewers near the entrances where no 'takes' were recorded are free of rats. This is to some extent corroborated by the sewermen who state that they see only an occasional rat, also by the fact that few surface infestations of common or sewer rat character are found in the City today, and these are usually of a minor nature and mainly in the Billingsgate area among the older properties. In one recent instance in this area, a small infestation estimated at eight rats was found in a basement where food is stored. Considerable damage had been done, and from borings and runs in the concrete floor it appeared that the source was defective drainage. Subsequent tests proved this correct, and major work costing several hundreds of pounds was necessary to remedy the nuisance. In this case, the property was open to rats in the sewers, the basement offering food and harbourage, and it can only be assumed that the small number of rats to find access and take advantage of the defects was due to the reduction of the population in the sewers. Consideration has been given to the question of test-baiting all the entrances poisoned in this series of controls, and it appears that little useful information would be gained for the additional costs this would incur. It is, however, proposed to apply a treatment late in May, 1952, again using '1080' and including all entrances not baited in this series. Graph No. 1 illustrates the breakdown of the pre-bait 'takes' from December, 1943, to May, 1948, and the progressive rise from that point up to December, 1950. The taller columns represent the pre-bait ' takes ' and the smaller columns the poison ' takes.' Summary No. 1 gives full details of the results of these treatments, and summary 1A gives details of the pre-bait and poison ' takes ' of four of these treatments prior to the ' 1080' series.

During the year, 37 families, comprising 99 persons, were rehoused. This included 24 families (65 persons) transferred within property under the control of the Corporation. Two blocks of flats were under construction on a housing site in Old Kent Road, which was formerly part of the Bridge House Estates of the Corporation, and it is expected that both will be completed and occupied during 1952. One block to be called George Elliston House will comprise 45 flats, the other to be called Wilkins House will comprise 20 flats. I referred also, in my last Annual Report, to the acquisition of a site in Golden Lane, partly in the City but mainly in the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. The compulsory purchase order in relation to this site was confirmed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 27th February, 1951. The Corporation decided to use the method of an architectural competition for the purpose of select ing an architect for the scheme, and this was organised in collaboration with the Royal Institute of British Architects. The conditions of the competition were announced on 12th July, 1951, the closing date for submission of designs being 31st January, 1952. Between 900 and 950 persons will be housed on this site, and it is estimated that the cost, including the acquisition of the land, will be about a million pounds. THE WELFARE OF OLD PEOPLE. On September 28th, 1950, the Lord Mayor invited a number of representative citizens to the Mansion House to consider the desirability of forming a City of London Old People's Welfare Association. The meeting unanimously resolved that such an Association should be formed, but it was not till June, 1951, that the Constitution of the Association, modelled on the form suggested by the National Council of Social Service and amended to suit the particular circumstances of the City, was agreed and adopted. Since then the Association has been very active. Records of the names and addresses of the old people and of their circumstances and needs have been compiled with the help of voluntary visitors, whose interest and sympathy has been welcomed in every instance and who have been able to do a great deal to brighten the lives of old people and to help them in many of their difficulties and perplexities. The Three Score Club, in the Corporation flats on the east side of the City, is open every day and has been a great success. The enthusiasm and enjoyment with which the old people enter into the varied social activities of the Club is heart-warming. They are a most responsive audience to all the generous people who have come to entertain them, but they are by no means entirely dependent on visitors ; there is a surprising amount of talent amongst the members of the Club. It has not yet been possible to provide a similar club for the west side of the City, but the City of London Residents' Association have been most helpful in granting facilities at their Club for the old people. A very successful holiday scheme was organised and nearly 50 old people were enabled to spend a week at the seaside. Through the London Council of Social Service outings were arranged for about 80 old people, who were entertained by Women's Institutes in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and 60 members of the Club spent a day at Brighton as the guests of the Portsoken Ward Club. All the old people received a Christmas dinner and a small food parcel from funds provided by the Lady Mayoress, the Mansion House Poor Box and many private persons. Home help has been promptly supplied whenever and wherever necessary ; a chiropody service has been arranged, and invalid chairs have been made available. Everything possible is done for the old people in the City within the limited financial resources of the City of London Old People's Welfare Association and a grateful tribute is due to the Hon. Secretary of the Association, Mrs. R. Cohen, who devotes all her leisure to welfare activities, and to whom the Association's successful beginning is very largely due. MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS. Your Medical Officer carries out the medical examination of all new entrants to the staff of the Corporation; of those who appear to be medically unfit to continue in employment and of those who have had prolonged or repeated absence on account of illness. In connection with the two last-mentioned categories, it is frequently necessary to correspond with medical and surgical specialists on the staff of hospitals and with general medical practitioners, and I have pleasure in recording that I have always received from them the greatest assistance and courtesy. The total number of medical examinations during the year was 228. WIDOWS' PENSIONS. The City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1950, gave the option to existing Officers of the Corporation Staff to have the scheme for Widows' Pensions applied to them. A recommendation for a health test, with a refused liability for the first five years in case of failure to pass the test, was approved by the Joint Advisory Committee as providing a safeguard for the fund. Accordingly a questionnaire similar to a form of "Proposal for Life Assurance without Medical Examination" was prepared, and each applicant for admission to the scheme was required to complete such form and submit it to your Medical Officer of Health. 534 forms were received by your Medical Officer of Health ; 468 persons were accepted and 7 were rejected on the information given on the forms. It was necessary to carry out medical examinations in 59 cases. Of these 50 were accepted, 7 were rejected, and 2, who were on sick leave and were unable to attend when requested, have since died. The results are summarised as follows:— Members electing to enter the Scheme 534 Members passed for admission 5181 Members deferred for first five years 14 Members dying before interviews arranged 2 }534J 16 STAFF. The members of your staff in this Department carried out their duties with efficiency, tact and courtesy during the year, and only on three occasions has it been necessary to have recourse to the Courts to secure compliance with public health legislation. At the end of the year, Mr. C. Slatter, your Chief Meat Inspector at Smithfield Market and Mr. S. B. Murray, the Deputy Chief Meat Inspector, resigned after 43 years and 40 years' service with the Corporation, respectively. Mr. C. Mellish was subsequently appointed Chief Inspector and Mr. F. E. Thompson, Deputy Chief Inspector ; both these Officers have served the Corporation as Meat Inspectors for many years. In April, 1951, Mr. H. J. Aldhous, B.Sc. (Estate Management) resigned, having obtained an appointment as Housing Officer to the Egham U.D.C. One of your Rodent Operatives also resigned during the year. It is with regret that I record the death of Mrs. Graham who had been employed as Bath Attendant and Cleaner at the City Mortuary and Cleansing Station since 1927. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, CHAS. F. WHITE, Medical Officer of Health. 17 STATISTICAL INFORMATION. Area.—661 acres (including the Temple and Tidal Water and foreshore).

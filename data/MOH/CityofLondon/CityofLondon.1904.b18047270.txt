ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE YEAR 1904, To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., March, 1905. Gentlemen, In presenting my fifth Annual Report as Medical Officer of Health for the City of London, I would refer to some of the more important work in which your Staff has been engaged during the year. One feature of the year was the absence—with one exception referred to later—of any incident calculated to disturb the public mind. The death rate was the lowest ever recorded in the City, and the number of cases of infectious diseases reported was also the smallest since notification was made compulsory. It is satisfactory to find that no case of illness attributable to the consumption of shellfish purchased in the City was notified during the year. In this connection it is interesting to learn from some recent experiments made by Dr. Klein, on behalf of the Fishmongers' Company, that oysters contaminated with specific infective bacilli possess the property of ridding themselves of such micro-organisms within a short period when relaid in clean waters. Other shellfish were found to cleanse themselves under similar conditions, but more slowly. Some references to the official inspection and marking of meat exported from Holland and Denmark to this country will be found on p. 102, while the whole of that portion of the Report relating to the control of food supplies may, perhaps, appeal to those interested in the subject. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts have continued to be actively administered, with the effect of reducing the proportion of adulterated samples from 1311 per cent, in 1901 to 5.5 per cent, in 1904. In fairness to the Citizens it should be pointed out that the chief offenders are not natives of this country, and some figures illustrating this point are given on p. 122. 10 The Bye-laws for the regulation of tenement houses have been revised for reasons stated in the text of this Report, and new Bye-laws relating to water-closets, &c., and their accessories have been made under the powers conferred on the Corporation by Section 54 of the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1900. In each case these have been confirmed by the Local Government Board. The baths provided for the use of the occupiers of the Artizans' Dwellings in Stoney Lane were opened in May last, and a reference to the number of attendances given on p. 53 will show ample justification for the expense incurred in making this necessary provision for the well-being of the tenants of the Corporation. The exception before mentioned refers to the important question of milk supply and milk transport. Those aware of the danger incurred—especially by infants—by the ingestion of contaminated milk will readily understand the significance attaching to the results of Dr. Klein's bacteriological examination on the samples submitted to him (see p. 28). These may have far reaching results, and it is not improbable that they may indicate one of the chieffactors in the maintenance of the continued heavy rate of infantile mortality. AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 672.7 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.051 square miles, equal to a square of 1.0252 miles to a side. The area of" Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 10.81 miles to a side. DENSITY (1904). City of London, Registration District, at night - - 35 persons to an acre. „ „ „ „ during the day - *533.5 „ „ Registration London, at night - 62.1 „ „ „ ,, during the day not known. No Imperial Day Census has yet been taken. ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The assessed rateable annual value of property within the administrative county of London was £41,657,244 in 1904—whilst the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London, including Temples, was £5,107,182 in 1904, or nearly one-eighth of the whole County. * This figure refers ODly to persons "actively engaged in the City during the daytime." The actual number of people visiting the City daily is probably nearly 1,500,000. 11 POPULATION. The undermentioned figures are abstracted from the Registrar-General's Report, dated 30th December, 1901, on the Census of England and Wales, 1901 (County of London). TABLE A. Area. Statute Acres. Inhabited Houses. Population. 1891. 1901. 1891. 1901. City of London 672.7 5,340 3,865 37,702 26,923 For Registration, Parliamentary and Municipal purposes the boundaries of the City are co-terminous. These figures represent the population on the night of the 1st April, 1891 and 1901. A Day Census—the number of persons actively engaged in the City during the daytime—has been taken on three occasions, viz., in 1866, 1881, and 1891. It is a matter for regret that no Day enumeration was made in the City during the last Imperial Census year. TABLE B. CENSUS RETURNS. Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census.

This consists of two sub-districts, together containing a population of 23,565 at the middle of 1904, calculated on the last Census Returns:— *St. Botolph 8,887 †St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 14,678 Total 23,565 The Night population, therefore, of the City of London Registration District at the middle of 1904, is taken at 23,565, and it is upon this figure that all vital statistics in this Report have been calculated. The Day population at the middle of 1904 was estimated at 364,120. A Day Census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. In 1903 it was ascertained that in the week ending 19th July no less than 347,463 vehicles passed to and from the four City bridges, viz.:—London, Southwark, Blackfriars and Tower, equivalent to upwards of 18,000,000 vehicles per annum. BIRTHS. During the year 1904, 353 births were registered in the City. The annual birth rate was at the rate of 15.0 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 13.9 per 1,000. The birth rates last year in the Sub-Districts were— St. Botolph 20.7 per 1,000 St. Sepulchre and Allhallows 11.5 „ In the Metropolis the birth rate in 1904 was 27.9 per 1,000, being the lowest hitherto recorded therein. This decline in the birth rate has been in operation since 1871 or 1872, and is common to nearly all European countries. * At the date of the last Census, this District included the "civil parish" of Glasshouse Yard. The parish was transferred to the Holborn Union by the Local Government Board Order, No. 43156, which came into operation on 29th September, 1901, and to the Registration District of Holborn (Finsbury Sub-District) on 1st January, 1902, making the Registration District of London City co-extensive with the Municipal City of London. All the Registration Districts in London are co-extensive with the Poor-Law Parishes or Unions except the District of Fulham. t On the 1st April, 1901, the Middle Temple was transferred from the Strand Sub-District to St. Sepulchre Sub-District. 13 VACCINATION. Of the children born in 1904, 229 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, and 28 had died before the age for vaccination. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 14 cases, 1 infant was reported to be insusceptible to vaccination, 36 had removed into other districts, and 40 vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 5 cases of conscientious objection. Vaccination Statistics in the City of London. Year. Number of Births. Successfully Vaccinated. Insusceptible. Had Small pox. Died before Vaccination.

During the year under review, 865 deaths were registered in the District, including *644 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table I. for details. Deducting the latter we have to deal with 221 deaths, to which we must add 85 persons who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered. The mortality, therefore, upon which our death rate is calculated is 306. The death rate for 1904 was 12.9 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 12.0), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 16.6. These figures are not corrected for sex and age distribution. Death Rates, per 1,000 per Annum. Year. City of London. Great Towns of England and Wales.

The deaths from zymotic disease per 1,000 of the population was 0.32 compared with 2.18 in the Metropolis. The deaths of children under one year of age to 1,000 births come out 96, against 146 for the whole of London. Deaths in City Institutions. During 1904, 85 persons died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries, or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 27.8 per cent, of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis (1904) being 208 per cent. This high percentage is caused in the City by the excessive proportion the number of inmates in these places (exclusive of officers and their families) bears to our population, the ratio being about 1:20, as compared with 1:94 in the Metropolis (Census 1901). In other words, these figures represent that one in every 20 citizens is an inmate of either a Workhouse, Workhouse Infirmary or a Lunatic Asylum, in comparison with one in every 94 inhabitants of the Metropolis.

Of the City deaths, 6.2 per cent, were caused by injuries or violence (as compared with 8.03 in 1902 and 5.03 in 1903), being 0.7 below the average for the previous five years.

By the term "Non-residents" is meant persons brought into the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and dying in public institutions there; and by the term "Residents" is meant persons who have been taken out of the district on account of sickness or infirmity, and have died in public institutions elsewhere.

SHELTER FOR TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATION DURING DISINFECTION. The Shelter in Golden Lane, Barbican, provided in accordance with Sec. 60 (4) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which enacts that" sanitary "authorities shall provide free of charge temporary shelter or house "accommodation with necessary attendants for the members of any family "in which any dangerous infectious disease has appeared, for the purpose of "enabling such dwellings to be disinfected by the sanitary authority," has been visited by 10 families during the year.

Unfortunately, owing to the state of public business last Session, this measure had so little chance of being considered that it was withdrawn in the Commons before the Second Reading. It was, however, re-introduced in the House of Lords by the Duke of Northumberland, when it was passed on the 5th August, 1904, and received by the House of Commons three days later. The Session coming to an end shortly afterwards, the Bill could not be further proceeded with. This Bill was the natural sequence to the statute that created the "conscientious objector," which was indeed passed on the understanding that a Re-vaccination Bill should be brought in. Being entirely non-political in character, it was essentially a measure that should have been promoted by the Government, who, although stated to be in no sense hostile to the Bill, showed a somewhat unsympathetic attitude towards it. It is to be hoped, therefore, that pressure will be brought to bear upon the Government of the day to induce them to introduce or assist the passage of a similar Bill next Session. That they could be induced to do either is doubtful, as in these days of "passive resistance," when notoriety can easily be obtained by a cheap martyrdom, it is to be feared that no Government would risk the unpopularity amongst a section of the community that the support of a Re-vaccination Bill might entail. The object of the Bill promoted last year was to make re-vaccination compulsory within six months after children reached the age of twelve years. It was practically an extension of the existing Vaccination Acts, and the same penalties were imposed as in the case of primary infant vaccination. The weak point in the Bill, as in the existing Act, was the inclusion of a clause relating to exemption on account of conscientious objection. With this exception, the Bill was worthy of support in the best interests of the community. Similar legislation has been in operation in Germany for thirty years, where the Vaccination Law of April, 1874, requires that young children must be vaccinated before the end of the calendar year following the year of birth, and all school children must be re-vaccinated in their twelfth year. Obedience to this law is enforced by fine or imprisonment. In a Report issued last year by the Local Government Board, as the result of an enquiry conducted in Germany by Dr. Bruce Low, it is noted that during the twelve years—1891-1902—there were recorded in England and Wales, with a population of 32,526,075 persons, 6,761 deaths from Small-pox, while in Germany, with a population of 56,367,178, during the same period only 607 deaths from this disease were registered. These differences are very striking, and we may reasonably infer that had a primary and secondary vaccination been as efficiently carried out in this 22 country as it is in Germany, instead of 6,761 persons dying of Small-pox during the above period, the number recorded would have been only 353. In other words, 6,408 lives have been sacrificed owing to the weakness shown by successive Governments in yielding to the unreasoning prejudice of anti-vaccinationists. SMALL-POX. In April last, in consequence of a slight recrudescence of Small-pox in the metropolis, enquiries were made at the premises of 40 City firms where contacts were reported. In all 1,476 persons were visited. Of these, 804 were found sufficiently safeguarded, and 248 were forthwith either vaccinated or re-vaccinated, the remainder refusing further protection. On the 5th April, on making enquiries at a restaurant near the City boundary, one of the employes was found to be suffering from Small-pox while actively engaged in preparing food. It was further ascertained that another young woman had recently returned to work after an attack of Influenza and "Chicken-pox." Medical confirmation being obtained, the case was duly notified, and the patient removed to hospital. The restaurant was at once closed, and the premises, linen, &c., disinfected. In the meantime the entire staff of eleven persons was re-vaccinated. There was only one other case of Small-pox notified during 1904; this was also from some premises on the City boundary. In the course of the year 67 enquiries were conducted in cases of notification of persons having been in contact with persons suffering from Small-pox outside the City. In these investigations 4,004 employees of various firms were seen, of whom 2,490 were found to be properly protected; of the others, 753 were induced to submit to re-vaccination. In January last year I submitted a Report to the Sanitary Committee upon some recommendations made to the St. Pancras Borough Council by their Medical Officer of Health, to which the Corporation of London, together with other Metropolitan Boroughs, were invited to subscribe by the St. Pancras Borough Council. These were drawn up with the object of securing additional powers for preventing the spread of infection from Small-pox. 0 These recommendations were to the following effect:— "To request the London County Council to insert Section 42 of the "Brighton Corporation Act in their next General Powers Bill, as under :— "When an inmate of any building used for human habitation within "the Borough is suffering from any infectious disease, then, unless such "building is a hospital in which persons suffering from an infectious 23 "disease are received, the following provisions shall have effect, that is " to say :— "(1) The head of the family to which such inmate (in this "section referred to as the patient) belongs, and failing the nearest "relative of the patient present in the building, or being in "attendance on the patient, or failing such relative every person in "charge of or in attendance on i he patient, shall, upon demand in ''writing from the Medical Officer of Health of the Borough, furnish "the following particulars, or such of them as may be demanded, "relating to the patient and to the members of the family of the "patient, so far as the same are within his knowledge, or can be "reasonably obtained by him, viz.:— "(a) The name, age, employment or occupation, and place "of employment or occupation of the patient. "(b) The names and ages of the members of the family of "the patient being inmates of the building in which the disease "has occurred, and their employment or occupation, and place "of employment or occupation, and in the case of children "attending school, the names of the schools attended. "(2) Every person being an inmate of the building in which the "disease has occurred, shall, upon demand in writing by the Medical "Officer of Health of the Borough, furnish the following particulars, "or such of them as may be demanded:— "The names, ages, and employment or occupation of himself "and the members of his family being inmates of such building, "and in the case of children attending school, the names of the "schools attended. "(3) The employer of any person employed in, but not an inmate of the building in which the disease has occurred, shall, upon receipt "of notice in writing from the Medical Officer of Health of the "Borough of the existence of the disease, and written demand for "the name of any person so employed therein, furnnish such name if "the same is within his knowledge, or can be ascertained by him by "any reasonable means, to the Medical Officer of Health of the " Borough. "(4) Every person required by this section to furnish information "who fails to give the same, or wilfully gives false information with "reference thereto, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding forty "shillings. "(5) To recommend that the London County Council be requested "to insert a section into their next General Powers Bill, providing "that any person inhabiting any house in which a case of Small-pox "breaks out, who knowingly and wilfully associates with other "persons without having his or her own person or clothes cleansed 24 "and disinfected to the satisfaction of a medical practitioner, shall " be liable to a fine not exceeding forty shillings." It was also suggested that the Home Secretary be petitioned to make an order for the prevention of diseases, especially of Small-pox and Consumption, communicable to workers in laundries, declaring that in laundries the examining, sorting and mending of dirty linen be prohibited as dangerous under the Factory and Workshop Act, until after it has been effectually disinfected by boiling or washing in strong soap and water or by some other equally effectual means. It was further recommended that the President of the Local Government Board be petitioned to frame general legislation on the following lines :— " That in casual wards, poor law buildings, common lodging-houses, " and poor men's hotels, e.g. Rowton Houses, &c., when Small-pox breaks " out, inmates be prohibited from leaving the house until after the " expiration of a fortnight from the date or removal of the patient, except " to be removed to a Small-pox hospital or to a quarantine station. " Provided that this prohibition do not apply to inmates that submit to " immediate disinfection and cleansing of their clothing and person, and " undertake to remain in residence at the house during the above" mentioned period, and to submit themselves for medical examination " when required. Provided also that the Sanitary Authority be " empowered to make such compensation as they may consider adequate " to any inmates complying with any requirements they may make." The Sanitary Committee decided to support these proposals, and the St. Pancras Borough Council was so informed. NOTIFICATION OF CHICKEN POX. On the 19th April last, the Corporation were notified that the Local Government Board had approved, as a case of emergency, a Resolution passed by the Council on the 29th March extending the application of Section 55 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, in the Administrative County of London to Chicken-pox for a period of four calendar months from the 8th April. On 6th August it was announced that the Local Government Board approved a further extension for a period of three calendar months. The Order, therefore, expired on the 7th November last. Although this Order has lapsed, a system of voluntary notification of this disease is in operation in the City. 25 OYSTERS. On the 27th January, 1904, the Medical Officer of Health for the Borough of Holborn reported that he had received a notification of a case of Enteric Fever, and upon enquiry had found that the patient had, about nine days previously, eaten oysters from a stall in Leather Lane, the owner of which obtained his supplies from a dealer at Billingsgate. He also stated that another case was reported to him in the previous month in which oysters were eaten which were supplied by the same salesman. These particulars were at once brought to the notice of the Fishmongers' Company, and your Medical Officer of Health also communicated the facts to the dealers who sold the oysters. The firm in question, in replying, forwarded copies of certificates of purity with reference to Dutch oysters and to oysters from the Colne Fisheries, and stated that they were endeavouring to get the same from all places from which they procured shellfish. It was pointed out to them that as their firm was represented at the meeting of the Fishmongers' Company on 5th January, 1903, and subscribed to the resolution then passed, it was surprising that they had not taken the same measures with regard to all sources from which they had obtained their supplies. As the oysters implicated in this case were imported from the Continent and re-laid on the East Coast, it was clearly a case in which the recommendation of the Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal should be acted upon. Your Medical Officer recommended that the place where the oysters were re-laid should be at once examined topographically with a view of determining whether the laying or pond was, or was not, to be considered as free from risk of objectionable contamination. The Government of the country from which the oysters were imported was requested to prohibit the export of them if, upon enquiry, they were found to be procured from a locality where they were liable to be contaminated by sewage or other objectionable filth. A copy of your Medical Officer's Report of this matter was forwarded to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Fishmongers' Company were also requested to urge upon the Trade the necessity for a strict adherence to the terms of the resolution referred to. This course was taken advisedly, as in two instances firms who set their hands to the resolution subsequently dealt with contaminated shellfish. This must not be taken to imply that they knowingly did so, but as evidence that they had failed to take sufficient measures to protect both themselves and the public from an ever-present danger. It is of the utmost importance that frequent periodical examinations of all shellfish layings, pits, &c., should be made, as it 26 has been found by experience that shellfish taken from a place apparently beyond suspicion occasionally show evidence of marked sewage contamination due to an intermittent or new source of pollution. STORAGE OF OYSTERS IN RETAIL SHOPS. The question of the influence of improper storage upon the wholesomeness of oysters having been raised by the wholesale trade, an enquiry was made into the conditions under which they were kept in retail establishments. In practically all cases it was found that supplies were received daily, and as the traders are able to fairly accurately gauge their requirements there is but little need for storage. The minimum is generally obtained, and any increased call met by fresh purchase. Those which are of necessity left over from one day are used on the next, and no oysters are kept more than two days. Many of the traders state that they invariably return to the wholesale dealer any surplus stock, some use those kept more than 24 hours for cooking only, while in a few cases there is definite evidence that such oysters are actually returned to the beds or layings, and their place supplied by fresh. They are received in bags and are not kept in water during the whole time of storage. Generally speaking, they are cleansed by scrubbing and washing before being placed in the receptacles, but in some instances this important precaution is disregarded. Not only is there a possibility of contaminated mud, &c., being conveyed direct to the interior of the " fish," but there is the certainty of fouling the water in which they are placed. The oysters, after being externally cleansed, should be placed in clean white enamelled or glazed earthenware pans or dishes, with or without the addition of water containing salt, which should be changed from time to time as it becomes foul. The use of metal or wooden vessels is objectionable, on account of the great difficulty in keeping them reasonably clean. The advantages of a smooth white receptacle are that it can be readily cleansed, and shows at once the presence of dirt. Special receptacles have been manufactured for this purpose, but at present these are being but little used. 27 These receptacles should be stored in clean, well-aired positions, protected as far as possible from the possibility of contamination. The practice of placing bowls of oysters in front of a shop at or near the ground level, adopted by some, should be discontinued. If it should be necessary to wash the oyster after opening, this should be done under a tap of running water, so as to avoid the use of fouled water. In the City, exclusive of the wholesale merchants, there are 37 establishments in which oysters are sold direct to the public, and at which a varying quantity—probably not less than 10,000 to 15,000 oysters—are sold daily during the season. At many of the hotels and restaurants oysters appear on the bill of fare, and can be obtained by customers. In most cases, however, no stock is kept, and the supply is procured from the nearest merchant. The City being a centre of the trade is exceptionally well situated for this class of business, as the retailers are so near the wholesale merchants that they can readily purchase their supplies daily, thus ensuring that their customers are always served with fresh shellfish in the best condition. As a result of these enquiries it has been found that, speaking generally, there is little to take exception to as to the way in which the retail oyster trade is conducted, although, as before mentioned, there is room for improvement with regard to the nature of the receptacles used for storage. As there will probably be little difficulty in inducing the retailers to adopt the suggestions previously referred to, the public may rest assured that, provided the oysters are in the first instance procured from an unpolluted source, they may be eaten in the City without danger to health. 28 CONTAMINATED MILK. With the object of ascertaining how far the milk supplied to the City was affected by Tuberculosis, a series of samples was taken on arrival at the various stations, and submitted to Dr. Klein for bacteriological analysis. It will be remembered that a similar series was taken in 1902, when it was shown that, although 24 milks were examined, all were found free from the bacillus. To make the samples as representative as practicable, two samples were taken from each county. It will serve to give some idea of the wide area from which the City milk supply is derived to mention the counties from which samples examined were derived, viz. : Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Dorsetshire, Essex, Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire, Huntingdon, Leicestershire. Lincolnshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Somersetshire, Staffordshire, Suffolk, Warwickshire, Wiltshire and Worcestershire. Dr. Klein's report is as follows :— St. Bartholomew's Hospital, E.C. 1th January, 1905. The samples of milk submitted to test for Tubercle were collected by your Inspector in sterile bottles supplied by me, each bottle was stopped with sterile glass stopper, capped and securely tied. Of each sample 300 cubic centimetres of the milk were tested; the sediment being divided in two portions, one was injected intraperitoneally into one, the other (larger) portion subcutaneously into the groin of a second guineapig. These guinea-pigs were labelled with the number of the milk sample, thus: sample 20 was injected into guinea-pig 20 peritoneally, into guineapig 20a subcutaneously. The animals were kept under suitable conditions, both as to cleanliness of cages and abundance of good food, for about four weeks, by which time tubercles, if any, would have developed sufficiently obvious to be detected both by the unaided eye and by the microscope. Some of the animals died in the course of the allotted four weeks from causes other than tubercle, and in the appended tables of results the cause of their death will be stated. This fact, viz., in experiments of this nature animals injected with the sediment of a large volume of milk {e.g. each with that of about 150 cubic centimetres) being liable to succumb to more or less acute disease—abscess, septicaemia and the like, makes it necessary to use two animals for each sample. The present series of experiments, as also many other similar previous experiments, show that by using for each sample two animals, viz., one for intraperitoneal and a second for subcutaneous injection, the risk of losing the test for a particular sample qud tubercle, which might happen if only one animal were used for each sample, is thereby avoided. I have never found that in the case of a particular sample both the animals succumbed within the four weeks to causes other than tubercle. 29 In the appended Tables the results are described in their proper sequence:— County.

From the foregoing results it will be seen that of the 39 samples of milk tested for the presence of tubercle bacilli three samples proved by animal experiment to have contained them, that is to say, nearly 8 (eight) per cent, of the samples were capable of causing tuberculosis. At the same time it has to be pointed out that whereas with each of the two samples No. 19 and No. 33, tuberculosis was produced in both animals (peritoneal and subcutaneous), with sample No. 23 only in one animal (subcutaneous) was this result obtained, the peritoneally-injected guinea-pig remaining unaffected. This result would indicate that in the last named sample (23) the tubercle bacilli could not have been present in the milk in great numbers, certainly in less numbers than in the other two samples (19, 33). Looking at the foregoing description of results a condition is seen which, although of less seriousness for the present, may hide danger which at other times is liable to assume not inconsiderable proportions. Summary of Results. Table A. Character of Milk. Number of Samples. Percentage. Clean and pure 19 48.7 Bacillus tuberculosis 3 7.9 Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus 7 17.9 Bacillus enteritidis Gaertner 10 25.5 Total 39 Samples 100 per cent. As will be seen from Table A, 19 samples were found to be clean and pure, no result followed on their injection into animals; this would amount to 48.7 per cent. only. The samples were:—Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 26, 28, 37 and 39. But 20 samples could not be declared clean and pure, as tested by their action on the animal body ; this would mean that 51.3 per cent, of the samples contained impurities which caused disease. These 20 samples ranged themselves into three groups, namely :— (а) Three samples, or about 8 per cent. (7.9 per cent.) causing culosis: Nos. 19, 23, 33. (б) Seven samples, or 17'95 per cent., causing suppuration due to Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus: Samples Nos. 6, 14, 24, 25, 27, 32, 38. In all the animals which showed the suppuration the Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus was recovered from the pus in pure culture. It will have been noticed that the suppuration was not in all instances present in both animals, sometimes in one only of the two. 34 (c) (10) Ten samples, Nos. 13, 20, 21, 22, 29, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36, or 25.5 per cent., caused in one or both of the animals chronic multiple abscesses in the spleen, which organ was at the same time enlarged. In the pus of these splenic purulent foci invariably and without fail copious presence of a microbe was found, which in all and every respect corresponds to the Bacillus enteritidis Gaertner, that is a microbe which has been shown to be associated with certain forms of acute gastro-enteritis and diarrhoea. I have subjected the microbe isolated from the splenic purulent nodules to every test which differentiates the Bacillus enteritidis Gaertner from the group of microbes constituting the colityphoid group, and I have found that the splenic microbe coincides with the Gaertner group, and only with this. Cultures were made in gelatine streak, gelatine shake, Agar streak, broth, phenol broth, blood serum, taurocholate of soda litmus glucose, lactose peptone litmus, Agar surface plates, gelatine surface plates, neutral red broth, and steamed potato, and in all these the splenic microbe grows in exactly the same manner as our typical laboratory Bacillus Gaertner. In very minute doses (a fraction of a small colony of a recent Agar culture) injected subcutaneously into guinea-pigs, either of the two microbes causes acute septicemic infection and death, and with the same symptoms. But of decisive importance as to identity of the two microbes were the following tests:— (a) The splenic microbe produces alkali in litmus milk just like Bacillus Gaertner, the litmus milk becoming slowly and gradually blue to slate colour, the milk retaining its fluid character. (b) The splenic microbe produces on Drigalski medium blue colonies just like the Bacillus Gaertner and Bacillus typhosus. (c) The splenic microbe is possessed of numerous thin long wavy to spiral flagella just like Bacillus Gaertner and Bacillus typhosus. (d) The splenic microbe in an emulsion from a recent culture becomes agglutinated in a conspicuous manner and instantaneously with the blood serum of rabbit which had been previously repeatedly injected with culture of our laboratory Bacillus Gaertner. I consider these last four tests as decisive, and as removing the splenic microbe just as the Bacillus Gaertner from other known coli bacilli. Both the splenic microbe and the Bacillus Gaertner are in morphological respects identical, being oval to cylindrical very mobile bacilli, gram negative. That in our experimental animals the result of injection with the corresponding milk samples was of a chronic character, viz., multiple purulent nodules, is readily explained by assuming that the microbe was present only 35 in very small numbers; as a matter of fact, when appreciable numbers of the same microbe from a recent culture were injected the result was acute infection and death. Now, this splenic microbe being the real Bacillus enteritidis Gaertner, the matter assumes a serious aspect, for this reason, viz., the Bacillus Gaertner is capable when introduced in sufficient numbers by the digestive organs of causing acute gastro-enteritis, and further, if this microbe be present initially in however small numbers in milk, during the warm weather, or if kept for some time in a warm place, it would soon multiply—milk being a good soil for such multiplication—and the milk remaining unaltered to the eye, its consumption might cause serious intestinal disorders. How this microbe got into the milk, cannot be said ; but since the Bacillus Gaertner, according to our present knowledge, seems to be generally derived from the bovine animal, it is probably also in our cases directly or indirectly referable to this animal, it certainly could not have got into the milk in transit. Whether directly from the udder of the cow, or with impurities in the cowsheds or originally from ailing animals, must for the present remain unexplained. E. KLEIN. January 7th, 1905. Addendum, January 19th.—I have experimental evidence that as small a dose as /1200 or even 1/1000 part of a cubic centimetre of a broth culture 27 hours old causes acute septicemic infection and death, but when smaller doses, e.g. 1/2000 or 1/4000 part, are injected the animals develop the subacute or chronic disease of the spleen. I have likewise succeeded in infecting animals (guinea pigs and mice) by feeding with milk culture. The animals died on the fifth day with acute enteritis, the lower ileum being in a state of great hasmorrhage.—E. K. This report reveals a condition of things so serious that it requires the most careful and detailed consideration :— (i.) As to its bearing on the public health ; (ii.) The causes which lead to the contamination of milk ; and (iii.) The possibility of practical measures for its prevention. In the first place it will be noticed that only 48'7 per cent., less than one half, of the samples could be considered as clean and fit for food. TUBERCULOSIS. So far as Tuberculosis is concerned, three samples out of thirty-nine contained the bacillus, two in large numbers, and the third in less. These three were received from farms situated in Somerset, Suffolk and Dertyshire by dairy companies who supply a large number of retailers. 36 In nearly all cases such dairy companies have in their contracts with the farmers clauses rendering obligatory the notification (to the company) of any disease among either the family or the cows, but it is clear that this is in itself not sufficient for the public protection. in each case when the fact of the sample being infected with the tubercle bacillus was pointed out, the supply of milk was at once stopped, and a detailed examination made by the Medical Officer of Health and a Veterinary Surgeon. In Somerset (19) two cows were removed from the herd, one for "old age "and a slight disease of the lungs," in the other the "udder was slightly "diseased." Suffolk (23).—The Veterinary Surgeon reported that of 53 cows in the herd three were found to have "defective quarters, and the glands chronically "thickened. These three cows were sent absolutely away, and the other 50 "are in good health." Derby (33).—Defective ventilation and lighting in cowsheds were found and remedied. One cow was separated from the herd in consequence of "suspected tuberculosis." This animal was slaughtered, and the postmortem revealed " tuberculosis in one quarter of the udder." In each case, after removal of the diseased animals the supply was resumed, a sample of the milk being subsequently taken on arrival and submitted to Dr. Klein. These samples were found to be free from tubercle (19bis, 23bis, and 33bis). From one point of view, it is satisfactory to know that diseased cows were found on each herd, but the fact unfortunately shows how little care is taken to preserve the purity of our milk supply. STAPHYLOCOCCUS PYOGENES AUREUS. In seven samples, equal to 17"9 per cent, (see Table A), the staphylococcus pyogenes aureus was found. This probably has no serious significance in the majority of cases, but its presence must be taken to mean that the milk is not to be described as pure. It has been found, however, present in milks which have caused disease, and is generally associated with cases of mastitis. As a matter of fact, investigation into the sanitary condition of the farms, as reported by the Medical Officers of Health, showed that in one case only Derbyshire (32) were the cows healthy and properly kept. Wiltshire (14).—(i.) " Some of the cows are not as clean as they should u be, the quarters, and in some cases the teats, being dirty, and in such 37 "a state as to contaminate the milk. There is no attempt to keep the hips "and flanks clean." (ii.) "Drainage bad. The teats of the cows are clean, but the udders in "most cases are not, especially in those animals that are long-haired. The "flanks are dirty in many cases." Hertford (25).—Fifty cows; all healthy. Premises in good condition. "Flanks of the cows coated with manure. Bacillus enteritidis sporogenes "found in water.'' Lincolnshire (38).—" Hind quarters dirty. Cubic space in sheds very "small, as low as 308 feet per head. Floors of wood. Yard not clean." While at Buckingham (27) two cows were found to have "had "mammitis and Lincolnshire (38) one cow was found with catarrhal mastitis, and removed and sold; in three cases—Middlesex (6), Cambridge (24) and Derbyshire (32)—the supply has been terminated. In all the farms the sanitary defects were reported to have been remedied. BACILLUS ENTERITIDIS GAERTNER. The Bacillus enteritidis Gaertner found in 10 samples, or 255 per cent., is a virulent microbe, which so far as is known has not previously been absolutely identified in milk. It is worthy of note, however, that Delepine, in 1894, in examining the milk which caused an extensive outbreak of diarrhoea at Manchester, found that it contained a "large number of bacteria, the most abundant being short, "very motile bacilli, resembling the Bacillus coli, large discrete Cocci, and a "Streptococcus with large segments (non-virulent). Anaerobic, and Aerobic "cultures in milk and bouillon yielded a very abundant growth of several "organisms. I was specially struck with the abundance of bacilli which "belonged to the Bacillus coli group. Of these there were three varieties, "one (a) having all the cultural characters of the typical Bacillus coli com"munis; another (6) which gave all the usual chemical cultural reactions of "the Bacillus coli communis, but which produced on gelatine thick colonies "with rough mammillated surface; a third one (c) had most of the characters "of the Bacillus enteritidis of Gaertner." He further states that on testing this last mentioned organism for virulence "a single loopful of pure culture on agar produced the death of guinea-pigs "within 24 to 30 hours." Professor Delepine came to the conclusion that the milk had been contaminated • by " water heavily polluted with excreta of a "specially virulent kind, and that the virulent bacteria so introduced had "multiplied rapidly in the milk." Journal of Hygiene, Vol. (iii)p. 76, et seq. 38 The Bacillus enteritidis Gaertner was first found by Gaertner to be present in the meat of a cow which had suffered severe diarrhoea for two days before she was killed. The twelve persons who ate the meat raw all became sick, while of those who ate of the cooked meat a large percentage were also affected. The microbe was found in the meat of the cow and also in the spleen of a person who had died from the effects of the poison. It proved fatal to animals, and good meat inoculated with it and kept for some hours had the same toxic effects. It has since been found in meat in investigating outbreaks of ptomaine poisoning, and is generally derived from cattle or pigs. It is probable, therefore, that it gains access to the milk either directly from the cow, or indirectly through the excrement of cattle or pigs. The opportunities for such contamination exist abundantly in the majority of farmyards. Under the ordinary conditions of dairy farming, faecal pollution is always more or less present in milk, but as Professor Delepine points out, under ordinary conditions such contamination may exist without serious effects, but when some animals in a herd are affected with intestinal inflammation, A'irulent bacilli must frequently escape from their bowel, and infect more or less directly a portion of the milk, when that fluid is not collected under conditions of strict cleanliness. Dr. Klein lays stress on the extreme virulence of this organism, and points out that although it exists in small quantities only in the samples examined, it must be remembered that under the influence of an increased temperature it would multiply very rapidly, and might give rise to the most serious consequences. Warm weather, and the keeping of milk warm for some time for infant feeding, would tend to bring about a most dangerous condition of things, and it is probable that this microbe, however it may obtain an entrance into the milk, is, at any rate, one of the main factors in producing that form of infantile diarrhoea so fatal in hot weather, especially when care and cleanliness are not rigidly observed. Dr. Eustace Hills points out that " during the last twenty years, while the "general death rate has progressively declined, the infantile mortality has "not shared in the decline to any appreciable extent. Since the infantile 14 mortality has not been influenced by the improvement in the sanitation and "in the water supply which has taken place in most of the larger towns "during this time, it must be due to other conditions which so far have "undergone no alteration. Cellular Toxins by Vaughan and Novy. 39 "There can be no doubt that the most important of these is the gross "ignorance which prevails among the poor as to the proper method of "feeding their young infants." The facts that in England and Wales during the five years 1897-1901 there was an annual average of 33,339deaths of infants under one year of age from diarrhœal disorders (equal to a mortality of 36 per 1,000 births), and that no fewer than 3,721 deaths of infants (equal to infantile diarrhoea death rate of 29 per 1,000 births) were recorded last year in the County of London alone, will be amply sufficient to emphasise the importance of this subject. As soon as the above mentioned results were known, the dairymen were notified, and the position explained. They were mainly large dairy companies, paying considerable attention to the question of purity of milk supply, and at once expressed their willingness to co-operate with the Authority. In nearly all cases the milk supply was stopped under the advice of your Medical Officer and a careful and exhaustive investigation into the sanitary condition of the farms undertaken by the Medical Officer of Health of the District, and a Veterinary Surgeon. The results of such inspection may be briefly summarised:— Wiltshire (13).—Three cows removed by Veterinary Surgeon (two cows had lost one quarter each, and the other had an indurated quarter, and removed from herd). "No water laid on in the shed. Flooring uneven. "The hips and flanks, and in some cases the tails, were dirty." Somerset (20).—All animals found healthy, and premises in excellent "sanitary condition." Suffolk (21). — Animals healthy. Order made by District Council and carried out." Two cowhouses to be cleansed, repaired and limewashed, "drains and grating repaired, new pond cleaned out." Essex (22).—Cows certified by Veterinary Surgeon to" be healthy and "with normal temperatures, and free from any disease." It was subsequently found that one cow had a high temperature, and was isolated. Samples of milk from this animal sent to Dr. Klein. No sanitary defects were reported. Staffordshire (29).—One cow "affected with catarrhal mastitis in one "quarter, associated with an erythemal eruption of the skin of the udder." This animal was removed from the herd and sold. "Lancet," Feb., 1903, p. 374. Dr. J. M. Tatham. 40 The Veterinary Surgeon made various recommendations "for protecting "the milk from foreign matter during the process of milking. The milk has "no doubt been previously contaminated by the dirty nature of the litter in "use, which the owner has decided to discontinue." "Drainage defective. "Gullies inside shed. Premises fairly clean." Stafford (30).—"Not being able to obtain satisfactory action, the supply was "permanently discontinued. The facts were reported to the Medical Officer of "Health of the County." Northampton (31).—"There being some difficulty on the part of this "farmer in fulfilling our requirements, the supply has been discontinued and "the contract terminated." Gloucester (34).—"Approaches to cowsheds bad (cows have to pass "through filth in and out). Insufficient room for cows to lie down except "on their own dung." Twenty cows all healthy and sound. Worcester (35).—"The water supply is of doubtful quality. Large "accumulation of manure in close proximity of the sheds. Cowhouse badly "lighted. Limewashing carried out." "Cattle in general good health and "free from contagious disease." Gloucester (36).—"The cows healthy, also the sheds and dairy clean, and "also a good water supply." "No evidence to indicate the source of contamination. The cattle (50) "are exceptionally clean and healthy in appearance; stalls well kept; the water "is from a supply which is above suspicion, and all reasonable care seems to be "taken in the way of cleansing the udders of the cows, and the hands of the "milkers before milking. The sanitary arrangements are good. I should be "glad if all the milk sellers in my district were as free from objection as this "place seems to be." All the diseased cows were removed from the herds, and the sanitary defects remedied before the supply was resumed. A further sample was then taken and submitted to Dr. Klein for examination. In every case this second sample proved to be free from the bacillus, showing that in all probability the conditions under which it had previously been found were removed or modified by the carrying out of measures considered necessary as the result of inspection. While this is undoubtedly in one sense satisfactory, it only emphasises the necessity for far more rigorous initial inspection of dairy farms, and for their being kept thereafter under continuous sanitary supervision. 41 Shortly, of the ten farmers implicated in two cases (Nos. 30 and 31), the supply was permanently discontinued. Two only (Nos. 20 and 36) were reported to be satisfactory as regards both the sanitary condition of the premises and the health of the cows. In two cases (Nos. 13 and 29) diseased cows and insanitary conditions of farms co-existed. In three cases (Nos. 21, 34 and 35) the premises were insanitary, the cows being healthy, and in one case (No. 22) disease was found, the premises being in good order. Milk is a fluid which, from its very composition, is an ideal medium for bacterial growth, and is, moreover, especially liable to contamination. While of late years much greater attention has been paid to its collection and distribution, there can be no question that even now far greater care should be taken by the trade. While adulteration is rightly punished as a fraud, the sale of unclean milk is far too common, and should be checked in every possible way. To minimise the danger, it is necessary to go back to the farm. To deliver milk to the actual consumer in a condition fit for food, it is essential that the utmost care be taken in dealing with it at every stage. The cows should be kept in large, well-ventilated sheds while under cover. The Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order gives power to Local Authorities to insist upon conditions which, though not ideal, would tend to render milk safe. In many cases, however, regulations are not made, and in more they are not properly carried out. At least 800 cubic feet (with free ventilation) should be allowed to each animal, and the buildings so constructed as to be readily kept clean. No feeding should be allowed in the cowsheds while milking is going on, and no accumulation of manure permitted. The water supply should be pure and ample, and all milk cows should be kept out of yards, &c., where manure is allowed to accumulate. Every cow, while in the shed, should be cleaned and groomed as often as possible, and before milking the udder and teats should be carefully cleansed and dried. The health of those attending upon and milking the animals should be carefully watched, and any cases of infectious or contagious disease should be at once isolated, and the utmost precautions at once taken to prevent the milk being contaminated. The milker should thoroughly wash his hands, arms and face, before handling the animal, and should cover his ordinary clothes with a smock or overall, kept scrupulously clean and used for this purpose only. Whatever precautions are observed, some impurities from the air, cow, clothing, &c., are certain to obtain access to the milk, which should, therefore, be strained through clean, fine muslin immediately it is drawn. The cleansing of milk vessels, churns, &c., is a matter of great importance, if possible this is best carried out by a current of steam directed into the Interior—failing this, they should be scalded with boiling water after cleansing 42 Inasmuch as the growth of bacteria is largely dependent upon temperature, milk should be at once cooled by passing through a refrigerator. If it be put up in sterilized bottles, this can be done immediately, and the cooling effected by placing the bottles in cold water. Where milk cannot be properly refrigerated, then sterilisation should be resorted to. To this, however, many objections have been raised, and at the present time the system does not seem likely to become popular. The milk when cooled should be kept so, and Railway Companies should be compelled to provide special refrigerator vans for the purpose. In transit all milk vessels should be securely locked, and every precaution taken to prevent contamination. There is a general, but erroneous, impression among farmers and dairymen that the locking of churns is objected to by the Railway Companies. Formerly this was the case, the reason given being the difficulty of checking the quantity contained in the vessels. In a leaflet (No. 110), issued by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries, it is stated all the principal railway companies do not make any difference in the charges when sealed cans are used, provided the tare weight of the vessels is stamped upon the outside of them. The companies reserve the right to open locked cans. This, however, is simply a protective clause which would only be exercised where there was any reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the consignment. Farmers do not seem to be aware of this concession, as practically none avail themselves of it. Certainly milk is rarely consigned to the City in locked churns. As it is obviously in the farmers' interests that there should be no chance of their consignments being tampered with, they would do well to adopt the use of locked churns. The importance of such protection in transit need scarcely be insisted upon. The recently adopted regulations of the Corporation for control of milkshops require all milk vessels to be kept covered, and a moment's considera tion of the possibility of pollution by dust and organic matter in a large City (to say nothing of the dirty condition of many of the smaller shops, where many other articles, both clean and unclean, are purveyed) will be sufficient to show the necessity for such a rule. In the household the same idea must be borne in mind ; dirt, ever a source of potential danger, becomes an actual one where milk is concerned. Care in providing clean vessels, well-ventilated places for storage, &c., will not only minimise risk, but will tend to economy, as enabling the milk to keep good for a much longer period. Shortly, cleanliness, always necessary, is especially and absolutely so in the case of milk. 43 It may be objected that all these precautions are unnecessary, and that if they were carried out they would entail so much expense that the price to the consumer would have to be greatly increased to recoup the farmer. Even if this were true, it would certainly be worth the additional outlay ; but as a matter of fact these precautions are already observed by some of the large Dairy Companies, who nevertheless are able to compete with the trade generally. It is, however, quite possible that from lack of enterprise and capital the supply of milk to large centres might by such action be taken from small farmers and pass into the hands of large companies and firms—nor is this a result altogether to be objected to on public health grounds. There is ample scope for such small farmers in the supply of milk in their own districts, where questions of transport and storage are not of the same value. Whatever precautions, however, are taken, accidents from time to time are likely to occur, as it would seem to be impossible to altogether prevent the possibility of infection at some stage. As the contamination is nearly always at the farm, it is here that any measures by the Authorities to safeguard the public health must be taken. Action by the Local Authority to which the milk is supplied can obviously never be effective nor sufficient. The power given under the Public Health Act (Section 71) to any Local Authority to deal with milk is limited to its own district:— "71.—(1.) If the Medical Officer of Heatlh of any district has evidence "that any person in the district is suffering from a dangerous infectious "disease attributable to milk supplied within the district from any dairy "situate within or without the district, or that the consumption of milk "from such dairy is likely to cause any such infectious disease to any person "residing within the district, such Medical Officer shall, if authorised by "an Order of a Justice having jurisdiction in the place where the dairy "is situate, have power to inspect the dairy, and if accompanied by a "veterinary inspector, or some other properly qualified veterinary surgeon, "to inspect the animals therein ; and, if on such inspection the Medical "Officer of Health is opinion that any such infectious disease is caused "from the consumption of the milk supplied therefrom, he shall report "thereon to the Sanitary Authority, and his report shall be accompanied "by any report furnished to him by the said veterinary inspector or "veterinary surgeon, and the Sanitary Authority may thereupon serve "on the dairyman notice to appear before them within such time, not less "than twenty-four hours, as may be specified in the notice, to show "cause why an Order should not be made requiring him not to supply "any milk therefrom within the district until the Order has been with" drawn by the Sanitary Authority. 44 "(2.) The Sanitary Authority, if in their opinion he fails to show "such cause, may make the said Order, and shall forthwith serve Notice "of the facts on the County Council of the county in which the dairy is "situate, and on the Local Government Board, and, if the dairy is situate " within the district of another Sanitary Authority, on such Authority. "(3.) The said Order shall be forthwith withdrawn on the Sanitary "Authority, or their Medical Officer of Health on their behalf, being "satisfied that the milk supply has been changed, or that the cause of "the infection has been removed." It is true that in the Metropolis if any such action were taken by one Borough Council it would always be in conjunction with any other Borough Council to which the same supply was being distributed. This has been the case hitherto, and incidentally the fact proves that the powers now being sought in Parliament by the London County Council to deal with the County as a whole are entirely unnecessary and useless. For whether one is dealing with a single Borough or a group, the morality of stopping the supply within one's own limits and allowing it to be used elsewhere is scarcely of a standard to be approved by Sanitarians. If a milk is unfit for consumption in one district, it is equally so in any other, and anything short of total prohibition is indefensible and absurd. Milk stopped in one district will be sent to another. A good instance of this is given by Medical Officer of Health, Manchester, Report for 1902. The Local Authority in whose district the dairy farm is situated should deal with the matter. The Contagious Diseases Act, 1878, gave power to the Privy Council, now transferred to the Local Government Board, to make an Order, under which Local Authorities were empowered (inter alia) to make regulations :— (а) For the inspection of cattle in dairies. (b) For prescribing and regulating the lighting, ventilation, cleansing, drainage and water supply of dairies and cowsheds in the occupation of persons following the trade of cowkeepers or dairymen. (c) For securing the cleanliness of milk stores, milk shops and of milk vessels used for containing milk for sale by such persons. (d) For prescribing precautions to be taken by purveyors of milk and persons selling milk by retail against infection or contamination. These regulations, however, are adoptive only, and I would therefore submit that in the first place these should be made compulsory on every Authority. 45 The powers of such Local Authorities should, moreover, be extended so as to give power to a Local Authority, with proper safeguards, to cause the supply of milk for human consumption from any source within their district to be entirely stopped, if it should be found to be at any time contaminated or capable of causing or conveying disease. Such measures as were necessary would then be carried out under the Local Authority, and the supply resumed on its becoming satisfactory. In the event of a contaminated milk being found in any district, it would then be only necessary for the Authority to communicate with the Local Authority within whose district the source is situate whose officers, being on the spot, and being fully acquainted with the conditions, could at once take action, with the result that instead of one or more districts being protected at the expense of others, the whole source of danger could be at once cut off. This probably would require some Parliamentary enactment giving increased power to the Local Government Board, as it is doubtful whether such measures could be included in the above quoted objects of the Order. Power should also be conferred upon the County Councils to act in default of and at the expense of the Local Authority. It should be pointed out that at present only thirty-eight of the sixty-two Administrative Counties of England have actually appointed Medical Officers of Health. One other (Somerset) has recently decided to make such appointment. But the necessity of some such radical steps is obvious, if any real attempt is to be made to stop at its source the supply of contaminated and diseased milk, and there could be no reasonable objection to such a proceeding. I would, therefore, advise that the attention of the Local Government Board be called to the above mentioned facts, and that they be urged to take such action as they may deem fit. 46 ENTERIC FEVER AND WATERCRESS. In the early part of the past year the Hackney Borough Council invited the Corporation to support a request to the Local Government Board for an enquiry into the sources of the watercress supplied to the Metropolis. In reporting to the Committee thereon, your Medical Officer stated that the London County Council had directed enquiries to be made as to the conditions under which watercress sent to the London markets is grown, and pointed out that whatever might be the result of such enquiry, that body would be unable to take any useful action, as most of the watercress consumed in London is supplied from sources outside the County, and that, therefore, the only public body who could actively interfere was the Local Government Board. The Sanitary Committee supported this view, and the Court subsequently resolved that the Local Government Board should be informed that the Corporation is in favour of such enquiry. ANTHRAX. The Registrar of the sub-district having notified me that a death from this disease had occurred at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, enquiries were instituted and the following facts ascertained :— The patient, aged 40 years, employed at a horse-hair factory just outside the City boundary, in the Borough of Finsbury, was taken ill on the 12th July with headache, and on arriving at his work the following morning with a swollen neck, he was sent by his employers to St. Bartholomew's Hospital as a suspected case of Anthrax. A culture was taken of the discharge from an abrasion behind the right ear, which on examination showed Anthrax bacilli and cocci. He died on the 10th July. After death an examination was made of a drop of blood from the heart; this also showed Anthrax bacilli and streptococci. It was stated at the subsequent inquest that death had resulted from Anthrax of a most virulent type. It was also given in evidence that at the date of his attack the deceased had been working with Russian, Siberian and English horse-hair, which had previously been washed with hot water, soap and soda. Ten cases of Anthrax are reported to have occurred amongst persons employed at this factory within the last nine or ten years, two of which were fatal. 47 The body was brought to the City Mortuary from St. Bartholomew's Hospital, special precautions being taken to prevent the spread of infection. Although not belonging to the City, the admission of the body (which was the nearest one to the Hospital) was permitted in the interests of the public health, the man's residence being at Mile End. These facts were at once communicated to the Medical Officers of Health for the district in which the patient resided, and for the district where he worked, respectively. MIDWIVES ACT, 1902. In September last the Sanitary Committee had under consideration a letter received from the London County Council on the subject of the administration of the Midwives Act, 1902. The London County Council asked in the letter referred to, if the Corporation had any objection to the use of their disinfecting premises and apparatus for disinfection of clothing of midwives who had been in attendance on cases of Puerperal Fever or other illnesses supposed to be infectious, and noted that under Section 5 of the rules framed by the Central Midwives Board, such clothing must be disinfected to the satisfaction of the Local Sanitary Authority. Your Medical Officer pointed out that the question arose, what was meant by the term "Local Sanitary Authority" in these rules, it not being clear whether it was intended to apply to the Authority for the district in which the patient or the midwife resided. Puerperal Fever being a dangerous infectious disease, as scheduled in the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, under Section 59(1) of that Act the Corporation are compelled to remove, disinfect, and return free of charge, any clothing or articles infected with this disease or likely to retain such infection. This duty is therefore imperative, and the Corporation has no option in the matter in cases where the infected clothing belongs to a resident. At the time of the last Imperial Census there were no midwives resident in the City of London. This indicates that lying-in women in the City, when attended by a midwife, engage them from outside districts. It may further be noted that in the ten years 1894-1903, only seven cases of Puerperal Fever occurred amongst residents in the City. It is evident, therefore, that we shall be seldom called upon to carry out the duty referred to above. "RETURNED" CASES OF SCARLET FEVER. In July last the Sanitary Committee had under consideration a communication received from the Clerk to the Metropolitan Asylums Board, drawing attention to the fact that the Poplar Borough Council had issued a circular letter with reference to the alleged premature discharge of a patient from one of the Board's Hospitals. 48 Bearing in mind the difficulty of knowing at what stage of the disease Scarlet Fever patients are free from infection, I informed the Committee that it seemed surprising that so few cases are reported, and that in our experience in the City these cases are rare. In these circumstances, I suggested that the Metropolitan Asylums Board might be glad to receive the assurance that the Corporation of London had every confidence in the manner in which the Board conduct the administration of their hospitals; an opinion in which the Committee concurred. SANATORIA FOR CONSUMPTIVES. Many of the Metropolitan Borough Councils having urged the Metropolitan Asylums Board to establish a Sanatoria for Consumptives, the Board, in December, 1903, issued a circular letter, stating that in view of the large increase in expenditure it would involve, they hesitated to take any definite action in the matter without some authoritative expression of opinion from the Local Government Board. They stated they had written to the Local Government Board to this effect, but we have not yet been acquainted with the nature of the reply. PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION. The several measures in force in the City for preventing the spread of Consumption have been, as in 1903, in active operation during the past year. Much good has ensued from the display of cautionary notices with a view of checking the dangerous and disgusting practice of spitting. There is an exceedingly active demand on the part of the Citizens for these notices for exhibition both in private offices, work places, and public places. Railway companies also show an increasing desire to assist the Corporation in their efforts to protect the public from infection by Phthisis, and the more general adoption by them of the vacuum method of cleaning railway carriages must act as a great preventive. At the present time almost every company coming into the City is using this method of cleansing. It has been adopted by the Midland, London, Brighton and South Coast, South Eastern and Chatham, Great Central, Great Northern, Great Eastern, Central London, London and North Western, Great Western, London and South Western, and the City and South London. The Great Eastern Railway Company are particularly active in endeavouring to keep their station at Fenchurch Street in a cleanly condition. This is no easy undertaking, by reason of the volume of traffic in a very confined area, and the class of persons travelling to and from the docks and riverside stations. The platforms, which seem dangerously narrow in places, are 49 frequently swept and disinfectants very freely used, especially during hot weather, but a little more attention might be given with advantage to the staircases also to the yard without and the approaches thereto. The following is a summary of the measures in force by the different railway companies having stations in the City for cleansing platforms, carriages, &c.:— EAST DISTRICT. Great Eastern Railway. Fenchurch Street Station. Platforms and approaches disinfected and swept four times daily. Spitting cards on platforms and approaches to ticket offices. The position of these cards has been altered to places where they are more likely to attract attention. Spitting Notices are in all the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway Company's carriages ; those belonging to the Great Eastern Railway Company will be supplied with Notices on return to yard for usual repairs. Carriages cleansed at Stratford, Ilford and Woolwich. The Spitting Notices in the carriages of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway are designed with excellent taste. MIDDLE DISTRICT. South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Cannon Street Station. Carriages cleansed at Rotherhithe, Blackheath, Maze Hill, Plumstead, Addison Road, &c. Wet sawdust is used when platforms are swept. Disinfectants used when fish is unloaded. Spitting Notices in station ; none in railway carriages. At Blackheath the vacuum cleanser is used for cleaning carriages. Great Eastern Railway. Liverpool Street Station. Carriages cleansed at Stratford by vacuum cleanser. Platform swept and watered, but not disinfected. Spitting Notices exhibited both in stations and carriages. North London Railway. Broad Street Station. Carriages are swept and disinfected each trip, also at night. Platforms swept frequently. Disinfectants used during hot weather. No Spitting Notices. Midland Railway. Moorgate Street Station. Carriages cleansed at Kentish Town, where this company have established a vacuum cleansing plant. Platform watered and swept when required. No disinfectant used. Spitting Notices on platform and in the company's omnibuses, none in carriages. 50 Great Northern Railway. Moorgate Street Station. Carriages cleansed at King's Cross. Platforms swept and watered. No disinfectant used. Spitting Notices on platforms; none in carriages. This company are at the present time cleaning the whole of their carriage stock at the London end with the vacuum cleanser, and are extending the use of it in country districts. Central London Railway. Bank Station. Carriages are swept and disinfected each trip, they are also gone over every night in the car sheds with the vacuum cleanser. Platforms swept and disinfected constantly. Spitting Notices in carriages, lifts and station. City and South London Railway. Bank Station. Carriages swept and cleansed by vacuum cleanser at Clapham. Platforms disinfected and swept twice daily at least. Spitting Notices in carriages, lifts and stations. City and Waterloo Railway. Bank Station. Carriages cleansed at Waterloo. Platforms watered and swept frequently. No disinfectant used. Spitting Notices in carriages and station. City and Finsbury Railway. Finsbury Pavement Station. Carriages are watered and disinfected, swept and dusted at Drayton Park. It is proposed to adopt the vacuum cleanser. Spitting Notices in all carriages. Platforms watered with disinfectant as often as necessary. WEST DISTRICT. Central London Railway. Post Office Station, Newgate Street. Carriages disinfected and swept each trip at Bank Station. Platforms, stairs, &c., disinfected and swept several times daily. Spitting Notices on platforms, and in lifts, carriages, and in booking hall. This company has also adopted the vacuum cleanser. South Eastern and Chatham Railway. St. Paul's Station. Carriages swept at Holborn Viaduct Station, and cleansed at Loughborough Junction. Platforms, stairs, and booking hall swept once a day. Disinfectants used once a week. Spitting Notices are exhibited at the station, but none in carriages. 51 South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Snow Hill, Ludgate Hill and Holborn Viaduct Stations. Carriages swept at Holborn Viaduct and cleansed at Loughborough Junction. No disinfectant used. Sprinkled with water before sweeping in summer months. Platforms, stairs and booking halls swept twice daily. No disinfectant used. Spitting Notices on platforms and booking hall at Snow Hill, on stairs and booking hall at Ludgate Hill, and in booking hall and waiting-room at Holborn Viaduct; more are required. There are no Spitting Notices in any of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway Company's carriages. As to the possibility of the spread of tuberculosis through eating meat of animals affected with this disorder, it is obvious that the flesh of animals affected with any acute specific disease should be rejected owing to the risk of the consumer becoming infected by it. In August, 1901, a Royal Commission was appointed to enquire and report with respect to tuberculosis— (1) Whether the disease in animals and man is one and the same; (2) Whether animals and man can be reciprocally infected with it; (3) Under what conditions, if at all, the transmission of the disease from animals to man takes place, and what are the circumstances favourable or unfavourable to such transmission. This Commission was necessary on account of the pronouncement of Dr. Koch at the British Congress on Tuberculosis in 1901, when he stated:— "I feel justified in maintaining that human tuberculosis differs from "bovine, and cannot be transmitted to cattle." ..... "The infection of human beings (from animals) is but a very rare occur"rence, I should estimate the extent of infection by the milk and flesh "of tubercular cattle, and the butter made of their milk, as hardly greater "than that of hereditary transmission, and I therefore do not deem it "advisable to take any measures against it." These views did not commend themselves to the majority of scientific men who had studied the subject, and numerous observations have since shown that they are untenable. But in view of the high standing of Dr. Koch, and the practical bearing upon the agricultural question in this country, the acceptance of this theory would at once involve the abandonment of all inspection and destruction of meat affected with tuberculosis, it was felt that an immediate and exhaustive investigation was imperative. 52 The subject is a large one and involves much experimental work, and it was scarcely expected that any conclusion could be issued for some considerable period. The results of the investigation were, however, so striking that the Royal Commission felt it obligatory to issue, without further delay, an Interim Report (dated 16th May, 1904). To quote the Report:— "For the reason that the result at which we have arrived, namely, that "tubercle of human origin can give rise, in the bovine animal, to "tuberculosis identical with ordinary bovine tuberculosis, seems to us to "show quite clearly that it would be most unwise to frame or modify "legislative measures in accordance with the view that human and bovine "tubercle bacilli are specifically different from each other, and that the "disease caused by the one is a wholly different thing from the disease "caused by the other." In other words, the opinion expressed by the Royal Commission confirmed the course of action taken by the Corporation for many years past. ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS, STONEY LANE, HOUNDSDITCH. These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks" of Dwellings, severally named King's—Queen's— Prince's—North—and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class; some of the ground floors being let as shops. Exclusive of the shops and cellars, they contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 995 persons. Sixty-one per cent. are adults and thirty-nine per cent. children (under 14 years). The death rate for 1904 was 14.0 per 1,000 per annum [of which 42.9 per cent. was of children under 5 years of age]. Deaths of children under one year to 1,000 births were 200, as against 90 for the City generally. The number of births was 30, viz.: 20 males and 10 females. The birth rate, 30.1 per 1,000, is the lowest recorded since 1894, and is 9.6 per 1,000 below the average for the previous five years. Only one illegitimate birth has occurred in these Dwellings since 1894, and in that instance the mother was stated to have been of weak intellect and a mere child. 53 Table of Births and Deaths occurring at the Artizans' Dwellings, Stoney Lane, Houndsditch, during the year 1904.

The bathing accommodation provided for the use of the Tenants of these Buildings, referred to in my Report for 1903, was opened for use on 2nd May last year. The following is a record of the attendances from that date to the end of the year:— Month. Sex. . Males. Females. May 570 700 1,270 June 598 691 1,289 July 708 819 1,527 August 507 550 1,057 September 426 461 887 October 376 320 696 November 279 246 525 December 302 274 576 Totals 3,766 4,061 7,827 54 The baths are in great demand on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays, but they are used more on Fridays by both sexes than on any other day, when the attendances are on the average doubled. This is probably due to the large number of Jews residing in the Dwellings. It will be seen from the figures given above that during the eight months the new Buildings were open upwards of 7,000 baths were taken. This speaks well for their popularity, and cannot fail to be a useful factor in enabling the tenants to live under more healthy conditions than obtained in the past. DISINFECTION, &c., AT CITY MORTUARY. 2,560 articles of bedding, clothing, furniture, &c., were received at Golden Lane and disinfected. 184 bodies were received at the Mortuary, pending interment; the number for the three preceding years being 111, 164, and 190. Number of Articles disinfected, Bodies received at the Mortuary, and Inquests held at the Coroner's Court in the City during 1904, compared with the previous five years. Year.

Smeeton and Co.). 28th „ „ 4-5, Long Lane. The block of buildings containing the steam disinfecting apparatus and fumigating chambers, &c., was completely destroyed on 29th October last during a fire which occurred at some adjoining premises ; much damage was also done to the post-mortem room. Plans are now being prepared for re-arranging these buildings upon improved lines. DISINFECTANTS. The methods adopted in 1901 for disinfecting public thoroughfares, &c., referred to in detail in your Medical Officer's Annual Reports for that and the succeeding year, were continued during 1904. As heretofore, all chemicals and disinfectants supplied throughout the Public Health Department were obtained through your Medical Officer. They are used for the following purposes:— A. Deodorizing and " denaturalizing" condemned meat. / B. Disinfecting public conveniences (urinals, &c.). C. Disinfecting roadways, street gullies, &c. D. Disinfecting premises, &c., after infectious disease, drain testing, and sundries. The amounts spent during the past twelve months under these several headings were:— £ s. d. A. 11 13 9 B. 16 6 8 C. 123 5 4 D. 30 14 0 Total £181 19 9 This, although £52 in excess of the amount spent for similar purposes in 1903—which, however, was a cold and wet season—was less than the amount for 1902. This is satisfactory, considering the warmth and length of last summer. 56 SANITARY INSPECTIONS. The following is a Statement of the work of the Sanitary Inspectors in their several Districts during each month of the year:— WEST DISTRICT. (Inspector F. J. Robbins.) Date of Report.

Many sanitary defects formerly attended to by these officers are now handed over to the Factory Inspectors, thus enabling the former to give greater attention to details connected with each case dealt with by them. A very considerable proportion of the routine work involved in the administration of the Public Health Acts is carried out by the District Inspectors, who conduct many extensive and important enquiries with both tact and firmness. As the education of the general public in health matters increases, so does the demand for the services of your officers, and although it is satisfactory to observe a growing intelligent public interest in details connected with sanitary science, it taxes the time at your Inspectors' disposal somewhat severely. That their duties are performed with a minimum amount of friction with property owners in the City, is shown by the fact that in no single instance out of 430 Orders issued during the year was it found necessary to resort to Police Court proceedings. In some cases where delay was unduly prolonged, a reference of the particulars to the City Solicitor was sufficient to ensure compliance with your requirements. 59 WOMAN SANITARY INSPECTOR. In April last, in some notes as to the success attending the appointment of a Woman Sanitary Inspector, I stated that so far it had been found impracticable to undertake any systematic inspection of offices where women clerks are employed, but that all cases of complaint had been investigated immediately. It was estimated that there are at least 2,000 workshops where women are employed in the City, and that with only one Woman Inspector another six years would elapse before the whole of these workshops would be visited, even if no time was devoted to the inspection of those already on the Register. In addition there are 23 railway stations where the sanitary accommodation provided in the ladies' waiting rooms require periodical inspection, and the underground conveniences for women are constantly visited by this officer at the request of the Streets Committee. It was evident that, although the appointment of a Woman Sanitary Inspector was of the greatest value in dealing with premises where women were employed, experience had shown that one officer was quite insufficient for the purpose. Apart from these reasons the work allotted is of a character that cannot be efficiently performed by men. Their services are especially called for in the City in view of the fact that the number of girls employed in offices for typewriting and clerical work is constantly increasing. Moreover, these appointments are encouraged by the Local Government Board, as shown by their approval of those officers already selected for such work. In consequence of these representations the Sanitary Committee obtained the sanction of the Court to advertise for another Woman Inspector. In the result the Court concurred in the Committee's selection of Miss M. M. Pole for the office, and this lady's appointment was subsequently formally confirmed by the Local Government Board, as from the 16th January, 1905. THE HAMPSTEAD BOROUGH COUNCIL v. TENNANT. The obligation of Railway Companies to comply with Bye-laws made under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and the Metropolis Local Management Acts, 1855 and 1862. On June loth, 1903, a case of some importance as affecting the application of Bye-laws to sanitary conveniences at railway stations was decided at the Marylebone Police Court. This was the case of the Hampstead Borough Council v. Tennant. The latter traded as Tennant and Co., Builders, of Grange Road, Willesden Green, and had to answer seven summonses under the Public Health (London) Act, 60 1891, and the Metropolis Local Management Acts, 1855 and 1862, in respect to certain sanitary work done by them at the Finchley Road Station of the Metropolitan Railway Company (who were the real defendants in the case). It was contended by the Railway Company that they were not amenable to the Local Authority, but the Magistrate decided against them in reference to all the various sections of the Acts of Parliament under which the summonses were issued, and consented to state a case. Intimation was subsequently given by the Railway Company that they were content to accept the Magistrate's ruling, and that the case would not be proceeded with. Whatever opinion on this question may have been held elsewhere, no other view than that expressed in the above decision has ever been held by the Corporation, and the various Railway Companies in the City have never disputed the right of the Corporation to inspect their premises, and to require them to remedy any sanitary defects. BYE-LAWS FOR WATER-CLOSETS, &c. On the 23rd July, 1901, I submitted for the consideration of the Sanitary Committee draft Bye-laws with respect to water-closets, ash-pits and receptacles for dung, &c., prepared in accordance with the 54th Section of the City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1900, which requires the Corporation to make and enforce Bye-laws for this purpose. The City Solicitor, the Engineer and myself, to whom these were referred, in due course reported thereon, and after further consideration amended draft Bye-laws were submitted by the Committee to the Court of Common Council, who formally adopted them on the 28th July, 1904. They were subsequently submitted to the Local Government Board for confirmation, who allowed and sealed them on the 27th September, 1904. A copy of these Bye-laws will be found in Appendix E on page 157. Although they relate primarily to water-closets, &c., and their accessories, they are so intimately connected with the general system of house drainage that it is desirable that the Regulations for the latter made in September, 1898, under the City of London Sewers Act, 1848, should be brought into harmony with the more modern Bye-laws. 61 HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. In my Annual Report for last year it was noted that the Sanitary Committee had under consideration a scheme, pending legislation, for effecting improvements in the conduct of the business of hairdresser or barber. In November last I presented a Report giving full details of the results of enquiries made both in foreign countries and in our own Colonies. This Report has been so widely referred to in the public Press, and at such length, that there is no occasion to further allude to it here beyond recording the manner in which, and how far we have succeeded in putting the scheme suggested in the Report into operation. In the first place, suggested draft Regulations were drawn up, and authority obtained from the Committee to ascertain how far these would be acceptable to those engaged in the trade, as it was felt that, having no legal power of enforcement, without such co-operation we could do little. With this object in view, the opinion and assistance of the Barbers' Company was sought, but in reply the Clerk stated that, while appreciating our action in consulting them, the Company regretted their inability to give us any practical and technical assistance, and suggested the Incorporated Guild of Hairdressers should be approached on the matter. This course was adopted with the best results, and I am glad to take this opportunity of acknowledging the valuable assistance rendered by this influential trade organisation in promoting the object sought. As a result of several conferences with the representatives of the Guild, certain regulations and recommendations were agreed to. These were in due course submitted to the Court of Common Council, when Resolutions submitted by the Sanitary Committee to the followiug effect were agreed to, viz.:— (i.) That the Incorporated Guild of Hairdressers, &c., be informed that these Regulations and recommendations meet with the approval of the Corporation. (ii.) That it is advisable that a Register be kept at the Guildhall of such Hairdressers, &c., as are willing to be bound by these Regulations, and to exhibit a copy of the same in their establishments, (iii.) That the certificate of sanitary condition required before registration be granted by your Medical Officer of Health in respect of all such establishments within the City limits, and that the same be renewed annually. (iv.) That the necessary inspection and re-inspection, so far as the City is concerned, remain in the hands of your officers. 62 The following are the Regulations and recommendations referred to in Resolution (i):— 1. All shelves, fittings and tables on which instruments are placed to be of glass, marble, slate or other similar material. 2. Clean towels, &c., to be used for each customer, and a fresh piece of paper or clean linen to be placed on the back of chair or head-rest. 3. No general powder puffs to be used, and powder pulverisers or cotton wool substituted. No sponges to be used. *4. All hairclippers, razors, scissors, combs, or other tools, after use'to be placed in a disinfecting solution. 5. Razors to be wiped on paper. 6. Perfectly clean hairbrushes only must be used. *7. Shaving brushes after use to be placed in a disinfecting solution. 8. Liquid or powdered soap or shaving cream only to be used. 9. Cut hair falling on the floor to be immediately swept up and removed, and floors to be cleansed daily. 10. No general alum crystals or blocks to be used as a styptic, but a liquid or powder applied on towel or cotton wool or by spray. 11. The most scrupulous cleanliness to be observed in all that pertains to the business. In addition to the foregoing the following Recommendations were made. (a) Regular customers and subscribers should be strongly recommended to provide their own toilet articles, razors, brushes, &c., which would be exclusively reserved for the owner's use. (b) All cut hair and paper to be burned. (c) No customer apparently suffering from any skin or hair affection to be attended to save at his own house or offices, or in a private room. * The following disinfectants to be used, viz.:— Cyllin solution, in the proportion of one teaspoonful of Cyllin in one quart of water, or Izal solution, in the proportion of one teaspoonful of Izal in one pint of water. 63 (d) Charges should, if necessary, be re-modelled to enable Hairdressers,&c. not only to comply with the letter, but the spirit of the above without loss. (e) The operator to wear a clean white garment without pockets, sleeves fitting close to wrists, and wash his hands before attending to each customer. (/) Metal combs to be used. (g) Machine or rotary brushes should be discarded. In accordance with Resolution (ii.) of the Committee, arrangements were made in order that the names and business addresses of proprietors of Hairdressing and Barbers' establishments in the City of London, who are willing to be bound by these Regulations, should be officially recorded in the Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C., as "Registered Hairdressers or Barbers." Also in conformity with Resolution (iii.), it was agreed that no application to be placed on the Register would be considered until the Certificate of your Medical Officer of Health had been granted to the effect that the business premises of the applicant were in a satisfactory sanitary condition. This is to be understood to mean:— (1) That all saloons are adequately ventilated and in a cleanly condition. This specially applies to those in basements. (2) That the drains have been inspected and tested, and found to be in good condition, trapped and ventilated. (All lavatory basins must be separately under-trapped.) (3) That the products of combustion and fumes from all gasheated apparatus are conducted to the outer air by means of shafts or chimneys. (4) That the premises are in all other respects suitable for the purpose. The Guild also determined that all persons who apply to them for Registration should be required to subscribe to the following. I, the undersigned, do hereby request the said Guild to enrol my name in their Register of Hairdressers and Barbers observing the foregoing Regulations, and do hereby acknowledge that this List of Regulations has been issued to me by the said Guild, and that I will observe each and every thereof; and further, that in the event of my making or permitting any breach therein, the said Guild are at full liberty and I hereby consent to their removing my name from such Register of Hairdressers observing such Regulations, and to advertise such removal as they may think fit. Dated this day of ,190 64 OFFENSIVE TRADES. In June last, in reply to an enquiry from the Corporation of Glasgow, it was referred to me to report as to the powers of the Corporation for controlling offensive trades and businesses in the City, when I reported to the effect that statutory powers for this purpose are derived by the Corporation from the City of London Sewers Acts, 1848,1851 and 1897, and the Public Health (London) Act, 1891. It must be noted, however, that in the application of Section 19 of the latter Act to the City of London, the Corporation should be substituted for the London County Council (vide Sub-section 10, Section 19). No. 13, MANSELL STREET-RECOMMENDATION OF CORONER'S JURY. Early in August last some sensational accounts appeared in the newspapers of the insanitary condition of a tenement house at No. 13, Mansell Street, Aldgate, occupied by a woman who died in the City Infirmary. At the inquest one of the witnesses gave evidence which induced the jury " to request "the Coroner to write to the City Sanitary Authorities, and call their attention "to the matter." In due course a letter was addressed to the Town Clerk by the Coroner for East London, in which he stated that the jury desired him to communicate their opinion that the City Sanitary Authorities should request their Inspectors to visit and examine the premises. The following were the facts of the case:— The house in question was a tenement house situated at No. 13, Mansell Street, Aldgate, the owners of which were most respectable people, with whom we have never had any trouble. The usual annual cleansing of the premises throughout was carried out satisfactorily in the Spring of the year, and at the time of the Coroner's letter the house was reported to be in a fair sanitary condition. The room occupied by the deceased was found after her death to be in a dirty and neglected state, owing to the habits of the occupants. As a matter of fact the deceased had been in receipt of a weekly wage from the owners for keeping the house in decent order. The evidence given by two of the witnesses was grossly exaggerated, and it is interesting to note in this connection that at the time of the inquest one of them had paid no rent for three months, was under notice to quit, and a distraint about to be levied on her goods. This house, together with Nos. 5 to 19, in the same street was scheduled for demolition in connection with the proposed Tower Bridge Approach improvement. These facts were at once communicated to the Town Clerk for transmission to the Coroner. 65 STABLES. In the Report of your Medical Officer of Health to the Sanitary Committee on the 28th June last, a reference was made to the sanitary condition of the several stables in the City which had recently been inspected. Special attention was given to the defects discovered, which were subsequently remedied in each case. In many of these places the stables are situated in basements, access to which is obtained by inclined roadways, and, as the result of inquiries, it has been ascertained that horses so stalled enjoy good health. As these underground stables are generally well lighted, well drained, and well kept, the animals doubtless benefit from the equable and warm temperature that exists in such places. Owing to the great value of land in the City, stable accommodation in several instances is provided upstairs on first floors, which are reached by sloping approaches. For the same reason in many cases the stables are without any yards, all grooming being done in the stalls. It should be noted that most of the stables in the City are well kept, and the horses generally seem in excellent condition. This applies particularly to those attached to the fire brigade stations. The following shows the number of stables and horses stalled therein in the three sanitary districts:— District. No. of Stables. No. of Horses. West 15 279 Middle 8 76 East 8 77 31 432 These figures do not include a large Horse Repository in Barbican containing 111 stalls, where the number of horses stabled is constantly varying. Under existing legislation stables come within the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 16 (1) (c) of which enables Sanitary Authorities to make Bye-laws for the prevention of the keeping of animals on any premises in such place or manner as to be a nuisance or injurious or dangerous to health. Bye-laws for this purpose were made by the late Commissioners of Sewers, on the 5th December, 1893, and confirmed by the Local Government Board, 8th February, 1894. These Bye-laws are identical with the model ones issued for the guidance of Sanitary Authorities by the Local Government Board, and were adopted by the City in order to secure uniformity. 66 The London County Council last year in a General Powers Bill sought for authority to make Bye-laws with respect to the paving and drainage of stables and stable yards within the County, and your Medical Officer, in reporting on the same, pointed out that Bye-laws for this purpose were hardly necessary, stables being "premises" within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and nuisance therein could be dealt with summarily, and the Sanitary Authority could, therefore, if they think desirable, specify any works to be executed to prevent a recurrence of any nuisance. Moreover, a multiplicity of Bye-laws should be avoided. In the event the London County Council's proposals were not adopted. LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL (GENERAL POWERS) ACT, 1904- In November, 1903, your Medical Officer reported at length upon the London County Council (General Powers) Bill as drafted for the consideration of Parliament. This Report dealt with the sanitary section of the Bill, which aimed at giving additional powers to Local Sanitary Authorities in the Metropolis. These are now embodied in the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904, which received the Royal Assent on the loth August, 1904, wherein the separate and independent authority of the Corporation, as the Local Sanitary Authority for both the City of London and the Port of London, is clearly defined. The new statutory powers conferred upon the Corporation in Part III. of this Act grant authority for— Section 19 (1) (2).—The purification or destruction of filthy, dangerous or unwholesome articles. Section 20 (1) (2).—The cleansing of houses infested with vermin. Section 22.—The removal or alteration of sanitary conveniences so placed or constructed as to be a nuisance or offensive to public decency. Section 24 (2)—gives the Sanitary Authority of any sanitary district a right to enter at all reasonable times any house, building or premises, or part thereof, in that district for the purpose of examining whether there is any contravention of the provisions of Sections 19 and 20 (already referred to.) This is an entirely new departure, and one of great importance to Sanitary Authorities. It is a most useful provision. Similar powers should be conferred upon Sanitary Authorities in relation to all nuisances. At present, 67 under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, power of entry is only given in cases where there is reasonable cause to believe that there is some contravention of the Act, or of a Bye-law under the Act. Part V., Section 27 (1 to 9)—deals with tuberculosis of the udder in cows, and provides that in cases where a Veterinary Surgeon, appointed by the Council under the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Order, 1899, has reason to suspect that any cow in any dairy farm or cowshed situated within the County (exclusive of the City of London) is suffering from tuberculosis of the udder, he may cause such cow to be removed, and the Council shall cause it to be slaughtered. This section also provides for the compensation of the owner of such animal, and for fines or imprisonment when persons employed in the execution of this section are obstructed. There are some material differences between the Bill as drafted and the Act now under consideration. In the Bill a clause was inserted that would have made it an offence to sort or sift house refuse by hand. I am strongly in favour of such a restriction, and regret that it does not appear in the Act. There was also a clause prescribing sanitary requirements to be carried out in premises where any article intended for human food is sold or prepared for sale. This, too, was dropped in the Act, but in my opinion, this clause, as drafted, did not go far enough for the protection of the public, as, unless registration were enforced, the control would be inadequate. Clauses were sought in the Bill for the London County Council to make Bye-laws with respect to the paving of stables and stable-yards for administra tion by local Sanitary Authorities in the County. These, however, as previously mentioned, were dropped in the Act. Section 22 in the Bill exempted Railway Companies from the operation of Bye-laws requiring the removal or alteration of sanitary conveniences sc placed or constructed as to be a nuisance or offensive to public decency. It will be noted that this dispensation is not granted in the Act, and in my notes on the Bill in November, 1903, I reported that I could see no reason for such exemption, which would have been most objectionable. The title of this Act is somewhat misleading, but Section 25 makes it clear that the above powers are conferred upon, and are to be exercised by, the Corporation and Metropolitan Borough Councils in the County of London, and that the London County Council—with the exception of the powers given under Section 27 (1 to 9) which do not extend to the City—is not concerned with their administration. 68 ALIENS BILL. This Bill was read a second time on 25th April, 1904, and on the 8th June referred to the Standing Committee on Law, where its progress was so delayed that on the 7th July the Bill was reported to the House, the Home Secretary having declined to proceed any further with the measure before the Standing Committee. The Bill was consequently abandoned. It is understood that a similar Bill will be introduced this year. Section 4 was the only part of the Bill affecting the City as a "Sanitary Authority." It provided that:— "(1) If the Local Government Board are satisfied, on the complaint of "any Sanitary Authority, that the dwellings in the district of that "Authority or in any part of that district are overcrowded, and that "the immigration of aliens into that district or part has substantially "contributed to that overcrowding, the Board may make Regulations "as regards that district or part (in this Act referred to as the "prohibited area)— "(a) for defining the limits of the prohibited area ; and "(b) for prohibiting or regulating the dwelling or residence of "aliens, or of any particular class of aliens, in the prohibited "area; and "(c) providing for such other matters as appear to the Board "necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect "to this section. (2) The expression 'Sanitary Authority' in this section means any urban "or rural sanitary authority, or in London any sanitary authority "within the meaning of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891." The Corporation of London is the " Sanitary Authority " for the City. Although at the present time there is no part of the City that there is occasion to have defined as a "prohibited area" within the meaning of the Bill, the above provision is a useful one. The measure as a whole is worthy of support, and in the interest of the public health it is to be hoped that the Government will have no difficulty in carrying it to a successful issue. SANITATION OF "NON-PROVIDED" SCHOOLS IN THE CITY. A "non-provided" school is a public elementary school not provided by the Local Education Authority (the London County Council in the City), but maintained by them under certain conditions. A public elementary school and the conditions referred to are defined as under:— 69 The term "elementary school" means a school at which elementary education is the principal part of the education there given, and the payments from each scholar do not exceed ninepence per week. Every "elementary school" conducted in accordance with the regulations of Section 7 of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, is a public elementary school within the meaning of that Act. The "non-provided" schools in the City of London transferred under the London Education Act, 1903, from the School Board for London to the London County Council included the following:— Cripplegate Without Ward (since closed). St. Bartholomew the Great, West Smithfield. St. Sepulchre Parochial, Giltspur Street. Aldersgate Ward, 181, Aldersgate Street. Coleman Street Ward, London Wall. Bishopsgate Infants, Bishopsgate Churchyard. Aldgate Ward, Mitre Street (closed, but since January, 1905, partially used for Infants of Sir John Cass Foundation). Sir John Cass Foundation and Institute, Jewry Street. Billingsgate, Tower, &c., Ward Schools, Botolph Lane (closed January, 1905). St. Bride and Bridewell, Infants, Bride Lane. St. Dun stan's Infants, Fetter Lane. St. Dunstan's Parochial, Fleet Street. Since the transfer the London County Council has caused a survey of these schools to be made by their Architect, who has also reported upon the condition of the sanitary accommodation at each of them.* In several cases amendments are desirable in the arrangement of the lavatories, &c. This is a matter which has received the attention of the various governing bodies for some time past, but improvements have doubtless been delayed in consequence of the uncertainty as to the future requirements of the new Education Authority. Your inspectors have visited the schools from time to time. Smoke tests have been applied, and any actual nuisance brought to the notice of the owners for immediate abatement. It is rumoured that the severe examination by the hydraulic test is about to be applied by the officials of the London County Council. This seems somewhat premature in view of the proposed re-arrangement of the lavatories generally referred to above, and the possibility of a further number of schools being permanently closed. *A synopsis of this Report has been published in the public Press. 70 HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The Superintendent of Cleansing reports that the refuse removed from the City in 1904 consisted of 33,979 cartloads of street sweepings and slop, and 50,742 loads of house and trade refuse; total, 82,721. Of this bulk, 27,554 loads were consumed by the Destructor at Letts' Wharf; this was 1.3 per cent. more than last year, and 1.7 per cent. above the average for the previous five years.

This necessitated the service of a total of 425 Notices [or, 194, 48, and 183 during the year, in the West, Middle, and East Districts respectively]. Tn addition to the foregoing there are eleven Blocks of dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is "self-contained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that under these circumstances they are not subject to the Bye-laws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family:— Situation.

Two important decisions were given on 3rd February, 1904, by the High Court (King's Bench Division), when in each case the Judges were of opinion that certain Bye-laws relating to cleansing houses let in lodgings were invalid, as they did not provide for notice being given to the landlord. The question was also raised that the Bye-law fixing the first week in April as the period within which the annual cleansing was to be done was unreasonable. In the first case, Stiles v. Galinski, the appellant was a sanitary inspector of the Stepney Borough Council, and the respondent a landlord within the meaning of the Bye-laws in force in Stepney for houses let in lodgings. The respondent was summoned at the Thames Police Court on 23rd June, 1903, for not causing some premises to be cleansed in the first week in April, in accordance with the bye-laws, and the summons was dismissed by the Magistrate. The second case was that of Nokes v. The Mayor, &c., of Islington, in which the appellants had been fined, at the Clerkenwell Police Court, ten shillings and costs upon an information similar to that of the first case. In delivering judgment in both cases, the Lord Chief Justice stated that the Court held that the Bye-laws in each instance were unreasonable, as no provision was made for giving notice, and that a landlord was thereby not properly safeguarded from liability for a criminal offence. In the case of Stiles v. Galinski the appeal of the Stepney Borough Council was dismissed with costs, and in the second case, that of Nokes v. The Mayor, &c., of Islington, the appeal was allowed with costs. The Bye-laws in question were drafted on the model Bye-laws issued by the Local Government Board for the guidance of local authorities, and those in operation in the City of London were also framed on them. Although it was the rule in the City always to give formal notice to owners when there was occasion to enforce any of the Bve-laws, it was considered advisable to recast them with a view to meeting the points raised in the foregoing cases. A new set of Bye-laws was therefore prepared. These were adopted and sealed by the Court of Common Council on the 24th November, 1904, and confirmed by the Local Government Board on the 20th January, 1905. A copy of these will be found in Appendix F on page 165. 73 FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901. WORKSHOPS AND WORKPLACES. This Act came into operation on the 1st January, 1902, and during the preceding year a systematic inspection of workshops and workplaces was commenced in view of the additional obligations the Act imposed upon the Corporation as a Sanitary Authority. A Register of workshops was compiled from information supplied by H.M. Factory Department, and by the end of the year under review (1904) all these premises had been visited, in addition to the new workshops notified by H.M. Factory Inspector from time to time. Upon inspection it was found that many of the workshops entered had long since ceased to be used, some were found not to be within the City's limits, a number of factories had been included in error, whilst in other cases the premises had since been demolished. As the work progressed the errors above mentioned were eliminated, and by the end of 1904 a Register of Workshops—complete so far as they were then known to exist in the City—was in use. This will be largely added to, from time to time, by systematic inspection of the City, which has already brought to light many workshops not previously known. The City's Register of Workshops up to the end of the year shows 1,336 separate premises as existing, and containing 3,066 workshops. In my Annual Report for 1902 I estimated that 2,500 workshops needed inspection, which, it will be seen, has been considerably exceeded, whilst many more are still being discovered. With respect to workplaces there is no statutory obligation to register them, but this course was adopted in the case of kitchens of restaurants, &c., with the result that we now have a complete Register of Kitchens known to exist in the City, the total number being 918. The workshops inspected by your Woman Inspector are included in the above figures, but the details of the work performed appear under a separate heading on page 90. 74 The following is a summary of the work done annually since the passing of the Act:— Registered Workshops. 1901 745 Inspected and Registered during the year. 1902 481 1903 547 1904 1,293 „ „ „ 3,066 Total for four years.

By the middle of June last the inspection and registration of Furriers' workshops in the City had been completed. The results clearly show the necessity for systematic inspection. The importance of cleanliness cannot be over-estimated in this business, and thorough ventilation is absolutely necessary. If, in addition, refuse is removed daily and fur clippings are properly stored, it places the sanitary condition as high as possible in such a business, especially if floors are rendered impervious by some suitable material. One case only of infectious disease, viz., Scarlet Fever, has occurred during recent years in connection with this industry, and the precautions taken after the patient (a boy) was removed to hospital prevented any spread of the infection. H.M. Factory Inspector was notified of the fact that in 13 cases the "Abstract" of the Act was not affixed as required by statute in workrooms where young persons or women were employed. Only 75 of the 144 premises inspected, in which the business of furrier or skin merchant is carried on, are used as workrooms, the remainder being occupied by dealers and importers of skins or rugs as warehouses or showrooms. The enquiry showed that 22 outworkers were employed within the City and 120 in districts outside. The majority of the premises inspected had but one workshop each, nineteen had two, five had three, one had seven, and one nine. The artificial illuminant employed was gas in 100 cases, electricity in 18. The total number of workshops inspected was 118, and involved 720 inspections and re-inspections, and the number of employes engaged made a total of 906 workers (312 males and 594 females). In five cases overcrowding was found to exist. The total number of defects reported was 416, comprising (1) Dirty condition of workshop, defective ventilation, dec., 129; (2) Defective drainage, including soil pipes and sink wastes, 69; (3) Water-closets, want of ventilation, unsuitability, not separate for the sexes, and general defects, including want of cleansing, 139; (4) Water supply, including dirty cisterns, others not covered, &c., 38; (5) Accommodation for reception of refuse defective, 41. The number of Notices served was 142, made up of 108 "Intimations" and 34 "Statutory," all of which were complied with, without the necessity for any legal proceedings. 77 BAKEHOUSES. (Underground.) Bakehouses have been the subject of special legislation for many years, and since the 1st January, 1896, it has been unlawful to establish any new one underground. The Factory and Workshop Act of 1901 introduced some stringent measures with regard to these places, and it was therein enacted that after the 1st January, 1904, no existing underground* bakehouse should be used unless certified by the Sanitary Authority to be "suitable as regards construction, light, ventilation, and in all other respects" (Sec. 101 (4)). Early in the year the whole of the underground bakehouses had been dealt with, i.e., were certified as suitable or had permanently ceased to be used as such. The following is a list of the underground bakehouses in the City dealt with under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901:— 188, Aldersgate Street. 81, Bishopsgate Street Without. 59 to 62, „ „ †4, Broadway. 95, Cannon Street. 8, Copthall Avenue. 15, Corn hill. 15, Duke Street. 85, Fore Street. †67, Farringdon Street. †88, „ †93, Fetter Lane. †12, Gracechurch Street. †21, Holbom. 8 to 14, King Street, Snow Hill. 48, Knigbtrider Street. 8, Lambeth Hill. 18, Long Lane. †37, Middlesex Street. †63 to 65, „ †22, „ 31, Newbury Street. 3, Pancras Lane. 21, Stoney Lane. 68, St. Mary Axe. †75, St. Paul's Churchyard. 194, Upper Thames Street. [* An underground bakehouse,is one in which the floor surface of any baking room is more than 3 feet below the surface of the footway of the adjoining street, or of the ground adjoining or nearest to the room. † These have been established at least 21 years. 78 ABOVEGROUND BAKEHOUSES. The following is a list of bakehouses in the City situated aboveground:— 90, Bishopsgate Street Without. *9 and 10, Hart Street. †18-19, Leadenhall Market. *61, Middlesex Street. †l55, Minories. *85, Middlesex Street. †4, Water Lane. *13, Widegate Street. †93-94, Upper Thames Street. SUMMARY. Underground bakehouses 27 Bakehouses aboveground 9 Total number of bakehouses in the City 36 During the year 203 inspections of bakehouses were made, and with four exceptions they were found to be up to the standard required by the Act. The defect in each of the four cases mentioned was want of cleanliness in the walls or ceilings, which was remedied forthwith on service of Notice. Midnight visits were made, i.e., between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. Two bakehouses aboveground ceased to be used as such, and one was demolished for railway improvements. KITCHENS OF RESTAURANTS. The initial inspection of Kitchens of Restaurants, &c., commenced in the year, 1902 was completed during the year. A Return presented in February, 1897, showed that there were at that date 614 places in the City where food was prepared for sale. As a result of the recent inspection 909 kitchens were placed upon the Register, and this number has since been further added to, 9 new kitchens having been established, the total number now registered being 918. The kitchens registered are classified as follows, viz.: (1) Tea Shops; (2) Coffee-Houses; (3) Public-Houses; (4) Restaurants with Licence; and (5) Restaurants without Licence. * These have been established at least 21 years. † Established during 1903. 79 Roughly speaking, there are twice as many women employed as men, but as both sexes are usually employed, the provisions of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, with respect to suitable, sufficient and separate water-closet accommodation apply, kitchens being "workplaces" within the meaning of the Act. There was at first some doubt in the minds of Keepers of Restaurants whether they come within the scope of the Act, but upon their attention being directed to the Memorandum of the Secretary of State* on the subject, very little opposition was experienced. Of the kitchens inspected 508 are situated underground, and although the advantages of their being aboveground are obvious, it is too much to hope that all kitchens established in the future will not have this defect, space aboveground being so much more valuable. The experience gathered from the constant inspection of these places suggests the following:— The floor, walls and ceiling should be finished in a durable material and be free from obstructions, so as to be easily cleansed, all tables, benches, &c., being readily movable. Where gas is used for cooking purposes, means should be provided for carrying off the fumes of gas. Electric light should be used, so as to reduce heat as far as possible in the kitchen. Proper larders and pantries should be provided for the storage of cooked and uncooked food. Special attention should be paid to the condition of water cisterns, and effectual means taken to exclude dust and dirt, &c. At least one white enamelled stoneware sink should be provided for washing vegetables; indeed, it would be better if all sinks were made of similar material, the advantage being that dirty conditions are at once apparent and call for immediate attention. Cupboards or other provision outside the kitchen should be made for hanging wearing apparel when not in use. Means should be taken to exclude dust and dirt from entering underground kitchens as far as possible. * Vide p. 69 Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report for 1902. 80 Where inspection chambers to drains exist in kitchens they should be provided with double covers (one cover below another), or be so arranged that the covers cannot become unsealed by being walked on, &c. Separate lavatory basin accommodation should be provided outside the kitchen for both sexes, where practicable, for use of employes. Where lift shafts are used in connection with kitchens they should be cleansed from time to time. In a properly arranged kitchen many other things suggest themselves, such as separate scullery and cold (ice) larder, separate rooms for cooked and uncooked foods, fish larder, vegetable store, dry goods store, plate room, saucepan room, &c., &c., but these conditions do not obtain at many kitchens in the City. It is almost unnecessary to add that kitchens should be adequately ventilated and that the temperature should not exceed 80° Fahr. Many persons appear to imagine the cooking can only be carried on in an extremely hot kitchen, but this is a wrong impression. The lack of proper provision for keeping food hot whilst being served up often results in the temperature being kept unduly high, the windows being closed to prevent the rapid cooling of the dishes. During the year many of the kitchens have been re-visited, and in future the whole of them will be re-inspected periodically. It is found that the businesses are constantly changing hands, and that the kitchen arrangements are an ever-varying quantity. Gas stoves are frequently added, without any provision being made for carrying off the fumes, the watercloset accommodation for the sexes has to be re-adjusted and the walls and ceilings of the kitchen soon get dirty. These and many other points need constant and vigilant attention to ensure a decent standard being maintained. Special attention is now being paid to the storage of food, and suggestions from my Department are often appreciated and acted upon. The meat and food deposited for sale in restaurants is examined, but only in one instance was it necessary to take action. In the case mentioned several joints of meat, &c., were seized and taken before a Magistrate in the usual way, but no prosecution resulted, there being good grounds to believe that the meat was not intended for the food of man. During the year 513 re-inspections of kitchens were made. The Women Inspectors will in future attend to all kitchens where women only are employed, and arrangements have been made whereby over-lapping will be avoided on the part of the Workshop and Women Inspectors in respect of the kitchens where male and female labour is employed. 81 Summary of Sanitary Defects remedied in Kitchens of Restaurants &c., 1904.

Up to the present, time has not permitted of much being done in the inspection of Factories, which primarily falls within the scope of the duties of H.M. Factory Department. The Factory Inspectors are required, under the Statute, to give notice to the Sanitary Authority of sanitary defects remediable under the Public Health Acts, but not under the Factory Acts. In the early future it will be possible to give this important matter more attention, and thereby anticipate the action of the Home Office Authorities. In one instance where it was proposed to establish a factory, plans of the sanitary arrangements were previously submitted, a precaution which, if generally adopted, would often save trouble and expense. During the year 78 Factories were inspected, 39 of which are accounted for under the heading of "Woman Sanitary Inspector." Details of Inspections, &c., 1904.

Inspectors of Factories. In 1904 thirty-one notifications of factories and workshops where sanitary defects existed that were remediable under the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, were received from H.M. Inspectors of Factories under the provisions of Sec. 5 (1) of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. Under the latter statute the local sanitary authority is under the obligation of informing the Factory Inspector of the action taken by them in each instance, and further, to commence proceedings to remedy the defects discovered within one month of the date of the notice. With few exceptions the sanitary defects reported at the thirty-one places referred to above were remedied before the end of the year, and the works required at those then outstanding have since been completed. A comparison of the number of such notifications received in past years with the year under review shows as follows:— 84 Year. No. of Complaints received. 1897 34 1898 65 1899 55 1900 49 1901« 51 1902 54 1903 66 1904 31 Annual average 50 It is satisfactory to note that these complaints were fewer in number than for the last seven years. On investigating the reports of H.M. Factory Inspectors, defects other than those notified have been remedied when necessary. The additional defects found included:— (1) W.C's opening directly into workshops, &c. (2) Gas stoves, &c., not ventilated. (3) Defective drains. (4) Defective soil pipes. (5) Defective urinals. (6) Defective waste pipes, &c. DOMESTIC WORKSHOPS AND FACTORIES. "Domestic Workshops" and "Domestic Factories" are places in which no mechanical power is used, and in which the only persons employed are members of the same family dwelling there; but when work is done only at irregular intervals, and does not furnish the whole or the principal means of living to the family, the place ceases to come under the provisions of the Act. 85 Places where the family are engaged either in straw plaiting, pillow lace making, or glove making are also exempt. Four Domestic Workshops within the City were duly notified to H.M. Chief Inspector of Factories as required. The following is a list of those registered:— Premises. Trade. Workers. Total Workers. M.

In January, 1904, the Corporation adopted a standard of sanitary requirements for kitchens and above-ground bakehouses to be complied with by applicants for Certificates. Up to the present 14 applications have been received, and three Certificates granted, two of which were for kitchens and one for a bakehouse. Some of the applicants have decided not to proceed further, the others are under consideration. Much misapprehension exists as to the Certificates. It should be pointed out that they are only issued where a definitely high standard exists, and not in cases where work has been carried out just to satisfy the bare requirements of the Public Health Acts. OUTWORKERS. Much difficulty has been experienced in getting employers to send in lists of the names and addresses of their outworkers in accordance with Section 107 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. It is extraordinary to find the number of employers who are, or profess to be, ignorant of their obligation in this respect. Whenever a workshop is inspected the persons responsible are informed that a list of their outworkers must be furnished twice a year, and even then many failed to do so. In order to deal with this neglect in an effectual manner, all persons previously known to employ outworkers were given notice, before the end of the year, on an official form, of the requirements of the Act, which, if ignored, will entail further proceedings. The following is a copy of the Notice referred to:— 87 Corporation of London. PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, GUILDHALL, E.C., October, 1904. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901 (Section 107). OUTWORKERS' LISTS. To The Act requires that, in certain classes of work,* occupiers of Factories and Workshops, and any Contractor employed by such occupiers, shall, on or before 1st February and 1st August in each year, send to the Local Sanitary Authority where the Factory or Workshop is situated a list of the names and addresses of all persons employed by them who do not work at such Factory or Workshop. This applies to any place from which work is given out, even though there is no Workshop there. † The return must be made in the form and manner prescribed. For neglecting to comply with these requirements the penalty is a fine not exceeding £2, and in the case of a subsequent neglect not exceeding £5. Lists should be sent to The Medical Officer of Health, Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C. * The making, cleaning, washing, altering, ornamenting, finishing, and repairing of wearing apparel and any work incidental thereto ; The making, ornamenting, mending, and finishing of lace, and of lace curtains and nets; Cabinet and furniture making and upholstery work; The making of electro-plate; The making of files; Fur-pulling; Making of iron and steel cables and chains; Making of iron and steel anchors and grapnels; Making of cart gear, including swivels, rings, loops, gear buckles, mullin bits, hooks, and attachments of all kinds; and Making of locks, latches, and keys. † Copies of the Form (Outworkers Form 44, July, 1902) prescribed by H.M. Home Secretary can be purchased from Messrs. Eyre and Spottiswoode, East Harding Street, Fleet Street, or of H.M. Printers for the time being. 88 THIS TABLE WAS ISSUED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT BOARD BY REQUEST OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

Summary of work done under the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, during the year 1904:— Factories inspected 39 „ re-inspections 57 Workshops (workrooms inspected, measured, &c.) 345 „ re-inspections 282 Workplaces inspected 11 „ re-inspections 35 Offices inspected 13 „ re-inspections 8 Domestic workshops inspected 4 Schools inspected 2 Complaints received from H.M.

During the year the inspection of workshops already on the register has been completed, and 345 workshops where women are employed have been dealt with by your Woman Inspector, in addition to 39 factories. Fifty trades are represented, thirty-one of which are concerned with the making of clothing, and from these a great deal of the work is given to outworkers, most of whom carry on their work outside the City. The existence of factories is not notified to a Local Authority by H.M. Inspectors of Factories, though the obligation to inspect the sanitary accommodation at these places rests with the Sanitary Authority under Section 38 Public Health (London) Act, 1891. The use of mechanical power in any part of the work renders the premises a "factory" within the meaning of the Factory Act, and it often happens that in clothing factories the only power used is in the cutting room, the actual making up of the garments being done by hand or treadle machines. There are besides, 91 premises in which certain trades are carried on which are classed as factories whether power is used or not, such are bookbinders and tobacco factories. A large number of women are employed in factories in the City, but the existence of the places where they work is left to be discovered by the Sanitary Inspectors. In the 39 factories visited by your Woman Inspector in 1904, 1,734 women were found to be employed, and no less than 122 defects were detected. MANTLE MAKERS. All the premises (both workshops and factories) where mantle making is known to be carried on have been inspected. Over 200 houses were visited in the initial enquiry ; at the majority of places all the work was given out, while a small number were only showrooms and offices of firms whose factories were situated abroad. Work was found to be carried on at 78 of the premises, 17 factories and 61 workshops. The workshops included 113 workrooms, and nearly 2,000 women are employed in this trade. 130 defects were fuund, the greater proportion of them being in respect of defective or unsuitable sanitary accommodation, badly ventilated workrooms, and dirty walls and ceilings. The occupiers of all places from which work was found to be given out were notified of their obligation to forward lists of outworkers to the Medical Officer of Health. THE USE OF GAS IN WORKSHOPS. The dangers attendant on the use of gas in workshops for heating purposes, whether in stoves, heaters for irons or tools, or in gas irons, when no means of carrying off the fumes is provided, are very little realised by occupiers of workshops and workplaces, especially in those cases where no smell of '' gas " is detected. In this relation it may be of interest to quote the remarks made by H.M. Chief Inspector of Factories with regard to the inodorous gas, carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide CO), in a report on water and other gases published in September last. In this report attention is drawn to the danger of poisoning from the carbon monoxide given off by water and other gases of a similar nature, and in a smaller degree by coal gas. It was pointed out that carbonic oxide poisoning may occur in many ways. Thus danger of this kind may arise from the use of gas irons and from defective gas fittings, and from gas stoves, especially when no provision is made for the products of combustion to be carried away by a flue or chimney. The absence of a chimney in a room greatly increases the risk. Carbonic oxide is also found where coke fires are 92 used in confined spaces. Symptoms of carbonic oxide poisoning begin with throbbing of the blood vessels of the head, giddiness, palpitation of the heart, and weakness of the limbs. These become greatly aggravated after any exertion. Headache, anaemia, and defective nutrition may result from the long-continued breathing of the gas in small amount, such as might occur from defective gasfittings. LADIES' WAITING ROOMS AT RAILWAY STATIONS. The ladies' waiting rooms at twenty-three Railway Stations have been inspected regularly twice a year, and a marked improvement has been noticed in their cleanliness and general condition. Specific improvements effected are shown in the following list:— Aldersgate Street - 2 W.C's. Ventilation and light increased. Walls and ceiling cleansed. Bank (Central - Ventilation increased. London Railway). Bishopsgate Street- 4 W.C's. Ventilation improved. Blackfriars - - Refuse removed from roofs outside windows of W.C's. Hood placed over gas stove in attendants' room. Cupboard provided for attendants' food, formerly kept in an unused closet. Cannon Street - 1st Class room ventilation improved. (South Eastern and Chatham Railway). Cannon Street - Fittings repaired. (District Railway). Fenchurch Street - 1st Class room ventilation increased. (Great Eastern Railway). Holborn - - 1st Class room ventilation increased. (South Eastern and Chatham Railway). Liverpool Street - Valve closets removed and replaced by wash-down closets in all ladies' waiting rooms. Ventilation of East side Suburban room improved. Ludgate Hill- - 1st Class room valve closets removed and replaced by closets of wash-down type. Waste-pipe of lavatory basins repaired. Walls and ceilings cleansed. 93 Moorgate Street - Walls and ceilings cleansed. (Metropolitan Railway). Moorgate Street - Ventilation improved. (Great Northern and City Railway). St. Paul's - - Fittings repaired. Snow Hill - - New fittings provided. The ladies' room at Mansion House Station has been demolished in the course of alterations to the station. The ladies' rooms at all the stations, except Bank (Central London), Bank (City and South London), Fenchurch Street (Great Eastern Railway), Mark Lane (District), and Moorgate (City and South London), are not reserved for passengers only, but are open to the general public. A Paper read by Miss Safford on "Health Aspect s of some Occupations for Women," at the Sanitary Institute Congress, at Glasgow, on July 29th, 1904, conveys so much useful and practical information that I insert an abstract. This Paper deals with a few of the occupations followed by women in the City of London. There are no "dangerous trades" carried on, and the insanitary conditions found arise from the following causes: Deficiency of natural light, insufficient ventilation, overcrowding, unreasonable temperature, insufficient or unsuitable sanitary accommodation, dirty walls, ceilings, and floors. Special defects in 6ome types of occupations:— (A) Workshops— (1.) Dust producing processes—Feather Dressing. Special means of ventilation are needed to carry off the fine light dust which is given off. In Furriers, the chief danger is the dust and hair which are produced in cutting and sewing. Beyond the injurious effect which any dust has on the lungs, there is also with "fur dust" the risk of its being a vehicle of anthrax contagion. (2.) Workshops in which gas is used in the process of work. In nearly all cases where clothing is made, gas is used to heat irons, and in gauffering and accordion pleating machines. In artificial flower making, the tools are 94 heated at little gas-stoves placed on work tables. Cardboard box makers and frame makers use gas to heat the glue, and the smell of the glue, added to the fumes of the gas, makes these workshops particularly unpleasant. In all these trades, a hood and flue, or other means of carrying off the injurious products of combustion, should be provided. (B) Laundries and Receiving Offices— The presence of steam and the excessive heat from stoves for irons and gas-heated irons and machines, and defective floors in wash-houses, are the principal sources of ill-health in laundries. In receiving offices, the rooms used for sorting dirty linen are small and badly ventilated. (C) Factories— As compared with workshops, the particular danger of factories lies in the nerve strain caused by the "unceasing competition of sensitive human nerve and muscle against insensitive iron." The nerve tension involved in working electrically-driven sewing machines making 4,000 stitches a minute must be acute. (D) Restaurants— Basement kitchens are dark and badly ventilated, and the air admitted is usually charged with dust and impurities from the streets. Aboveground kitchens are comparatively healthy. (E) Offices— An increasingly large number of women work as clerks in typewriting offices, as telephone operators, and in various other capacities. The offices are often dark and badly ventilated. More serious is the menace to health caused by the absence of suitable sanitary accommodation for the lady clerks which obtains in the majority of these offices. The gradual undermining of health, with consequent anaemia and neurasthenia, are the least evils which result. Too often serious internal injury is caused, and the harm done does not end with the girls themselves. Outside London, the matter is dealt with by Section 22 of the Public Health Amendment Act, 1890, which requires the provision of separate sanitary accommodation in every building where persons of both sexes are employed in "any trade or business"; but there appears to be some doubt as to whether Sections 37 and 38 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, which deal with the provision of sanitary conveniences, can be enforced in regard to offices. If these Sections are held not to apply to offices, it is surely time that, by fresh legislation, London should be brought into line with the rest of the country in a matter of so vital importance to health. 95 SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS. The usual flushing of courts and alleys in the more thickly-populated and poorer parts of the City was carried out as usual during the summer months under the directions of the Superintendent of Cleansing. The main streets and thoroughfares were also regularly and frequently washed, and your Engineer informs me that in the above services no less than 50,238,433 gallons of water were used. Disinfectants were also freely applied where necessary. In the subjoined lists the places marked * * * were flushed every twentyfour hours, those marked * * twice a week, and those marked * once a week.

Smoke nuisances were reported at 55 premises during 1904. The number of observations recorded in relation to them amounted to 1,202, as against 1,306 noted at 57 places in 1903. In only one instance was the evidence sufficient to justify the institution of legal proceedings for abatement of smoke nuisance. In this case the owner of the "Queen's Arras," Bird-in-Hand Court, Cheapside, was summoned at the Mansion House for non-compliance with a prohibition order made on 2nd April, 1902. The summons was heard on the 28th March and on 16t,h May. The offence was proved at the first hearing, but the nuisance having been abated and a guarantee given by the defendant that it should not recur, the summons was withdrawn on the 16th May. Generally the improvement recorded last year is maintained, but several nuisances reported upon and dealt with by your Committee in the past required frequent attention, old nuisances occasionally being permitted to recur from carelessness, improper fuel or burning of refuse. Much assistance has been rendered by the Police in notifying the occurrence of smoke nuisances. A misleading suggestion having been offered in the public Press that smoke may have some disinfectant properties, and therefore harmless, I cannot too strongly emphasise the danger to public health from the loss of light, vitiation of the atmosphere, and to the dirt, suffocation and depression due to the pall of smoke suspended over London, especially in the colder season of the year, arising not only from factory chimneys but from every domestic fire. A wide-spread recognition of this evil is the first step towards its abatement. 98 SMOKE ABATEMENT. In January, 1904,1 was asked to advise upon a letter from the Town Clerk of the City of Westminster, inviting the Corporation to support the following Resolution:— "That, in view of the damage to health and property caused by coal "smoke, the London County Council be urged to undertake an inquiry "into all methods of cooking, so as to ascertain whether there is any "form of apparatus which is smokeless and at the same time "practical and economical for general use." By my advice the Westminster City Council were informed that, while agreeing with the suggestion that an inquiry in this direction might serve a useful purpose, it would be better that the Local Government Board should be requested to undertake such an investigation. DAIRIES, COWSHEDS, AND MILKSHOPS "ORDERS." There are now 552 purveyors of milk registered in the City of London under the Dairies, Cowsheds, and Milkshops Orders, as compared with 553 in 1903. In the course of the year the sale of milk was discontinued at 30 premises, 29 new premises were added to the register, and 29 changes of ownership occurred. The classification of the persons registered is practically as last year. The regulation requiring all vessels used for the storage or sale of milk to be provided with suitable covers has been enforced throughout the City, and beneficial results as to the purity of the milk supplied to the consumer assured. During the year only one case of infectious disease occurred on premises where the occupier was registered as a purveyor of milk. This case occurred on 5th April in the Barbican, and all milk found on the premises was at once destroyed and the sale of milk at the shop forbidden until the premises had been disinfected. A street list of the places where milk is sold in the City will be found in Appendix D, p. 152. 99 ICE CREAMS. Ice creams were sold during the season at 237 premises within the City of London, against 239 last year. Ninety-one of this number are owned by foreigners and are small confectionery establishments, 115 are large refreshment dep6ts (Lyons 41, British Tea Table Co. 33, Express Dairy Co. 13, and Aerated Bread Co. 28), the remaining 31 are kept by smaller retailers. The ice cream on sale at 84 shops is made within the City of London, in all other instances it is manufactured in outside districts and brought into the City ready for consumption. Where the commodity is manufactured inside the City the premises are constantly visited, and the regulations relating to the manufacture and sale of ice creams enforced; where the article is made outside the City the place of manufacture is ascertained and the Medical Officer of Health of the district communicated with. In every instance the manufactory and the process of manufacture have been favourably reported upon. It is satisfactory to note that during the year no case of illness has been traced to the consumption of ice creams. Nineteen itinerant vendors' barrows and wares have been regularly under supervision, and the regulation requiring them to conspicuously exhibit on their barrows the place where the ice cream was manufactured has been complied with. A marked falling-off in point of the number of itinerant vendors has been noted, the number under observation last year being 47. 100 MEAT SUPPLIES. The supply of meat to the Central Market for the year 1904 was 410,519 tons, 5 cwts., 3 qrs. It will be seen from the Table on p. 112 that this amount has only twice been exceeded, viz., in 1901 and 1903, when the deliveries exceeded 415,000 tons in each case. The Market was open for business 304 days, thus showing an average daily supply of 1,350 tons. That the meat deliveries do not now increase concurrently with the growth of population is due to the increasing amount of meat delivered to the retail trade direct from the slaughterhouses attached to the Cattle Markets at Islington and Deptford, and also from the numerous Cold-Air Stores established on the riverside and elsewhere, and although the Market deliveries are less than last year, the actual volume of business transacted at the Central Market has probably increased. The state of trade in the Market has a direct relation to the amount of meat dealt with by your officers. Thus, when a cargo of meat arrives in an indifferent condition at a time when the demand for supplies is large and meat fetching good prices, any affected portions are cut away in order that the value of the sound portions of the carcasses should be realised ; on the other hand, if such a consignment is put on a dull market the meat is stored in refrigerators and served out from time to time according to the demand. Being originally of poor or doubtful quality, much of this meat is subsequently condemned. This and other causes, such as fires on meat-carrying vessels, and breakdowns in refrigerating machinery have resulted in the seizures for 1904 being the heaviest recorded in the City, viz., 1,556 tons, 2 cwts., 1 qr. During one week in October last no less than 132 tons, 7 cwts., 0qrs., 8 lbs. of unsound meat, chiefly beef from the River Plate, was condemned by your officers. The removal of such a mass of putrid material from a public market taxed the resources of the staff to the utmost, but it was fortunately effected without a single complaint either by the salesmen or the public—a fact that speaks well for the organisation and work of the Department. As the sources of supply are becoming more remote, it is unlikely that there will be any material diminution in the amount of meat seizures. For instance, two more firms are now importing chilled meat from the Argentine, and when it is remembered that the voyage from Buenos Ayres takes three weeks as compared with six days for the New York passage, it is evident that supplies from the former are more likely to arrive in an unsound condition, especially as the arrangements for transport in South America are at present somewhat imperfect, the steamers generally bringing the meat of two or more importers which has to be picked up at factories considerable distances apart. The 101 cargo, therefore, is liable to arrive in an uneven condition, that which is stored first generally requiring very careful inspection. These supplies from the Argentine are, however, about equal in quality to second and third grade chilled American now so largely consumed here, and to which it is an important trade rival. In addition to chilled beef, we receive a considerable quantity of both frozen beef and mutton from the same quarter, for which there is a steady trade at prices slightly lower than that of New Zealand produce. It may serve a useful purpose to quote here some observations on this subject which appeared in December last in "The Meat Trades Journal." "It would really seem as if the beef cattle of England wanted grading "up quite as much as those of 'foreign' countries from whom we now "draw so largely for regular supplies. This is a matter that ought to "receive the attention of the Board of Agriculture, who, we think, would "be perfectly justified in encouraging and facilitating by every possible "means the use and service of well-bred bulls. The unremunerative "character of home-bred cattle is frequently brought forward, but it is "not to be wondered at when we see the very mediocre quality of the "great bulk of the animals marketed all the year round. In the last "quarterly Shorthorn Circular (July to September), no fewer than 22 "pages are taken up in enumerating the animals exported abroad for "breeding purposes, the list comprising 350 head, the great bulk of which "went to Argentina, a country that ere long must become a most "formidable rival to American and Canadian shippers." The "Times " also alluded to this emigration as— "a beneficent stream of the blood of the famous breed of cattle in the "world flowing steadily from our shores ... to level up the herds... in "climes far distant from our own." American-killed beef continues one of the staple articles of food consumed in the Metropolis. It is imported by six firms holding eleven shops in the Central Market; they have in addition a large number of agencies in the centres of population throughout the country, and are thus enabled to distribute their supplies without much assistance from other salesmen. Some of these firms are also doing more slaughtering than formerly, and by distributing the dressed carcasses to the trade direct from the Foreign Cattle Market, where they are killed, form the home producers' most formidable opponents, as it is almost impossible for any but an expert to distinguish the imported from the home-grown meat. Throughout the year Canadian cattle have been imported in varying numbers, and in all probability we shall receive in the near future regular consignments from this source, especially as the quality has been better than was the case last year; it is still, however, not up to the standard of the States cattle. 102 Improved pastoral conditions in Australia have done something to remedy the disastrous effects of the drought, but the number of carcasses placed on the market has not yet reached the normal level. Consignments from this quarter show a marked improvement in quality, and the beef in particular left little to be desired. Australia, which created the exportation of meat, continues the active competition with the New Zealand trade in lamb referred to in last year's Report, when some high-class shipments from Melbourne were noted. The Danish supply to the market, although not large, has certainly been of such a character as to indicate laxity of supervision on the part of the authorities abroad. Some years ago an arrangement was made with the Danish authorities for them to inspect and label all meat intended for export, but so much unsound meat was passed in this manner that your Medical Officer of Health made the matter a subject of a special Report to the Sanitary Committee, in which it was pointed out that unless the Danish label can be accepted as an absolute guarantee, there are grave objections to its use, inasmuch as it might furnish a ground of defence should proceedings be instituted against any person in this country dealing in diseased meat bearing an official guarantee as to soundness. The Committee adopted the suggestion contained in this Report, that the attention of the Danish Government be directed to the facts, and that the return of labels found on unsound meat as arranged should be discontinued.* Twelve months ago it appeared likely that there would be increased supplies of Russian pork. These expectations have not been fulfilled, while the imports of beef from that country have ceased altogether. The system of voluntary inspection by Government of meat intended for export from the Netherlands is spreading and is now in operation in the following places: Rotterdam, Hook of Holland, Flushing, (Vlissingen), Eindhoven, Harlingen, Oss, and Assen. On the 15th March another inspection service will come in operation at Nieuwerkerk a/d Yssel. About 80 per cent. of the pork exported from the Netherlands is submitted for the inspection by the Government experts, nearly the whole of which finds its way into the London City market, where the result is quite satisfactory. Of the marked carcasses seized by your officers, by far the greater part have been those of animals which have been insufficiently rested before slaughter, and which will always present difficulties of no mean order to the officer who examines them immediately after slaughter ; they appear then perfectly sound, but owing to the abnormal condition of the blood very rapid changes take place post-mortem, so that they appear at Smithfield in a state in which it would be impossible for your officers to allow them to pass into consumption. * Since the above was written the Danish Ministry have issued fresh instructions which, if strictly carried into effect, will meet the difficulty. 103 Such damage might easily be prevented if arrangements could be made for allowing these animals to remain longer at the port of export before slaughter, or even by slaughtering them at the place where they were bred and forwarding the carcasses with proper precautions by rail. Of the unmarked carcasses a considerable proportion are still found diseased and unfit for food, and it is much to be desired that the inspection be made compulsory in all meat intended for shipment. Until this is the case it seems inevitable that unsound animals, slaughtered where no skilled inspection is available, or shipped by persons knowing their condition, will continue to arrive. The matter is a very important one, and of great interest to the trade, inasmuch as no less than 73½ per cent. of the pork imported comes from Holland. No sheep were received from Servia during the year, and unless better methods of selection on the Continent and preservation in transit are adopted, it is undesirable that they should be sent here. The home-produced supplies continue to diminish, and we are more than ever dependent upon Colonial and foreign meat. On surveying the year's results, we find that the citizens have, on the whole, been well provided with meat, while the producer has realised good prices for good articles. The superabundance of second-class and imperfectly prepared meat has been the most notable feature, and this in spite of poor prices obtained for it. It is not surprising, therefore, that there is a lessened demand for the home-grown product, and the reason for the deterioration, as before mentioned, is probably in great part due to the large export to foreign countries of our finest breed of cattle. The several Cold-Air Stores and Wharves by the riverside have, until the year under review, been visited by the Meat Inspectors when occasion arose or when opportunity afforded, but the appointment of an Inspector for special duty at wharves and for riverside work has resulted in their more regular and systematic supervision, and the figures given on p. 119 show that the amount of unsound food—chiefly tinned goods—removed from these places during 1904 was considerably above the average for previous years. By arrangement with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, referred to in last year's Report, classes for instruction and examination of Naval Officers in meat inspection have been held from time to time throughout the year, and one Assistant Inspector of Victualling, seven Fleet Paymasters, five Staff Paymasters, eight Paymasters, and one Assistant Paymaster have been granted Certificates of competency. 104 SLAUGHTERHOUSES. There still remains an objectionable feature in the City. The remarks made by my predecessor apply with almost equal force to-day, viz.:— "With one or two exceptions, these are ill-adapted for the business, "and require the constant supervision of the Meat Inspectors to keep "them in anything like a wholesome condition." There were 14 of these places existing when those remarks were made; these have now, from varying causes, been reduced to eight in 1904, the right to slaughter having lapsed in one case since the last Report. No. 44, which was so much damaged during the demolition of some adjoining premises as to make it unsafe for killing bullocks in, is scheduled for coming down in the widening of Mansell Street, and it is to be hoped that, becoming thus a corner site, when the widening is effected, will render the site too valuable for such a business. REPORT BY ADMIRALTY COMMITTEE ON HUMANE SLAUGHTERING OF ANIMALS. In January, 1904, a Committee was appointed at the instance of the Board of Admiralty to consider the question of humane slaughtering of animals, and included representatives of the War Office, Board of Agriculture, City of London, and the London County Council. A large number of witnesses were examined, including some nominated by the Association of Master Butchers and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, besides practical butchers and certain private individuals who had made a particular study of the subject. Further information was obtained from Austria, Germany, Denmark, and Switzerland. The Committee reported on 1st July, 1904, and made several recommendations, the principal being that:— All animals, without exception, should be stunned or otherwise rendered unconscious before blood is drawn. Private slaughterhouses should be replaced by public abbatoirs. Slaughtermen and others employed in or about slaughterhouses should be licensed by the Local Authority. The Committee also gave careful consideration to the question of the best design for a slaughterhouse, and presented a set of recommendations based upon the design of a model slaughterhouse then being constructed by the Admiralty at Chatham Dockyard, of which they submitted a complete description with plans. 105 The Report gave details of what the Committee considered the most humane, expeditious, and practical methods of killing after stunning various animals used for food. The Committee, practically tested a number of appliances, such as masks and patent killers, and recommended their use in the case of quiet cattle or injured horses only, as their adjustment was found very difficult in the case of wild or restive animals. The Committee found that the poll-axe, when used by an expert is, on the whole, the most satisfactory method of slaughtering cattle. This view will be endorsed by all having a knowledge of the subject. A noticeable feature of the Report is the expression of opinion that the Jewish method of slaughtering must be condemned on grounds of humanity, and arrived at this conclusion on the ground that:— "(a) The Jewish system fails in the primary requirements of "rapidity, freedom from unnecessary pain, and instantaneous loss of "sensibility, and that it compares very unfavourably with the methods "of stunning as recommended by the Committee. "(b) The preliminary operations of ' casting' and of forcing the "animal's head into position for the cut, are difficult, painful, and "objectionable from a humanitarian standpoint. "(c) The subsequent operation of cutting the throat is at best an "uncertain method of producing immediate loss of sensibility, and "frequently causes great and unduly prolonged suffering to the animal. "(d) Until some method is devised and adopted for rendering the "animal unconscious previous to the ' casting' and throat-cutting "operations, the Jewish system of slaughtering cattle should not be "permitted in any establishment under Government control." In addition, the Committee submit some model Clauses, as under, dealing with methods of slaughter that could with advantage be universally adopted and strictly enforced by Local Authorities having power to make Bvedaws for regulating slaughterhouses:— (a) All animals (cattle, calves, sheep, lambs, and pigs), without exception, must be stunned, or otherwise rendered unconscious before blood is drawn. (b) Animals awaiting slaughter must be so placed that they cannot see into the slaughterhouse, and the doors of the latter must be kept closed whilst slaughtering is going on. 106 (c) The drainage of the slaughterhouse must be so arranged that no blood or other refuse can flow out within sight or smell of animals awaiting slaughter, and no such refuse shall be deposited in proximity to the waiting pens. (d) If more animals than one are being slaughtered in one slaughterhouse at the same time, they must not be within view of each other. (e) None but licensed men shall be employed in or about slaughterhouses. These suggestions are in ths main provided for in the Bye-laws for slaughterhouses in operation in the City. With regard to (a), although not consulted by the Departmental Committee, I strongly concur, and so advised the Admiralty Authorities, who had previously asked my views on this point. I also advise the adoption of (e), dealing with licensing the operators. I recommend, therefore, the adoption of these Clauses by adding them to our Bye-laws for regulating the conduct of the business of slaughtering. These are subject to confirmation by the Local Government Board. SEIZURE AND CONDEMNATION OF TUBERCULAR MEAT. In September last a circular letter was received from the Secretary to the Local Government Board, stating that he had been directed to state that the Board had had under consideration the Report of the Select Committee of the House of Commons in the Tuberculosis (Animals) Compensation Bill, 1904, in which reference is made— (a) To the variety of practice alleged to exist with regard to the amount of tubercular deposit, the existence of which in a carcass is held to justify total condemnation. (b) To complaints made by butchers as to the injury caused to them by their prosecution in open Court for having tuberculous meat upon their premises. On the advice of the City Solicitor and Medical Officer of Health, the Board were informed in reply thereto, with reference to (a) that your Meat Inspectors have copies of the Board's letters enclosing the recommendations of the Royal Commission, that they had been instructed by your Medical Officer of Health to comply strictly therewith in seizures of tuberculous meat, and that, as a matter of fact, such recommendations have been invariably followed. With reference to (b), the Board were informed the invariable rule is that, in every case, the evidence is carefully considered before any proceedings are taken, and no proceedings have ever been taken in cases where a butcher, 107 being in possession of tuberculous meat, has notified the fact as soon as he became aware of it, and that no complaints have ever been made to us as to any injury accruing from prosecution in such cases. As a matter of fact, practically the whole of the meat trade in the City is in the hands of the salesmen of the Market, upon whose premises the meat is deposited for the purpose of sale, and who, on becoming aware that the meat is unfit for food, immediately call attention to the fact. In such cases, if the evidence is sufficient to justify, action is taken against the consignor, who is clearly the guilty person. So far as the City was concerned, therefore, the circular letter of the Local Government Board does not in any way affect the action of the Corporation, as in every detail the recommendations are in accord with the routine action of its officers. That the trade is alive to the importance of the exercise of the greatest caution in conducting their business is shown by the advice given by the London Butchers and Pork Butchers' Trade Society. Traders having occasion to purchase offal were recommended immediately upon delivery of the same at their shops to take care it was strictly examined, and in the event of any portion being found otherwise than perfectly sound, to place it without a a moment's loss of time in the "receptacle for trade refuse." They have also made arrangements whereby their members can be represented by a scientific expert whenever a seizure is taken before a magistrate. Such a course will be of the greatest service to the Corporation in their endeavour to punish the dishonest and criminal trader without injury to legitimate business. UNSOUND IMPORTED FROZEN RABBITS. On the 1st June last information was received that a number of cases of Australian rabbits of doubtful quality had been discharged into lighters from the s.s. "Medic" for conveyance to wharves up the river. It was ascertained that some of these cases had been taken to the Central Markets, but that the greater portion of the damaged ones had been delivered at the Union Cold Air Stores beneath Cannon Street Station. Upon visiting this place it was found that a survey for damage was in progress on behalf of the Insurance Companies. Notice "not to deliver" was followed by an application on behalf of the Underwriters for permission to remove these rabbits to a country town for examination by the local authority. It being undesirable to entertain this proposal, the whole consignment, consisting of upwards of 80.000 rabbits was examined at the Stores. The work was commenced on the 10th June, not being completed until the 14th July, and resulted in the seizure of 10,322 rabbits. 108 SEIZURE OF IMMATURE KIDS DRESSED AS RABBITS. On the 28th March, 1904, a salesman in the Central Meat Market directed the attention of one of our Meat Inspectors to the contents of a box invoiced as " rabbits." These were at once submitted to your Medical Officer of Health, who found that, although they were dressed in the manner rabbits are usually prepared for market, they were unquestionably immature animals of another kind. A further examination of these was made by a member of the Royal Veterinary College, who pronounced them to be the carcasses of newlyborn kids. Although the sale of kids for rabbits was only a trade fraud, the fact remained that these animals had practically never lived, having been killed at birth for the sake of utilizing the mother's milk supply. The use of flesh of newly-born animals of any kind being a disgusting practice, and the meat in question being obviously improper for human food, the carcasses were destroyed and the circumstances carefully investigated. It was stated that the animals in question had come from the Continent, and it was subsequently ascertained through the Netherlands Minister that they were an experimental consignment from a small trader residing at Baarle-Nassau, who, when examined by an official veterinary surgeon, by instructions of the Director-General of Agriculture at the Hague, admitted that he had intended to send a hundred weekly as long as a sufficient number of newly-born kids could be had, but that as the first experiment had been a failure "he found he had at once enough of it, and would never try the same "thing again." DISEASED PIGS FROM A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. On the 11th January last your officer seized in the Central Meat Market eight pigs, seven of which were in a very wet and emaciated condition, and one badly spotted on the skin, and the glands on cutting were quite black. These pigs were part of a consignment of 35 pigs sent to a firm of salesmen by the authorities of one of the Royal Hospitals, and were accompanied by a certificate of removal to market from a Veterinary Inspector to the London County Council, who certified that ;he had seen the 35 pigs both alive and after slaughter. The Secretary of the Institution, in reply to enquiries, stated that the animals had been slaughtered in consequence of an outbreak of swine fever amongst them. 109 A letter was subsequently received from the Secretary expressing his Board's regret that no notice was given that the pigs in question were about to be dispatched to our market, and giving an assurance that in future, when sending any pigs to market under similar circumstances, we shall be at once notified. He further stated that the Board would require an explanation from the Veterinary Inspector as to how he sanctioned the removal of pigs to the City that were subsequently found unfit for food. In these circumstances it was not considered necessary to take further action. SUGGESTED ALTERATION OF THE LAW RELATING TO UNSOUND MEAT SEIZURES. Understanding that the President of the Local Government Board proposed to introduce a Public Health (Amendment) Act, the National Federation of Meat Traders suggested for the consideration of Mr. Long some material modification of the existing law relating to seizures of unsound meat. The Corporation of Glasgow took strong exception to these suggestions, as reported in the "Meat Trades Journal," and in a circular letter asked the Corporation for an expression of opinion thereon. The matter was referred to the City Solicitor and your Medical Officer of Health by the Sanitary Committee, and we had no hesitation in reporting that we entirely agreed with the view taken by the Glasgow Corporation. The proposed amendments were intended to apply to the Public Health Act of 1875, but in the event of their being accepted for that Act, they would also be made to apply to the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and thus affect the City. The following are the suggestions referred to, with our objections to the same, which were in due course remitted to the Glasgow authorities:— Suggestion No. 1.—"It is proposed to expunge the words: 'The "'proof that same was not exposed or deposited for any such purpose, "'or was intended for the food of man, resting with the party charged." The words in both Acts—1875 and 1891—are identical, and it must be obvious that such an amendment would almost entirely do away with the value of the Section. To the honest trader there can be but little, if any, difficulty in proving that the meat in any particular case is not intended for the food of man; whereas, if the onus were thrown upon the Authority, it might be an extremely difficult matter, especially in cases were there was deliberate intent. It must be assumed that when meat ordinarily used for 110 human food is dressed in the usual way, and sent into a public market or shop, it is intended for human food, and such presumption should stand until refuted by the trader. Suggestion No. 2.—"In the event of a seizure, the owner to have an "opportunity of submitting evidence on his behalf when application is "made for a condemnation order by the Magistrate." There is nothing in the Public Health Act to prevent the owner appearing and being heard as to condemnation, and, as a matter of fact, in the City he is always advised by telegram of the fact that such a seizure has been made. Suggestion No. 3.—"Magistrates granting condemnation order should "be disqualified from adjudicating at the hearing of the summons relating "thereon." With regard to this, one point is certain, and that is, that when cases are tried before the Magistrate who condemns the meat there is a great advantage in the saving of time, and in dealing fairly with the case, by reason of the Magistrate having actual personal knowledge of the facts. Suggestion No. 4.—The repeal of Section 47 (4), which provides that "where a person convicted of an offence under this Section "has been within twelve months previously convicted of an offence "under this Section, the Court may, if it thinks fit, and finds that "he knowingly and wilfully commits both such offences, order that "a notice of the facts be affixed in such form and manner, and for "such period not exceeding twenty-one days, as the Court may order, to "any premises occupied by that person, and that the person do pay "the cost of such affixing, and if any person obstruct the fixing of such "notice, or remove, deface or conceal the notice while affixed during the "said period, he shall for each offence be liable to a fine not exceeding "five pounds." It is' perfectly true that this would be a serious matter for any trader, but obviously this would only be made use of when the offence was a very serious one, and the issue of such order is entirely within the discretion of the Court. Suggestion No. 5 seeks to apply the provisions, Section 47 (8), of the Public Health Act, 1891, to the whole of the country. With this the Corporation is not concerned. Suggestion No. 6.—The exemption of a Manager from responsibility, "where it can be proved he had received specific and emphatic instruc"tions to comply with the requirements of the Public Health Act." There are grave objections to the transfer of liability. A trader must be responsible for the acts of his servants, and to allow loose words like "specific "and emphatic instructions to comply with the requirements of the Public 111 "Act" to remove the onus from the responsible person, would only open the door to fraud and the raising of endless objections. So far from it being desirable to relax any of the existing statutory provisions for safeguarding the public from the danger attaching to this class of offence, it has been made abundantly clear that the law requires strengthening in one essential point, as offenders even now can derive, in certain cases, a positive immunity from the consequences of their evil deeds. The following is a case in point. In December last a farmer owned a sheep that died in a field. A labourer who found it sent for the bailiff, and the latter cut its throat. The bailiff then handed it over to a local butcher, who dressed the carcass and sent it to the Central Markets, Smithfield, where it was seized, taken before a Magistrate, condemned as being unfit for food, and ordered to be destroyed. The butcher was subsequently summoned for being the person to whom the meat belonged to at the time it was deposited for the purpose of sale at the market. The above facts were proved in evidence, and the butcher himself even admitted he took all responsibility, but as he satisfied the Court that he derived no benefit from the transaction, and that the whole of the proceeds would have gone to the farmer's agent, the summons was dismissed on the ground that defendant was not liable as owner. In this instance the accused, probably for trade purposes, was willing to take responsibility, but the Magistrate could not place this to his disadvantage, and looked upon him merely as an agent. This is by no means a new question. In many cases the guilty person has escaped on account of the wording of the Section : "and the person to whom "the said belongs or did belong at the time of sale, or exposure for sale or "deposit for the purpose of sale, or of preparation for sale, or in whose "possession or on whose premises the same was found." / If the words, "and the person or persons, if any, under whose control the "same was" were added after the word "belong," it would make both persons liable, and the Court would be enabled to decide on the evidence as to how the responsibility should be apportioned. At present the owner escapes because he has no knowledge, and the butcher because he is not the owner.

Unfortunately there are no accurate means of arriving at the number of persons in the City during the day time MILK. It is satisfactory to note that the decrease in the number of cases of milk adulteration is maintained, as shown by the following figures:— Year 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. Number of Milk samples examined 392 599 517 452 Found genuine 209 519 457 417 Found adulterated 83 80 60 35 Percentage o£ adulteration 21.0 13.3 11.6 7.74 122 This decrease is not general throughout England and Wales, where, after falling from 21.1 to 10.6 in 24 years, it has shown a tendency to rise of recent years, thus:— 1900 10.8 per cent. 1901 11.2 „ „ 1902 11.6 „ „ It is too much to hope that milk adulteration will ever be entirely stamped out as the article lends itself so readily to sophistication. It therefore only remains for us to use every endeavour to reduce it to a minimum. That milk adulteration is mostly done deliberately by the wholesale dealer or retailer is shown by the results obtained by the examination of a number of samples collected at railway stations in November and December last, before delivery to the consignors, these, almost without exception, being found of excellent quality. At the request of the "Dairy Trades and Can Protection Society" arrangements were made in each case for their representative to be present when the sample was taken. The results of analysis appended show that the average of fat is 4.10 as compared with the average of 4 per cent. of the samples taken in 1902 and the Board of Agriculture standard of 3 per cent. With regard to milk supply, however favourably the City may compare with other places, it is certainly discreditable that 7.7 per cent., or 1 in every 13 samples purchased in the district last year, was either impoverished, adulterated, or both. It is fair to mention, however, that this figure would have been much lower but for one disturbing factor—the stranger within our gates, viz., the alien trader. This fact has been clearly established from a detailed examination of the returns, which disclosed that in the case of milk samples purchased in the City from foreigners last year, 11.1 per cent. or 1 in 9, were adulterated, against 6.1 per cent., or 1 in 16, taken at shops kept by natives, while in the case of all samples taken during the year the percentage of adulteration was 4.64, or 1 in 12, amongst foreigners, as compared with 8.4, or 1 in 21, of our own people. These facts are instructive as bearing on a question that is much exercising the public mind. So long as offenders are awarded light penalties, so long will adulteration flourish, because it will pay. As an illustration, it may be mentioned that in 164 convictions in England and Wales in 1902, the fine did not exceed 2s. 6d., 77 being of 1s. and under. Remove the profit while increasing the hazard of detection by frequent sampling and active enforcement of the Act, and offenders will be scarce. Speaking generally, the penalties imposed in this country are inadequate. We have it also, on the authority of the Local Government Board, that they have from time to time received complaints as to this from Local Authorities. 123 Analysis of Milk Consigned to City Dealers taken on Delivery in Railway Stations.

The accompanying figures are those for 1904 and the three preceding years:— Years 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. Number of Butter samples examined 238 299 368 442 Found genuine 224 292 367 429 Found adulterated 14 7 1 13 Percentage of adulteration 5.8 2.34 .27 2.94 It will be noted that butter adulteration, which had dropped from 5.8 in 1901 to .27 in 1903, increased in the following year to 2.94. This increase is due to the substitution of margarine for butter in 12 instances out of 101, where slices of bread and butter were purchased. These figures show a marked improvement over those of last year, when out of 71 such purchases 19, or 26.7 per cent., this fraud was detected, as against 11.8 per cent. in 1904. If these 12 cases are eliminated from the total samples of butter taken during the year, the percentage of adulterated butter was 0.29. BUTTER CONTROL IN THE NETHERLANDS. The Agricultural Department of the Ministry of Public Works, Trade and Industry of the Netherlands have been good enough to supply me with a Report giving full details concerning the production of batter, and the method of butter control in operation in that country. The number of butter factories in the Netherlands has of late years increased so much, and as a consequence the conditions have altered so greatly, that the Report has been issued in order to show what has been done to promote the development of this branch of agricultural chemistry. It further directs the attention of other countries to the fact that by the cooperation of the Netherlands Government and the persons interested, an attempt has been made to introduce a system of butter control. This will not only be a strong measure against adulteration in their butter trade, but also prove to us and other countries that the Netherlands intend doing everything tending to maintain the reputation of their principal products. SALE OF BUTTER BILL. In 1904 the Government again introduced a short Bill, the object of which was to stop a particular form of butter sophistication. In April, 1902, the Board of Agriculture, as empowered by Section 4 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, issued an Order limiting the permissible amount of water in butter to 16 per cent. In the Bill this restriction was made a statutory one, and also prohibited the addition of any substance whereby the amount of water in butter was increased. 125 The main purpose of the Bill was to stop the sale of "milk-blended" butter, as it was stated that many persons were deceived as to the true quality of the article sold under that name. The Bill also fixed the limit of water in Irish salt firkin butter at 20 per cent. until a date to be fixed by an Order in Council. The Bill was to have been construed as one with the Margarine Act, 1887, and to be operative from the 1st January of this year. Two or three other Bills on the same lines had been introduced by the Government in recent years, but none of them reached the final stage, and this one shared the fate of the others. DRUGS. In the course of the year, 52 drugs were sampled, of which 4, or 7.69 per cent., were reported against. This figure is too high, especially as this class of offence shows no signs of decreasing in the City, the figures for the three preceding years being 7.2 per cent. in 1901, 6.3 per cent. in 1902, 7.69 per cent. in 1903. In England and Wales, drug adulteration appears to be steadily diminishing, the percentage of adulteration for the years 1900, 1901 and 1902 being 15.4, 11.6 and 9.5 respectively. Bearing in mind the purpose for which drugs are used, their adulteration is particularly discreditable and dangerous practice. Of the 89 other articles examined, 5 were adulterated, viz., 1 each of mustard, cocoa, and margarine, and 2 of coffee. FOOD PRESERVATIVES. In July, 1899,* the Board of Agriculture appointed a Departmental Committee to inquire into the use of preservatives and colouring matters in the preservation and colouring of food. On the 16th January, 1901, the Committee issued a Report recommending the following :— "The addition of formaldehyde or formalin, or preparations thereof "in foods and drinks to be prohibited, and salicylic acid only allowed in " limited amount, and its presence declared. "For milk, all preservatives and colouring matters to be prohibited, and "their addition to be an offence under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. "In cream and butter the amount of preservative to be limited, and the "amount present to be notified by label in the case of cream. Vide p. 100, Medical Officer of Health's Annual Report, 1901. 126 "The use of copper salts in 'greening' preserved foods to be "prohibited. "Chemical preservatives of all kinds to be prohibited in the case of all "dietetic preparations intended for the use of invalids or infants. "That means be provided, either by the establishment of a separate "Court of Reference or by the imposition of more direct obligation on the "Local Government Board, to exercise supervision over the use of "preservatives and colouring matters in foods, and to prepare Schedules "of such as may be considered inimical to the public health." Although four years have elapsed since these recommendations were made by the Committee, nothing further has been done in the matter. On 27th September last, in a Report to the Sanitary Committee, I again referred to the subject, and expressed the opinion that the time had arrived when the recommendation of the Departmental Committee should be given a legal value by legislation following on the lines suggested by the Committee. The results have now been published of an elaborate series of experiments recently conducted in America to ascertain the action of borax and boracic acid in food on the human subject. The conclusion arrived at is that boric acid and equivalent amounts of borax in certain quantities should be restricted to these cases when the necessity for them is clearly manifest, and when it is demonstrable that other methods of food preservation are not applicable, and that in these cases it would also follow, apparently, as a matter of public information, and especially for the protection of the young, the sick, and the debilitated, that each article of food should be plainly labelled and branded in regard to the character and quantity of the preservative employed. With these facts now added to our former knowledge of the prejudicial effect such preservatives may under certain conditions exercise on the human being, it is greatly to be desired that legislation as to their use or restriction should be promoted at the earliest opportunity. THE LONDON COUNTY COUNCIL AND THE SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS. In February, 1904, the Parliamentary Committee were instructed to take the necessary steps with a view to the Council promoting, in the session of 1905, legislation to enable it, as the Authority dealing with the whole County, to secure at its own expense the analysis of samples of milk arriving at railway stations in London and subsequently distributed in the County, and also to enable the Council, as the Central Authority, to ensure that the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts should be administered on a sufficiently comprehensive scale in each sanitary district within the County. In due course these instructions were carried out, and in the London County Council (General Powers) Bill, 1905, clauses were inserted to give effect to these views. Clause 127 23 (1) of the Bill goes a good deal farther than the recommendation of the Committee. If it becomes law, it will invest the Medical Officer of the London County Council ex-officially with similar powers with regard to the collection and examination of samples of milk as are now possessed by a local Sanitary Authority. The acquisition of such powers is unnecessary. The London County Council propose that they shall practically become a controlling authority for administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act within the administrative County of London, which includes the City. At present the Local Government Board and the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries perform this duty under definite statutory powers, not only in London, but for the whole of England and Wales, and there is no reason to believe that the London County Council are better qualified to undertake the work than the existing authorities. Therefore the introduction of a third controlling body is obviously undesirable and superfluous.* What really is wanted with regard to the collection of samples of milk at Railway Stations is an amendment of the present Act so as to allow any Inspector under the Act to take samples at any place of any articles of food which he has reason to believe are consigned to tradesmen in the district for which he is appointed. This has been rendered necessary by a decision of the Lord Chief Justice at a Divisional Court on the 29th October, 1902, as the result of an appeal against the decision of a Magistrate at the Clerkenwell Police Court, that an Inspector under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts could not take samples on delivery outside his own district. In dismissing the appeal, the Lord Chief Justice made the following remarks:— "The Court came to the decision with reluctance, but they did not "consider that Section 3 of the Act of 1879 extended the jurisdiction of "the Inspectors so as to enable them to seize at the place of delivery, "unless such place of delivery was within the district for which they "were appointed." It is evident from these observations that the Lord Chief Justice was of opinion that legislation for this purpose was desirable. THE BUCKS COUNTY COUNCIL MILK SUPPLIES FOR THE CITY. In February, 1904, the Bucks County Council informed us that their General Purposes Committee had been instructed to enquire into and report to them "on the best means whereby the County Authority for the "administration of the Food and Drugs Act may co-operate with the *A Petition against this part of the Bill on the lines indicated was lodged on behalf of the Corporation on the 12th February, and the following amendments to the Bill were carried in the House of Commons on the 16th March. Part V., giving power to London County Council, referred to above, was struck out. Provision was also made for the sampling of milk in the County by Medical Officers of Health in places situated outside their own districts. 128 "authorities of the County and City of London, so as to secure the purity of "the milk sent from this County to London when delivered to the consumer." The matter was referred to me, and by my advice the Bucks County Council were informed that the suggested co-operation would be most valuable, and that probably the most useful way of effecting this would be for the Bucks Authority to:— 1. Advise the Corporation from time to time when they desire any particular samples of milk taken under the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act on delivery at the railway stations within the City, as this is obviously the only way in which the farmer can be protected ; and 2. When any milk sampled in the City (coming from Bucks) is found to be of an unsatisfactory character, for the Corporation to inform the Bucks County Council in order that they may have the opportunity of investigating the conditions under which it is produced. The limits of the jurisdiction of the Corporation as the Sanitary Authority for the City were pointed out, also that the London County Council are in no way concerned with the administration of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, either in the City or the Metropolis, and that within the Metropolis, excepting the City, these Acts are administered by the various Borough Councils. EVASION OF THE MARGARINE ACT. In July, 1904, I was informed by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries that they had received information that a good deal of "butter" sold for distribution was margarine put up in unbranded tins, the consumers being led to believe they were eating butter. It was stated that this practice was seriously prejudicing the English butter makers, as the substituted article was made on the Continent. Some difficulty having been experienced in tracing the merchants supplying the material, the assistance of the Corporation was invited. Special enquiries in likely quarters were at once set on foot, and although unsuccessful in actually finding any unbranded tins of the article in question, the Inspector detailed for the supervision of tinned food in the City secured manufacturers' samples of margarine packed in tins that were illegally branded. The law requires that every package containing margarine shall be durably branded in letters of a prescribed size. In this case the lettering was slightly under the Statutory limit; this was a comparatively minor point. Exception, however, had to be taken to the character of the branding which was so unstable that the lettering could be readily removed with a dampened cloth without leaving the slightest trace of any marking. The tin was also not 129 branded on the top with the word "margarine," as required by the Act. The firm selling this article was not registered, and large quantities of margarine passing through their hands in the City escaped registration altogether. The firm referred to raised the question as to whether these tins were "packages" within the meaning of the Act, as the case containing them was sufficiently marked, but in order to raise no unnecessary difficulty, agreed to comply with the requirements as to marking and durability of the lettering. The firm also rectified the omission in regard to registration, and duly registered the premises where the goods were handled. No further action was therefore necessary. IMPORTED DAIRY PRODUCTS. From the last report issued by the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries (Intelligence Division) it is shown that in 1903, 2,414 samples of imported articles of food were taken at the ports of entry into this country under Section 1 of the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, and analysed at the Government Laboratory. These included 1,997 samples of butter, 223 of cheese, 30 of fresh milk, 90 of condensed milk, 11 of sterilised milk, and 63 of cream. One sample of butter, four samples of condensed milk, and three samples of sterilised milk were reported against. In six of these cases legal proceedings were taken against the importers, which were successful in each case, convictions being obtained and fines imposed. It is curious to note that in one of the cases of condensed milk reported against, legal proceedings were waived on payment of a fine of £2, which was imposed under the Customs Consolidation Act. The number of samples of butter, cheese, milk and cream taken at ports of entry during 1903, and two preceding years, were as under:— Year. No. of samples. Found adulterated. Percentage of adulteration. 1901 2,142 11 0-51 per cent. 1902 2,216 2 0.09 „ 1903 2,414 8 0.33 „ These results are satisfactory, showing an annual average of only 0.31 per cent. of adulteration amongst imported dairy produce, and compares very favourably with the corresponding figures for England and Wales during the same period when the annual average adulteration of samples of milk, butter and cheese taken under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts was no less than 9.5 per cent. 130 131 SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACTS, 1875-1899.

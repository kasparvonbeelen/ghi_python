A.C.G.F.C., F.R.I.C., F.R.S.H Jan. 1958 1 a REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF LONDON FOR THE YEAR 1964 To the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commoners of the Corporation of London. Guildhall. e.c.2. Telephone: MONarch 3030. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to submit the following report on the work of my Department during the year 1964. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W.G. SWANN, Medical Officer of Health. Port and City of London. VITAL STATISTICS The resident population of the City according to the Registrar General's estimate at midyear 1964 was 4,580. The birth rate fell to 6.99 per 1,000 resident population and the death rate fell to 8.30 per 1,000 resident population as compared with 9.38 and 12.01 respectively in 1963. There were 32 live births, 3 of which were illegitimate. The total number of deaths for all ages was 38. 22 male and 16 female. There were 8 deaths due to cancer, 2 of which were cancer of the lung. 9 were due to coronary and other heart diseases and 7 were due to bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. 8 notifications of infectious disease were received, namely 2 of erysipelas, 2 of measles, 1 of paratyphoid, 1 of puerperal pyrexia, 2 of pulmonary tuberculous. PIGEON NUISANCE A firm of pigeon catchers is employed under contract by the City Corporation whose policy is not to exterminate all pigeons but to control their numbers to such proportions as will ensure that the pleasure they give to residents and visitors is not out-weighed by the nuisance they cause. During the year 3,800 pigeons were humanely trapped and killed as compared with 2,900 in 1963. HOUSING Housing Act, 1957 1. Number of houses which on inspection were considered to be unfit for human habitation:- None 2. Number of houses in which defects were remedied in consequence of informal action by the Local Authority or their Officers:- Ten 2 3. Number of representations made to the Local Authority with a view to (a) the serving of notices requiring the execution of works or (b) the making of demolition or closing orders:- (a) None (b) None 4. Number of notices served during the execution of works:- None 5. Number of houses which were rendered fit after service of formal notices:- None 6. Number of demolition or closing orders made:- None 7. Number of houses in respect of which an undertaking was accepted under subsection (4) of section 16 of the Housing Act, 1957:- None 8. Number of houses demolished:- None During the year 74 families were rehoused, leaving 537 families for whom accommodation was required at the end of December, 1964. At Avondale Square, Old Kent Road, S.E.I, the 2nd. Stage of the development, Harman Close, has been completed and comprises 48 flats for old people. A mid-day meal is provided in the dining-room six days a week and there are lounges available for the tenants to meet in and watch television, etc. The accommodation is under the supervision of a resident Matron. The preparation of plans, by Consultant Architects, for the first phase of replacement of the sub-standard houses to the North and West of the Metropolitan Cattle Market in Islington is now in the final stages and an early start on the building work is anticipated. At the Holloway Estate, Islington, preparatory work prior to commencement of the 2nd Stage of redevelopment has been completed and building should commence early in 1965. The model Old People's accommodation at Isleden House (31 flats) erected by the City Parochial Foundation and acquired by the Corporation, continues to be of interest to people in this country and from overseas who are concerned with the housing and welfare of the elderly. The ready availability of physical assistance, the provided mid-day meal with the other benefits at Isleden House is reflected in the well-being of the elderly residents and their longevity, and the infrequent use of the Sick Bay for their treatment. The Sick Bay continues to receive patients from St. Bartholomew's Hospital (a total of approximately 949 having been admitted since 1954), and elderly tenants from the Corporation's housing estates. The new Public Services Building, Barbican, is nearing completion and will provide a new Fire Station, office accommodation for the Civil Defence and Weights and Measures Departments and for certain sections of the Medical Officer's Department now at 20, Golden Lane, including a Coroner's Court. Diversion of the Metropolitan Railway between Moorgate and Aldersgate Stations is well advanced and work started on a further 675 flats bringing the total number under construction to 1,304. SEWERAGE AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL Sewerage and sewage disposal in the City of London are the responsibility of the City Engineer who has supplied the following information:- "The sewerage system in the City is comprised mainly of ovoid shaped brick sewers, the average internal dimensions being 4 feet high x 2 feet 8 inches wide. This size being adopted only to provide access for sewermen, as the normal dry weather flow depth of effluent is only about 9 inches at an average velocity of 2 to 3 feet per second. The Corporation sewers discharge into the Greater London Council intercepting sewers .which flow eastwards across the City at a much lower depth, to their Northern Disposal and Outfall Works at Beckton. The system of sewerage in the City is adequate, with ample margin for diverting flows from sewers during reconstruction and maintenance works." WATER SUPPLY In addition to the Metropolitan Water Board supply there are 123 artesian wells in use in the City, all are used for domestic or drinking purposes. Most of these wells were constructed between 1890 - 1930 and were bored to depths of between 300 and 650 feet into the hard grey chalk below 3 the impervious strata, yielding many thousands of gallons of clear, sparkling and bacteriologically pure water. Each of these wells is operated by the respective owners or occupiers of the premises in which they are housed and they provide an adequate supply of water for all purposes. When the 1945 - 1948 Water Acts came into force, a restriction was imposed on new borings as the water table was known to be falling, and since that time no new bore holes have been allowed in this area. Disused wells are sometimes brought into operation and improved by means of acidisation. This process enlarges the interstices in the chalk strata and allows the subterranean water freer access and is accompanied by some nuisance to the surrounding users. This was realised when a large City building contractor carried out the operation earlier in the year and a complaint was received from an adjoining premises about the colour and taste of the water,. Mr. Welldon and Mr. Camsey are the responsible inspectors for the regular sampling of these supplies and this is carried out by arrangement with the Ministry of Health's Bacteriological Laboratories at Colindale.. The samples are forwarded to the laboratories within a matter of hours in insulated containers and results are known within 4 to 5 days. During the year, 118 samples were taken, the water in each case was satisfactory. These samples were subject to a coliform examination and only two showed a verv minor plate count. This was not Bact. coli type 1 (Escherichia coli). As the later supplies were adequately chlorinated no further action was taken. The temperature of this water is remarkably constant averaging 57°F summer and winter. Of the total number some 121 are treated at source, thus providing an additional safeguard. Most supplies are chlorinated but some have adopted the ultra-violet method of sterilisation. Most wells are supplied with an electric submersible pump which is lowered into the bore and operated at a depth of about 400 ft. There are several sources of contamination which makes constant sampling necessary. These fall roughly into three classes 1. Improvement works to artesian supply. 2. Flooding of surface water into bore hole. 3. Improperly sealed off disused wells. The Metropolitan Water Board has supplied the following information:- "The water supplied to the City during 1964 was generally satisfactory both as to quality and quantity. The supply is derived from two sources in varying and unpredictable proportions viz:-, River Thames derived water from the Thames Valley filtrations stations above Teddington, and New River derived water from the Board's works at Stoke Newington. During the year 948 yards of service mains were laid but no trunk main. All new and repaired mains are chlorinated before being brought into use or restored to service, and samples of water from them are tested bacteriologically to ensure that the quality is satisfactory. The Board's waters are not plumbo-solvent.. Samples are collected daily at each stage of purification and in the distribution system. Immediate action is taken in respect of any form of contamination or variation in quality." 4 5 METROPOLITAN WATER HOARD — Water Examination Department BACTERIOLOGICAL RESULTS - YEARLY AVERAGES, 1964 CITY OF LONDON Source of Supply BEFORE TREATMENT AFTER TREATMENT Number of samples Agar plate count per ml.

City of London (Various Powers) Act, 1954 Clean Air Act, 1956. During the year 78 complaints of smoke nuisances were received. 69 of these were confirmed and emanated from the following sources:— 1. Oil-fired furnaces 51 (73.9%) 2. Solid Fuel Furnaces 4 ( 5.8%) 3. Domestic appliances 2 ( 2.9%) 4. Incinerators 4 ( 5.8%) 5. Bonfires 8 (11.6%) The main cause of nuisances from furnaces in (1) and (2) was improper maintenance of good equipment. In two cases it became necessary to consider the renewal of equipment during the coming summer season. In the case of one solid fuel furnace the owner abated the nuisance by acting upon the recommendation of the Free Sales and Technical Advisory Service of the National Coal Board. Nuisances from domestic appliances occured either when unsuitable fuel was used, or was not available. Nuisances caused by smoke and fly-ash emissions from two inefficient incinerators resulted in recommendations being made for their replacement.. Bonfire nuisances arose mainly from the disposal of low density building materials on demolition sites. A satisfactory measure of co-operation was maintained in all cases with the exception of one persistent offender who was proceeded against under the provisions of Section 16, Clean Air Act, 1956. An Order was made by the Court, prohibiting a recurrence of the nuisance. NOISE The control of noise was one of the foremost problems during the year. Complaints, from the occupiers of both residential and office accommodation most frequently centered upon demolition site clearance and building operations. Other complaints concerned commercial activity and noise from vehicles. Two types of development are prevalent in the City. Firstly the piecemeal demolition and erection of buildings adjacent to or between existing buildings and secondly the massive, or comprehensive, development schemes. The former gives rise to nuisance from the direct transmission of hammering, drilling and allied noises, possibly restricted to one occupier and often working schedules can be adjusted to offer sufficient relief. In the case of the latter, comprehensive development, the sheer weight of power production and heavier machinery.. In addition building operations within buildings can give rise to complpints from other occupiers within the building.. An effect of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act, 1963 has been an increase in the number of alterations to existing accommodation. On occasions such work has been commenced mid-week but interference with office working has been such that the alterations have been deferred until weekend involving costly overtime working. This is an instance where the development of less noisy techniques would be of benefit to employers. Mostly complaints have been tempered with an awareness that necessary work was being carried out, the City being no exception to the rule of change. Behind this tolerant mood is a quickness to report what is considered to be avoidable noise, such as mechanical defect or lack of lubrication and similar faults which can be expected to be remedied. On the 4th November, 1964 it was announced in the House of Commons as part of major policy that a standstill in new offices in London would be imposed. As a side effect of this policy it can be thought of in relation to the noise problem. Obviously of no immediate impact, but as current building projects are completed change in the pattern of noise from building is a matter for interesting conjecture. The Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir Alan Wilson, F.R.S. presented its final report on the problem of noise to Parliament in July, 1963. As was to be expected the findings and recommendations expressed in the report continued to fashion thought during 1964. Generally the need for research was stressed and relating to the building and demolition operations included reference to need for attention to design and operators of plant. Locally knowledge is being gained and complaints carefully investigated, but as stated the report was to Parliament and research by and report from a central authoritative body would be most beneficial towards achieving standards of control, clear guidance and uniformity of action. In its present state noise control compares with smoke control concepts of some years ago. Ultimately control will depend upon research and standards, accepted or imposed. It will be expensive but well worth while in improving the well being and comfort of a great many. 6 CRUDE SPIRIT DRINKERS In the 1963 annual report mention was made of the problems of vagrants and crude spirit drinkers. A further effort was made to find a solution to this problem at a meeting held at the Southwark Town Hall in February. Representatives were present from the London County Council, Corporation of London, Stepney Borough Council, Southwark Borough Council, Ministry of Health, Metropolitan Police, Maudsley Hospital, Salvation Army, Royal London Discharged Prisoners Aid Society, Camberwell Borough Council and Bermondsey Borough Council. The City of London was represented by:- Mr. H.M. Pinnell, O.B.E., Mr. H.T.Pike, Mr. W. Samuels, Mr. S. Sheppard, Dr. W.G. Swann and the Rev. D. Harbord (Rector of St. Botolph's, Aldgate). The effect of crude spirit drinkers on the public by creating nuisances and causing fear to women and children was mentioned but the main points of discussion were the dangers of crude spirit drinking and the ways of prevention, cure and rehabilitation. The main dangers of crude spirit drinking is the risk of damaging the optic nerve leading to nerve blindness, cirrhosis of the liver as well as insensitivity to cold and pain; and ultimate death through alcoholic poisoning. Unfortunately methylated spirits can be obtained quite easily and it appears that even surgical spirit can be obtained from some shops although reputable chemists would refuse to sell it for improper purposes. It would appear therefore that the only way of prevention would be by adding a denaturant to make the spirit even more unpalatable and to have legislation or controls which would make it more difficult to obtain surgical spirit for improper purposes. The curing of crude spirit drinkers is very difficult as very few, if any, would volunteer for treatment and it is important to remember that these addicts are also suffering from a mental disorder which makes them unable to form proper human relationships and this leads them into their degraded mode of life. Perhaps in their own interest provision should be made to compel them to accept treatment. Rehabilitation is the final stage and every assistance should be given to these individuals, after cure, to once again become useful members of society. Since the Churchyard of St. Botolph's-, Aldgate has been fenced, crude spirit drinking in public in the City has lessened. Nevertheless, the club which is run for "down and outs" at St. Botolph's Church by the Rector, Rev.D. Harbord still has about 30% crude spirit drinkers in its membership. The discussion at the meeting was full and detailed and the following resolution was passed:- (a) That, despite all the good work being undertaken by various voluntary organisations, the problem can only be dealt with by the new legislation, including provisions for the compulsory treatment of addicts and the payment of grants for the establishment of hostels, and to enable them to give assistance wherever necessary. (b) That there should be greater restrictions on the sale of surgical spirit and that consideration should be given by Parliament to providing for the addition of other denaturants to all forms of crude spirit to render it undrinkable. (c) That the work of voluntary organisations should be maintained with the aid of grants and that co-operation between all interested bodies should be encouraged. (d) That the Minister be informed of the views expressed by the various Representatives at the meeting, and requested to consider as a matter of urgency some form of legislation which:- (i) would strengthen existing powers and give a more stringent control over the sale of spirits of the nature under discussion; (ii) make adequate funds available to the appropriate authorities and voluntary bodies to enable more to be done to combat the existing situation so far as these unfortunate people are concerned by providing treatment and rehabilitation. (e) That in view of the action already taken by the London County Council in setting up a working party to consider the problem of crude spirit drinking, the decisions of this meeting be conveyed to that authority, and to the Metropolitan Boroughs' Standing Joint Committee, and that they be asked to support the recommendations of the meeting. COMMON LODGING HOUSES There is one mens'common lodging house in the City which is fully occupied nightly. These premises are situated at 116, Middlesex Street and are owned by the Salvation Army Authorities, the Deputy Keeper is Major H. Jones who resides at that address. The premises house some 420 men on 6 floors. There are canteen facilities available in the basement. 7 General repairs and decoration of the premises were carried out during the year and cleaning takes place daily. For this particular type of building the general hygiene and maintenance is good. The bedding is changed weekly and mattresses are of foam rubber. There is always a problem of insect infestation, namely phthirus pubis and pediculis humanus, in this type of establishment and men suffering from the effects of these insects are sent, with the appropriate instructions, to the City Corporation Cleansing Centre at Golden Lane. They are not allowed to take up residence until they produce an authenticated document from Mr.Lawrence our Mortuary Superintendent. Dr. Lascelles, the General Practitioner for the area, has kindly arranged to hold weekly surgeries within the hostel and this arrangement has considerably alleviated the problem of sickness. During the year a man suffering from a highly infectious form of tuberculosis was found to be residing at the hostel, and his removal, detention and maintenance at Banstead Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, was necessitated. Between the time that information reached this Department about this man and the hearing of his case at the Mayor's and City of London Court he was housed in a cubicle within the hostel and subsequent disinfection was carried out daily by the Corporation's cleansing staff. This arrangement was due to the Deputy Keeper's kind co-operation and every effort was made to isolate the man and his possessions within the hostel. Major Jones was later called to give evidence at the Court when the Order was made for the man's removal. EXHUMATION OF HUMAN REMAINS IN DISUSED CHURCHYARDS During the year three disused churchyards were cleared and the human remains found therein properly reinterred. Two of these were ancient churches, St. Pancras, Pancras Lane and St. Nicholas Aeons, Nicholas Lane, which were destroyed in the Great Fire of London 1666 and were not rebuilt. These exhumations were carried out in accordance with the requirements of the St. Pancras, Pancras Lane Churchyard Act, 1961, and the St. Nicholas Aeons, Churchyard Act, 1963. Details of interments can be found in the Parish records and are between 1538 and 1849. A total of 343 cases of human remains were properly reinterred at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, Surrey and 28 early morning visits were made by the Public Health Inspectors concerned in addition to numerous routine daily visits. Three individual notifications of human remains on building sites etc. were sent to the Coroner who was satisfied that these bones were of ancient origin. These were later reinterred on site. OFFICES, SHOPS AND RAILWAY PREMISES ACT, 1963. The Establishment for Public Health Inspectors was increased by three to meet the requirements of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act. Overcrowding. Section 5 of the Act provides that no room, to which the Act applies must be overcrowded as to cause risk of injury to the health of any of the persons working therein. In determining whether or not any suchroom is so overcrowded consideration must be given, not only to the number of persons working in the room, but also to the space taken up by the furniture, furnishing, machinery, plant equipment, appliances, etc. The number of persons habitually employed to work in the rooms at the same time must not be such that when the total floor area of the room is divided by the number of persons a figure of less than 40 sq.ft. per person is obtained. This gives a superficial floor area standard. A cubic capacity standard is obtained by dividing the total cubic capacity of the room by the number of persons employed in the room. If a figure of less than 400 cu.ft. is obtained the room is considered to be overcrowded. Where the ceiling height is below the optimum 10ft. the floor space for each person working is increased above the 40sq. ft. standard. The final paragraph of this Section provides that any room used at the passing of the Act on 31st July, 1963, as part of a premises covered by the Act, will not be subject to the space standards until three years after the Section has come into operation, i.e. 1st August, 1967.Thisrespite will enable employers to resolve their overcrowding problems before their premises are visited by the appropriate Inspector. Lighting The employer is required to make effective provision in every part of the premises in which 8 persons are working or passing, for securing and maintaining suitable and sufficient lighting by either natural or artificial means. No minimum standard is laid down in the Act, but the Minister has the power to make Regulations presenting such standards in all or any of the classes or premises to which the Act applies. The Minister has not yet made such Regulations, but guidance has been obtained from pamphlets issued by such bodies as the British Lighting Council, which has set out a Code covering all artificial interior lighting applications. This code recommends illumination levels, and specifies a limit on the amount of glare found to be acceptable. Prohibition of Heavy Work. Section 23 of the Act provides for the limitation by Regulations of the weight of loads carried by employees. Although the Minister of Labour has publicised advice on the subject, pointing out that the lifting ability of an individual depends on such factors as 'know-how', muscle tone, and general physical characteristics, general guidance is indicated based on the average build of experienced industrial workers. An accident in this category reported to the Department resulted in a hernia to the person concerned due to moving a heavy safe, and in this particular case, advice on the lines indicated above, was given to the employer concerned. Dangerous Machinery Certain machines likely to be used in the various premises covered by the Act might expose the operators to some danger, especially if the construction is such that moving parts are not adequately fenced. This problem was foreseen and the Act includes several sections intended to provide the the enforcing authority with a means of controlling the use of this type of machinery. The requirements briefly are:- (1) That all dangerous parts of machinery should be securely fenced and that the fencing must be of substantial construction, properly maintained and kept in position whilst the dangerous part is in motion or use (Section 17). The actual wording used is similar to that of Section 14 of the Factories Act 1961 and this has been interpreted by the Courts to mean that it is the employers duty to fence every machine to provide absolute security against all forseeable risks even if this renders the machine un-usable - although most machines can be fenced without making them un-usable. (2) That no person under 18 years may clean any machinery if in doing so they are exposed to risk of injury from a moving part of that machine or of any adjacent machinery. (Section 18). (3) That no person may work any machine specified by the Minister as being dangerous unless fully instructed as to possible dangers and precautions necessary and has been sufficiently trained in work at the machine or is under adequate supervision by an experienced person (Section 19). The Minister has now specified certain machines as being dangerous in the Prescribed Dangerous Machines Order, 1964, which came into operation on 1st August, 1964. The machines specified vary from Dough mixers to Garment pressers; from bacon slicing machines to hand-operated guillotine machines. Out of a total of 103 accidents notified up to the end of 1964 it is interesting to note that on only one occasion was dangerous machinery involved. On this occasion the operator of a letteraddressing machine suffered injury to the fingers due to what was considered to be inadequate guarding of the machine. The facts were reported to the officer appointed by the Minister under Section 57 of the Act, who took the matter up with the manufacturers of the machine in question. These manufacturers are now in the process of improving the design of the machine so as to comply with the requirements of the Act. The presence, in premises to which the Act applies of dangerous machines which come within the scope of the Prescribed Dangerous Machines Order 1964, is noted by the inspector at the time of the initial general inspection and if necessary, steps are taken to ensure that those which are inadequately fenced receive attention. First Aid. The first aid requirements can be divided into:- a. Provision of First Aid Boxes b. Setting-up of First Aid Rooms c. Presence of Qualified Staff. Where premises have less than 150 people employed it is only necessary for a first aid box to be provided in the charge of a responsible person who need not be qualified to render first aid. In these smaller premises so far inspected no difficulty has been found in obtaining the provision of an adequate number of boxes. Employers are accepting the view that a small injury promptly treated could avoid an absence from work. . 9 In larger offices where more than 150 people were employed it has been found that a number of the occupiers had already provided a first aid room before the passing of the Act The Act recognised that a properly equipped first aid room is probably the best method and to this end there is a provision to relieve the occupier from the obligation to maintain a number of separate first aid boxes with a person in charge of each one by means of an exemption certificate granted by the Local Authority. Many enquiries have been received and as a result of inspection and discussions many of the first aid rooms are being brought up to a recommended standard which will allow exemptions to be granted. In view of the probable need which will arise as these offices are inspected contact has been made with the British Red Cross Society who conduct classes at the Finsbury Barracks, City Road, E.C.I. Accidents Occupiers of Office premises are required by Section 48 to notify to the Local Authority accidents which cause a person to be absent from work for more than 3 days. The purpose of notification is to enable enforcing authorities to detect breaches of the Act and to advise occupiers on measures to prevent the recurrence of similar accidents. During the year it has been the practice to investigate every accident reported. The cause of these accidents has been found in the main to be due to carelessness on the part of the employee. A small number were due to unskilful use of machinery. Annual Return.

Loten, the Chief Inspector for the following report:- "The application of the Act to shop premises has been interesting and, in some respects, surprising. A cross section of premises, old and new; large and small; retail and wholesale, has been visited in the five months since the Act came into force. These inspections, in addition to representing the commencement of administration, were designed to provide information upon which broad standards could be set in respect of those provisions not covered by specific requirements in the Act itself or the Regulations which had been made. Ventilation is undoubtedly the requirement which has received the least attention in the past and which, with a few notable exceptions, receives scant or no attention in the design and equipping of the modern shop. Attempts are being made to prompt occupiers and shopfitters to examine their schemes in relation to their compliance with the Act, and thus prevent the completion of new lock-up shops, in particular, without having made suitable provision for compliance with the Act, pointing out that within the three solid walls and the plate glass frontage, 'effective and suitable provision shall be made for securing and maintaining, by the circulation of adequate supplies of fresh or artificially purified air, the ventilation". Whilst the Minister has power to prescribe by regulation a standard for ventilation no such regulation has yet been made, and, it is understood, none is contemplated. Once contact has been made the other aspects of the Act's provisions are examined to see that in these respects also the Act will be complied with. It is generally acknowledged that the minimum temperature requirement of 60.8°F. after the first hour is not excessive, but there are a number of instances where this is never achieved during the day. The need to provide thermometers is something which has caught most shopkeepers unprepared. In at least once instance compliance was achieved by a thermometer attached to a greetings card! The provision of some first aid equipment has been found to be more general than was anticipated, and to bring the existing stock up to the prescribed standard presents no difficulty. The problem will be to keep the first aid box properly stocked. An overall picture, from the result of carrying out 158 general inspections, can be seen from the following table of deficiencies discovered:- Retail Shops % Wholesale Shops & Warehouses % Temperature 8 3 Provision of thermometers 62 73 Inadequate ventilation 79 29 Cleanliness 12 29 No handrails to staircases, defective floor surfaces and obstructions 23 12 Cleanliness of sanitary conveniences male 37 44 female 20 23 Cleanliness of washing facilities — male 30 35 female 24 23 Provision of running hot water 30 21 Accommodation for clothing — hanging 24 3 drying 51 12 Provision of first aid equipment to the correct standard 77 69 The accidents reported all of which have been investigated, disclosed none of a serious nature but they showed how carelessness is the main contributing cause. Each general inspection has disclosed some points where the Act was not being complied with, in a few instances only minor things being required to be done. The result of each general inspection is made the subject of a report to the occupier in writing. It should be said that in the majority of cases the report is accepted in a reasonable and responsible way and action is initiated to remedy the defects which have been disclosed. It is too early to say how satisfactorily some questions will be resolved but from the further consultations which have taken place between specialists who have been brought in to advise and your inspectors there is every reasonfor anticipating that the occupiers are prepared to accept with good grace the new standards which the Act has imposed." WELFARE I am indebted to Mrs. Rita Cohen, M.B.E., Honorary Welfare Officer and Honorary Secretary of the City of London Old People's Welfare Association for the following report:- 12 "During the year ended 31st December, 1964 the City of London Old People's Welfare Association has continued to promote and assist the general good of all old people resident in the City of London, and those of pensionable age for the housing of whom the Corporation has accepted responsibility. The services provided through the City of London Old People's Welfare Association have included; Chiropody; Convalescent Holidays;Extra Domestic Assistance or Home Help; the supply on loan of medical equipment not obtainable through Statutory sources Supply of Television and Wireless Sets and Licences; Outings and Entertainments; Christmas Food Parcels: and a Personal Visiting Service. I set out a summary of the Service and the number of persons for whom they have been provided in 1964: Within the Square Mile Corporation Estates Convalescent Holidays Chiropody Treatment 60 persons p.a. 240 persons p.a. Gravel Lane Clinic 133 persons p.a. 970 persons p.a. Clinics at Dron House, Isleden House, Golden Lane, Ferndale Road Almshouses, Harman Close. Home Helps 41 persons per week 24 persons per week. Meals 5,541 meals p.a. Handicrafts, 90 persons attending 160 persons attending classes Singing and Dancing etc. classes each week. each week. Laundry 72 Laundry collections per annum. Television and Wireless 400 sets (Over a three-year period). Medical Equipment on 50 persons supplied with either loan wheelchair, commode, bedrest, etc. Outings 60 participants p.a. 240 participants p.a. Clothing (including 24 persons p.a. 16 persons p.a. Bedlinen). Food Parcels 240 recipients p.a. 1,560 recipients per annum. Hairdressing (Domiciliary 10 persons per month, visits). The provision of the foregoing Services has only been made possible by the generosity of the Corporation and by contributions and donations received from individuals and Organisations. In addition to the services provided (as listed) regular visits were made, and no effort was spared to ease the burden of the old people living in, or connected with, the City of London. The City of London Old People's Welfare Association is indeed indebted to those who by their efforts in so many ways have helped to make the old folk feel that life continues to hold much of interest for them and to feel that they are an essential part of the community." MASS RADIOGRAPHY The close liaison between the staffs of the Mass Miniature Radiography Unit and the Corporation has continued and I am grateful to Dr. W.D.R. Thompson, Medical Director of the Unit for the following report:— "Introduction For the greater part of the year under review the Unit operated at the Mass Radiography Centre, 20, Golden Lane, E.C.1, while for the remaining period it visited firms, etc. within its zone. Of particular interest was the visit to the General Post Office at Mount Pleasant when the Unit organised an all night session besides the normal morning and afternoon sessions. The response on this occasion was over double the attendance of previous occasions and was more than 82 per cent of the total staff. The Controller was highly appreciative of the service rendered by the Unit. The Unit also paid its biennial visit to the Finsbury Health Centre when it concentrated upon firms in the Borough and the Ludgate Circus area of the City of London. Over fourteen hundred firms were circulated out of which about four hundred participated in the Survey. Five cases with a significant tuberculous lesion and one carcinoma of the bronchus were discovered. 13 Unit's Results During 1964 the Unit examined 40,172 males and 24,189 females making a total of 64,361 which is below the average of the past few years. This arose through the uncertainty of the Unit's removal from 20, Golden Lane, E.C.1, to its new premises at the Public Services Building, Milton Court, Milton Street, E.C.2. which although anticipated on several occasions during 1964 did not materialise. Up to the end of 1964 the Unit has examined 537,439 males and 354,557 females - making a grand total of 891,996 since it commenced operations in May, 1950. Thirty-nine cases (26 males and 13 females) with a significant tuberculous lesion have been discovered which gives an overall rate of .606 per 1,000 examinees. The rate of significant cases for men was .647 and for women it was .537 per 1,000. This denotes an increase in the male incident, with a slight decrease in females. The highest incidence of tubercle was discovered in men within the 55-59 and 65 plus Age Groups, while groups between the ages of 25-54 show about a fifty per cent increase over last year's findings. The highest incidence for women was found in the 25-34 Age Group which is contrary to our normal findings. Of the thirty-nine cases of tubercle cited above twenty-eight (20 male and 8 female) were found while the Unit was operating at the Mass Radiography Centre, 20, Golden Lane, E.C.I. Twenty cases of carcinoma of the bronchus (19 male and 1 female) were discovered during the year which is a further increase on previous years. Of this total 12 male cases were found at the Golden Lane Centre. Doctor's Referrals Doctor's in our zone have been constantly advised of the services of the Unit. Doctor's referrals have produced an incident rate of 11.494 per 1,000 examinees which shows a further increase on previous years' results. Medical Procedure Abnormal cases are referred to the appropriate Chest Clinic through the examinee's own doctor. Clinics have recorded their sputum findings. Fourteen cases with a positive sputum have been reported of which nine were male and five female. Cases outside the purview of a Chest Clinic have been referred to St. Bartholomew's Hospital and the ready co-operation of Dr. N.C. Oswald and Dr. Graham Hayward is gratefully acknowledged as is the helpful assistance rendered by Dr. W.G. Swann and his staff." WELL-WOMEN'S CLINIC This clinic, set up with City Corporation funds in 1958, is now well established, and it is a source of justifiable satisfaction that, at a time when the Ministry of Health is recommending Local Health Authorities and Hospital Boards to take action, the Corporation of London and St. Bartholomew's Hospital can claim seven years of first class work in this important field. During the year, four hundred and forty women were seen (443 attendances) at the clinic, involving the examination of 886 smears. The examination of these smears is a highly skilled process, and as cytologists with the necessary skill are in very short supply, the examination of such a large number of smears is no small feat. Only one positive case and a few non-malignant conditions were found, but who can measure the worth of the reassurance and peace of mind afforded by the examination? It is of interest to note that research carried out by the Department of Chemical Pathology at St. Bartholomew's Hospital into the possibility of finding a chemical indicator of the presence of early cervical carcinoma has not yet been successful but the search goes on. Mammography of clinically normal patients is a method of discovering very early malignancy of the breast at a time when the chances of cure are at a maximum. This work, once again supported by City Funds, commenced at St. Bartholomew's Hospital on 31st August, 1964. Since then 140 patients, aged 40 years or more, have been examined, of which number 120 proved to be normal, 16 showed a variety of benign conditions and 4 showed conditions the nature of which was in doubt. One of them was found at operation to be benign, two are being kept under close 14 vation and the fourth was, unfortunately, lost sight of, no reply having been received from her general practitioner. The discovery of these early lesions would certainly justify the continuation of the scheme for a further period, when a larger number of results would be available, enabling a more statistically significant appraisal of the value of this type of examination to be made. RODENT CONTROL, 1964 In compliance with the provisions of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act, 1949, it is the duty of every Local Authority to take such steps as may be necessary to secure as far as may be practicable that its district is kept free from rats and mice and in particular:— (a) from time to time carry out such inspections as may be necessary for the purpose aforesaid. (b) to destroy rats and mice on land of which it is the occupier and otherwise to keep such land free from rats and mice. (c) to enforce the duties of owners and occupiers of land under Part 1 of this Act and to carry out such operations as are authorised by those provisions. (d) to keep such records and make such reports relating to functions under Part 1 of this Act as may be required by any directions given by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Implementing the aforementioned provisions of the Act comprised inspection on the block principle to ascertain the presence of rats and/or mice, treatment of properties found to be infested, recommendation and supervision of structural and incidental proofing, and periodical control measures for the destruction of rats in the City sewers. A total of 2,943 occupancies and properties were subject of inspection, comprising comprehensive re-development sites, riverside food wharves and warehouses, public and private catering establishments, offices, shops and factories. Altogether 556 complaints were received either by notification, or as the result of inspection and of this number 487 infestations were subject of control measures. In 69 instances no action other than advice was necessary. The total of 487 infestations treated comprised 5 major and 60 minor infestations of rats, and 2 major and 420 minor infestations of mice. Of the rat infestations, 5 major and 54 minor were common rat (Rattus Norvegicus) character, and the remainder, 6 minor infestations came under the Ship (Black) rat or Rattus Rattus classification. The major infestations of common rat, which occured on building sites were of sufficient numerical density as to be excluded from the minor scale (1-20) although low in the major category (21-200). Treatment of these infestations entailed 4,590 visits for operational purposes, and in the application of control measures 10,086, initial baiting sites were selected for both rats and mice. In the control of rats 5,058 pre-baits, and 452 poison baits were laid. These measures resulted in a minimum estimated kill of 507 rats, and of this number 304 bodies were recovered and removed from the sites of the operations. Others not included in this figure, were found on elimination of structural harbourage, or removal of incidental harbourage providing nesting facilities. Treatment of mice infestations entailed the application of 9,173 anti-coagulant poison oaits and 704 bodies were recovered. In 16 instances structural rat-proofing was carried out by owners or occupiers and in 2 cases defective drainage resulting in common rat infestation of surface properties were remedied. Incidental rat and mouse proofing in the nature of removal of harbourage provided by unnecessary and undisturbed accumulations has again received unremitting attention and the assistance and co-operation of the Director of Public Cleansing and his Inspectors in this respect has been invaluable. A major factor in the control of common rat is the periodical treatment of sewers, and during the year under review, four "Direct" poison treatments with Fluoroacetamide as the toxic agent 15 were applied. These were carried out in March, June, September and December, and an average of 390 sewer manholes, with the exception of the June control, were poison baited. The annual overall test results achieved by the previous treatments were applied prior to the June control when a total of 391 manholes were non-poison test baited. These non-poison baits, which in effect act as pre-baits, were left down for two days, and when on examination were found to be taken, replaced by poison bait. The overall result was 6.6% complete "takes". The comparable test result of the three previous years, 1961-1963, was 17.6%, 11.6% and 8.9% respectively. This system of sewer rat control instituted in the City in 1950, using Sodium Fluoroacetate, and followed by Fluoroacetamide, has in recent years been adopted by many local authorities throughout the country with extremely satisfactory results, as set out in Technical Circular, No.11 October, 1964, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. To summarize, the degree of rat infestation in the City is at the present time the lowest yet recorded, with emphasis on the vastly diminished status of Ship (Black) rat which a few years ago was the dominant infestation. MEAT AND FOOD INSPECTION - SMITHFIELD MARKET During the year 354,088 tons of meat, poultry etc., were delivered into Smithfield Market, a decrease of 31,249 tons compared with 1963. This was due to a shortage of imports from Argentina but the total of seizures increased by 9 tons. Consignments from Yugoslavia during the year increased but owing to the warm summer it resulted in an increase of seizures for bacterial spoilage by 105 tons. The new Meat Regulations which came into force on 1st October, 1963, require that all meat shall be examined, and if passed, be stamped by the local authority. It will be noted that of the 1,498 diseased items which were stamped by local authorities 41% of the stamp markings were illegible, mainly due to the stamps that were used being made from rubber and not metal, and out of a total of 2,029 diseased items 26% were not stamped by local authorities. The first consignment of chilled beef arrived in Snithfield Market from Poland on the 10th December, 1964. It is very much like the Yugoslavian beef and after overcoming the usual teething troubles it will be difficult to tell one from the other. FOOD HYGIENE (GENERAL) REGULATIONS, 1960 & 1962 Transport and Handling of Meat The following report has been received from Mr. D.R. Bernhardt the officer appointed to enforce the provisions of these Regulations in regard to transport and handling of meat. Stalls The stalls in Smithfield Market still maintain a good standard of cleanliness. Meat Transport The carrier company vans have been maintained to a good standard of cleanliness throughout the year, any defects being remedied immediately. Railway transport has improved and contact with the railway goods supervisor in the Smithfield Depot, when dirty meat has arrived, has enabled containers to be isolated, and any necessary repairs and cleansing has been carried out immediately on return to the railway cleansing department. Trucks The standard of cleanliness has been maintained. V ans The private butchers vans have been well maintained but vehicles used by foreign cafe and restaurant proprietors show a very poor standard of cleanliness. Thirty five warning letters have been sent for infringements of the regulations and one prosecution resulted in the proprietor being fined. 16 Smoking Sixty-one warning letters were sent during the year and three prosecutions were taken for smoking whilst handling food and all resulted in fines. Hats and Clothing The introduction of a new type of hat which gives better covering to the head is being tried out, and it is to be hoped that this will eventually supersede the old type. 139 warning letters were sent out in respect of carrying meat on shoulders whilst not wearing head covering, wearing dirty overalls whilst handling meat, and not wearing overalls whilst carrying meat. Of this total 67 were to foreign cafe or restaurant proprietors. 17 18 Table showing the amount of meat surrendered to or seized by Meat Inspectors in the City of London for DISEASED Condition, 1964 Country January lbs February lbs March lbs April lbs May lbs June lbs July lbs August lbs September lbs October lbs November lbs December lbs TOTAL 1964 lbs TOTAL 1963 lbs Argentine 165 244 75 128 158 292 27 236 356 274 206 2,161 2,176 Australia 10 5 5 31 8 59 89 Eire 222 32 191 44 157 414 261 1,321 48 France 203 203 Great Britain 16,436 14,713 12,068 18,393 12,172 11,818 13,726 10,004 16,932 16,050 14,883 14,641 171,836 178,224 New Zealand 9 4 4 4 30 32 58 54 243 579 23 15 1,055 455 Poland 20 S.Africa 31 34 65 54 S.

PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN MEAT The control of pests of crops and animals to safeguard the present level of food production depends on the use of toxic chemicals. During the last decade or two with the advances in synthetic organic chemistry many new chemicals have been discovered for crop protection just as many new drugs have been found for use in medical practice. The consequences of the increased use of toxic substances in agriculture were comprehensively studied by the Zuckerman Working Party which reported to Ministers in 1951 on risks to workers applying pesticides; in 1953 on pesticide residues in food, and in 1955 on risks to wildlife. A Research Study Group appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reported in 1961 upon Toxic Chemicals in Agriculture and Food Storage — The Sanders Report. They were satisfied that the scheme now called the Pesticides Safety Precaution Scheme was working well and providing the safeguards to the consumer it was intended to produce. This is a notification scheme whereby the manufacturer supplies to the Advisory Committee on Poisons Substances all the biological, chemical and toxicological data available. The Committee considers whether official clearance can be given to the new compound. Similarly the Veterinary Products Safety Precaution Scheme covers veterinary products sold directly to farmers. When a new pesticide is accepted it can then be officially approved for agricultural use and is added to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food list of recommended chemicals. Advice notes to farmers on the use are published, giving details of care to be exercised by operator, dosage per acre and timing of applications in relation to harvesting of the crop. The Sanders Committee found no evidence of chronic illness from the cumulative effect of traces of pesticides in food and concluded that pesticides consumed for a long time at levels at present agreed as acceptable would have no adverse effect on the health of the consumer. Specifically in relation to consumer hazard arising from meat, the available evidence suggested that poison hazard to farm stock lay almost entirely in metallic compounds, few of which are now used as pesticides. A more recent report, that of the Cook Committee published on 24th March, 1964 on persistent organochlorine pesticides is more cautious. This Committee found no evidence of any serious immediate hazard to human beings from the use of these pesticides or to wild-life apart from certain species of predatory birds. In particular it rejects the suggestion that these chemicals may be severe liver poisons or that they can be condemned as presenting a carcinogenic hazard to man. On the other hand it regards it as a matter of concern that traces of the chemicals are being found in so many situations and expresses the firm opinion that accumulative contamination of the environment by the more persistent organochlorine pesticides should be curtailed. The Committee recommends that a start should be made by restricting certain important uses of aldrin and dieldrin. After this season fertilisers containing aldrin will be withdrawn and products with aldrin and dieldrin for garden use will not be available.Sheep dips and sprays with these will be withdrawn after the 1965 season. Other uses of these chemicals and the use of D.D.T. should be reviewed again at the end of three years. The manufacturers of aldrin and dieldrin disagree strongly with the Committee's scientific conclusions since their own scientific researches suggest that, after reaching a harmless level of concentration the chemicals cease to have further cumulative effect. The National Farmers' Union have drawn attention to the considerable significance that restriction on their use can have for agriculture. Yet the Government have decided to give effect to the Committee's recommendations so the use of these chemicals will be curtailed through the voluntary schemes operated by the manufacturers and the Government. OBSERVATIONS ON CATERING ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE CITY In reporting upon the work of any one year it is always difficult to assess the improvements and progress which have been made during such a short period of time, and one can do no more than observe general trends. Unfortunately the trend during the last year appears to have been one of further deterioration in the standard of cleanliness maintained in many catering establishments in the City. Undoubtedly the catering industry, at least so far as the City is concerned, is passing through a very difficult period. Having regard to the heavy capital expenditure which has been incurred during recent years in the re-equipment and reconstruction of kitchens, it is particularly disappointing and disturbing to have to report again, as we did last year, that the improvement in the standard of equipment and construction has not been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in the standard of cleanliness. Probably the root cause of this failure to maintain clean conditions is the continuing shortage of staff and the impossibility in the present state of the labour market of caterers being able to secure suitable staff who are preDared to 22 accept the discipline necessary in food premises. Any representations made merely results in staff leaving forthwith and actual dismissal causes no hardships whatsoever, as alternative employment is always immediately available. It is not part of our work to defend the City Caterers, but unless one is aware and appreciative of their problems and difficulties it is impossible to suggest any measures which will be effective in securing compliance with statutory requirements. It is felt however that, until the catering industry is able to recruit staff of the right calibre with sufficient knowledge and appreciation of the importance of food hygiene, further progress in raising the standards of cleanliness is likely to be slow. Unfortunately, too often the only interest that many catering workers seem to have in their job is to get through a working day with the minimum of effort. As, come what may, meals must be provided punctually and quickly during the lunch break, cleanliness and hygiene is the aspect of their work which is the first to suffer during the stresses and strains which develop when lunches are prepared in understaffed restaurants. It is perhaps unfortunate for the catering industry that much of the essential work is monotonous and of a menial nature which will attract only the lowest grade of labour, and it is perhaps expecting too much to hope that staff who are often dirty should for a part of each day revolutionize their usual habits and approach to life. An indication of the difficulties with which one has to contend is illustrated by a recent experience when representations concerning the use of glasses that had not been washed, elicited the reply that "They had only been used for drinking water". Probably the predominant factor that makes it increasingly difficult for the City Caterer to overcome his many problems is the ever reducing profit margins to which he is working which is aggravated by the very high rent that is now being demanded for space in the City. During the year under review, for various reasons, there has been a reduction in the number of catering establishments, and those which have been closed down because of rebuilding projects have not been replaced by new restaurants. It is an inescapable fact that popular catering in the City is becoming less and less profitable, and unless City workers are prepared to pay a more realistic price for their mid-day meal they will eventually find themselves without the facilities to lunch which they now enjoy. A further frustration with which City Caterers must contend is the delays which occur in the execution of essential repairs and maintenance. There is such an abundance of profitable and easy work available in the City that contractors understandably are not eager to be troubled with such thankless commissions as the washing down and repainting of dirty kitchens. Whilst many written representations have been made during the year regarding a multitude of unsatisfactory conditions, it has not been felt necessary to institute legal proceedings in a single instance. The reason for the absence of legal action when so many contraventions of the food hygiene regulations have been observed is often queried. To those who advise quick and frequent recourse to the courts, we would point out that our objective is not to embark on a series of punitive expeditions, but to encourage and persuade caterers to co-operate in ensuring that food is at all times prepared under hygienic conditions. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that unless we are able to secure the willing co-operation of each individual caterer, it will never be possible to obtain that general improvement in standards, for which we have been striving for so many years. Whilst in some instances we have not been satisfied with the efforts being made by individual caterers, we have nevertheless invariably found that they have not ignored the criticisms it has been necessary to make from time to time. However, notwithstanding many disappointments and frustrations we have some successes to report. For instance, the new staff restaurants provided by some of the large commercial firms which have come into commission during the year provide excellent examples of what can be accomplished by a combination of good planning and sound construction. The result is a general arrangement which surpasses, with a few notable exceptions, anything achieved by the commercial caterers. The reconstructions and re-equipment carried out by some of the Banks and Insurance Companies have also been both noteworthy and commendable and one wonders at times if this privileged class of City workers appreciate the advantage they enjoy in having their mid-day meals prepared under such first class conditions, served in attractive, comfortable dining rooms at unrealistic cheap prices with which the ordinary caterer cannot, of course, hope to compete. One of the few exceptions previously mentioned includes a top grade restaurant which opened towards the end of the year where the elegance ofits public rooms and the standard of the facilities provided compare favourably with the very best in the west end. The kitchen arrangements and staff amenities are also of a correspondingly high class. It is indeed encouraging to be able to report that there are now available within the City, restaurants of the highest grade, offering 23 facilities comparable to the very best in London, serviced by kitchens which are probably unsurpassed in the excellence of their arrangements. During the year, as is customary, it has been our duty to accompany distinguished visitors from all parts of the world on an inspection of selected catering establishments in the City and it is to those restaurants and staff canteens referred to above where facilities and arrangements are beyond reproach that we usually take our guests. A little reflection will indicate that food hygiene does not consist of any magical formula but it is a constant daily struggle by all those who are engaged in the preparation and service of food. It is equally obvious that our work in endeavouring to supervise and improve conditions in catering premises throughout the City, is likewise a continuous struggle. No matter how enthusiastically or energetically this absorbing and vital aspect of the public health work is attacked, one can never be satisfied that the job has been done well enough. In conclusion we would say that whilst we can never afford to be satisfied with the results of our endeavours, in fairness to the City Caterers, it can be said that so far as the structural conditions of catering premises are concerned there has been a marked improvement upon the conditions which existed some years ago. There has also been a parallel improvement in the provision of essential amenities for the staff, and the conditions in which they work. EGYPTIAN POTATOES In August, a detention notice was served on the owners of 28,655 half bags of Egyptian potatoes which had been delivered to a City wharf per s.s. "CHRISTIANE SCHULTE". Many of these potatoes were rotten, sprouting and decomposed and it was arranged for the whole consignment to be sorted and a number of bags which were considered to be unsound were removed by the Corporation's Cleansing Department. Twelve days after the commencement of the sorting operation the owners requested that it be stopped as they were negotiating for the balance to be removed by another firm for pig feeding and composting. This, however, did not materialise. In view of the fact that these potatoes were causing a public health nuisance pressure was brought to bear on the owners to expedite arrangements for the disposal of the unsound portion. A few days later 250 tons of these potatoes were removed by barge to another area and destroyed under the supervision of the local Authority, the balance of 101 tons being delivered to the Corporation's Cleansing Department by the owners for destruction. As a consequence of these operations a complaint of fly nuisance arose at the Corporation's Cleansing Department. Arrangements were made for the staff of the disinfecting stations to deal with this matter and the nuisance was abated. These operations entailed numerous visits and telephone calls by Mr. Hudson, the Public Health Inspector and the whole matter was expedited by the co-operation of the staff of the wharf where the potatoes were landed. ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION There are established in the City of London four stations for the measurment of atmospheric pollution by the volumetric method; one at the City Mortuary which is attended by the Superintendent of the Mortuary and Disinfecting Station and three at Police Stations which are operated with the kind assistance of the City Police. Daily readings are taken at these stations and the information is collated at the central office in Guildhall where the smoke stains are 'read' on a photo-electric reflectometer and forms are completed and returns made to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research who collate similar information from all over the country. In the winter months when 'smog' is likely to occur, more frequent readings are required to get an accurate reading as to the extent of atmospheric pollution. The resident Superintendent of the City Mortuary and Disinfecting Station has frequently carried out four-hourly readings during such periods in the past and if the 'smog' is prolonged this duty could be quite onerous. With this in mind a semi-automatic sequential smoke and S02 sampling instrument was purchased. This machine can be set to take readings at either three or twenty-four hour intervals. During the winter fog warnings were received on three occasions and the machine was set to operate three hourly. On all these occasions the fog dispersed rapidly. 24 There are two deposit gauges in the City one on the roof of the Guildhall Office Block and one at the City Mortuary. The rainwater and deposited matter are collected during the month by means of a bowl which has been scientifically measured. On the 1st of the month it is taken to the Public Analyst for general analysis and the results are forwarded to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. A similar procedure is carried out in connection with lead peroxide method. The lead peroxide candles are exposed to the atmosphere for 1 month and then analysed by the Public Analyst The operators of the volumetric apparatus on the four City sites have again carried out observations and recordings in a most efficient manner. Changes in the siting of the instruments at Cloak Lane and the City Mortuary will have to be considered during 1965 when both these stations will be closed down due to redevelopment. The results of the atmospheric pollution investigations in the City are set out in the following tables. TABLE I — Deposit Gauge The rainwater collected was slightly less than the average for the past five years but there was an increase in the amount of soluble and insoluble deposits at both stations. TABLE II — Smoke concentrations by the volumetric method The concentration of smoke recorded during 1964 was below the average for the past five years. T ABLE III — Sulphur measurement by the volumetric and lead peroxide methods The concentration of sulphur recorded in 1964 was slightly higher than the average for the past five years.

Members of the Staff are encouraged to take voluntary advantage of the facilities provided thus for biennial X-ray of the chest. For obvious reasons no attempt is made to compile official statistics but it is known that a large percentage of Corporation employees take advantage of this opportunity for a regular "check-up". Medical Emergencies The arrangement which has been made with a firm of medical practitioners in the City to be on call for emergencies at Guildhall was not implemented during the year. This emergency service was instituted because the Medical Officer of Health from the nature of his duties may often be unavailable to answer urgent calls. Ophthalmic Optician Service Since the beginning of March, 1959, a firm of Ophthalmic Opticians have been operating an eye testing service for members of the staff. A weekly session is held in the Medical suite of the Guildhall Office Block. This service is operated under the National Health Service, and examinations are free although charges are made for the dispensing of prescriptions. During the year 98 members of the staff had their eyes tested, 23 of these had not previously had an eye test under the National Health Service, and 20 were found to have visual defects which required correction and were supplied with spectacles. 75 had been examined previously and were already using spectacles. Of these 66 needed further correction and appropriate lenses were fitted to existing frames or to new frames of the patient's choice. Medical Examinations During the year 549 persons were medically examined. The distribution by Departments and the reason for medical examinations are shown in Table 3. 329 persons were medically examined for admission to the Superannuation Scheme; 11 were rejected as unfit and 3 were deferred. The clinical conditions causing rejection are shown in Table 1. 55 persons were medically examined owing to prolonged absence on sick leave. At the time of examination, 21 were reported as fit for duty, 21 were reported unfit for duty, and 13 were reported unfit for further service. The clinical conditions causing unfitness are shown in Table 2. 95 persons who had reached retirement age were medically examined and all were reported as fit to continue in the Corporation's service for a further 12 months. 3 persons were medically examined for temporary appointments 4 were examined to verify the nature of a disability and 6 medical examinations were carried out in respect of employees at the Monument. In addition 46 persons were examined in connection with applications for exemption from parking fees. 10 candidates for teaching and canteen posts were X-rayed and all were reported as showing no abnormality of the lungs. 27 TABLE 1 CONDITIONS EXCLUDING CANDIDATES FROM THE SUPERANNUATION SCHEME Disease Males Females Bi-lateral Hydronephrosis 1 — Bronchitis and Asthma 1 — Bronchitis and Emphysema 1 — Cancer of Lung 1 — Diabetes 1 — Epilepsy 1 — Physically and Mentally Unfit 1 — Physically Unfit 1 — Post-encephalitic Brain Damage 1 — Severe Varicose Veins 1 — Ulcerative Colitis 1 — Totals 11 Nil TABLE 2 CONDITIONS LEADING TO PREMATURE RETIREMENT Disease Males Females Carcinoma of Bronchus 1 — Carcinoma of stomach 1 Cervical Spondylosis 3 — Cirrhosis of Liver and Diabetes 1 — Coronary Thrombosis and Hypertension 1 — Disseminated Sclerosis 1 — Facial Paralysis and Psychoneurosis 1 — Gross Anaemia 1 — Phlebitis and Oedema — 1 Psychoneurosis and Hypertension 1 — Severe Neurosis 1 — Totals 11 2 28 TABLE 3 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS DEPARTMENT ADMISSION TO SUPERANNUATION SCHEME REFERRED FOR EXCESSIVE SICK ABSENTEEISM OR RETIREMENT OVER 65 YEARS OF AGE Fit Unfit Deferred TOTAL Fit for Duty Still Unfit Unfit for further service TOTAL Fit Unfit TOTAL SPECIAL M F M F M F M F M F M F 2 F M F M F M F M F M F Architect 11 6 11 6 2 2 8 1 8 1 2 1 Billingsgate Market 2 2 1 1 Cemetery 15 3 15 3 3 3 1 Central Criminal Court 5 2 1 6 2 1 3 1 3 Chamberlain 15 4 15 4 1 1 Civil Defence 1 1 Cleansing 5 5 4 6 2 1 12 1 18 10 18 10 Comptroller & City Solicitor 5 4 5 4 1 1 1 1 Engineer 10 1 10 1 1 1 2 6 6 1 Epping Forest 5 1 5 1 2 2 5 5 Hallkeeper 1 1 2 8 2 8 2 Highgate Woods 1 1 2 Housing 6 10 1 7 10 2 1 2 1 3 1 Justice Room — Mansion House 2 2 2 2 Library 7 4 2 9 4 London Central Market 10 10 1 1 Mansion House 1 1 Mayor's & City of London Court 1 1 Medical Officer of Health 20 4 1 21 4 4 6 1 11 3 3 2 Metropolitan Cattle Market 3 1 3 7 2 2 Police 22 22 2 24 22 1 1 4 3 4 3 Printing and Stationery 4 1 4 1 Rating & Rate Accounts 2 4 2 4 45 1 Schools — Boys 10 10 2 1 1 1 — Free mens 5 4 2 7 4 — Girls 6 6 — Music & Drama 5 4 1 1 7 4 1 1 Shops Act Inspector 1 1 1 1 Spitalfields Market 6 1 6 1 1 1 Surveyor 18 9 1 19 9 5 1 1 Tower Bridge 10 1 11 4 2 1 7 2 2 3 Town Clerk 8 6 8 6 1 1 1 1 6 Weights & Measures 1 1 1 1 1 West Ham Park 2 2 2 2 1 215 99 11 — 3 — 229 99 21 — 21 — 11 2 53 2 66 29 — 66 29 68 3 29 STATISTICAL INFORMATION Area — 678 acres (including the Temple and foreshore).

Details of action taken under the Food and Drugs Act, 1955 both in respect of samples purchased by the Sampling Officer and articles of food which were the subject of c???plaint by members of the public, or of foodstuffs about which enquiries were made by importers, are summarised below. In no instance was it considered appropriate or necessary to institute legal proceedings. 36 So far as the samples purchased by the Sampling Officer were concerned, of 359 samples submitted to the Public Analyst an adverse report was received in respect of 15 samples or 4.17%. Four commodities were principally concerned, sausages, lard, tinned stewed steak and kipper fillets. Two samples of pork sausages were found to contain an excess of fat meat. Representations were made to the manufacturers who in each case promised to overhaul their arrangements for checking recipes and weights. All subsequent samples were found to be satisfactory. The difficulty with the samples of lard was that two separate antioxidants were used but only one was disclosed on the label. Representations were made to the Importers who agreed to prepare new labels which would comply with statutory requirements. Three samples of tinned stewed steak were found to contain too low a meat content. All outstanding stocks of these commodities were withdrawn from sale as soon as the attention of the retailers was drawn to the report of the Public Analyst Three samples of pre-packed kipper fillets contained artificial colouring matter, the presence of which was not disclosed on the label. Representations were made to each of the manufacturers concerned and a meeting between representatives of this department and the National Association of Frozen Food Procedures was arranged. The opinion of this Association was as follows:- "Colour is an integral part of the process of producing kippers and the colour need not, theref ore, be declared as an addition." The atten tion of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was drawn to this matter, so that the position could be clarified when new regulations were made. The various consultations which have taken place between food importers and officers of this Department have been very useful and have prevented the importation of foodstuffs which would inevitably have necessitated statutory action. The complaints made by members of the public concerning various articles of food enabled useful checks to be made regarding hoth the method of preparation and manufacture and the stanT dard of hygiene maintained. It must be appreciated, however, that these complaints must be investigated with the utmost care and cannot always be taken at their face value. For instance, the investigation of a complaint regarding watered milk at a school indicated that the cartons of milk in question had been tampered with by one of the children. ADMINISTF IATIVE ACTION REGARDING ADULTERATION OR OTHER IRREGULARITY Article Informal or Formal Sample Nature of adulteration or irregularity Action Apple Strudel Informal The fruit filling was mouldy and unfit for human consumption.

Chilli Powder Informal Contained Chilli Powder 75%; Farina (Corn and Bean) 25%; Permitted colouring matter — a small quantity. This was a check sample for a neighbouring Borough for colouring. Since this sample contained only permitted colouring, no further action was considered necessary in this direction.

Dried apricots may contain S02 in a proportion not exceeding 2000 ppm. Essence, Pear Informal According to the formula given, this article was made from synthetic materials and should be described as Flavourings, or as Synthetic or Artificial Essence, These were samples for proposed import. In view of the Public Analyst's findings, the proposal was abandoned. Essence, Almond Informal „ „ „ „ „ „ Essence, Vanilla Informal According to the formula this article contained coumarin Coumarin is believed to be toxic to animals having anticoagulant and suspected carcinogenic actions, and therefore should not be used in food. * Fragment of Glass from a portion of Cabbage.

The presence of the Butylated hydroxytoluene was disclosed on the label but not of Butylated hydroxy anisole, The matter was raised with the importers who agreed to amend the labels forthwith. *Luncheon Meat Sandwich Informal Contained embedded in the bread a small black object consisting of a fragment of scorched, grease saturated dough. Appropriate representations made to the caterer who sold the sandwich, As bread was obtained from two separate sources it was not possible to pursue the matter with the bakers. *Meat Pie Informal The meat filling of the pie was stale, mouldy and unfit for human consumption. Appropriate representations made to the caterer and manufacturer. *Milk Informal Contained:- Milk fat 0,10% Solids not fat 0,22% Water 99.68% corresponding to the presence of 97% of added water. This was a sample of milk from a school which had been the subject of a complaint. Extensive enjuiries finally revealed that this milk had been tampered with as a "schoolboy's prank". The matter was left in the hands of the school authorities. *Milk Bottle Empty Informal Adhering to the inside of the bottle were two pupae of small fly, Paraspiniphora, Bottle not thoroughly cleansed before use. Appropriate representations were made to the dairy concerned. Mini Chips Informal The label did not include a statement of ingredients as required by the Labelling of Food Order, Representations made direct to the firm of multiple retailers marketing this product and as a result, the manufacturers have undertaken to amend the labels. *Olives, Bottled Informal The brine in which the olives had been packed contained a substantial growth of yeast. Investigation showed that these olives had been in the possession of the purchaser for some time. *Opal Fruits Informal The sweets were dirty. This matter was referred to the local authority in whose area the factory is situated. Oriental Egg Roll Mix Informal Contained only 0.2 per cent of dried egg equivalent to 0.6 per cent of whole egg, calculated on the whole sample. The proportion of egg was too small to justify the description "Egg Roll Mix", These were specimens of prepacked articles which a City merchant proposed to import into this country. He was advised that the labelling was unsatisfactory. Oriental Egg Drop Soup Mix Informal Contained no egg. Description considered misleading. Sausages, Beef Preserved Informal Contained Sulphur dioxide, 670 parts per million. Sausages may contain Sulphur dioxide in a proportion not exceeding 450 parts per million. Written representation made to the retailer who was also the manufacturer, Subsequent samples were satisfactory. 39 Article Informal or Formal Sample Nature of adulteration or irregularity Action Sausages, Pork Informal Contained:- Fat 35% Fat-free meat 28% Total Meat 63% The proportion of fat in sausages should not exceed 50% of the total meat content.

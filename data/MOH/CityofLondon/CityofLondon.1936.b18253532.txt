( Do. do. ) Feb., 1928 Graham, Mrs. (Bath Attendant and Cleaner) June, 1927 annual report of the medical officer of health for the year 1936. To the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C. June, 1937. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, After 35 years' loyal and devoted service to the Corporation of London, your Medical Officer of Health, Dr. W. M. Willoughby, died on November 4th, 1936. It is, therefore, my sad duty to present to you the Annual Report of the work of his department for the year 1936. Dr. Willoughby was born at Plymouth, in 1875, and was educated at Plymouth College and University College, Bristol, whence he obtained a scholarship to Caius College, Cambridge. In 1897 he took Honours in the Natural Science Tripos and, having chosen medicine as a career, he continued his studies at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, graduated M.B., B.Ch. in 1900, preceding M.D. in 1904. After a short period in general practice, Dr. Willoughby was, in 1901, appointed a Boarding Medical Officer on the staff of the Corporation of London as Port Sanitary Authority. In 1914 he succeeded the late Dr. Hubert Williams as Medical Officer of Health of the Port of London, and in 1928, on the death of Dr. Howarth, Dr. Willoughby was appointed Medical Officer of Health of the City of London. During these many years of service Dr. Willoughby earned the respect and esteem, not only of the members of the Corporation and their staff in all departments, but also of his colleagues in the Public Health Service throughout the country. He had an acute mind and a sound scientific training, which enabled him to view the whole public health field in proper perspective. He was very critical of "stunts" and dissatisfied with mere palliatives, but when he found a line along which it appeared to him that real progress could be made, he followed it with enthusiasm. Though he was naturally of a retiring nature, his ability and his rigid honesty of purpose were widely recognised, so that what he said or wrote always commanded attention as having been carefully weighed by a mind which, trained and constantly directed to the pursuit of truth, never shirked the issue, even if it proved to be unpalatable or unpopular. As a colleague who worked in daily association with him for eight years and who witnessed the courage with which he endured suffering during what he knew to be the last weeks of his life, I shall ever regard it as a privilege to have enjoyed his friendship, to have been stimulated by his ideas, to have been amused by his wit and to have been charmed by his unfailing courtesy and kindness. During the year Mr. J. E. Oakley, the Keeper in charge of the City Mortuary since 1909, retired on pension, and the Corporation were pleased to promote the Disinfector, T. Steggles, to fill the vacancy thus caused. I should like to express my great appreciation of the valuable assistance which is rendered by St. Bartholomew's Hospital to the Corporation in connection with (1) Venereal Disease; (2) Tuberculosis; (3) Maternity and Child Welfare. b 2 8 STATISTICAL INFORMATION. Area.—The City of London (excluding The Temple) comprises an area of 661 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.032 square miles. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116-9 square miles. Density.--City of London Registration District, at night, 17.3 persons to an acre; City of London Registration District, during the day, *664.1 persons to an acre; Registration London, at night, 59.5 persons to an acre. Annual Rateable Value.—The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London (including the City) was £60,471,426, on April 6th, 1936, whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London was £8,140,423, or about one-seventh of the whole County. The annual sum receivable from a penny rate is £31,950. Population.—The undermentioned figures are extracted from the Report of the Registrar-General on the Census of England and Wales, 1921 :— Area, Statute Inhabited Houses. Population. Private Families. Acres. 1911. 1921. 1911. 1921. 1921. City of London (Not including the Temple) 661 2,784 2,398 19,657 13,709 3,174 These figures represent the population on the nights of the 3rd April, 1911, and the 19th June, 1921. The following table shows the progressive decline which has taken place since 1861 in the number of inhabitants who reside within the City boundaries, and the progressive increase in the number of workers who are daily employed in the City :— Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population. 1861 112,063 — 1866 — 170,133 1871 75,983 — 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 – 1911 19,657 364,061 1921 13,709 436,721 (Imperial — Census.) 1931 10,808 There is only one registration district in the City. The estimated population of the City, for the year 1936, is 9,100. The day Census taken in 1911 showed that the day population was 364,061 persons, and also that 1,077,155 persons and 94,095 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the count was taken. Births.—During the year 1936, 417 live births were registered in the City, 385 of which, however, did not belong thereto. To the remaining 32 must be added the births of 36 children born to citizens temporarily residing outside the City boundary. The number of births, therefore, on which the rate should be calculated is 68. There were three still births. The annual birth-rate was 7.5 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 7.3 per 1,000. In the Metropolis the birth-rate in 1936 was 13.6 per 1,000. ♦This figure refers only to persons " actively engaged in the City during the daytime," and is based upon the Imperial Census taken in June, 1921. 9 Mortality.—During the year under review, 546 deaths were registered in the District, including 501 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. Deducting these latter, 45 deaths remain, to which must be added those of 59 persons who died in outside districts, where they were registered; the total, therefore, on which the City death-rate is calculated is 104. See table, p. 10, for details. The death-rate for 1936 was 11.4 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 11.0), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 125. Deaths from Violence.—Of the City deaths, 67 per cent. were caused by injuries or violence, as compared with 3.9 in 1934 and 9.7 in 1935. This is 0.2 below the average for the previous five years.

Infantile Mortality.—The deaths of children under one year of age were at the rate of 147 per 1,000 births, as against 66 for the whole of London. 10 CAUSES OF, AND AGES AT, DEATH DURING THE YEAR 1936.

Vaccination.—Of the 398 births notified to the Vaccination Officer during 1935, 110 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of 1936, 18 had died before the age for vaccination and 1 was reported as insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 0 cases, and 173 had removed into other districts. One case was pending. There were 94 instances of conscientious objection, and two cases were pending. The Public Vaccinator performed 11 re-vaccinations during the year, and in addition to the 110 successful vaccinations referred to above, 5 adult persons were vaccinated for the first time.

Four hundred and thirty-one notifications of births, including three still births, made in accordance with the requirements of the Notification of Births Act, were received. Of these, 68 only referred to City births, and the balance were transferred to the appropriate authorities. There were three still births. Sixty-eight initial visits were made as a consequence of these notifications, and 1,665 subsequent visits in connection with infant welfare and ante-natal work. No visit was necessary in connection with a case which came within the scope of the Children Act, 1908, or in respect of a nurse child. Supplies of milk (2,397 galls.) and 348 lbs. of dried milk, at cost price or free, according to circumstances have been provided, according to the practice which has been in operation for some years Cod Liver Oil is also given if its administration appears to be desirable. No home help was necessary during 1936. There were no notifications of verminous school children under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. No visit was made in connection with infant life protection and three in connection with cases of Ophthalmia. The lying-in accommodation provided by the City Corporation at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Act, 1929, was utilized in connection with only one birth during 1936. THE CITY OF LONDON WELFARE CENTRE, HELD AT ST. BARTHOLOMEW'S HOSPITAL. The City of London Infant Welfare Centre continued actively during 1936. There were 100 sessions held of the Welfare Centre, four special sessions for the immunisation of children against diphtheria, and two for Schick tests. One thousand six hundred and sixty-five home visits were paid by the Health Visitors. It will be seen that, with an annual birth registration of about 68, this activity effectively covers the babies and young children living in the City and provides a very satisfactory health service. During this year the immunisation of children against diphtheria has continued. Altogether, 20 have been immunised in 1936, which may be counted a fairly satisfactory figure. Forty-six children have now been immunised. It has proved necessary to hold extra sessions for purposes of immunisation and for Schick testing; the technique cannot be satisfactorily carried out and the cases properly supervised at the regular sessions without causing much waiting and delay for the mothers normally attending. There has been an increase in the number of attendances at the Infant Welfare Centre, during 1936, of 462. Visits increased by 140 and an extra 23 mothers commenced attending the Welfare Centre. Dr. Charles F. Harris, who is in charge of the Corporation Clinic held at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, has kindly prepared the following brief report on the working of the Clinic during 1936. The City of London Infant Welfare Centre progressed successfully during 1936. There are no great changes in the organisation to report. Dr. Franklin continued to act as Medical Officer to the Clinic and the Health Visitors were Miss Backhouse and Miss Cook. The energy and enthusiasm of these workers has contributed very largely to the efficiency of the Clinic during the year. There were 2,327 attendances at the Clinic during the year, about two-thirds of these being of infants over the age of one year. Schick testing was carried out and forty more infants were immunised against diphtheria. The Hospital has been exercised to provide as good accommodation for the Welfare Centre as is possible. The present accommodation, while not very bad, is not ideal. The Hospital has found it difficult at present to suggest an alternative place within the boundaries of the Hospital where the Clinic may be held, but it is intended to improve the accommodation as soon as this can be done. The value of the association of the Centre with the Hospital may be illustrated by two points. Of the 10 infants who died in the City during the year, four had been admitted 13 to St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Two of the remaining six were premature babies less than three days old, one was in another hospital, one refused admission, and two were found dead in public places. A more positive benefit, perhaps, is shown by the fact that the Lady Almoner of the Hospital was able to arrange for the convalescence of eight of the children attending the Welfare Centre and five mothers. The following is a tabulated statement of the work carried out by the Health Visiting Staff in the above connection :— MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE, 1936. Birth Notifications received, 68. Infant Welfare Centre. 100 Sessions :— (There were also 6 Sessions for Diphtheria Immunisation and Schick testing.) Under 1 year 819 1 Total 2,244 attendances.

Reports for schools 0 Scabies 0 Puerperal Pyrexia 1 MATERNAL MORTALITY. The enquiries into maternal deaths, which the Ministry of Health has required to be conducted, have not called for any particular organisation in my Department. With a small City resident population, few deaths in this category are reported. Where such cases do occur, investigations are conducted by me. No case was reported during 1936. It may be of interest to note that, from 1900 to 1936 inclusive, only 17 maternal deaths have occurred amongst City residents. PROVISION OF DENTURES FOR MOTHERS AND EXPECTANT MOTHERS. During 1935 it was felt that the Maternity and Child Welfare activities of the Corporation were somewhat stultified by the fact that some of the City mothers in urgent need of dental treatment were not in the position to meet the cost, and the Public Health Committee decided to make free provision in such cases as the Medical Officer in charge thought necessary and where the financial conditions justified it. Some contribution is obtained when possible. Two mothers were supplied with dentures in 1936. PROVISION OF MILK FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN. The Milk Act, 1934, authorised a scheme for the provision of milk for school children and has as its object the increase in the demand for milk in schools by lowering the price to scholars who are young children and young persons attending schools or courses for unemployed boys or girls recognised for grant by the Board of Education. The special price to these consumers is ½d. per J pint and the milk is supplied in ½-pint bottles. Free milk is also provided in cases where children are unable to pay and where necessity is certified by the Education Authority's Medical Officer. A scheme for the detailed and administrative control has been put into operation and, so far as London is concerned, it has been agreed that milk supplied under the scheme shall be pasteurised milk and comply with the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923. c 14 Seventeen samples for bacteriological examination have been taken by your officers of these milks as delivered to the various schools in the City where the scheme is in operation. In two cases these were found to exceed the bacterial count limit. Subsequent samples were found to be satisfactory. At the same time, 12 samples were taken for chemical analysis, and these proved to be genuine. I understand that the scheme has met with an encouraging reception. The scheme follows the good results of controlled experiments in schools, which indicate that children on milk are better in health, brighter in mind and grow faster than comparable children having no milk. It has also been shown that milk, if acting only as an additional nutriment, has an advantage over other experimental nutriment, and one would expect that the general effect of the scheme will be improvement in the well-being of those on whose behalf the scheme has been introduced. POST-GRADUATE NURSING COURSE. With the approval of the Public Health Committee, the Tuberculosis Sister and Health Visitor and the Assistant Health Visitor attended a special post-graduate course organised by the College of Nursing during the early part of the summer. These courses are particularly valuable to officers in the public health nursing service, as it enables them to keep in touch with modern developments in their profession. CHILDREN UNDER SCHOOL AGE. In May, 1936, the Ministry of Health issued a circular letter to Maternity and Child Welfare Authorities suggesting reconsideration of the arrangements made for the supervision of the health of children not in attendance at school. Although the Minister was convinced that, in general, these arrangements were satisfactory, he was concerned that, in some areas, insufficient attention was given to the health of children between 18 months and 5 years. It appeared that more than 16 per cent, of the children entering schools are found to require treatment for some disease or defect. It is clear that, in many cases, these conditions could have been prevented from developing, or quickly cured, if adequate supervision of the health of the child had been exercised throughout pre-school years. The Public Health Committee carefully considered the arrangements made in connection with their Child Welfare activities, and were of the opinion that the needs of City children up to 5 years of age were well met by the arrangements already made for the supervision of their health. In such a small area as the City, with two whole-time Health Visitors and the advantage of the housing of the Infant Welfare Clinic in such a great hospital as St. Bartholomew's, where the whole of the services of that Hospital are available to any child or parent, the problem of supervision of the health of the children in question is a comparatively simple one. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Seventy cases of infectious disease were notified or reported during the year 1936. An examination is made of the sanitary condition of the premises where the cases occurred and a summary of defects found by the District Inspector is given on page 60. In consequence of the absence of small-pox in London, the obligation to notify chickenpox ceased on the 18th day of March, 1936. In the following tables will be found particulars relating to cases of infectious disease, and information as to the removal of patients to hospitals. 15 STATISTICS OF NOTIFICATIONS AND REMOVALS TO HOSPITAL.

No case of Small-pox occurred during the year in persons resident or employed in the City. DISTRIBUTION OF DIPHTHERIA ANTI-TOXIN AND ANTI-INFLUENZA VACCINE. Provision was made some years ago for the distribution of Diphtheria anti-toxin free of charge to medical practitioners who apply for it. Only one application was received during 1936. Similar provision is made in regard to anti-Influenza vaccine, but no application was received during the year. PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1925. It has not been necessary during the year to take any action in regard to the abovementioned Regulations, which provide for the exercise of some control over persons suffering from Tuberculous affections and engaged in certain occupations associated with the milk trade. PROVISION OF INSULIN. Under the powers provided by Section 227 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, the Corporation have, at the request of the authorities of the University College Hospital, supplied, at regular intervals, insulin to one patient resident in the City and in attendance at that hospital. This is the first patient, so far as I am aware, in regard to whom such powers have been put into operation in the City. NURSING PROVISIONS. MEASLES, ENCEPHALITIS LETHARGICA, CEREBRO-SPINAL FEVER AND INFLUENZA. No application has been received during 1936 in connection with the scheme which has been approved in connection with the provision of nursing accommodation for the above-mentioned affections. An expenditure of £25 per annum in connection with complicated cases of measles, encephalitis lethargica and cerebro-spinal fever, and of £30 per annum on provision of medical assistance and nursing attendance in necessitous cases of influenza, has been approved by the Corporation. EXAMINATION OF PATHOGENIC BACTERIA. Arrangements have been made for free examination, at the request of medical practitioners, of specimens for pathogenic bacteria in cases of suspected infectious disease occurring amongst patients residing in the City. City practitioners have been informed of these facilities, and the result is communicated to them immediately it has been ascertained. During the year the following specimens were dealt with, and it will be seen that positive results were obtained in 14 per cent. of these cases. Specimens. Disease Suspected. Result. Positive. Negative. 10 Sputa Tuberculosis 4 6 25 Swabbings from Throats Diphtheria 1 24 In this connection, I regret to have to report that Dr. R. C. Canti, who held the appointment of Bacteriologist and Pathologist for some years, died on the 7th January. The Corporation have appointed Dr. L. P. Garrod, who is in charge of the bacteriological department at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, to succeed Dr. Canti. THE NOMENCLATURE OF DIPHTHERITIC INFECTIONS. At the request of the London County Council, a report of a Departmental Committee of that body on Nomenclature of Diphtheritic Infections was distributed to medical practitioners within the City. The report is one of considerable value, and the views expressed therein and the advice given will have been greatly appreciated. 18 VENEREAL DISEASES. The Special Centre for the Treatment of Venereal Diseases, which, in accordance with the powers under the Public Health (Venereal Diseases) Regulations, 1916, the City Corporation established at 20/21, Golden Lane—previously occupied as a shelter, and specially altered to meet the requirements—was transferred to St. Bartholomew's Hospital on the 17th February, 1930. This step was deemed expedient for economic and other reasons, and it is satisfactory to note that the number of persons availing themselves of the opportunity afforded has since that date shown steady average increase, the total number of new cases in the year being 1,060. The following is a brief summary of the work carried out during 1936. At the beginning of the year 436 males and 192 females were registered on the books as being under treatment or observation, which compares with 534 males and 192 females at the beginning of the previous year. Of these patients, 278 males and 171 females were under treatment for syphilis, 154 males and 11 females for gonorrhoea, and 4 male and no females for soft chancre. No males and 10 females were under treatment for conditions other than venereal disease. New patients admitted totalled 1,069, as compared with 927 in the previous year, the total attendances were 31,565. Unfortunately, 261 cases discharged themselves before completion of treatment, and 100, although completing treatment, failed to submit themselves to final test. Forty-six males and 11 females were transferred to other centres after treatment, whilst 502 males and 122 females were discharged after completion of treatment and observation. There were 8 in-patients. The total number of attendances is made up as follows:— Syphilis. Soft Chancre. Gonorrhoea. Non-Venereal Conditions. Total Attendances. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. 13,381 6,723 53 - 9,858 903 480 167 23,772 7,793 In the laboratories associated with the Centre, 11,256 specimens were examined, 30 for the detection of spirochetes, 1,188 for gonococci, 9,536 examinations for the Wassermann or Serum test, and 502 for other examinations. The following tabulation indicates the number of patients coming under treatment for the first time from the Counties stated, and also the examinations which were made for the detection of Spirochetes, of Gonococci, and for the Wassermann or Serum test in respect of these patients:- No. of patients treated.

Patients non-resident in the City. (a) Who work in the City. On diagnosis, these patients are informed that they can be treated and advised at the Dispensary or transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. (b) Who do not work in the City. On diagnosis, these patients are usually transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. The total number of cases so transferred was 131. Total Attendances:— Residents 305 Non-Residents 768 1,073 In view of the fact that the cases in the last stages of the disease are extremely infectious, especially in crowded houses, the Corporation have made arrangements to pay for the maintenance of selected City cases at St. Columba's Hospital, Swiss Cottage, and at St. Joseph's Hospice, Hackney. One case was admitted in 1936 to the latter institution. D 22 During past years a certain amount of difficulty has arisen in connection with the residential treatment of cases who were residing at the place at which they were employed, when diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis. In order to meet this, the Corporation have made an arrangement with the Brompton Hospital whereby urgent cases can be admitted within 48 hours under Dr. Young's personal care, under a Certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. Four cases have been admitted under this scheme during the year. Artificial Pneumothorax.—Artificial pneumothorax treatment has been used again during the year. Artificial pneumothorax refills were done on 30 occasions for City and 233 occasions for non-City patients, in connection with the Dispensary. The Tuberculosis Sister and Nurse.—As an adjunct to the work at the Tuberculosis Clinic, the outside work of the Tuberculosis Sister and Nurse has been continued on the same lines as former years. Sixty-two homes have been visited, and 169 visits made in connection with after-care and following up, and four in connection with City deaths. General.—The following information is supplied in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health:— (i.) The Tuberculosis Dispensary is at St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the Tuberculosis Officer is Dr. F. H. Young, O.B.E.; one Tuberculosis Sister and one Tuberculosis Nurse are engaged in the work. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for insured and uninsured persons by the London County Council. (ii.) Patients are referred to the Tuberculosis Dispensary from doctors, hospitals, school clinics and other institutions, with all of which there is close co-operation. The services of the Staff and all the resources of St. Bartholomew's Hospital are available for diagnosis and treatment. Many patients are referred to departments of the Hospital for these purposes. (iii.) The Tuberculosis Officer is in constant consultation and communication with general practitioners, so that there is close co-operation between them and the Dispensary. He reminds them when reports are due on insured patients under domiciliary treatment and provides them with copies of the form with names and addresses inserted. (iv.) When the diagnosis is in doubt and the patient is under the care of a practitioner, arrangements are made with him for re-examination ; in other cases arrangements are made with the patient, but should he fail to attend, either the Tuberculous Sister calls upon him or he is reminded of the appointment in writing. (v.) The Tuberculosis Officer explains to the patients the importance of the examination of home contacts, and in addition to the necessary visits of the Sanitary Inspectors, the Tuberculosis Sister visits the homes of City residents periodically for the same purpose, and arranges for the attendance of the contacts at the Dispensary at times convenient to them. The supervision of these contacts and the re-examination of suspects among them is secured by the home visits periodically made by the Sister or Nurse. (vi.) Considerable use is made of X-rays from the point of view of diagnosis and decision as to method of treatment to be recommended. The usual methods of treatment have been continued in the Dispensary. Tuberculin has been used in a few cases. In addition, 2 City and 15 non-City cases of pulmonary tuberculosis attended for the continuation of their treatment by artificial pneumothorax and inductions of the treatment have been performed in several cases in the wards of the Hospital, and the operations of thoracoplasty and phrenic evulsion have been performed. (vii.) Experience shows that when the disease is active, residence in an institution more quickly and certainly brings about arrest than when the treatment is attempted at home on sanatorium lines, and that the lessons learnt in the sanatorium are sometimes put into practice by the patient on his return home to his permanent advantage. (viii.) Dental treatment is provided by the Dental Department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the Corporation defrays the whole or part of the cost of artificial dentures for necessitous cases. (Two patients were so provided during 1936.) (ix.) Nursing in their own homes of patients resident in the City is one of the duties of the Tuberculosis Sister, but this year no visits in this connection were necessary. Milk has been provided for necessitous persons requiring extra nourishment and in this connection the sum of about £26 has been expended. (x.) Patients suffering from Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis receive advice and treatment from the Surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, to whom they are referred from the Dispensary. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for as in pulmonary cases. The Corporation supplies surgical apparatus free of cost for necessitous residents in the City. 23 (xi.) The arrangements for "care" and "after-care" are carried out by a subcommittee of the Public Health Committee, on which two ladies are co-opted as members, † It receives detailed reports on all cases of Tuberculosis occurring among City residents, (xii.) No local arrangements exist for providing employment for patients. (xiii.) No opportunity has arisen for the use of a shelter, but arrangements would be made for any suitable case if a site were available. (xiv.) No special points have been noted as to the incidence of Tuberculosis ; the records do not show that the disease is specially prevalent among any class of workers in the City. (xv.) The usual method for preventing the spread of infection is adopted, and pocket sputum flasks are provided free of cost. (xvi.) The principal difficulty encountered occurs on the discharge of a patient from a sanatorium with the disease quiescent. The home environment to which he returns is often unsatisfactory ; suitable occupation near his home may be practically unobtainable, even when remuneration is not the main consideration, and the very considerable benefit gained is in some cases soon lost and the treatment in the sanatorium largely wasted. (xvii.) Difficulties also arise with regard to advanced cases. These are usually very infectious and do not care to go to the Infirmary. This has been largely remedied by the arrangement made by the Corporation already referred to. For some time past the Tuberculosis Officer has been dissatisfied with the method in use in dealing with adult " contacts " of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, and a new scheme has been used. The method previously used has been to examine each contact fully with X-rays at the time when the original case was discovered ; if no evidence of tuberculous disease was discovered, the contact was seen periodically as long as contact was maintained with the original case and for two years after this had ceased. The objection to this system was mainly psychological; either the contact attended regularly and worried about the possibility of contracting tuberculous disease, or failed to attend after the first time owing to carelessness or fear that something would be discovered. In addition, there is a considerable change of population in and out of the City, and contacts who left the City were completely unprotected. Probably, owing to the fact that they had been examined and told originally that there was no evidence of tuberculosis, they were likely to be more negligent about symptoms than they normally would be. The number of people who subsequently develop pulmonary tuberculosis as a result of contact during adult life, provided they show no evidence of heavy tuberculous infection when they are X-rayed, is very small, and it seemed possible that a considerable amount of psychological damage was being done by the system in operation. The new system is to examine each contact case thoroughly at the time when the original case is discovered. If no evidence of tuberculous disease or heavy tuberculous infection is discovered, they are informed of this and given a pamphlet telling them that there is no need to worry unless they develop any of the common symptoms which occur as a result of the onset of tuberculosis, and advising them of the course to take if symptoms do develop. The pamphlet which is given to them is shown in Appendix E. The method of dealing with non-adult contacts has not been changed, as most of the considerations noted above do not apply. Of course, this alteration of method does not mean that any abatement has been allowed in the hygienic measure which are applied to infectious cases. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY. TRAINING OF HEALTH VISITORS. The Corporation have placed at the disposal of the College of Nursing the facilities available at their Tuberculosis Dispensary, in order that that body can give to their health visitor students a short course of practical experience in tuberculosis work, as undertaken by a tuberculosis nurse. Appreciation has been expressed on every occasion when advantage has been taken of these opportunities, although during 1936 the facilities were not used. ARTIFICIAL PNEUMOTHORAX TREATMENT. At the request of the Authorities of one of the Home Counties, artificial pneumothorax has been administered to one of the patients under their control, and an appropriate fee charged. † The present lady members of the Committee are Miss Crosby, M.B.E., and Lady Smith, J P.

The number of smoke observations made was 480. During the year 27 complaints of smoke nuisance or annoyance from chimneys were dealt with. A number of these were of a temporary character and did not recur. A critical examination of the air in the City was commenced in the year 1914, in conjunction with the Committee for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, appointed by the International Exhibition and Conference in London, 1912. A rain gauge is mounted upon the roof of one of the Corporation's buildings in Golden Lane, and the rain-water from a known area of surface is collected monthly. This rain-water, containing the soot, grit, and dust washed from the air, has been submitted for examination to the Public Analyst and the results tabulated. For comparison, the results obtained from similar observations made at the Meteorological Office, South Kensington, on the west, and Victoria Park, on the east of the rain gauge at Golden Lane, are shown in the attached table. The table also shows the rainfall for the months of January to December of the year 1936, and the amounts found of insoluble matter, tar, soot, and dust, also the soluble matter, together with the sulphates, ammonia and chlorine in the volume collected. The results as given by the Public Analyst have been re-calculated into metric tons per square kilometre during each month. SUMMARY OF MONTHLY OBSERVATIONS AND REPORTS DURING THE YEAR 1936.

The Congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute, at Southport, from 6th to 11th July; the Congress of the Royal Institute of Public Health, at Edinburgh, from 26th to 30th May; the Congress of the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, in London, from 16th to 18th July; the Congress of the National Veterinary Medical Association of Great Britain and Ireland, at Scarborough, from 14th to 18th September; and the Congress of the National Smoke Abatement Society, in London, from 14th to 17th October, were all attended by representatives of the City Corporation, and again provided ample evidence of the value of these assemblies. SANITARY INSPECTORS' ASSOCIATION—CONFERENCE. The Conference of the Sanitary Inspectors' Association was held at Harrogate, from the 31st August to 5th September, and one of the Officers of my Department, Mr. W. R. McGrath, was permitted by the Public Health Committee to attend. He reports a record attendance of councillors and member delegates, and also the presence of representatives of the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Royal Sanitary Institute and Sanitary Inspectors' Examination Joint Board, the Royal Sanitary Institute and the Society of Medical Officers of Health, and other kindred organisations. The discussions resulting from the papers delivered demonstrate that the interchange of views of the members of local authorities and their officers serve a very useful purpose, and the permission of the Public Health Committee to attend was very much appreciated. CREMATION. The following summary of cremations carried out at the end of 1936 at all the crematoria in Great Britain since 1885, when the first crematorium was established at Woking, clearly indicates a steady increase in cremation as a means of disposal of the dead. With only two exceptions, each of the several crematoria in the country has shown a percentage increase on the cremations which took place in 1935, in eight such increase being higher than 25 per cent. The average increase is 17.42 per cent., as compared with 1935, the actual numbers being 9,614 during 1935 and 11,289 during 1936. Another significant factor is the establishment of three new crematoria during the year. Cremations at the Corporation Crematorium, at Ilford, reached the record number of 295. The purview of the late Medical Officer of Health, Dr. W. M. Willoughby, of the disposal of the dead was expressed at the Congress of the Royal Sanitary Institute, which was held at Southport, in the following terms:— DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD. The neighbourhood of Normanton Gorse, in Wiltshire, repeatedly enchains my fancy and induces a sense of veneration. And this not only through its Stonehenge, a recorder of the procession of the equinoxes and thus of its own approximate date, but because of the clustering or scattered bowl disc and bell barrows, with here and there a long barrow, confirming the date of the circle and demanding speculation on one of the lovable occupations of mankind—the provision for disposal of his dead. The breaking of neolithic and early bronze barrows seems curiously to raise no qualms, rather speculation—a healthy speculation based on fact otherwise unattained. It is not the golden pin-work on the haft of the bronze dagger or the hand-made, not turned, jar of badly-baked clay which here takes our attention; but rather the fact that the behaviour of these neolithic and early bronze ancients towards the remains of their honoured and loved are brought into comparison with our own English ways. In this barrow is found a skeleton, once a body inhumed, in that a rude yet ornamented jar contains ashes—burial and cremation side by side in place and time. Ditsworthy Warren, near Plymhead, on Dartmoor, is similarly venerable but more speculative. Rows of once upright stones lead from menhirs to cairns of granite blocks, the cairns rifled long since, and in the neighbourhood of these a large circle of stones. Little is known of these relics. I mention them because, in comparing the stone cairns with the barrows of Normanton, we come across the limitations of their makers—for these, stone is available and compelling, for the mounds on chalk, chalk rubble alone is at hand. Wonderful that these puny efforts still remain unlevelled thousands of years after they were thrown up. But look at a field a few years after allotment holders have lost 27 their prime enthusiasm. Fifteen or 30 years later, it would take a motor tractor and thorough ploughing more than once over to restore the evenness of the meadow and, without this aid, a hundred years more will still see its furrows, bumps and weeds. The mounds of rubble and cairns of granite in out-of-the-way Normanton and Ditsworthy have grown into their setting of beauty and interest; but allotments gone out of cultivation are to be seen studded over this England now ours, but which will revert to generations born and unborn as our legacy. In our modern cemeteries and churchyards the surface is not only unlevel, it is packed with shaped stones, few of intrinsic beauty, most of stereotyped design and devoid of artistic merit. The result as to the distance, middle distance or close perspective, is that of an ugly scar on the landscape ; the description, "perfectly dreadful," is mild. I would ask you to look critically at them and question yourselves whether this is in reality our honour to the dead and whether it bears any relation to worthy remembrance of them among the living. So far, the surface; now, and as shortly as possible, a deeper insight into this bounden duty of honouring. St. Paul has familiarised us with a seven-word picture of a process of disintegration of the body which has no relation to that obtaining in England. " Perfectly dreadful" is an apt description of this, but the actuality at present in England is as much more so, as it is more protracted. I am not going to describe it. It neither bears inspection nor does it leave room for argument; it is no honour to the dead and now is less to the living. How up to the present could such things have been, and with quiet acquiescence? Just this— there was no alternative to the one ugly fashion. This is the full and correct answer. Kites there were not, the pyre insufficient, the worm unthinkable : thus the unseen and unminded evil. Why in the present does it exist? Fashion swings on, the out of sight is out of mind as regards the unpleasant physics and chemistry of the subject, and the alternative is not yet in full working order ; the crematoria are insufficient in number and their location not generally at hand. The subject as regards large towns must be pressed at once, because there is an alternative, it can now be stated, in terms, that cemeteries are ugly, unworthy centres of massive and protracted putrefaction brought on the one hand up to the doors of dwelling houses, or on the other engulfed by them. In early bronze times there are to be found, at Normanton, more cremations than earth burials; in Dorset county the proportion is greater still; in Cornwall the pyre was almost universal. In Cornwall's comparative hives of industry the knowledge which permitted the process of smelting copper from the dross may have influenced this purity of method. We, in more crowded times and expanded knowledge, cannot afford to neglect the application of the perfected cleanness in disposal knowledge has brought us. 28 CREMATIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. 52 YEARS—1885-1936.

.... But in 1884 appeared the well-known judgement of Mr. Justice Stephen, whch in the case of a child's " body having been burned by its father contrary to the order of the coroner, determined cremation to be a legal act. provided no nui.ance be caused thereby to others "—Extract from speech made by the late Mr Henry Thompson at the opening of " Golder's Greeen Crematorium 22nd, November 1902. Vide "Transactions of Vremations Society of england, 1903." P.21 29 NUISANCE CAUSED BY PLANT, MACHINERY, ETC. The promotion of legislation to extend to nuisances occasioned by noise in the Administrative County of London, the provisions relating to nuisances in the Public Health Code for London, was under consideration by the Public Health Committee of the City Corporation during the year. From the medical aspect, there is no doubt that night noise, especially in proximity to dormitories, can constitute a gross deprivation of a fundamental necessity for sound health in those dwelling within range—namely, unbroken sleep. On the other hand, adaptability of the body to noisy conditions is also a fact, and this doubtless accounts for the acquiescence of people in the vicinity, because they have come to regard the avoidable as unavoidable. I have felt that the noise of a factory could be eliminated without excessive burden on industry, but appreciate that, without the law insisting upon it, there would be no considerable advance in the direction of noise elimination. I think, however, that the definition of the word "noise" would require careful thought if any ultimate legislation was not to impose undue burden on industry, but this is a detail not difficult to overcome.

The improvement reported last year has been maintained, but there is still a number of persons who evade the Regulations. Those butchers and small restaurateurs who visit the market at irregular intervals are particularly difficult to supervise. The market carriers know the Regulations and the advantage of maintaining their vehicles in a fit and proper condition. The market porters, generally, also carry out the Regulations, although a number, particularly the pitchers, appear to object to the wearing of a washable head-covering. Private cars are still used for the conveyance of meat, but many of these have been fitted with an adjustable boxed inner lining, which is easily detached and cleansed, thus avoiding the serious contamination which must occur unless very special precautions are taken in the use of these vehicles for this purpose. During the year 1936 no prosecutions were taken, but 612 contraventions of the Regulations have been recorded, all of a minor character, and cautionary letters have been forwarded where necessary. The standard of cleanliness with regard to the butchers' shops is generally good. The depots used as distribution centres by multiple restaurants are the subject of constant supervision, and many improvements have been made in these premises. The premises used for the manufacture of sausage and meat products within the City show a general state of cleanliness. The general improvements noted during the past year are the result of cordial cooperation between the meat traders and transporters and the officers of my department. london county council general powers act, 1932. Summary of types of premises registered during 1936. Trade carried on— Sausages and Cooked Meat 1 Pickling of Meat 7 Manufacture of Ice Cream 1 Sale of Ice Cream 23 Preparation of Cheeses 1 Manufacture of Chutney 1 Preparation of Sausage Casings 3 Manufacture of Jams and Salad Cream 1 Note.—Some of these premises are registered for more than one of the above processes. 42 This Act has improved the standard of cleanliness in many businesses. Before premises are registered, a schedule of alterations and improvements is submitted, where necessary, to the applicant. When the improvements have been carried out, a standard capable of maintenance results. The number of premises registered in the City since the inception of the Act is 153. In all, seven cases of premises were considered unsuitable for satisfactorily conducting the type of business for which application for registration was made, and 37 premises have been removed from the register, the occupier having removed or discontinued in business, thus leaving a total number of 116 premises now on the register. supervision of the ice cream trade. During the summer season, 68 inspections have been made in connection with the manufacture or sale of ice cream of the 42 premises now registered in the City, and 33 inspections have been made of the barrows or stalls of itinerant vendors, who this season numbered 29. In all instances where lack of cleanliness or other breach of the requirements of the Act was observed, the issue of a caution has resulted in appropriate steps being taken to remedy the defect. Additional premises registered during the year in accordance with the requirements of the London County Council General Powers Act, 1932, numbered 24, and seven premises have been removed from the register, the occupants having gone elsewhere or discontinued in business.

This Act came into operation on the 1st May, 1936. The greater part of the Act concerns the Pharmaceutical Society, members of which alone may sell poisons detailed in Part 1 of the Poisons List. Part 2 of the list is a concern of the Common Council of the City of London as Registering Authority for persons selling the poisons there listed in the City. The duties of the Authority are to list these persons, to inspect their premises and to secure compliance with the provisions of Part 2 of the Act. A shopkeeper may not sell listed poisons unless he is on the Local Authority's list, and the application to be listed must be on a schedule form. Provision is made for a charge of 7s. 6d. for first listing, 1s. for any subsequent alteration and 5s. for annual renewal. In regard to multiple premises, the fee is 7s. 6d. for each of the listed premises and 5s. for each year of renewal. Appropriate forms of application for listing have been prepared, and have been circulated by me to grocers, ironmongers, oilmen, garage keepers, seedsmen, etc., likely to be affected by the Act. The Court of Common Council appointed Mr. E. A. Johnson as Inspector under the Act, and from the date when it came into operation to the end of the year, 97 persons were appropriately registered. The work in connection with the above Act has been carried on as usual, and 82 visits to firms dealing with material controlled by the Act made by your Officer. Twenty-seven special enquiries on behalf of other Authorities in connection with delivering samples and obtaining statutory statements from registers were made. There was one offence against the law which necessitated the institution of legal proceedings. As the offence actually took place outside the City, the necessary prosecution was instituted by another Authority and a fine of £5 5s. with £10 10s. costs, was imposed. The quarterly returns to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have been made at the end of each quarter. agricultural produce (grading and marking) acts, 1928 and 1931. The above-mentioned Acts have been administered during the year with little real difficulty beyond that of persuading affected parties to conform to the requirements. This is readily understandable in areas like the City of London, where there are so many casual street vendors with little or no knowledge of the requirements of the law. Those regularly engaged in the work associated with these Acts of Parliament, having once been acquainted by the Inspector of their obligations, readily remedy any omission ; defect is almost invariably due to the failure of assistants to carry out the instructions of the proprietor. During the year 2,272 shops and stores and 732 street traders were interviewed. There were, in all, 30 minor offences. Ten new orders were issued under the Agricultural Produce (Grading and Marking) Acts, 1928 and 1931. fertilisers and feeding stuffs act, 1926 merchandise marks act, 1926. The following were released for manufacturing purposes under guarantee :— Tons. Cwts. Qrs.

During the year 1936, 1,019 samples of food and drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination, 763 of which were taken as informal or test samples without the formalities of the Food and Drugs (Adulteration) Act, 1928, being observed. Ten of these informal samples were reported against, as follows :— Samples. 2 Canned Fish 16 1 Meat 42 1 Canned Meat 4 1 Sausages 38 1 Spices and Herbs 45 1 Camphorated Oil 11 1 Mercury Ointment 2 1 Zinc Ointment 6 1 Spirit of Sal Volatile 1 10 Of the formal samples, 17 out of 256 were reported against, as follows :— Samples. 14 Milk 220 1 Spices and Herbs 1 1 Zinc Ointment 1 1 Camphorated Oil 1 17 The above-mentioned samples, with the exception of milk, were taken as the result of informal samples having been reported against. General Observation.—The percentage rate of adulteration of all food and drugs sampled in the City was 2 .6, the same percentage rate as in 1935. Butter, Cream and Cheese.—None of the 66 samples of these articles of dairy produce was reported against. Sausages.—Only one of the 38 samples of sausages was reported against. This sample was found to contain sulphur dioxide, the only permitted preservative, but no declaration of its presence was made by the vendor, who was cautioned and his attention called to the requirements of the Public Health (Preservatives, etc., in Food) Regulations. Canned Goods.—Two samples of sardines, procured from different vendors, were found to contain 33 and 43 parts of lead per million. In each case investigation showed them to be old stock, and the small amount unsold was surrendered for destruction. Spirits.—None of the 33 samples of spirits was found to be below the legal limit of 35 degrees under proof. Drugs.—Of the 86 samples of drugs obtained, six were found not to conform to the requirements of the British Pharmacopoeia. Legal proceedings were taken in two cases (where informal samples had been reported against previously), when fines were imposed with costs. Two formal samples, taken in connection with informal samples which had been certified not genuine, were found satisfactory. examination of milk. Chemical.—Of the 220 samples of milk, all of which were taken formally, 14 were certified to be below the legal limits which presume adulteration, equal to a percentage figure of 6.3, as compared with 2.7 in 1935. Three samples were found to contain extraneous water, its presence being confirmed by the Hortvet or Freezing Point test. Legal proceedings g2 48 were instituted against four vendors, and in three cases fines were imposed. In the remaining case, the subject of proceedings was in connection with samples taken from each of six churns of milk delivered at a railway terminus. Three of the samples were deficient in milk fat and three were genuine. The summonses were dismissed, the magistrate being satisfied that the milk had been delivered as given by the cows. Of the 220 samples of milk procured during the year under review, 81 were purchased from roundsmen in the streets. The following table shows the fat-content in each of the 220 samples, the average fat-content being 3 .5 per cent.:— Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. 1.5 l 3.6 21 2.0 1 3.7 25 2.1 l 3.8 19 2.4 l 3.9 6 2.8 5 4.0 8 2.9 2 4.1 6 3.0 5 4.2 1 3.1 8 4.3 2 3.2 21 4.4 2 3.3 28 4.5 1 3.4 27 4.6 2 3.5 26 74 Total 1 220 It will be observed that one sample contained as high a percentage of fat as 7.4. This sample was purchased at a small cafe, and after division of the sample it was ascertained that it had been served from a full bottle of milk without the vessel having been previously shaken. The vendor's attention was called to the undesirable practice of serving in this manner, some customers receiving a milk rich in fat to the prejudice of others. Five purveyors of milk, from whom samples had been taken, availed themselves of the provisions of the Food and Drugs (Adulteration) Act, 1928, and served notices upon the Authority requesting samples of milk to be procured in course of delivery from their suppliers. Milk-in-Schools Scheme.—Samples both for chemical analysis and bacteriological examination were taken quarterly at schools from each of the contractors supplying milk to schools under this scheme. All the samples taken for chemical analysis were found genuine, but two were found to exceed the bacterial limit for pasteurised milk upon bacteriological examination. The attention of the contractor was immediately called to the report of the Bacteriologist, the complaint investigated and explanation submitted. The circumstances were also reported to the Medical Officer of Health of the London County Council. A later sample proved satisfactory. The number of bottles of milk delivered daily to each school remains fairly constant. Milk bars have become a popular feature in the catering for the public in the way of flavoured milk " shakes," and a number of such businesses were established in the City during the year. The necessary sanitary arrangements for cleansing and sterilizing apparatus, and for the proper conduct of the trade, are required previous to registration. the milk and dairies order, 1926, and the milk and dairies (amendment) act, 1922. Sixteen new applications for registration as retail purveyors of milk were received during the year and none was refused. Four of these were from persons who have no City premises, but purvey milk within the area. Previous to registration in such cases, enquiries are made from the appropriate Authorities to ensure that the applicants are registered with them. Registration Statistics.

In addition, the usual observations were made from time to time in connection with milk distribution from barrows and vehicles. It was not found necessary to take action for milk bottling in the street or off dairy premises. the public health (condensed milk) regulations, 1923 and 1927. the public health (dried milk) regulations, 1923 and 1927. Thirteen samples of different brands of Condensed Milk were purchased for analysis, and all found to conform to the standards for composition and equivalent contents and the requirements as regards labelling. registered premises. Butter Factories.—One butter factory is registered in the City, and samples taken at these premises were all certified to be genuine. Wholesale Dealers in Margarine and Margarine Cheese.—No new application for registration was received during the year.

The above-mentioned Order came into operation on the 1st June, 1936, and replaced the old designations by " Tuberculin Tested," " Accredited " and " Pasteurised." The designations " Tuberculin Tested" (certified or pasteurised, as the case may be) and " Accredited " (farm bottled) may be used in addition. Bacterial counts for testing Tuberculin Tested and Accredited milks give place to the Methylene Blue Reduction Test. Pasteurised milk must contain less than 100,000 organisms per millilitre at any time before delivery to the consumer. In order that traders already licensed in the City under the old Order should be aware of the alterations, a formal intimation of such alterations was forwarded to each. During 1936 nine traders were licensed under the revoked Orders of 1923 and 1934. bacteriological and chemical examination of milk. samples collected at railway stations. In accordance with the practice instituted in 1904, a further series of samples of milk arriving in the City of London from the country was collected at Liverpool Street Station, and submitted to Dr. Garrod, the City Bacteriologist, for bacteriological examination and investigation as to the presence of dirt. A duplicate of each sample was submitted to Mr. A. J. C. Lickorish, the Public Analyst, for chemical examination. In all, 24 samples were taken and the farms from which they were despatched were situated in the following counties :— Suffolk 8 Herts. 16 Dr. Garrod reports that, from the results of his examination, two samples of milk, both from the same farm, suggested the possibility of the presence of tuberculous bacillus. I accordingly communicated with the medical officer of health for the county of the area in which this farm was situated and, in reply, received a report of which the following is an extract :— " Four bulk samples and one individual sample were taken from the herd in question and, on biological examination, one bulk sample proved positive. The three cows concerned in this sample were submitted to clinical examination, and in consequence a black poll cow was slaughtered. Postmortem examination of this cow revealed tuberculosis of one-quarter of the udder, the lungs and mesenteric and lymphatic glands. " The remaining samples of milk proved negative on examination." For purposes of comparison the following summary of results obtained since 1904 is here inserted :— Percentage showing Percentage showing Year. Tuberculous Infection. Year.

" Four animals had palpable lesions at the site of inoculation ; these I killed and examined. Of these, two, inoculated with milks 7 and 8, proved to be tuberculous." The detailed report is as follows :— milks for examination for tubercle bacilli, april, 1936. No. Date. Dirt.

Chemical examination showed that in five cases sophistication of the sample was indicated. The sophistication was slight in every case, and warnings were sent to the persons concerned. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. Artizans' Dwellings, Stoney Lane, Houndsditch.—These Buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five " blocks " of Dwellings, severally named King's, Queen's, Prince's, North, and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class, some of the ground floors being let as shops. The Buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 589 persons, compared with 621 in 1935. 89 per cent, are adults and 11 per 6ent. children (under 14 years). In addition to these Artizans' Dwellings, the Corporation, in connection with a slum clearance scheme, erected in the City:— (1) In December, 1927, a block of buildings, Bearsted House, in Hutchison Street, which contains 88 rooms, arranged in 24 tenements, and housing at the end of 1936 100 persons (94 per cent, adults and 6 per cent. children). (2) In January, 1929, a similar block of buildings, Dutton House, in New Street, containing 52 rooms, arranged in 16 tenements, and housing at the end of 1936, 65 persons (78 per cent. adults and 22 per cent. children). There are 7 shops, each with a large and well-lighted basement, in Bearsted House, and 8 shops, similarly provided with a basement, in Dutton House. The total population of these dwellings is 754. h2 TABLE OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS OCCURINS AT ARTIZANS DWELLINDS STONEY LANE, HOUNSDITCH, BEARSTEAD, HUTCHISION STREET, AND DUTTON HOUSE, NEW STREET, DURING THE YEAR 1936.

The birth-rate was 18.5 per 1,000, which is 8.8 per 1,000 above the average for the previous five years. The birthrate in these Dwellings reached a maximum of 46.9 per 1,000 in 1896, and has since been falling irregularly, but almost progressively. The death rate for 1936 was 15 .9 per 1,000 per annum. For the purposes of comparison of birth and death rates, the population in the whole of these dwellings has been included in the calculation, as probably representing a class homogeneity. The baths, provided for the use of tenants of these Buildings, which were opened in May, 1904, continue to be extensively used, the number of persons bathing during 1936 being 16,221, of whom 6,771 were males and 9,450 were females.

This necessitated the service of 40 notices during 1936. In addition to the foregoing, there are twelve blocks of Dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is " self-contained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that in these circumstances they are not subject to the Byelaws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family :— No. of Tenements.

Common Lodging House, 116, Middlesex Street.—This is the only common lodging house in the City. It was opened on the 7th February, 1906, and is known as the " Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter." Periodical inspections were made during the year. Following representation from this Authority, entire reconstruction of the basement washhouse, together with the provision of new sanitary fittings, was undertaken and completed by the owners, the Salvation Army. The premises are registered in the name of the Salvation Army Trustee Co. Neglect to comply with Water Closet Bye-laws. No instance of neglect in this respect has occurred during the year under review. Drainage Plans.—In the course of the year 254 plans were submitted with regard to proposed reconstruction of water-closets or drains in the City. Of these, 196 were approved, 30 revised and approved, and 28 not approved. Street Gullies.—The gradual substitution of properly trapped gullies for those formerly existing has greatly reduced the number of complaints received of offensive smells arising from these appliances, especially in warm weather. In some cases this nuisance was doubtless due to want of flushing, but in the majority faulty construction was the cause of the trouble. 60 The City Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past, and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more up-to-date design will, I hope, eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil. Sanitary Defects and Infectious Diseases.—In cases of notification of infectious disease, the premises involved were inspected with regard to the drainage system, water supply, ventilation, etc.; and of the 41 cases investigated in 1935, defects were found in two instances. Legal Proceedings.—During the year, 51 notices have been issued by the Sanitary Committee, and in no case was it found necessary, in consequence of non-compliance therewith, to refer the matter to the City Solicitor. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Custom House, as heretofore, required special attention. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the immediate vicinity of these places free from nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially during hot weather. Limewashing of Courts.—There are 60 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed frequently, become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of passengers or vehicles, together with the action of the smokeladen atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. Of the places so dealt with during 1936, 19 were situated in the East District, 24 in the Middle District, and 17 in the West District. Defective Connections to Sewer.—During the year, 12 reports were received from the City Engineer respecting the condition of connections between the drains of certain City houses and the public sewer. Investigations showed that it was necessary to reconstruct nine of the connections referred to. As a result of the inspection of the internal drainage system of these premises, reconstruction or alteration was found necessary in four instances. COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL OF REFUSE AND CLEANSING OF STREETS, COURTS AND GULLIES. The following observations are included in this Report by the courtesy of Mr. W. J. Heavey, the Director of Public Cleansing :— Collection and Disposal of Refuse. House and trade refuse is collected by 10 a.m. from receptacles placed on the kerb in streets scheduled by the Ministry of Transport, and after 10 a.m. from the interior of premises in other streets. Special arrangements are made for the collection of large quantities of trade refuse in scheduled streets. The contents of street orderly bins and market refuse are collected at any time during the day or night. All refuse is conveyed by horse-drawn vans or motor waggons to Lett's Wharf. It is there shot into the contractors' barges ; house, trade and market refuse being taken down the river to Hornchurch, where it is deposited on land belonging to the Corporation. Manure and contents of street orderly bins are separately barged where required by the contractors. At Hornchurch, the refuse is disposed of under the system of controlled tipping, as recommended by the Ministry of Health—i.e., the crude refuse is sealed off from the air by layers of earth excavated from the maiden ground of the tip and from other sources. Fires at the tip occur but seldom, and, as a precaution, iron water pipes are laid across the top of the tip, with joints at intervals to allow for the fixing of fire hose. No rats have been seen at the tip for several years, and this result may reasonably be attributed to the system of controlled tipping. Arrangements have been made for dealing with these vermin should their presence be suspected at any time. During the year ended 31st December, 1936, the tonnage of refuse collected was as follows :— House, trade and market refuse 43,462 Street and gully refuse 14,749 Total tons 58,211 Seventy-four per cent. of the refuse was collected by horse vans and 26 per cent. by motor waggons. It is estimated that the above total tonnage is equal to over 200,000 cubic yards. Cleansing of Streets, Courts and Gullies. The major part of the work of street cleansing is done during the night, when the whole of the City is cleansed either by motor brooms, motor water waggons or jet and hose. The condition of the centres of the carriageways in main thoroughfares during dry weather, except in market areas, is clean enough to render a nightly washing of the whole surface unnecessary, and such carriageways are therefore completely washed once a week only. On the other five nights of the week the channels are washed. In wet weather, however, the whole of the carriageways are washed every night if necessary. 61 Certain secondary streets, including those in the vicinity of Billingsgate and Leadenhall Markets, are washed every night, and streets in the vicinity of Smithlield Market three times per week. Most of the street gullies are emptied as often as required by mechanical means, two machines being employed for this purpose every night. After the gullies have been emptied, they are re-sealed with clean water from the machines and the contents of the gullies removed to Lett's Wharf. Gullies in courts and narrow thoroughfares, which are inaccessible to the machines, are emptied by hand or flushed, as required. During the year 1936, 64,985 gullies were cleansed and 25,383,000 gallons of water used for cleansing streets, courts and gullies. PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936. The Public Health (London) Act, 1936, came into operation on the 1st October, 1936. This Act is a consolidating act, and as such there is practically no alteration in the procedure or powers of the Corporation. The necessary detailed alterations in regard to formal notices and orders which, in the past, were issued under the old Statutes, were effected by the City Solicitor. PIGEONS. Complaints of nuisance and damage caused by the congregation of pigeons in the City continue to be received, and the contractor to the Corporation is continually being urged by this Department to devote greater efforts to reducing their numbers. It will, however, be readily understood that mere catching can have little practical effect so long as safe nesting places, which abound in such places as the City of London, are available. No sooner is one batch of birds destroyed than their nesting places are taken by others. In view of this fact, it was considered desirable in the early part of the year to communicate with the owners of large buildings, such as the City Churches, the Halls of the Livery Companies, the Bank of England, the General Post Office, the Stock Exchange, the railway stations hotels, etc., asking them to assist the Corporation in their efforts to reduce the number of pigeons infesting the City, by eliminating nesting places or making them inaccessible to the birds. This communication was received sympathetically, and in a number of buildings netting of potential or actual nesting places was carried out. In some cases there was no response to the suggestion, and in others it was contended that the practical difficulties and cost of pigeon proofing were disproportionate to the degree of nuisance. This contention can be appreciated in regard to such a building as St. Paul's Cathedral, but unless the owners of property generally will ascertain whether pigeons are nesting on or in their buildings, and if practicable, take preventive measures, there can be no permanent reduction in the pigeon population of the City. This problem is closely comparable to the rat problem. Pigeons and rats will both breed up to the limits of the nesting accommodation and the food supply, and in this connection the feeding of pigeons in the City by certain kindly and well-intentioned people is to be deplored. They are making the solution of this problem unnecessarily difficult, and if they desisted the pigeons would not starve, but would make their homes nearer to a natural supply of food, where they would not cause the nuisance and damage they do in the City. Moreover, it would then be possible to discontinue the catching and destruction of pigeons, which these same people so strongly resent and with which they have constantly interfered. During the year the Corporation Contractor was only able to catch 490 birds, and these were all destroyed under my supervision. At the time of writing this Report, however, increased efforts are in contemplation. Such ringed birds as were found were forwarded to the Homing Union, in accordance with the undertaking given when the Act of Parliament under which this action is permitted was placed on the Statute Book. Every precaution is taken to ensure that the work of trapping is not attended by any element of cruelty. EXHUMATION AND RE-INTERMENT OF BODIES AT THE CITY OF LONDON CEMETERY. During the year, the bodies of nine persons buried at the City of London Cemetery, Little Ilford, were exhumed under Home Office Licences and subsequently reinterred in the same cemetery. In accordance with the terms of the licences, the work of exhumation and re-interment in each case was carried out in the early morning and under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health. DISCOVERY OF HUMAN REMAINS. 12/15, Finsbury Circus. During excavation work at 12/15, Finsbury Circus, a small quantity of human remains was unearthed. The bones were very old and bore indication of previous disturbance. With the consent of the Coroner and City Police, these bones were reinterred on the site, with due decency and precaution. I HOUSING ACT, 1935. Section- 1 of the Housing Act, 1935, imposed upon every Local Authority the duty of carrying out a survey of their district in order to ascertain to what extent overcrowding existed. This involved the inspection of 1,686 separate dwelling-houses in the City and the measurement of the rooms comprising these dwellings. Of these 1,686 dwelling-houses, 65, or 3 .9 per cent., were found to be overcrowded. The Minister of Health fixed 1st April, 1936, as the date for completion of the survey, and 1st June, 1936, for the submission to him of a report based on the survey, and this information was accordingly forwarded. By Statutory Rules and Orders the appointed day for the operation of Section 6 in the City of London was fixed as 1st July, 1936, and requires that within six months after that date every rent book or similar document shall contain a summary in the prescribed form of Sections 2, 3 and 5 of the Act, and a statement of the permitted number of persons in relation to the dwelling. The appointed day for the operation of Sections 3 and 8, which make new cases of overcrowding an offence, was fixed as 1st January, 1937, which is also the date fixed for the coming into operation of Sections 4 and 68, which relate, inter alia, to the granting of licences for a temporary increase of the permitted number of persons. In one case only was obstruction experienced in obtaining entry for the purpose of measuring rooms, and legal proceedings were accordingly taken and entry subsequently obtained. Of the 65 cases of overcrowding found, two have been abated by the exclusion of temporary occupiers. Alternative accommodation has not yet been found for these cases. By reason of the advancing age of children, four additional dwellings became overcrowded by the end of 1936. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901, &c.

Notice in each case was served upon the offender and in all cases complied with. No cases of infectious disease were reported in connection with outworkers' premises in the City. 12 SUMMARY OF WORK DONE THE FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901, AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH (LONDON) ACT, 1936 &C.

WHITE, Acting Medical Officer of Health. Note.—The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (S. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the administration of that Act in workshops and workplaces, and to send a copy of his Annual Report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State (Home Office). If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office, the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in ths Home Office Memorandum of March, 1912. shops acts, 1934. The provisions of the above-mentioned Act have been carried out, and it has not been necessary to appoint any additional members to my inspectorial staff in connection therewith. As a consequence, however, of a memorandum which was issued by the Minister of Health dealing with this Act in general, each of my existing inspectors has been formally appointed and provided with a certificate of such appointment, in order that it may be produced to any appropriately responsible person on request. During the year 608 shops and warehouses were inspected and 243 defects found, all of which were remedied without recourse to legal proceedings. Applications for exemption certificates were received, and as satisfactory alternative accommodation was available in each case, all were granted. The following is a summary of the work done:— [### WEST. MIDDLE. EAST.

It has proved of considerable assistance in connection with the identification of persons found drowned in the River Thames. During 1936 five bodies were placed in the apparatus, all of which were subsequently identified. 71 disinfectants. The disinfectants and other chemicals in use in the Public Health Department and in other branches of the Corporation's service have, as in the past, been supplied under a contract prepared by your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for deodorising and denaturising unsound meat, disinfecting public conveniences, street gulleys, premises after infectious diseases, etc. Special attention was given to the thoroughfares in the vicinity of the Billingsgate and Smithfield Markets, the former of which presents certain difficulties in the matter of deodorisation in the summer months. Very few complaints were, however, received of offensive odours necessarily associated with the fish trade. In the interests of economy the practice of using a disinfectant fluid in conjunction with general street watering has been discontinued. rat repression. Inspections under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, have been carried out by Mr. G. A. Webber, one of the Sanitary Inspectors, specially appointed as Rat Officer. I am again able to report that many satisfactory results have been achieved through the co-operation of tenants of City Buildings and this Department. It is not possible to give any indication of the total number of rats caught in the City during any given period. Messrs. William Dalton & Sons, professional ratcatchers, inform me that their catch, during 1936, in the City of London, was 16,179 rats, the majority being Black Rats. A firm of caterers, with many branches in the City, give their catch, during 1936, as 3,102, and, as in previous years, the majority were Black Rats. The City has its own particular problem. The conclusions which have been arrived at, some of which are referred to here, have been gained only by experience in this area, and many of them should not be taken as applying to the subject generally. Here we are troubled with two types—the Black Rat and the Brown Rat. These titles do not give any accurate description of the colour of each specie. It is in formation, appearance, and habit that they differ. The one is the enemy of the other, and it is not possible for the two species to interbreed. The Brown Rat is more commonly known as the Sewer Rat, and is not nearly so widely prevalent now in the City as is the Black Rat. Nevertheless, it is believed that the Brown Rat is still more generally the country-wide pest, and this rat's activities were undoubtedly responsible for the introduction of the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, in 1919. It is the predominance of the Black Rat in the City of London, which, because of its different habits, renders, to a great extent, the present legislation inadequate and unsuitable in this area. The Brown or Sewer Rat is primarily an underground or burrowing animal. Its presence in a building is often due to a defective drain or sewer in or around the property it infests, such properties usually being old, and having attached a disused basement or cellar, whose construction is so defective as to give this rat full scope for its burrowing propensities. The erection of many new buildings in the City, together with the reconditioning of old properties, is partly responsible for the reduction in the Sewer Rat population, and the many regulations which now govern drainage and building construction generally, particularly in a built-up area, has also had the effect of defeating this rat, without being drawn up with that particular object in view. With the gradual lessening of Sewer Rat infestation in the City, the Black Rat has increased, until it now forms the chief problem, outnumbering its enemy by about twenty to one at a low estimate. Any grave danger to which the rat exposes the health of humans is accentuated by the predominance of this Black Rat, because, of the two species, it lives in much closer relation to mankind. City buildings, generally, provide excellent homes for this rat, which lives in matchlined or panelled walls, under floors, in false ceilings, in undisturbed accumulations deposited k2 72 in workrooms—in any place which, in spite of its closeness to us, provides a minimum of danger from that source and a maximum of convenience in their raids upon our properties. The vermin breed prolifically, the period of gestation being about twenty-one days, the litters from five to twelve or more. The rat reaches sexual maturity at about three months of age. The rat must of necessity live in dirty, unattended places in our buildings, but it would not, it is suggested, be correct to describe it as a naturally dirty animal. Actually, rats sit on their haunches and clean and preen themselves for long periods. Many have been seen, just killed, with livestock on them. Many more, particularly live rats, have been examined whose fur and skin is remarkable for its cleanliness, where even the operation of combing with a fine tooth comb has failed to show any living creature, or abundant dirt in the fur. Rats have an offensive smell, which, if they are present in numbers in a building, can be detected. In colonies they appear to be great hoarders of food, laying up a store against the day when their supplies may be cut off. It is a point of interest that, during one investigation, an inspection of the hollow cavity provided by a false ceiling showed a large quantity of lump sugar, each piece having been carried separately from the sugar basin and deposited in this "safe" place. No indication can be given as to how much had been eaten, but certainly no attempt had been made to consume this very neat and orderly pile. This discovery was interesting, because it provides some indication of what happens to solid poison baits, which are usually made in a size comparable to a piece of lump sugar. The disappearance of poison baits which have been laid about in buildings does not mean that those poison baits have been consumed. Rats are excellent climbers, and this applies particularly to the Black Rat, which, to reach an objective, will scale seemingly impossible climbs. Having once found a safe run, the rat will always reach its objective by that run. By living in obscure places, usually inaccessible to man, and therefore dirty, and by climbing lift ropes and negotiating lift gear, the feet and tail of the rat pick up a great deal of dirt and grease, and this, together with the natural exudations of the body, supplies us with an indication of their runs. The fact that the same run is used consistently accentuates the dirty marking, and so, in infested buildings, the experienced eye can rapidly pick up the trail. It has been noted that the majority of people do not associate these markings with the rat, even in those instances when the grease and dirt from their tails and feet has left a deposit in the run sometimes a sixteenth of an inch thick, and when one bannister upright is black from this cause, and the others still retain their painted or polished surface. Invariably these markings have been noticed, but are assumed to be ordinary deposits of dirt. These runs are to be kept in mind during any trapping operations. The reaction of the public to the problem generally may be summarised by saying that the rat has come to be regarded as an unavoidable evil. This has brought about the feeling that the rat is far too clever for us, and the problem has long since ceased to receive the logical treatment it should. There can be little doubt that the rat succeeds rather because of our apathy than by its own superiority. Occupiers of property complain frequently of their rat-infested premises, but usually because of the financial loss caused. The proprietor of a business is vitally interested from this point of view. It may be considered natural that this view-point rather obscures the aspect of danger to public health ; further, it might be said that, as both view-points lead to one ultimate aim—the riddance of the pest—it does not much matter. Yet there is a difference, for the financial loss is to the minority in business houses. If the public generally could be made rat-conscious solely from the more important aspect of public health, great strides could be made to solve this problem, for then we should have a majority interest, with every one showing more care in their conduct. The proper disposal of waste food and other accumulations in business houses and restaurants ; greater care shown by the biggest offenders, the indiscriminate eaters of apples, oranges, and other fruit, who throw the waste into some inaccessible corner, which is not cleaned, or behind or under some fitting to which the same remarks apply, but where the rat can easily get ; the closing of this window and that door, not because the employer suffers financial loss, but because the presence of this pest means danger to employee and employer alike. That should be the aim, and its establishment would spell doom to the rat. Because of the lack of this majority interest, the best method of repression—the consistent removal of attractions— is lost, and we fall back on the trapping and poisoning methods of destruction, carried out 73 with different degrees of efficiency, the result being unsatisfactory and indefinite because it depends upon individual and not collective effort. Here it is that the rat gains its reputation for cleverness. That it avoids our traps successfully cannot be denied ; but the ordinary break-back trap has many points in its disfavour—primarily, the number of years it has been in use. It is feasible that the rat has an inborn instinctiveness to avoid such a trap ; again, if the trap is successful, it shows another rat how its less fortunate mate was killed. Rats killed in break-back traps often lie dead in them for hours, there to be seen by others. The introduction of printers' varnish as a trap (this is a sticky substance, laid on cardboard) took place some years ago. It was extensively used and recommended in the City. It was new. Hundreds of rats were caught through this medium—seven, eight, nine, on a board. Now the rat is shy of this contrivance. It still has success where it is introduced for the first time, but it appears that any method of catching rats which shows others how it is done must fail with the passing of time. Many poisons are employed to destroy rats. Many succeed, but ever present is the danger of this " domestic " rat dying under the floor or in the hollow wall, probably in the water storage tank, circumstances which often bring complaints to this Department. For these reasons the use of poison is not recommended by this Department. Because experience has shown the general methods of destruction—trapping and poisoning—to be unsatisfactory this Department in many cases continues to recommend the employment of skilled catchers, men who catch rats and immediately remove them from the eyes of their fellows, without those remaining rats knowing how it was done. Yet it must be stressed again that this method alone would not be successful. The catcher must have the co-operation of the persons inhabiting the building he is endeavouring to clear. The removal of attractions is the chief weapon. Where this, together with rat-catching and rat-proofing, can be introduced simultaneously, success will be obtained. Let the public be rat-conscious from the view-point of public health, and much will have been done to achieve the overthrow of this pest. 74 rats and mice (destruction) act, 1919.

In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or of any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Commitee having cognizance of the appointment, 97 persons were examined by the Medical Officer of Health during 1936. Ninety-four of these persons were reported as physically fit for office. Nineteen officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement. With one exception, all were reported to be unfit for duty. One other was examined after illness and certified as unfit at that time.

REPORT OF MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST FOR THE CITY OF LONDON, 1899. ANNUAL REPORT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC ANALYST FOR THE YEAR 1899. To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my Annual Report for 1899. During the year appreciable progress has been made by professional experts in the investigation of the primal cause of preventable and other ailments. Laborious and costly bacteriological experiments have been carried on by scientists in various parts of the civilized world with a view of determining the special 11 contagia" of diseases of an infectious character; such as plague, leprosy, tuberculosis, cancer, "et hoc genus ornne," the outcome of which there is every reason to believe will lead to a considerable 10 modification of existing methods of treatment, whereby physical suffering and mental distress will be diminished. The inoculation of persons with carefully prepared "serums" with a view of giving immunity from attacks of certain malignant epidemics, has been proved to modify the severity and duration of the disease; albeit, it may not afford absolute security in every particular case. The simplest illustration of this may be seen in the practice of vaccination, as a prophylactic against small-pox, but the principle also applies to diphtheria, enteric fever, rabies, hydrophobia, &c., &c. During the last Session of Parliament a Departmental Commission was appointed by the Local Government Board to inquire into the extent and significance of notorious sophistications in the preparation of food intended for the use of man, and to inaugurate measures to compel traders to deal only in articles of a genuine character, in nature, substance, and appearance. 11 Again, the employment of so-called "Preservatives" has been referred to the same committee, who have not yet reported. As heretofore, these endeavours have been opposed by persons whose pecuniary interests are enhanced by fraudulent practices, which have the effect of making an inferior article appear like the real thing. Bygone experience gives but little encouragement to the hope that any real protection to the public will accrue from this investigation, owing to the overwhelming influence the principal offenders have in Parliament. The scarcity of rain throughout the kingdom was productive of much infantile diarrhoea and scarlet fever. A remarkable, and quite unique so far as the City is concerned, outbreak of enteric fever occurred in the earl}' part of the year, which will be found reported in full detail later on. 12 AREA. The City of London Registration District comprises an area of 672.1 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.05 miles, equal to a square of 1.0247 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,672 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.7 square miles, equal to a square of 10.8 miles to a side. The City forms one of the three central Metropolitan Districts, and is divided for civil registration purposes into the following four Sub-Districts, viz. :— 1. St. Botolph, including 15 parishes. 2. Cripplegate „ 2 „ 3. St. Sepulchre „ 11 „ 4. AllhallowsBarking „ 85 „ Total-113 parishes. The City District, or Union, is co-extensive with the municipal City of London within and without the walls, with the following 13 exceptions, viz.—the municipal City includes the Middle Temple, part of Staple Inn [four houses] †, part of Furnival's Inn [five houses], and a part of the Parish of Whitechapel [five houses], which for Poor Law and Registration purposes are comprised respectively in the Strand, Holborn and Whitechapel Districts, while the " Liberty of Glasshouse Yard," with the exception of a few houses occupied by sixty-five persons, although not forming part of the municipal City††, is included in the Parish of St. Botolph Without, Aldersgate, in the London City Registration District. This 'Liberty' contained in 1891 69 inhabited houses, occupied by 779 persons, and in 1896 only 733 persons, according to the Imperial Census. All deaths in Glasshouse Yard are included by the Registrar-General as occurring in the City, but the Corporation is only responsible for the sanitary condition of the area comprised in the "municipal" City of London, from which this Yard, with the exceptions above mentioned, is excluded. * Vide Census of England and Wales, 1891. The Middle Temple has since been constituted a separate Sanitary Authority, † The ground floors only are in the City. †† A new delimitation of this portion of the City is now under consideration. 14 DENSITY (1899).

ANNUAL RATEABLE VALUE. The assessed rateable annual value of property within the administrative County of London was £31,819,412 in 1891—£36,571,279 in 1899—whilst the corresponding rateable value of property in the municipal City of London was £3,984,285 in 1891, and £4,549,255 in 1899, or nearly one-eighth of the whole County. POPULATION. The first Imperial Quinquennial Census was taken in the City of London on the night of the 29th March, 1896, under the provisions of 15 the London (Equalization of Rates) Act, 1894, 57 and 58 Vic., cap. 53, sec. 3. In the Returns prepared by the RegistrarGeneral, dated 13th August, 1896, presented to Parliament, the population on the night of the enumeration was found to be 31,711, whilst in the previous decennial Imperial Census of 1891 it was 38,320, showing a decrease of 6,609 persons in the five years (1891-6). City Population. Census of 1861 112,063 „ 1871 75,983 „ 1881 51,405 „ 1891 38,320 „ 1896 31,711 Assuming that the annual rate of decrease between 1896 and 1898 corresponded to the rate of decrease in the decennial period 1891 and 1896, the estimated population of the City at the end of June, 1899, would be 28,039. The estimated night population of the various Registration sub-districts is as under; to which 16 the figures returned at the last Census are added for the purpose of comparison:— 1896. 1899(estimated to the middle of the year ). *St. Botolph 9,762 8,374 Cripplegate 3,299 2,677 St. Sepulchre 9,591 8,734 Allhallows 9,059 8,254 31,711 28,039 The population of the City, as ascertained by the Day Census taken by the Corporation at its own expense, was found to be in 1866— 170,133; in 1881—261,061; and in 1891— 301,384, showing an increase between 1866 and 1881 of 90,928, and between 1881 and 1891 of 40,323, so that if this progressive augmentation has been maintained since 1891, a Day Census at June, 1899, would have shown a population of about 338,850. The Day Census taken in May, 1891, proved that 1,186,000 persons and 92,000 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the counting was made. * The sub-districts of St. Botolph and Broad Street were united on the 1st September, 1899, and are so included in this Table.

Death rate recorded in the City of London each week of the year, compared with that of the Metropolis and the 33 Great Towns of England and Wales. References:— Metropolis 3 Great Towns City of London (Bloxam's Method) 17 MORTALITY. During the year under review, 1,011 deaths were registered in the District, including *642 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See Table A for details. Deducting the latter we have to deal with 369 deaths, to which we must add 149 persons who died at City Institutions in outside districts, where they were registered. The mortality, therefore, upon which our death rate is calculated is 518. The death rate for 1899 was 18.5 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 16.3), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis for 1899 was 19.8. These figures are not corrected for sex and age distribution. * All these deaths occurred in St. Bartholomew's Hospital. C 18 Death Rates, pee 1,000 per Annum. Year.

The number of deaths from the principal zymotic diseases* was 29, or 1.03 per 1,000 of the population, against 2.48 for the Metropolis. * Including Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, Whooping Cough, Fever, and Diarrhoea. 19 The deaths of children under 1 year of age to 1,000 births come out 135, against 167 for the whole of London. Deaths in City Institutions. During 1899, 155 persons died in City Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries or Lunatic Asylums, or no less than 29.9 per cent. of the whole City mortality, the corresponding figure for the Metropolis being 17.8 per cent. This high percentage is caused in the City by the excessive proportion the number of inmates in these places (exclusive of officers and their families) bears to our population, the ratio being about 1:25, as compared with 1:101 in the Metropolis (Census 1891). In other words, these figures represent that 1 in every 25 citizens is an inmate of either a Workhouse, Workhouse Infirmary or a Lunatic Asylum, in comparison with 1 in every 101 inhabitants of the Metropolis. c 2 20 Percentage of Deaths occurring in Workhouses, Workhouse Infirmaries and Lunatic Asylums to total Deaths in the City of London and the Metropolis respectively, for 1899, compared with the average for the previous five years :— Year.

Deaths from Violence. Of the City deaths, 6.56 per cent. were caused by injuries or violence (as compared with 7.02 in 1898), being 1.96 below the average for the previous five years. The percentage of registered deaths from violence in the Metropolis appears to have been fairly constant during the above period, but an examination of the Returns for a number of years shows that there is a tendency for the proportion to increase: thus in 1882 it was 0.7 per cent. lower than in 1899. In the City of London, however, the contrary obtains, and the ratio of deaths from violence to deaths from all causes has, since 1894 at any rate, regularly diminished, thus, in 1894 it was 10.5, and in 1899 6.56; a drop of nearly four per cent. (3.94). 22 PERCENTAGE OF REGISTERED DEATHS FROM VIOLENCE. Year. City of London. Metropolis. Per cent.

BIRTHS. The number of children born in the City (see Table B, page 38) was 416. The birth rate, therefore, was 14.8 per 1,000. The birth rate for the whole of London is given as 29.4. This wide variation is due to the differences in the sex and age distribution of their populations.

Of the births, 270 were successfully vaccinated, 41 died before the age for vaccination, 23 were postponed by medical certificate, 2 were insusceptible, 58 removed into other districts, and 26 were pending at the end of the year. During the same period only Two adults, &c., were re-vaccinated, a number far below the necessities of our population, it being clearly proved that infant vaccination does not confer a life-long immunity from Small-pox, and requires renewal at ages between 7 and 10, and again in the presence of an epidemic invasion.

This is the more noteworthy since the number of successful vaccinations had previously dropped from 78.9 per cent. in 1894, to 45.3 per cent. in 1898, in the City alone, and in a very large proportion throughout the Kingdom. Only Ten parents took advantage of the so-called "conscientious objection" in order to avoid having their children protected. The number last year was 33. All intelligent persons will recognise and rejoice over this return to reason on the part of the least-favoured, in point of education, of our fellow-citizens. 27 In this connection, the advice given in my last Annual, that no unvaccinated chiid should be admitted or allowed to remain in the Artizans' Dwellings, still obtains, and should be strictly observed.

These buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers during 1884-1885, were opened in January of the latter year. They stand upon ground formerly the site of Mount Court, Wood Green Court, Ebenezar Square, Meeting House Yard, Angel Court, Coak's Buildings, George Court, and Petticoat Square, in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five "blocks," severally named King's—Queen's—Prince's—North—and South, of dwellings, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class. Some of the ground floors are let as shops. Exclusive of the shops and cellars, they contain 539 rooms, arranged in 260 tenements, and are at present occupied by 1,066 persons, most of whom are Jews. Fifty-three per cent. are adults and forty-seven per cent. children. 30 The total cost of the buildings and land upon which they stand was £202,242, which are now maintained at an annual expenditure of about £1,850. The income derived from letting the tenements is £5,550, being 1.83 per cent. interest on the capital outlay. They are much sought after, and the rooms are rarely empty. The rent varies from 4s. 6d. to 9s. per week. The death rate for 1899 was 15.0 per 1,000 per annum [of which 18.8 per cent. were children under 5 years of age]. Deaths of children under one year to 1,000 births were 75, as against 130 for the City generally. The number of births was 40, viz.: 22 males and 18 females. The birth rate has fallen from 43.1 in 1898 to 37.5 in 1899; the average for the previous five years being 44.0 per 1,000 per annum. With one exception (1898) there has not been any illegitimate births during the fourteen years the buildings have been in existence. City of London.

In this respect we are behind neighbouring sanitary authorities in the metropolis and elsewhere. The desirability of attending to this matter is more urgent than ever, especially as the present water-closets, pans, and attachments are of an obsolete and objectionable pattern. The woodwork surrounding the pans is rapidly decaying, and that portion of the floor beneath the seats consists of uncovered earth, and in some cases stinks abominably. The flooring in front of the seats is, however, properly paved. In my judgment the whole of these W.C's should be forthwith removed, and pedestal closets with lifting seats substituted, so that the pans may be utilised as urinals and slop-sinks. D 34 Something, I admit, has been done recently to make these dwellings more wholesome, by the substitution of glazed earthenware for the old wooden washing troughs in the laundries, which, upon being demolished, were found in a most disgusting condition from slugs and other vermin. ARTELAN WELL, STONEY LANE. The well continues to give a supply sufficient for the wants of the Artizans' Dwellings and the Depot adjoining. Moreover, we were enabled to help Whitechapel with water during the recent drought. The level of the water is now eleven feet lower from the surface of the ground than it was in 1892, but there has not been any material 35 change in its chemical constituents, as the following details of my last analysis shows :— Analysis of Stoney Lane Well Water.

These figures show a remarkable decrease as compared with previous years, owing to the fact that in one establishment alone, no less than 45 patients were treated 38 on the premises, where every attention that liberal expenditure could ensure was provided by the employers.

In 1894 I submitted a Table showing a number of notifications sent by various Port Sanitary Authorities of 86 persons giving City addresses who had arrived from Cholera-infected foreign parts. During 1899, information from the same sources was forwarded, stating that 45 people on their way to the City District had landed at various seaport towns in vessels sailing from foreign ports, mostly Spanish and Portuguese, that were considered to be infected with Plague. The several addresses furnished to me were visited, and the parties interviewed when found, with satisfactory results in all cases. SHELTER FOR TEMPRARY ACCOMMODATION DURING DISINFECTION. The establishment at No. 6, Cotton Street, Aldersgate Street, is still in operation, pending the completion of the new buildings now being erected at Golden Lane. 40 As you are aware, this Shelter is not intended for the use of the poor only, any person within the City Sanitary district who may be inconvenienced by the process of disinfection after infectious disease in his or her dwelling, having a right to the accommodation it affords, under the provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 60 (Sub-sec. 4). Twelve families, comprising 22 adults and 18 children, total 40 persons, were received and provided with lodging, food, and attendance during the purifying of their houses after— Scarlet Fever - - from 5 families Diphtheria - - „ 6 „ Enteric Fever - „ 1 family 12 families One family came from a home consisting of three rooms, 6 of two rooms, and 5 of one room. In every instance the benefits provided have been received with grateful appreciation and decorum. 41 NEW SHELTER, GOLDEN LANE. In anticipation of the agreement for the tenancy of No. 6, Cotton Street, being about to expire, the Sanitary Committee, in March last, requested me to report as to the desirability of taking down the then existing Chapel at the City Mortuary, and adapting its site and the ground around it to the requirements of a new Shelter. After giving the matter careful consideration I submitted sketch plans suitable, in my judgment, for all present and future needs of a Shelter proper, in combination with sufficient space for the reception of cases in the possible contingency of an outbreak of Asiatic Cholera or other epidemic. The authority for such provision was conferred upon all Local Authorities by the Lords of Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, 42 in a Memo, dated the 21st day of July, 1866, as under:— "When the Medical Officer of Health recom"mends, the vestry or board shall, with as much "dispatch as practicable, provide jit and proper "accommodation for the reception of such "patients as have no home, or cannot properly "be treated at home, and may with advantage "to themselves be removed, and shall cause the "same to be provided with all appliances, "medicines, furniture, and other things neces"sary for the emergency, and shall appoint a "legally qualified medical practitioner, with or "without assistant, as the case may require, to "attend to the same. "If cholera or choleraic diarrhoea exist in "any dwelling u-hereof the Medical Officer of "Health reports that the sick and healthy cannot "therein be properly separated, the vestry or "board shall forthwith cause adequate accom"modation to be procured for the reception of "the healthy; and, when the Medical Officer of "Health recommends that the sick person shall 43 "not be removed, but that the healthy shall be "removed from the same room in which the sick "person is lying, the vestry or board shall cause "the other inmates of such room to be removed "to some convenient place of reception." Again, in 1883 the Local Government Board, in a Memorandum dated 25th August of that year, issued the following instructions:— "The Board desire that it should be clearly "understood that, in the event of cholera "prevailing in any particular district, the "sanitary authority of that district would be "called upon to make special provision of its "own; firstly, of refuges, and, in the second "place, of hospitals also should the moderate "provision to which the managers of the "Metropolitan Asylums Board must necessarily "restrict themselves be exceeded Coming down to more recent times, the "Public Health (London) Act, 1891," gives ample powers. 44 Thus the 75th Section recites:— (1) That "any Sanitary Authority may pro"vide for the use of the inhabitants of their "district hospitals temporary or permanent "and for that purpose may: "(a) Themselves build such hospitals, or, "(b) Contract for the use of any hospital "or part of a hospital; "(c) Enter into any arrangement with any "person having the management of any "hospital for the reception of the sick "inhabitants of their district on payment of "such annual or other sum as may be "agreed on." This Section is permissive only, but if any great emergency arose, and the public safety demanded additional powers, it would doubtless be made mandatory by an "Order in Council." The Sanitary Committee experienced great difficulty a few years ago in finding a suitable site or sites upon which to erect either a Shelter 45 for the sound, or a Hospital for the sick, excepting at a prohibitory cost, and the problem was solved for the time by hiring premises in Cotton Street, Aldersgate, at a high rental, although they never were, and never could be made, suitable in all rcspects for the purposes required. When this country was threatened with a visitation of cholera about seven years ago, application was made by the Commissioners of Sewers to a large Metropolitan hospital within your district * for terms upon which beds would be reserved for City cases. The reply was that in the event of an epidemic of cholera a certain number of beds would be reserved for treatment, but that they could not be allotted for the wants of the citizens alone—in other words, they would do their best to help, but could not guarantee their exclusive use. Payment for the occupation of beds was refused by the Governors as inconsistent with their obligations to the subscribers and the general public. * St. Bartholomew's Hospital. 46 A similar request was made to another large General hospital on the south side of the Thames,† but with no better result. If this had been otherwise, there would be insurmountable objections from a medical point of view, to one sanitary authority conveying sick persons outside its own boundaries, it being but reasonable and morally equitable that each district should bear its own burdens wherever practicable. In Asiatic cholera, the outset of the disease is frequently rapid, and the symptoms so urgent, that it would be cruel to convey a patient to any distance after the attack had once declared itself; indeed, the sufferer might die en route if collapse had set in. On this point it may be permissible to recapitulate the substance of some remarks contained in a Report of mine dated 8th November, 1892, viz.: — "The risk to life incurred by conveying "patients from their homes to a distant hospital "when once the graver symptoms have set in is "an important factor. † Guy'a Hospital. 47 " In many instances it would mean a destruc" tion of all chance of recovery by inducing " fatal exhaustion, apart from the physical " suffering entailed by such removal. " Imagine a case of acute vomiting and " purging attended by agonising cramp of the " belly and lower extremities, soon to be followed " by still more urgent complications, and it will " be easily comprehended that medical men will " not incur the odium of removing patients in " such circumstances. This is not the place to " say much upon the professional aspect of the " matter, but that the danger just foreshadowed " is not exaggerated will be endorsed by " physicians who have seen, as I have, in the " tropics and elsewhere, the frightful rapidity " with which persons enfeebled by previous " ailments, or their own profligacy, or intern" perance of all kinds, will succumb to cholera. " A few hours only may separate life from " death, and in such a contingency the sufferer " must perforce be treated upon the spot where " he receives his first knock-down blow, be it in " his own home or otherwise 48 This view emphasises the advantage of having a place of refuge near at hand as affording the best chance to the sick man for his recovery, and is, moreover, endorsed by the Local Government Board in the following words:— " Patients suffering from cholera cannot, for " the purpose of removal to hospital, be conveyed " any great distance, and the Board are " advised that it may be laid, down as a " general principle that a mile should be " regarded as the limit of distance that a patient " should be removed." Cholera terminates one way or the other more speedily than almost any disease of its class, so that ordinarily the necessary detention of the patient in hospital is brief, whether recovery takes place or not, and consequently the expense attending cure and convalescence considerably less than obtains with other disorders; much, however, depends upon the physical stamina of the patient at the time. It is a non-contagious disease, or, in other words, not communicable from person to person if well-known precautions be observed. 49 Sketch plans, referred to above, were laid before the Sanitary Committee, approved in their entirety, and subsequently sanctioned by the Court of Common Council. Contracts were entered into and the works at once proceeded with, under the supervision and responsibility of Mr. Engineer (D. J. Ross, Esq.), to whom I feel personally indebted for the liberal-minded way with which—putting aside all feeling of professional etiquette—he adopted the general arrangements and requirements of the building, as shown in my original designs. Reduced copies of these plans are attached hereto, by which the scheme will be readily understood. PLANS. No. 1.—Key Plan.—Indicates the appropriation of the whole of the Mortuary grounds. No.2.—Ground Floor. —Caretaker's apartments, —common room,—laundry and other conveniences ;—with sheds attached to the eastern E 50 end of the Shelter for chemical stores, ambulances, &c., &c. No. 3.—First Floor.—Bed rooms for married persons, children, and adult females,— Caretaker, &c. No. 4.—Second Floor.—Male and female wards (20 beds), bath room and lavatory accommodation. No. 5.—Third Floor.—Reserved for contingencies, without furniture, fittings or fixtures of any kind. Over this a flat roof covered with asphalte is to be constructed, and surrounded with a stone coping and open iron railings. This flat will afford ample accommodation for cisterns and water storage to supply hydrants in case of fire ; it will also be a convenient playground for children, and a drying place in connection with the laundry. Should any emergency arise, and the Public Health Authority be called upon by Her Majesty's Government to appropriate space for the temporary use of sick persons, the stairs leading from the third floor to the roof would 51 be enclosed and an outside staircase erected, so that all communication between this floor and the other portions of the Shelter would be cut off. Temporary buildings for doctors, nurses, and service generally, could easily be fitted with every necessary appliance and accommodation on the flat above. The block assigned to the main structure is so arranged as to prevent its occasional occupants having access to the other buildings in the Mortuary grounds, and the rooms assigned to the Caretaker of the Shelter will be entirely distinct from those of the Keeper of the Mortuary, to avoid any clashing of duties. The Chapel, in which the dead are to be kept in decent custody until they are removed for burial, will be placed in the most convenient position for the relatives, mourners and undertakers ; and in the improbable event (judging from past experience) of more accommodation being wanted in emergencies, there will be sufficient space in the post-mortem room. E 2 52 The internal arrangements depicted in the plans were suggested by practical experience derived from the last seven years' occupation of the Shelter in Cotton Street, and an anxious endeavour to profit by unavoidable omissions and drawbacks observed in that temporary home. They were designed with a view of constructing the requisite buildings in a substantial manner, avoiding undue ornamentation, but embracing modern sanitary improvements, including thorough ventilation, heating, electric lighting, &c., &c. They were drawn to scale under my directions by Sanitary Inspector Gathercole, whose technical skill has been of great service in the matter. No.1. NEW SHELTER &c. No.2 NEW SHELTER &c No.3 NEW SHELTER &c. No.4 NEW SHELTER & c. No.5. NEW SHELTER &c. 53 In 1892 I called the attention of the Sanitary Committee of the late Commissioners of Sewers to the possibility of utilising the ground then unbuilt upon in the City Mortuary enclosure, but they decided to hire the premises in Cotton Street for a time as a tentative measure, find the business of the Shelter has since been carried on there, and will be so until the new buildings are completed. The Corporation, as the Public Health Authority in the City of London, is to be congratulated upon the enlightened policy it has shown in giving the requisite sanction to the construction of an establishment of a permanent character, but like most improvements, this has not been effected without persistent opposition on the part of ill-informed persons who based their action upon imaginary dangers which no amount of persuasion or explanation could overcome. Memorials were presented by misguided objectors from distant and near inhabitants of Cripplegate Ward;—Deputations received by the 54 Sanitary Committee, and subsequently by the Court of Common Council, and all that could be urged by the opponents to the scheme, patiently and courteously listened to and argued ; but the petitioners refused to be comforted, and a public agitation was set afloat which eventuated in an appeal to the Local Government Board to interfere with what was, purely and simply, a determination on the part of the Corporation to carry out its (the Local Government Board's) own Orders. The result of this appeal to Cassar has not yet been made known to the uninitiated, but the irony of the situation remains, and is not the less instructive. In the meantime the Corporation proceeded to carry out its obligations, and on the 16th December last the foundation stone was laid by the Right Honourable Sir Alfred James Newton, Bart., Lord Mayor, supported by the Sheriffs, the Alderman of Cripplegate Ward (Sir Henry Knight), with the assistance of the Chairman (Walter Low, Esq.) and Members of the Sanitary Committee, the principal officers, and a large number of visitors. 55 Without reiterating the advantages which must accrue from the transfer of a temporary to a permanent location for the Shelter for administrative and executive purposes, it may be permissible to recall the fact that during the seven years the work has been carried on as recited above there has not been a single case of sickness or accident, nor has its existence evoked the faintest expression of apprehension from any one of the occupants of surrounding neighbouring premises in Cotton Street, in which the density of population is greater than in Golden Lane, and from which it is only 300 yards distant. I trust, therefore, that the Cripplegate recalcitrants will bend to the logic of facts, and accept the assurance that the work of the new building will be carried on with a scrupulous and honest desire to secure to them the same exemption from risk or annoyance. 56 DISINFECTION, &c., AT CITY MORTUARY. 9,175 articles of bedding, clothing, furniture, &c., were received at Golden Lane and disinfected. 102 bodies were received at the Mortuary, pending interment ; the number for the three preceding years being 94, 131, and 108.

No less than 59,408 gallons of disinfectants were manufactured under my direction at Golden Lane, 58,378 of which were distributed for various purposes throughout the City, 1,030 gallons remaining in stock at the end of the year. The amount paid for the materials employed in making the above was £201 to 31st December. This sum represents an actual saving of 94.4 per cent. on the amount paid to Contractors in 1893 (£1,800), under the old system of purchase of manufactured proprietory preparations. The system, now followed, moreover, possesses an additional advantage, which is of more importance to the public health than economy, namely, saving of time. For the last few years the outlay has included materials purchased for the use of the Cleansing Department in Underground Conveniences, of which considerable quantities are required all the year round, and but for which, the outlay for chemicals employed in the manufacture of 58 disinfectants proper would show a greater contrast. In the event of a sudden occurrence of hot weather the supply is now always equal to the demand—there is no waiting, as formerly was unavoidable—and the requisitions of the Cleansing Department are responded to immediately. Only those who have experienced the trouble and anxiety caused by contractors' tardy deliveries at critical times can adequately gauge the advantage of being able to draw upon one's own stores at a moment's notice. The particulars of the enormous saving to the Corporation by the adoption of my new method in 1894 will be found in the Annual Reports for 1896-7-8, and I refer to it again with some feeling of pride, as I have never invited any official recognition of the same, either complimentary or substantial. CORONER'S COURT. Forty-nine Inquests were held on bodies, 61, 68 and 59 in the years 1896-7-8. No Fire Inquests were held during the year. 59 SANITARY INSPECTIONS.

Full details of this and every other branch of departmental work are laid before each meeting of the Sanitary Committee. 65 OUTBREAK OF ENTERIC FEVER. During the first two months of the year an outbreak of Enteric Fever occurred in a large retail drapery establishment in Holborn Circus, occupying an area of 30,674 square feet. In all, 620 persons of both sexes (339 men and 77 women) were engaged in the business; of these— 416 Sleep and take their meals, 71 Dinner and Tea only, 133 Employed in the building during ordinary working hours, but obtain their meals and sleep elsewhere. The premises are of modern construction, and the general health of the inmates up to last year good, as shown by the fact that during 1897 only two cases of notifiable infectious disease (Scarlet Fever) were reported, and none in 1898 until the 5 th December. On the last named day, a case of Enteric Fever was notified, and the patient, a male of 24 years, at once removed to St. Mary's Hospital. F 66 The man had been ailing some time prior to above date with diarrhoea and other premonitory symptoms, but the diagnosis of fever was not determined earlier. The room, bed, bedding and clothing used by the patient were disinfected the same day. Fifty days later, viz., Monday, the 23rd January, four more cases broke out. Cases were reported in rapid succession on the following dates:— 1899 January 23rd 4 cases „ ,, 25th 4 ,, „ „ 27th 8 „ „ „ 31st 3 „ „ February 1st 4 „ „ „ 3rd 5 „ „ „ 7th 6 „ „ „ 11th 3 ,, „ „ 14th 7 „ „ „ 16th 9 „ The table below shows: (1) the number of the case; (2) the approximate date of attack; (3) the sex; (4) age; (5) departments in which they were engaged; (6) the result; and (7) where treated. 67 No. of Case.

Chart shewing the member of Persons attacked with Enteric Fever between 15th Jan : & 9th Feb : 1899. The columns at the side indicate the number of cases. The curve is constructed on Bloxam's method. 69 It will be seen from the Chart that the outbreak was at its maximum at the commencement, 16th-17th January, and gradually diminished until the 24th-25th January, when a marked recrudescence occurred, reaching its highest point on the 29th January, and then gradually abating until it ceased altogether on the 9th February. The curve shown is constructed on the principle of substituting for each term the mean of three adjoining terms throughout the series. This course has been adopted because in making a graphic representation of the progress of an epidemic, in cases where the terms (by which is meant the number of cases per diem) are small, such an arrangement reduces accidental irregularities which might otherwise obscure the real curve. These curves are arbitrary, and should not be regarded as exact in detail. They, however, illustrate the two maximum periods of infection, viz., 16th-17th January, and 28th-29th of the same month. 70 The dormitories of the persons attacked were situated as under:— P Corridor, on 3rd Floor 5 cases in 5 rooms (all women) B „ „ 3rd „ 9 „ 4 „ (all men) C „ 4th „ 19 „ 13 „ D „ „ 5th „ 14 „ 11 „ E „ „ 6th „ 5 3 „ Waiters' Dormitory 1 1 „ Hatton Garden—additional sleeping accommodation rented by the Firm 1 „ 1 „ 54 38 Distribution of patients in various departments:— Department.

Examinations were made with Widal's test at the Clinical Laboratory at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and other places, and gave the characteristic reaction of the bacillus typhosus. With the exceptions of the case removed to St. Mary's Hospital on the 5th December, the four removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board on the 22nd January, and the four taken two days later to St. Bart.'s, the remaining forty-five cases were treated at Holborn Circus. For the latter purpose a suite of rooms was adapted for use as a temporary hospital, and cut off from all communication with the rest of the house by double folding iron doors, the corridor being approached by a separate stone staircase. 72 Sixteen Nursing Sisters were obtained for night and day work, and two medical men were in almost hourly attendance. Nor was this provision excessive, since at one period five women, and forty men, were in bed under treatment. Respecting the remedial measures adopted in coping with the outbreak from its inception, repeated and thorough inspections were made of the sanitary fittings of the premises, the main drainage in the basement tested as far as possible, the supply of water and system of its storage, milk, butter and other articles of food examined, and bacteriological and physiological investigations made, at a considerable cost. The water-cisterns, having been emptied and cleansed, were charged with a strong solution of chlorinated lime, which was allowed to remain for six hours and subsequently drawn off by the delivery taps, followed by free flushing with clean water. Steam under pressure was also forced through the pipes. 73 The bedrooms were cleansed and disinfected from time to time, and no less than 4,500 articles of bedding, clothing and furniture, hangings, &c., treated at the steam apparatus, Golden Lane, without charge. The premises are supplied by the New River Company upon the "constant" system, and all water used for drinking drawn direct from the rising main, but there are several "draw off" taps in parts of the building, notably the general dining room, and over the lavatory wash-basins. As a rule the latter are only used for personal ablution. Should, however, the main supply be turned off for repairs, there is nothing to prevent the water being used for drinking. Cisterns for storage exist on the upper floors— some of these were very dirty and badly placed. One of the soil pipes on the third floor would not stand the smoke test, and a W.C. in connection with it was foul and choked. The floors of the water-closets were not provided with "safes," so that any overflow would find its way to the floor below. 74 A careful examination of the weekly summary of infectious diseases occurring in those parts of the metropolitan area supplied by the New River Company at the period under review, compared with those furnished by other companies, brings us no nearer to the source of the outbreak we are considering. There is, however, some faint evidence that the case of Typhoid notified on the 5th December had been suffering from diarrhoea and indefinite symptoms probably a week before that date, and may have contaminated the water in the cistern immediately beneath a W.C. on the fourth floor which became choked and overflowed, and having no "safe" or other contrivance to prevent leakage; but it is difficult to connect it with the one that succeeded fifty days later, or much after the ordinary period of incubation. An attempt was made to ascertain if any connection existed between the milk supply (from 45 to 80 quarts per diem) and the outbreak. 75 The establishment was served under a contract by a Dairy Company in the Islington district, and the manager of the dairy, at my request, furnished the following list of farms from which the bulk of their supply was derived, viz.: — Place. County. Population. Kegworth Derby 2,149 Findern „ * Kilbourne „ 1,427 W irks worth „ 3,725 Stanton-by-Bridge „ 116 Etwall „ 641 Kirk Ireton „ 514 Idridgehay „ -* Ashby-de-la-Zouch Leicester 4,535 Stoke Bardolph Nottingham -* Atherstone Warwick 4,491 Uttoxeter Staffordshire 5,516 Castle Gresley, Burton-on-Treut „ 864 Circular letters were at once dispatched to the several Medical Officers of Health in whose districts the above farms were situated, with a view of securing their co-operation in enquiring into their local and sanitary surroundings, but in no case was any evidence obtained that implicated the character of the milk. No reply was received from these places. 76 The health of all the persons engaged on the premises of the dairy at Islington was strictly enquired into, as well as that of their families. When the epidemic first declared itself, the housekeepers at Holborn Circus were instructed in the simplest method of sterilising the whole of the milk in bulk, immediately on its delivery, and on the importance of strict attention to this duty. I made a chemical analysis and found that one sample of milk had been partly skimmed of its butter fat. Bacteriological examination gave negative results, so far as the Typhoid bacillus, and Bacillus Coli, were concerned, but physiological experiments on guinea-pigs inoculated with cultivations prepared from another sample, showed conclusively that it was yielded by a cow suffering from tuberculosis. Enteric Fever has been frequently spread through the agency of milk, and especially cream, and butter milk, in which the Typhoid bacilli increase with almost incredible rapidity, 77 and any butter made from such infected material will as a consequence become contaminated and be the more dangerous, because we cannot sterilise or boil butter as we can milk. The case-mortality amongst the persons attacked in the outbreak now under review was 11 per cent. At first sight this appears low, when compared with 17 per cent. which represents the average (1889-1898) case-mortality amongst patients treated for the same disease at the Metropolitan Asylums Board's and other hospitals; but when the fact is considered, that the deaths in these institutions are largely augmented by those of a great number of ill-nourished, unhealthy children, contributed by all sorts and conditions of persons from an area containing a population of upwards of four millions and a half, and that no weaklings of this description were, from the very nature of the business, employed at Holborn Circus, it must be admitted that the type of the disorder was sufficiently severe to be regarded with interest. 78 Modern investigation of the etiology of Enteric Fever has led to the almost universal belief that in the great majority of epidemics the fons et origo mali is to be found in the foeces and urine [the former to by far the greater extent] which constitute the habitat of the special contagium of Enteric Fever, and by this means the alvine secretions of a Typhoid patient may pollute the drains and sewers, being conveyed thither through the ordinary water channels, unless proper precautions are adopted to disinfect all the dejections at the bedside ; water, therefore, should be regarded as simply a conductor of infected material. Again, a recent theory propounded by a recognised authority on Hygiene, is that the Typhoid bacilli derive their origin and are ever present in myriads in various kinds of subsoil earths, and in this way find ready entrance to the sewers by means of the watercourses, and desseminate death and destruction to whole communities. In support of this rather startling proposition, it is pointed out that Enteric Fever was more prevalent throughout the country generally in 1898 owing to the lack of 79 rain, which favoured the enormous growth of microbes in the soil, where they lay undisturbed by surface wet, rain, &c., and may have infected the atmosphere under certain conditions. Further, we have to deal with the question of infected milk and butter; and, lastly, we must not altogether ignore the possibility of aerial distribution. In the case we are considering the only water, as before said, is derived from the New River Company, the chemical composition of which I have invariably found, after twenty-six years' experience, of good organic purity. I think, therefore, we may exclude the supply as having anything to do with recent outbreak; at the same time we know the extreme rapidity with which water acts as a carrier, should any pathogenic germs escape into it. Reverting to the milk, it appears that of the 71 persons who took their dinner and tea only at Holborn, but did not sleep on the premises, all escaped, although most of them contributed to the consumption of milk The natural 80 inference to be drawn from this fact is, as before stated, that the outbreak was due to some central cause not yet determined. After the fullest enquiry with the means at my disposal, there does not appear any tangible evidence to show that the local epidemic was connected in any way with the water, or milk, supply. The investigation is, however, not complete, and cannot be so until the whole system of drainage has been thoroughly explored, a process which, owing to structural difficulties, has not yet been accomplished. At the commencement of the attack the basement and so much of the general drainage as could be reached was surveyed by two Sanitary Inspectors, accompanied by the builder employed by the owners. Men from the Engineer's Department were also sent up the main sewer, who reported no less than eighteen connections with the main drain running beneath the premises. 81 Only three of these connections showed any indications of being properly trapped, but as the whole of the basement was concreted over it is probable that any defects in the pipes could not be easily detected. On applying the smoke test, sewer gas was found to escape in a disused W.C., next to a bedroom on the fourth floor. This test was not perceptible in the basement, which is probably accounted for by the concrete and impervious floor. On opening the ground in one place a brick receiver was discovered, and doubtless several others exist in various parts of the building. One rain-water pipe was found in use as a soil pipe, with several waste pipes running into it. Another W.C. on the dining room floor was found in an offensive condition. The urinals in the basement are not satisfactory, and would, without constant care, be a source of nuisance. G 82 Most of the defects herein indicated have been remedied to my satisfaction since this matter was first reported upon last summer. In the interest of all concerned, the whole of the drainage in the basement should be reconstructed upon modern principles. This, however, is a matter that more properly comes within the province of your Engineer, to whom the question has been referred, with instructions to call upon the Firm to prepare a scheme and submit the same for the joint approval of the Sanitary Committee, the Engineer, and myself. In conclusion, it affords me pleasure to acknowledge the personal courtesy shown by the medical men in attendance, during the many weeks the epidemic lasted, who were ever ready with the fullest information and assistance under very trying circumstances. 83 HOUSE CISTERNS FOR WATER STORAGE. In October, 1898, I reported upon the absence of domestic cisterns in 89 houses at the following places, viz.: 29 in Bishopsgate Street Without— 8 in Brushfield Street-4 in George and Catherine Wheel Alley—1 in Great Alie Street—2 in Little Somerset Court—20 in Mansell Street—14 in Montague Court—10 in Mason's Court, and 1 in Spital Yard. The necessity for this provision arose from a scarcity of the water derived from the East London Water Company during the exceptionally dry summer season, the supply being only furnished for a limited time at certain periods of the day. The want of these receptacles for storing water occasioned much suffering in the poorer districts, owing to its intermittent delivery. G 2 84 The Sanitary Committee at once recognised the importance of seeking action, and under the powers conferred upon them by the City of London Sewers Acts, 1848, 1851, gave an order that in all the above-mentioned dwellings cisterns should be erected without delay. After much negotiation the owners of 59 houses supplied the deficiency without coercion, but in 18 instances it was not until pressure was put upon unwilling landlords by the issuing of "compulsory" orders that this was effected. In five cases, however, the owners proved obstinate, and the Public Health Department was driven to the only alternative of ordering the works to be executed by its contractors, and in due course the defaulters will be sued for the cost thereof, as the law provides. The question of doing away with cisterns in domiciles has exercised the minds of owners of house property and others, who argue that a "constant service" ensures a purer supply of water; and so it certainly does when cisterns 85 are improperly placed under inaccessible roofs or beneath floors, without efficient protection from weather, dust, droppings of animals, or other sources of pollution; but if they are constructed in positions where they can be easily inspected and frequently cleansed, we may concede the point, but it is only the commonest of common sense to insist upon some relief from the tyranny of the Water Companies, who, whilst charging the maximum of tax justified by inequitable legislation, give in return the minimum of accommodation in periods of water famine, or when any accidental disruption occurs in their mains or other mechanical appliances; in other words, when the so-called "constant service" becomes irregular. What is the tenant to do under this contingency ? The poor have neither the means nor the leisure to collect and store water for use during the intermissions of supply, and to them the want of water entails an amount of discomfort and uncleanliness that emphasises the bitterness of want and misery. 86 UNSOND FOOD. Four hundred and fifty-two cartloads of unsound food were removed by the Cleansing Department arid destroyed as trade refuse at Letts' Wharf, at the written request and expense of the owners. The material so disposed of comprised:— Vegetables and Fruit 374 loads Condensed Milk 35 „ Fish 11 „ Cheese 2 „ Miscellaneous 30 „ Total 452 loads The quantity of material dealt with under the above circumstances was considerably in excess of that for the two previous years, the number of loads being 325, 250 and 452 for the years 1897, 1898 and 1899 respectively. 87 The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 47 (8), directs :— "Where a person has in his possession any article "which is unsound or unwholesome, or unfit for the food "of man, he may, by written notice to the Sanitary "Authority, specifying such article and containing a "sufficient identification of it, request its removal, and "the Sanitary Authority shall cause it to be removed as " if it were trade refuse." Under Section 33 of the same Act the owner shall pay a reasonable sum for such removal, which in case of dispute is to be settled by a Petty Sessional Court. To avoid any possible misconception as to the ultimate disposition of the above, I have given instructions that every description of food [fruit, vegetables, tinned goods, &c.] seized as unsound or unwholesome and conveyed to Letts' Wharf shall be destroyed there in the presence of the Sanitary Inspector seizing the same. It will be apparent that this Order does not apply to the Inspectors of Meat. 88 VENTILATING SHAFTS, etc. Mr. Engineerreports three additional shafts were fixed in front of adjacent buildings to enable the sewer ventilating gratings in roadways to be closed, thereby affording considerable relief from nuisance to residents in the vicinity. There are now 314 of these shafts in the City. Also, that 156 premises were newly drained. A large number of drainage and other sanitary improvements were likewise dealt with by my own department, but these relate to the interior of buildings only. PUBLIC WATEIl-CLOSKTS. Twenty-four Underground conveniences in the City, containing 258 compartments as urinals, and 168 water-closets, now exist, and others are contemplated. 89 The accommodation for women includes 33 water-closets, with lavatory appliances ; and the system will be extended as opportunities afford. The exact position of the places for females is shown on the map in the Appendix, and are distinguished from those provided for men. I record this advance with much satisfaction. The subject of providing W.C's for women was for the first time strongly advocated in a Report of mine to the Commissioners of Sewers twenty years ago. At that date (November, 1879) my recommendation, although concurred in by many Commissioners, was not adopted, the matter being referred to the late Engineer, who reported adversely on the subject. As time passed, it was evident that public sentiment was sufficiently strong to impress upon the Commissioners the necessity of making suitable provision for both sexes; but it was 90 not until August, 1893, that the requisite accommodation was instituted. The increasing demand for such Conveniences for women is illustrated by the following facts. During 130 days in 1893 each W.C. at the Holborn site was used, on an average, by 10.1 women daily. In the corresponding period of last year the average number of women using the same W.C's was 15.7 daily, or an increase of 56 per cent. From October, 1897, to October, 1899,216,836 women used the W.C's provided for them, and nearly 1,000/. was received in pence from females alone in relief of the outlay incurred by the Corporation for the construction of these places. In 1899, the amount received from the users, by both sexes, in the City was no less than 6,339/. 16s. 6d. 91 HOUSE REFUSE REMOVAL. The Superintendent of Cleansing reports that the refuse removed from the City in 1899 consisted of 29.577 cart-loads of street sweepings and slop, and 45,044 loads of house and trade refuse ; total, 74,621. Of this bulk, 22,481, loads were consumed by the Destructor at Letts' Wharf. Refuse Dealt with During 1899 and Previous Five Years. Year. Street Sweepings and Slop. House and Trade Refuse. Total.

This skip system for house refuse removal, which commenced in 1892, has been extended as circumstances demanded, and much benefit has accrued to the persons for whose relief the method was adopted. The public dust-bins, which were, from their misuse, a nuisance and a constant source of trouble, have been abolished. Up to the end of the year 773 of these skips had been supplied in the poorer neighbourhoods without charge, and 451 were paid for by ratepayers : total 1,224. SIIMJIE1I FLUSHING OF COUNTS, Ac. The flushing of the more thickly-populated and poorer parts of the City during the hot months was carried on as usual, followed by the use of deodorants in the channels running through the courts and alleys, &c. 93 In this service, but including the streets, 29,439,551 gallons of water were used, and many thousand gallons of disinfectants were employed. Forty-eight places were so treated in the East District; thirty-seven in the Middle District; and eighty-jive in the West District. Total 170. The entrances to forty-jive courts were cleansed and lime-washed, viz. : twelve in the East District; six in the Middle District; and twenty-seven in the West District. A list of places dealt with are subjoined. In Lower Thames Street, and especially in the neighbourhood of Billingsgate Market and the Custom House, road flushing was freely employed and deodorants subsequently used at least twice in twenty-four hours, it being always difficult to keep the place free from nuisance caused by the leakages from the fish carts, which rapidly decompose and smell abominably, to the great disgust of the traders and the public. 94 SUMMER FLUSHING OF COURTS AND ALLEYS.

In my Report for 1898 will be found a resume of the Factories and Workshops Acts so far as they relate to the obligations of Sanitary Authorities; at the same time it was pointed out that, in spite of attempts on the part of the Legislature (in 1878 and 1896), there still remained a strong necessity for further codification. Another Bill dealing with these places has since been introduced in the House of Commons by the Government, in addition to which four other Bills have been prepared by private members. There is only one provision in the Government Bill to which attention need be drawn, viz., Clause 23, in which it is proposed, that— "After the first day of January, 1904, an "underground bakehouse shall not be used "unless certified by the Sanitary Authority "to be of suitable construction for that "purpose, &c." 101 This is intended as a compromise for dealing with a vexed question of many years' standing, being an attempt to modify an admitted evil and an obvious and much-needed improvement, without prematurely interfering with the interest of traders, who will have three years in which to adapt their bakehouses to modern requirements. Whether the Legislature may pass the Bill or not, no Sanitary Authority should permit the use of any underground bakehouse, such a situation being opposed to health and decency. The following are the particulars of defects found in factories and workshops, and reported to me by H. M. Inspectors; also the steps taken by my department to effect improvement. Fifty-five cases were thus notified in the course of the year, compared with sixty-five in 1898, and thirty-four in 1897, distributed as under:— EAST DISTRICT. Situation of Premises.

The Corporation of London is the Local Authority in the City for the purpose of regulating the sanitary condition of Dairies and Milk Shops, under the Dairies, Cow Sheds, and Milk Shops Order of 1885, and the work of inspection is at present carried out by Officers appointed by the County Purposes Committee. I repeat the recommendation made in former years that this duty should belong to the Public Health Department—the Sanitary Authority for the City—as a legally qualified Sanitary Inspector is more competent to deal satisfactorily with the matter than an Officer whose duties are confined to the supervision of Weights and Measures. During the year the Inspectors of Weights and Measures visited 379 Dairies and Milk Shops, being 13 more than in 1898. Of these, 349 were registered at Guildhall, 23 were unregistered, and 7 either closed or demolished. The occupiers of the unregistered premises have since complied with the regulations. k 2 132 These shops were also visited periodically by the Sanitary Inspectors, with a view of discovering and remedying any defects found in the general arrangements of the premises. The Milk sold at these places is under the constant supervision of the Inspectors appointed under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, details of which will be found in my Report as Public Analyst (vide page 163). BAKEHOUSES, Bakehouses are workshops under Sections 34, 35 and 81 of the Factory and Workshop Act of 1878, and, as such, subject to the authority of the Public Health Department. The proposed amendment in the law relating to these places, now under the consideration of Parliament, is referred to in page 100 of this Report, under the heading of Factories and Workshops. 133 There are 40 bakehouses in the City of London, viz.:—14 in the West Sanitary District, 10 in the Middle, and 16 in the East District, located as shown in the following Table :— WEST DISTRICT.

SMOKE NUISANCES. Twenty-four cases liable to be dealt with under your statutory powers have been reported, viz., 1 in the East, 17 in the Middle, and 6 in the West District. All were formally declared by the Sanitary Committee "nuisances" within the meaning of sec. 24 (b) of the Public Health (London) 135 Act, 1891, in consequence of the emission of "black smoke," and Notices were served in due course in each instance. This work involved 151 separate inspections by the officer specially detailed for the prevention of smoke nuisances. The figures mentioned above show a marked improvement over those for the previous year, when 59 nuisances of this class were dealt with, and 4 prosecutions were instituted. In 1899 no summonses were taken out. MEAT SUPPLIES. The total quantity of meat delivered at the Corporation Markets, Smithfield, during 1899, amounted to 405,456 tons 9 cwts. 2 qrs. against 400,112 tons 9 cwts. 3 qrs. in the previous year, being an increase of 1.33 per cent. The corresponding percentages for 1897 and 1898 were 3.3 and 1.73 respectively. The Markets were open for business 307 days, so that the average supply per diem was about 1,321 tons. 136 Table showing the annual deliveries and other details since I have held office during the past 26 years:— MEAT SUPPLIES, 1874 TO 1899.

The proportion of English country and town killed supplies is still declining, and the Australian and New Zealand imports maintain the average, but for the first time a marked increase is shown in the percentage of American and Foreign deliveries. These figures illustrate two facts: first, that the inhabitants of London are now more dependent than formerly upon the dead meat supply for their daily consumption, the weight 139 passing through the Central Markets being 2¾ times as much as it was in 1871, whilst the population is about 1⅓ times as great; the second is, that as the sources of supply become more distant, the risk of the meat arriving at market in an unsatisfactory condition is greater, and, therefore, the proportion of bad to good meat will rise. The Inspectors seized 1,172 tons 5 cwts. 2 qrs. as unfit for the food of man, classified as under :— Tons Per cent. Putrid meat 1,034½ 88.2 Diseased meat 95 8.1 Unsound from accident or causes other than above 42½ 3.7 1,172 100.0 The principles which govern the seizure and destruction of meat actually diseased from constitutional, parasitical, specific, endemic, or sporadic causes are immutable, being founded upon fixed laws of pathology as old as 140 Hippocrates, and all the special pleading of graziers, butchers, and their abettors cannot, and should not, prevail against the practical and wide experience of officials whose plain duty is to protect the public from the consequences of eating meat charged with pathogenic microbes, irrespective of the pecuniary losses to those whose goods are sacrificed. The question of compensation to innocent dealers is one that should command universal sympathy, but it forms no justification for laxity in the discharge of their duty on the part of the meat inspectors. It should be remembered that in the Central Market we only see dead meat in which every vestige of the morbid products of disease is frequently carefully and cunningly removed by unscrupulous consignors, and, therefore, we are driven to adopt a high standard of excellence in determining whether meat of a suspicious character should be sold for human consumption. 141 The responsibility involved in the fearless and faithful performance of a disagreeable and sometimes invidious duty cannot be over-estimated, and I claim for your officers that they are never unmindful or indifferent to the obligations cast upon them. Unfortunately, there is a tendency on the part of interested persons to dispute the conclusions arrived at with respect to the sale of meat from a tuberculous animal that may have been slaughtered before the general mass of muscular tissue has become involved, and looks fresh, and, to an uneducated eye, wholesome ; but these objections have no place in my mind, although one regrets to observe from time to time an opposition on the part of offenders of the nature of an appeal from the judgment of Medical Officers of Health to a class of men whose professional training applies more to quadrupeds than to bipeds, and whose interference savours somewhat of presumption. The question of allowing meat to be sold in the City Markets from an animal in any portion 142 of whose carcass tubercles have been discovered at the time of slaughtering is one of great moment, and involves serious risks to the public health. I feel, therefore, impelled to refer to it specifically for the reason that of late there has been a tendency for veterinary surgeons, or their subordinates, to certify that unless the whole mass of muscular tissue shows signs of degeneration, the meat may be eaten with impunity if properly cooked. The advocates for the sale of meat so diseased attempt to justify their position by the convenient theory of what they call "localised tuberculosis," a proposition based upon the inexcusable ignorance of the elementary principles of physiological induction. No competent pathologist would dare to assert that when pathogenic micro-organisms have once entered the body of an animal, one part of its anatomy (the muscles) is free from infection, and another part (the viscera) infected: the force of absurdity can go no further than this ! ! 143 To obviate any possible misconception on this point it must be clearly understood that under no circumstances, nor from any quarter, malgré the certificate of a veterinarian will tuberculous meat be passed by myself, or inspectors, at any of the dead meat markets within the jurisdiction of the Corporation of London; and, further, that any person, irrespective of his rank, attempting to poison the public with such stuff, will be prosecuted and rendered liable to fine or imprisonment. The conclusion arrived at by the Congress of Paris in 1888, and the subsequent adoption of the principles above enunciated by the largest municipalities, at home and abroad, fully justify the foregoing remarks. In all courtesy, and in full recognition of the great advances made in veterinary science during the last two or three decades, I respectfully submit that the training and education of its votaries afford no justification for the assumption of opinions antagonistic to the experience of the practical physician. 144 Some idea of the magnitude of the work of the Inspectors may be obtained from the following figures copied from the Annual Report of the Market Superintendent :— 1897. 1898. 1899.

One ton in every 346 tons of meat paying toll in the Central Markets, Smithfield, was condemned last year, as compared with one ton in 452 in 1898, which affords satisfactory testimony to the increased vigilance and efficiency of the Inspectorial Staff. 145 CENTRAL MARKETS, SMITHFIELD.

The seizures of diseased and unsound meat have also been on a scale without precedent, having amounted to 1,172 tons 5 cwts. 2 qrs., against 884 tons 1 cwt. in 1898, the heaviest weight previously recorded being in 1897, when 918 tons 3 cwts. 3 qrs. were seized.

The following table illustrates this:— Population. 1871. 1899. Increase Tons cwts. qrs. Tons cwts. qrs. Dead Meat supply 147,491 0 0 405,514 0 0 175 Meat seized 59 2 0 1,172 5 2 1884 DISPOSAL OF CONDEMNED MEAT The 1,172 tons 5 cwts. 2 qrs. of condemned meat was disposed of to the same firm that has held the contract for many years. The amount received for it was £2,735 7s. 3d. as compared with £2,059 2s. 5d. in 1898, £2,392 3s. 6d. in 1897, £2,352 4s. 4d. 149 in 1896, and £1,572 7s. 6d. in 1895, against which must be placed the expenses incurred by the Corporation in the execution of their responsibility, to wit: Salaries of Inspectors; chemicals for disinfecting baths; cost of horses, vans and haulage; rentals of condemned meat sheds; repairs; a daily outlay, frequently heavy, for porterage to convey the condemned stock from the shops of the salesmen to the sheds for disinfection before removal to the factory of the contractor at West Ham, and incidentals, &c. IMPORTATION OF RABBITS The importation of rabbits into this country continues to increase. Over two millions were imported from Australia and New Zealand last year, which were valued at £60,000. Frequently 20,000 are daily received at the freezing stores during the non-breeding season; they arrive in cases or crates, each crate containing about 24 rabbits. 150 The examination of these rabbits should be conducted by competent meat inspectors at the port of entry, and this can only be done when they are partially thawed from the freezing chambers. I am assured that agents, surveyors of consignors, or any persons having an insurable interest in the animals, find it impossible to examine them for any defect or disease until many hours after they are landed from the freezing chambers, owing to their frozen condition. Long experience shows that rabbits are not so free from suspicion of disease as other frozen meats—sheep, beef, lamb, &c. It is obvious, therefore, that no inspection can be of the least practical use unless conducted by specially qualified inspectors of meat, and that this process, for the reasons above stated, should be carried out at the wharf when the crates are first landed from the ship. The supervision of these imports could not be efficiently carried on at Smithfield with our present staff ; but apart from this consideration, 151 I have no hesitation in advising that they should not be allowed to pass out of the jurisdiction of the Port Sanitary Authority, if there is any reason to doubt their soundness, and should by any accident the transit of such goods escape the vigilance of the Port officers, the Medical Officer of Health of the district into which they may have been conveyed should be notified of their removal, and requested to have them examined at the place where they are offered for sale. In some consignments we have dealt with at the Central Markets the proportion of bad or doubtful rabbits examined has been 20 per cent. The "wasted" Australian sheep referred to in last Annual Report came this year in still greater numbers (see my monthly printed Reports, Nos. 20 and 21); many were condemned; some of them, though not absolutely injurious as food, were almost destitute of nutritive property, and are regarded by many shippers as tending to injure the trade by furnishing some justification for the idea so prevalent in some minds that "all frozen meat is rubbish." The practice of keeping meat 152 in cold stores for long periods with a view of its selling at a better price frequently renders it mouldy, and sometimes almost valueless. If frozen Colonial meat is to compete successfully with any except very inferior Continental produce, it should be in the hands of the consumers as quickly as possible after being landed. Steps are in contemplation with a view to the demolition of the Slaughterhouses in Aldgate with their inevitable abominations of Pounds, Lairs, and Dung-pits; a procedure which will also abolish the dangerous nuisance caused by cattle passing through crowded City thoroughfares, and over the pavements leading to the shops. The prominent success of the Foreign Cattle Market at Deptford as a slaughtering place for the Jews, takes away the last valid reason why the Aldgate abattoirs should be continued. I am sanguine enough to predict that, if spared, I shall be able in my next Annual Report 153 to felicitate the Corporation upon its relief from the long-standing reproach of allowing such a grievous scandal to continue in its midst. An additional Inspector of Slaughterhouses and Meat was appointed in May last, and the staff now consists of seven specially qualified officers, who are solely engaged in the supervision of the meat supplies in the City. FISH SUPPLIES. 179,983 tons of fish, of which 129,469 were land-borne and 50,514 water-borne, were received at or near Billingsgate Market during the year. This was an increase of 15,152 tons over the average of the previous five years, but was 2,584 tons less than the total for 1898. 154 Of the above, 148,088 tons were consigned to Billingsgate Market, the remainder, viz., 31,895, being delivered at the salesmen's shops in the neighbourhood of the Market. The decrease in the year's deliveries noted above is occasioned by large a falling-off in the weight of fish sent to the dealers outside the Market, but there was a slight increase in the amount consigned direct to the Market. These figures can be more readily understood from the following Table :— Year. Fish Delivered at Billingsgate Market. Fish Delivered in the neighbourhood of Billingsgate Market. Total Deliveries.

I venture to believe that in doing so I have in no instance overstepped the allegiance, and respect due to the Honourable Corporation it is my pride and pleasure to serve and advise. The Local Government Board have prescribed a definite formulary for the guidance of Medical Officers of Health, in a departmental memorandum dated December, 1899, the salient features of which are as follows, viz.:— " Every Medical Officer of Health is required "to make an annual report for the year ending "the 31st December. The report is to be made "to the Sanitary Authority, and the Medical "Officer of Health himself should send a copy "of it to the Local Government Board and to "the London County Council. The Board's "copy of the report should be forwarded to them " when the original is sent to the Sanitary 159 "Authority, except where the report is likely "to be printed by order of the Authority, when "the Board need only be supplied with a "printed copy. It is very desirable that the "Annual Report should be printed, in order "that a supply of copies may be available for "distribution among the members of the "Sanitary Authority and other persons in"terested. "The sanitary history of the year under "review should include a record alike of the "proceedings of the Medical Officer of Health "himself and of the proceedings taken under " his direction or advice. "What has been said above with regard "to the information which an annual report "should contain must be understood, not as "suggesting that the report should be limited "to these subjects, or that more detailed or "differently arranged tabular statements may "not be added, but as indicating the sort of "information required by the Board's Order. "Many Medical Officers of Health will 160 "doubtless, with great advantage to the adminis"tration of their districts, furnish much more "detailed information respecting particular "questions to which they have been led by the "circumstances of the foregoing years to devote ''attention, or in the investigation of which "they may have arrived at valuable con"elusions. Any information of this kind will "be appreciated by the Local Government "Board." I am, Your obedient Servant, Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C.

In two of these the summonses were withdrawn upon technical grounds; but convictions were obtained, in the remaining seven, and fines imposed from 5s. to £5 and costs. One sample of Margarine was collected at the premises of George Outten, provision dealer, 38, Mansell Street, Aldgate, labelled contrary to the Margarine Act, in addition to which the Inspector reports that the dealer's stock of the same parcel was not labelled in any way. The following is the Report of Inspector Ralph, to which I have added the statutory certificate of analysis as required by the Margarine Act (50 and 51 Vict., cap. 29):— "I beg to report that on Friday, January 20th inst., "I visited a small general provision shop, No. 38, "Mansell Street, Aldgate, occupied by Mr. George "Outten, and asked for 1 lb. of Butter, but received the "reply: 'I have not got any.' I then asked for 1 lb. "of Margarine, which was served, and I paid the sum "of l0d. for it. I told the occupier I was an Inspector "under the Food and Drugs Act, and had purchased "the Margarine for the purpose of it being analysed by "the Public Analyst, and offered to divide the same " into three parts, which was accepted. 167 "I divided the Margarine into three parts, labelled, "sealed and stamped, and gave one portion to the seller, "one to the Public Analyst, and retained one for " myself. "The Margarine was served in a piece of paper by "Mr. Outten, who wrote the word 'Margerine' (sic) "on the outside with a lead pencil; but after the "purchase was completed, he offered to write it in ink, "and remarked: 'He should have to buy a stamp.' "There were no labels or marks of any kind visible to "acquaint intending purchasers whether it was Margarine "or Butter, and it was taken from a box in view of " customers in quantity from 3 to 4 lbs. CERTIFICATE. "I, the undersigned, PUBLIC ANALYST for the "CITY OF LONDON, do hereby certify that I "received on the 20th day of January, 1899, from "Inspector W. H. Ralph, a sample of Margarine for "analysis (which then weighed about five ounces), and "have analysed the same, and declare the result of my " analysis to be as follows :— " The sample consisted of Margarine. "The word 'Margerine' (sic) was written in pencil " on the wrapper. "No change has taken place in the constitution of " the sample that would interfere with the analysis. "As Witness my hand this 24th day of January, " 1899. "W. SEDGWICK SAUNDERS, M.D." On the 13th February, 1899, the defendant 168 appeared at the Mansion House in answer to two summonses taken out by Mr. Solicitor, under your instructions. In the first, the defendant was charged with selling Margarine in a package not "durably" marked, as prescribed by the Act; and, secondly, for exposing Margarine for sale by retail, the same not being branded, or marked in such a manner as to be visible to the purchaser. The charges were heard before Sir Joseph Savory, and the defendant was convicted and fined 5.v. and 2s. costs on each summons. At the date of my last Annual Report a Bill was under consideration by the legislature for amending the law relating to sale of food and drugs, which subsequently passed both Houses, and received the Royal Assent on the 9th August, 1899, as the 62 & 63 Vict., c. 51, 1899, the Act to come into force on and after the 1st January, 1900. 169 A summary of the above was presented by me to the Sanitary Committee on the 28th November, 1899, supplemented by a further statement on the 23rd January. At the close of the year it was ordered that a Notice be published calling attention of wholesale dealers in Margarine, or Margarine Cheese, to the obligations imposed upon the Trade by the new Act, and accordingly the following was approved and circulated :— "NOTICE. " To Wholesale Dealers in Margarine or " Margarine Cheese. "SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1899. "Under the provisions of Section 7 (1) of the above "Act, every occupier of a manufactory of Margarine or "Margarine Cheese, and every wholesale dealer in such "substances, shall, on and after the 1st January, 1900, "keep a register showing the quantity and destination "of each consignment of such substances sent out from "his manufactory or place of business, and this register "shall be open to the inspection of any officer of the " Board of Agriculture. 170 "By Sub-section 3, if any such occupier or dealer fails "to keep such a register, or to produce it when required, "or to keep the register posted up to date, or wilfully "makes any false entry or fraudulent omission, he shall "be liable on summary conviction for the first offence to "fine not exceeding £10, and for any subsequent " offence to a fine not exceeding £50. "By Sub-section 4, all wholesale dealers in Margarine "or Margarine Cheese are required, on and after the "1st January, 1900, to register their premises with the "local authority, which in the City of London is the "Corporation of London, at the Office of the Town "Clerk (Public Health Department), Guildhall, in the " said City. "Any person found guilty of an offence under this "Section shall be liable on summary conviction for the "first offence to a fine not exceeding £20, and for the "second offence to a fine not exceeding £50, and for the "third or any subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding "£100. In certain circumstances the offender is liable "to imprisonment with or without hard labour for a " period not exceeding three months. " MONCKTON. " Guildhall." In response to this Notice a number of firms applied at Guildhall for registration, when a not entirely unexpected difficulty arose. 171 The Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, extends the provision of the Margarine Act of 1887 to Margarine Cheese; and Section 9 of the same Act is also made to extend to wholesale dealers in Margarine or Margarine Cheese, whereas in the past manufacturers of Margarine only were required to register. Section 9 of the Margarine Act, 1887, enacts, that manufactories of Margarine shall be registered from "time to time" in such manner as the Local Government Board may direct, and when this section came into operation in 1888 the Local Government Board gave very precise directions as to the manner of registration, and required the local authorities to issue licences to the firms inscribed on the register. Some months ago I made inquiries at Whitehall to ascertain if the Local Government Board intended to issue any instructions respecting the registration of wholesale dealers of Margarine and Margarine Cheese, and was there advised that under the circumstances a letter should be 172 addressed by the Town Clerk to them on the subject. This suggestion was adopted, and in due course a communication was received from Whitehall stating that the Local Government Board would give the necessary instructions. The matter now rests until such instructions are sent; in the meantime the names of persons applying to be placed on the register are received at this office, but no licences are issued. A question has been raised, "What is a wholesale dealer?" There are many firms nominally carrying on a wholesale trade in Margarine who never have an ounce of that substance on their premises from one year's end to another. This is explained by the common practice of traders dispensing with a warehouse, the railway companies offering ample facilities for storage at their depots. All the books and accounts, however, are kept at the City offices of the merchants. 173 Others, who call themselves "Agents," conduct large business operations in the City with foreign Margarine manufacturers. They buy and sell to other firms in this country, but the Margarine so dealt in does not enter their premises, and is rarely seen by them. Section 7 (1) of the Food and Drugs Act, 1899, requires that every occupier of a manufactory of Margarine, or Margarine Cheese, and every wholesale dealer in such substances, shall keep a register, showing the quantity and destination of each consignment of such substances sent out from his manufactory or place of business. It will appear from the above that the wholesale dealer has only to register Margarine actually passing in and out of his "place of business," and unless the railway companies are to be classed as dealers and made to conform to the Act, an immense quantity of imported Margarine will escape registration altogether. 174 The question whether articles of food should be dealt with as being adulterated in cases where a foreign ingredient has been added with the object of improving their appearance, or, in cases of perishable articles, for retarding decomposition, has, during the past year, been much discussed both by manufacturers and the public. As a consequence the Local Government Board referred the subject to a Departmental Committee. This Committee, known as the "Preservatives Committee," is now sitting with the object of inquiring into the use of preservatives and colouring matters in the preservation and colouring of food, and many samples of articles of food have been taken in the City, at the request of the Committee, by your Inspectors of Food and Drugs, who up to the present have sent, through me, 39 samples, including cheese, condensed milk, bacon, potted meats, tinned rabbit, preserved fruits, beer, wine, and lard, to the Government Laboratories. 175 The circumstances under which your Inspectors were employed in taking these samples for the Local Government Board is fully explained in the following correspondence. On the 10th August last, I received a communication, as under, from the Secretary of the Preservatives Committee, with whom I have been in communication for some time past:— "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W., "8th August, 1899. "Sir, "I am desired by Sir Herbert Maxwell to com"municate with you in the following circumstances:— "The President of this Board has appointed a "Departmental Committee (with Sir Herbert Maxwell "as Chairman) to inquire into the use of preservatives "and colouring matters in the preservation and colouring "of food, and to report (1) whether the use of such "materials, or any of them, for the preservation and "colouring of food, in certain quantities, is injurious to "health, and if so, in what proportions does their use "become injurious; (2) to what extent and in what "amounts are they so used at the present time. "Having regard to the importance of the inquiry thus "entrusted to them, the Committee are very desirous of "receiving information as to the names, nature, and "amounts of such preservatives and colouring matters 176 "admixed with foods of one and another class that may "have come, or may during the next few months come, "to your notice in connection with your work under the "Sale of Food and Drugs Acts. "The Committee are especially desirous of learning of "any fresh experiences in the direction indicated during "the prevalence of hot weather, and also of receiving "data as to the relative frequency and amounts of "admixtures of the sort in question in foods which form " the subject of Sunday trading. "The Committee will accordingly be glad to receive "any information with which you will be good enough "to furnish them at an early date, and from time to "time during the ensuing twelve months, with reference "to the foregoing points, or any of them. "I am, Sir, "Your obedient Servant, "CHAS. J. HUDDART, "Secretary of the Committee. "Dr. Sedgwick Saunders, "Public Analyst." It appears that at the outset of their inquiries, the Committee found they did not possess the proper machinery for collecting samples from merchants and others. In this difficulty the Secretary addressed a letter to the Town Clerk inviting the assistance and co-operation of my Department. 177 "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W., "12th August, 1899. "Dear Sir, "The Departmental Committee appointed by the "President of this Board to inquire into the use of "preservatives and colouring matters in foods, regard it "of great importance that samples of imported foods "coming foreign should be taken at some of our ports "for the purposes of analysis. "The Committee have been in communication with "Her Majesty's Customs on the subject, and have "obtained their co-operation in so far as they can give "it, namely, the Customs' Officers at the ports in ques"tion have been instructed to afford information as to "the consignees of certain foods, in order to the purchase "of samples, if possible, from such consignees. "The Committee much wish that your Town Council "should aid them in effecting the purchase of these "samples, and will be glad if to this end an Inspector "can be deputed to execute this important part of the "work for them. "Feeling sure that there will be no difficulty in the "way, I purpose coming to see you on Tuesday of next "week, and shall hope to call at your office about "12 o'clock on that day. "I snail be glad if you can arrange for the Inspector "who would be deputed for the purpose in view to be at "your office on the occasion, so that, if the Town "Council see their way to grant the desire of the "Committee, he will be in possession of the necessary N 178 "details as to the methods of procedure, &c. The "matter is really a most urgent one by reason of the "present hot weather, and the Committee wish to place "the business in train as speedily as possible. My visit "in anticipation of your Council's action will in the end "expedite matters, seeing that the Inspector will be "ready to proceed with the duty at once on receiving "instructions from the Council. "Any expenses entailed in carrying out the duty will, "of course, be recouped by the Committee. "I am, Dear Sir, "Yours faithfully, "(Signed) CHAS. J. HUDDART, "Secretary of Committee. "The Town Clerk, "Guildhall, E.C." On the 22nd August a somewhat similar communication reached me:— "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W., "19th August, 1899. "Dear Sir, "The Departmental Committee appointed by the "President of this Board for the purpose of inquiring "into the use of preservatives and colouring matters in "food, are anxious to secure from the consignees "samples of imported goods coming from foreign "countries. The Committee regard this matter as of "very special importance, and they therefore desire me "to ask your aid in obtaining the requisite samples. 179 "The Board of Customs have made arrangements "whereby I shall be informed of the names and "addresses of consignees of the imported articles "appearing on the enclosed list. They have also under"taken to give me such facts as to markings of each "importation as they possess, as will enable it to be at "once recognised by the consignee. "What the Committee desire is that you will be good "enough to depute an inspector to make attempt to "purchase samples of these imported goods from the "consignees who chance to have their places of business "in your district. "Any sale by the consignees would, of course, be "voluntary, and a refusal to sell would end the matter "so far as the Committee are concerned. But the "Committee think that, if the inspector were to state "the purposes for which the samples are desired, namely, "for analysis with a view to determining the amount "and character of preservative used in foods, little "opposition need be feared on the part of the consignee, "especially when he is informed that the results of the "analysis are for the purposes of the Committee only, "and in no case for the taking of any legal proceedings. "Anticipating the aid which I feel sure you will "render in the matter, I beg to enclose, in addition to "the list of articles already mentioned, a few instructions "to aid the appointed inspector in proceeding to secure "the samples. "In the event of your concurrence, I will myself "transmit to the inspector whose name and address you "may give me, information as to the names and addresses N 2 180 "of consignees from time to time, also the names of the "articles to be sampled, and any note as to marking "that the Customs may have sent to me. "I would ask that you kindly inform me so soon as "you can as to the result of your consideration of this "letter, and of the name and address of any inspector "deputed to see to the matter. "Recoupment of any outlay in this matter will, of "course, be made by the Committee. " I am, Dear Sir, " Yours faithfully, " CHAS. J. HUDDART, "Secretary to the Committee. "Dr. W. Sedgwick Saunders, "13, Queen Street, Cheapside, E.C." To this I replied, on the 23rd August, in these terms:— "Public Health Department, "Guildhall, "23rd August, 1899. "Dear Sir, "My Secretary has forwarded to me here your "letters of 19th inst., and I write to assure you that "on my return to work at Guildhall on 4th prox., I will "enter at once on the business in hand and give all the "assistance in my power. I may, however, at once say, "that I cannot consent to the Inspectors engaged "reporting direct to you, it being essential, as a matter "of departmental discipline, that all communications "connected with their work should pass through my 181 "hands, I undertaking that this cause shall not delay "any information it is desirable to lay before your "Committee. "I am, Dear Sir, " Yours truly, "WM. SEDGWICK SAUNDERS. "C. J. Huddart, Esq., "Local Government Board" "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W., "28th August, 1899. "Dear Sir, "I have to acknowledge the receipt, on behalf of the "Preservatives Committee, of your letter of the 23rd "inst., and to thank you for the same. I will in all "cases communicate directly with yourself. "I am, Dear Sir, "Yours faithfully, "CHAS. J. HUDDART, "Secretary of the Committee. "Dr. Sedgwick Saunders." To this letter was subjoined the scheme suggested by the Preservatives Committee for carrying out the orders of the Local Government Board for the sampling of imported foods, viz.:— "(1.) Names and addresses of consignees will be "communicated by the Secretary; any special markings "on the imported goods will be named so that the goods "may be identified. 182 "(2.) Such markings will have especial significance, "since it is most important that the samples taken "should be from the articles actually imported from "abroad by the consignees, and the inspector should "take pains to secure that the sample is part of an "individual importation, making use for this purpose of "the facts supplied as to marking of the goods. "(3.) Only one sample from any one consignee should "be purchased. "(4.) Sale by the consignee of the sample will be "voluntary on his part. In proceeding to purchase, the "inspector should state that he is acting on behalf of the "Preservatives Committee, that the sample desired is "simply for purposes of analysis, with a view to "determining the amount and nature of any preservatives "or colouring matters that may be used, and that no "legal action will be taken in respect of the sample. He "should say, moreover, that the interests of public health "and of the trade are alike involved in the inquiries that "are being made by the Committee, and express the "hope that no obstacle will be placed in the way of the "Committee by refusal to sell. "(5) The quantities named in the attached list are "the smallest that will suffice for the purposes of the "Committee. If the inspector find himself unable to "procure a small quantity of any article, and for any "special reason deem it desirable to procure a sample in "large amount, he should communicate the fact to "myself and await instructions. This, however, does "not preclude the purchase, for example, of a pound of "sausages, or a pound of ham or bacon where "necessary. 183 "(6) Samples to be addressed as shown at the "bottom of the enclosed list. "Samples of following Imported Foods in amounts "named are desired for use of Preservatives Com"mittee, under the circumstances and conditions already "communicated: — "Milk.—6 ounces. "Cream.—3 ounces or small tin, if 'tinned. "Cheese.—¼lb. "Potted Meats.—¼lb. "Ham.—¼lb. of fleshy part. "Bacon.—¼lb. „ „ "Sausages.—¼lb. or whole sausage. "Beer.—½pint. "Low-class Wine.—Small bottle. "Jams.—¼lb. or small jar. "Also some tinned foods, &c., when desired. "Samples to be addressed:— "Principal Chemist, "Government Laboratories, "Clement's Inn Passage, "Strand, London, W.C. "(Preservatives Committee.)" Your Inspectors of Food and Drugs rendered every assistance in their power, but the work absorbed so much of their time that I conferred 184 with Mr. Huddart with a view of the Preservatives Committee either limiting their requisitions upon this Department or obtaining additional help from other sources. The result of this interview was, that Mr. Huddart wrote the following letter to the Chemist at the Government Laboratory, and favoured me with a copy, which is as under:— "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W., "18th October, 1899. "Dear Mr. Lewin, "I saw Dr. Sedgwick Saunders yesterday with a "view of asking whether he could arrange to render "larger help in connection with the sampling of "imported foods than has resulted from the information "supplied by the Customs. "Dr. Saunders told me that much time is taken up "by his Inspectorate in sampling under present arrange"ments for the Preservatives Committee, but he is "very anxious to do what he can, and he has agreed to "instruct his Inspectors to secure such samples as they "can from imported firms which appear on the Customs "lists, apart from and in addition to actually listed "importations. In this way I trust that many more "samples than have hitherto been taken will be available "for your purposes. 185 "I left a further list of consignees with Dr. Saunders "yesterday, and shall continue to send such lists as "I receive, he, on his part, promising to give them "such prompt attention as is possible. "I am, "Yours faithfully, "CHAS. J. HUDDART." "Local Government Board, "Whitehall, S.W. 19th October, 1899. "Dear Dr. Saunders, "I will ask that the name of ship and the port of "departure be included in the list of consignees as far "as possible. We shall be glad of a sample of the "tinned rabbits; but, without express sanction of my "Committee, I think it will be well that no such sum "as you mention, namely, 10s., be paid for any sample "desired. I am only sorry that you should find such "difficulty as is experienced in procuring samples, but I "am confident that all that can be done is being done by "your Inspectorate. "I am, "Yours faithfully, "CHAS. J. HUDDART, "Secretary to the Preservatives Committee.'' 186 Up to the end of the year the following list of samples, referred to on page 170, had been collected for the Preservatives Committee, and forwarded to the Government Laboratories, viz.:— Cheese 8 samples. Condensed Milk 6 „ Bacon 6 „ Potted Meats 6 „ Tinned Rabbit 1 „ Preserved Fruits 5 „ Beer 4 „ Wine 2 „ Lard 1 „ Total 39 samples. All these had arrived in this country from various Foreign and Colonial ports. In a Report recently presented to the Sanitary Committee I referred in detail to some circular letters issued by the Board of Agriculture, respecting the Food and Drugs Act, 1899. 187 Attention was therein directed to the inaction of that Board in not, as a first duty, availing themselves of the powers conferred on them by the new Act, so far as it relates to the making of regulations for determining the normal constituents in the case of milk, and milk products, and in fact, once and for all, settling the vexed question, "What is milk?" It is with some satisfaction, therefore, to learn the Board of Agriculture has now decided to move in this direction, and that a Departmental Committee has recently been appointed by the President of the Board to thoroughly investigate the subject, with a view of rendering operative Section 4 of the Act referred to above. The Committee will be assisted in their inquiries by the Chief Chemist to the Government Laboratories and by representatives of the various interests concerned, including agriculturists, milk traders, and public analysts. 188 The New River Company's and the East London Company's water supply to the City of London have been periodically examined. I have again to acknowledge the assistance rendered in this part of my duty by Mr. Howard B. Turner, F.I.C., Sanitary Clerk, as well as the zealous co-operation of the Inspectors of Food and Drugs. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, Fellow of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain and Ireland. Public Analyst for the City of London, &c., &c., &c..

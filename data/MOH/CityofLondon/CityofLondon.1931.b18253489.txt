To the Right Honourable The Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C. April, 1932. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I have the honour to present my fifth Annual Report on the work of the Department of the Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. This year, again, it is my painful duty to have to record the death of a member of my staff. Mr. J. W. Mayne, the Officer in Charge of Rat Repression work, died in March, after a long illness. Mr. Mayne entered the service of the Corporation in October, 1916, and by his death the City has lost a very valuable officer. I have also to announce the retirement on the age limit of Mr. F. J. Robbins, a Grade I Sanitary Inspector, and Mr. H. Mettam, a Grade I Meat Inspector. Both these officers have served the Corporation well during many years, and I hope they may long enjoy the leisure which they have well earned. STATISTICAL INFORMATION. Area.—The City of London (excluding The Temple) comprises an area of 661 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1.032 square miles. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles. Density (1928).—City of London Registration District, at night, 17.3 persons to an acre; City of London, Registration District, during the day, *664.1 person to an acre; Registration London, at night, 59.5 persons to an acre. Annual Rateable Value.—The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London (including the City) was £59,406,139) on April 6th, 1931, whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London was £8,694,024, or about one-seventh of the whole County. The annual sum receivable from a penny rate is £33,588. Population.— The undermentioned figures are extracted from the Report of the Registrar-General on the Census of England and Wales, 1921:— Area, Inhabited Houses. Population. Private. Statute Families. Acres. 1911. 1921. 1911. 1921. 1921. City of London (Not including the Temple) 661 2,784 2,398 19,657 13,709 3,174 These figures represent the population on the nights of the 3rd April, 1911, and the 19th June, 1921. The following table shows the progressive decline which has taken place since 1861 in the number of inhabitants who reside within the City boundaries, and the progressive increase in the number of workers who are daily employed in the City:— Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population. 1861 112,063 - 1866 - 170,133 1871 75,983 - 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 - 1911 19,657 364,061 1921 13,709 436,721 (Imperial 1931 10,808 - Census.) There is only one registration district in the City. *This figure refers only to persons " actively engaged in the City during the daytime," and is based upon the Imperial Census taken in June, 1921. B2 8 The population of the City, as shown by the Imperial Census for the year 1931, is 10,808. The day Census taken in 1911 showed that the day population was 364,061 persons, and also that 1,077,155 persons and 94,095 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the count was taken. Births.—During the year 1931, 413 live births were registered in the City, 380 of which, however, did not belong thereto. To the remaining 33 must be added the births of 28 children born to citizens temporarily residing outside the City boundary. The number of births, therefore, on which the rate should be calculated is 61. There were four still births. The annual birth-rate was 5.6 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 7.7 per 1,000. In the Metropolis the birth-rate in 1931 was 15.0 per 1,000. Mortality.—During the year under review, 680 deaths were registered in the District, including 620 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See table, p. 9, for details. Deducting these latter, 60 deaths remain, to which must be added those of 75 persons who died in outside districts, where they were registered ; the total, therefore, on which the City death-rate is calculated is 135. The death-rate for 1931 was 12.5 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 12.0), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 12.4. Deaths from Violence.—Of the City deaths, 5.9 per cent. were caused by injuries or violence, as compared with 2.7 in 1929 and 8.5 in 1930. This is 1.1 above the average for the previous five years.

The deaths from Phthisis correspond to a rate of 0.64 per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 0.89 in the Metropolis. Infantile Mortality.—The deaths of children under one year of age were at the rate of 81 per 1,000 births, as against 65 for the whole of London. 9 CAUSES OF, AND AGES AT, DEATH DURING THE YEAR 1931.

Vaccination.—Of the 413 births notified to the Vaccination Officer during 1931, 102 had been successfully vaccinated by the end of the year, 11 had died before the age for vaccination and in no case was a child reported as insusceptible. Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in 1 case, 219 had removed into other districts, or the vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 80 instances of conscientious objection. The Public Vaccinator performed 45 re-vaccinations during the year, and in addition to the 102 successful vaccinations referred to above, 41 adult persons were vaccinated for the first time.

No new work has been undertaken in connection with Infant Welfare Work, as it is found that the needs of the City are amply fulfilled by the arrangements already in operation. The small resident population of the City and the consequent few births enables a close personal touch to be maintained between my staff and the City mothers. The Infant Welfare Centre, administered by the Corporation at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, has had a satisfactory attendance at the weekly Wednesday session, and supplies of milk and dried milk, at cost price, under cost price, and free, according to circumstances, have been provided in accordance with the practice which has been in operation for some years. Cod Liver Oil Emulsion is also given where its administration appears to be advisable. No home help was necessary. 436 notifications of birth, made in accordance with the requirements of the Notification of Births Act, were received. Of these, 50 referred to City mothers, and the balance were transferred to the appropriate authorities. The Woman Inspector, who undertakes the work arising from these notifications, reports that 293 visits were made as a consequence of notifications received, and also that 564 special visits were made in connection with infant welfare. Five visits were also made in respect of cases coming within the scope of the Children Act, 1908, all in relation to nurse children. Two verminous school children were notified under the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1904. MATERNAL MORTALITY. The investigation into maternal deaths which the Ministry of Health now require to be conducted has not called for any particular organisation in my department. There are very few deaths per annum among the City resident population, and the few maternal deaths are investigated by me. In 1931 the number was nil. It may be of interest to note that, from 1900 to 1931 inclusive, only 15 maternal deaths have occurred among City residents. BIRTH CONTROL. The question of birth control in relation to Maternity and Child Welfare work has been the subject of frequent consideration by many local authorities, and the Minister of Health has been requested from time to time to sanction proposals for the use of these centres for giving advice on this subject in general. This sanction the Minister has been unable to give, and has issued a memorandum which indicates that he does not consider that it is the function of Maternity and Child Welfare Centres and Antenatal Clinics to give advice on birth control, except in a very limited degree, such as where further pregnancy will be detrimental to health. Although local authorities have no general powers to establish birth control clinics as such, the Notification of Births (Extension) Act, 1915, enables them to exercise powers for the care of expectant mothers and nursing mothers, and it may properly be held that birth control clinics can be provided for this limited class, but since there is an acute division of public opinion on the subject, no departmental sanction is given for the establishment of such clinics, except on condition that contraceptive advice will be given only in cases where further pregnancy will be detrimental to health. Local authorities also have power to provide clinics at which medical advice and treatment will be available for women suffering from diseases peculiar to the sex, but here, again, the Minister makes it clear that departmental sanction to such clinics would only be given on condition that any advice on birth control would only be given to married women where gynaecological or general health conditions suggest the necessity. 12 INQUESTS ON MOTHERS DYING IN CHILD BIRTH. A new departure in investigations referring to maternal mortality was suggested by a Metropolitan Borough Council in the direction of the compulsory holding of an inquest in the case of the death of a mother in, or shortly after, child birth, and where necessary, for a post-mortem examination in such cases by an independent medical expert. Whilst one can but agree with the advantages which such a course would provide, the proposal raises questions of such importance that I am of opinion, and this opinion is shared by the majority of authorities, that consideration should be adjourned until the final report of the departmental committee on mortality and morbidity is issued, and that any requirement on the lines suggested should apply to the country as a whole. INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Ninety-two cases of notifiable infectious diseases were reported during the year 1931. Notification of Chicken-pox.—In consequence of the presence of the mild type of smallpox which has been more or less prevalent in London for the past few years, Chicken-pox was made a notifiable disease in the City for six months, from the 17th day of March, 1930, at the expiration of which time it was renewed for a further six months, which expired on the 17th March, 1931. In view of the fact that conditions in relation to smallpox still justify it, the Court of Common Council by order extended the obligation to notify for a further period of twelve months, expiring on the 17th day of March, 1932. Appropriate notice to interested parties was effected, and a copy of such notice is reproduced in Appendix E of this Report. Fourteen of the cases reported were Diphtheria, compared with 19 in 1930. The number of Scarlet Fever cases was 17, compared with 20 in 1930. There were 6 cases of Erysipelas. Measles and German Measles are not notifiable diseases, and only cases of the former illness were brought to my notice by medical practitioners and through the medium of the school medical service. Thirty-seven cases of Chicken-pox were notified, 14 of Acute Primary Pneumonia, 1 case of Acute Influenzal Pneumonia and 1 of Smallpox. No case of Ophthalmia Neonatorum was reported. The percentage of cases removed to hospital for treatment continues to be satisfactory. In each instance of notified disease a detailed examination is made of the sanitary condition of the premises where the case occurred and a summary of defects found by the District Inspector is given on page 62. In the following tables will be found particulars relating to cases of infectious disease, and information as to the removal of patients to hospitals and sanatoria. 13 STATISTICS OF NOTIFICATIONS AND REMOVALS TO HOSPITAL.

The customary disinfection, where necessary, was carried out, and those persons, resident or employed in the City, who had been in contact with cases of Small-pox, were supervised. The total number of cases (including missed cases) notified or reported to this Department during the period ended 31st December, 1931, was 70. Resident and removed from City premises 1 Resident in the City but removed from premises or institutions outside the City 0 Non-resident but removed from City premises 1 Non-resident but removed from St. Bartholomew's Hospital 8 Non-resident but employed in the City 55 Non-resident but who attended the O.P. Department, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and who were diagnosed as suffering from Chicken-pox and sent home, being subsequently removed by local Medical Officers of Health as suffering from Small-pox 5 Non-resident but employed in the City, who were contacts to other cases, and who, for the latter reason, had been instructed by their employers to remain away from work. (Not included in total number of cases above) 14 Returned as " Not Small-pox ":— (a) Non-residents but employed in the City 3 (b) Non-residents removed from O.P. Department of St. mew's Hospital 0 The total number of persons in contact with cases ascertained or notified during the period ended 31st December, 1931, was 1,237, made up as follows:— Notified to this Department by Medical Officers of Health of the districts from which the cases were removed:— (a) City residents 9 (b) Non-residents employed in the City 368 In contact with cases resident in the City or removed from City premises (including St. Bartholomew's Hospital):— (a) City residents 8 (b) Non-residents 103 In contact with cases not resident but employed in the City and notified to the appropriate Medical Officers of Health if resident outside the City:— (a) City residents 0 (b) Non-residents 749 NURSING PROVISIONS. Measles, etc.—The Corporation has approved of the expenditure of £25 per annum in respect of the nursing of complicated cases of Measles, Encephalitis Lethargica and Cerebrospinal Fever, and have also agreed to expend the sum of £30 on provision of medical assistance and nursing attendance in necessitous cases of Influenza. No action was necessary under this heading during 1931. DISTRIBUTION OF DIPHTHERIA ANTI-TOXIN AND ANTI-INFLUENZA VACCINE. Although City medical practitioners are well aware of the facilities available, no applications for supplies of diphtheria anti-toxin or anti-influenza vaccine were received during 1931. Examination for Pathogenic Bacteria.—During the year the following specimens were so dealt with. It will be seen that positive results were obtained in about 12 per cent. of these cases. Result. Specimen. Disease suspected. Positive. Negative. 28 Swabbings from throats Diphtheria 3 25 9 Sputa Tuberculosis 1 8 1 Blood Typhoid Fever - 1 One throat swabbing was received from the Central Foundation School for Girls, Spital Square, E.C., which proved to be negative of diphtheria bacilli. PROVISION OF INSULIN. In accordance with the request made by the Authorities of the University College Hospital, Insulin has been supplied to one patient resident in the City, and in attendance at that hospital. The Corporation have power to make this provision under Section 77 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, with the approval of the Ministry of Health, but, so far as I am aware, this is the first patient in regard to whom such powers have been put into operation. The arrangement has worked satisfactorily. C2 16 TUBERCULOSIS. The hours at which the Dispensary was open for diagnosis and treatment of Tuberculosis were:— Tuesdays 12.30 p.m.—2.30 p.m. 2.30 p.m.—4.30 p.m. For the Artificial Pneumothorax Clinic. Wednesdays 5.0 p.m.—7.0 p.m. Fridays 11.30 a.m. (New cases only.) „ 2.0 p.m.—3.0 p.m. In all, 256 sessions have been held. New Patients.—The number of new patients examined was 362, as compared with 407 last year :— Patients Referred to the Hospital.—The following is the summary of patients referred to the various departments of St. Bartholomew's Hospital for help in diagnosis or treatment:— Resident. Non-Resident. Total. Referred to X-ray Department 41 119 160 ,, Surgical „ 0 0 0 „ Dental ,, 3 2 5 Throat „ 9 22 31 „ Pathological „ 0 0 0 Other „ 3 23 26 56 166 222 Patients Admitted to the Hospital for Diagnosis.—The wards of the Hospital are available for the reception of cases presenting difficulties of diagnosis, which can only be overcome by observation as In-patients. No resident and 8 non-resident patients were admitted for this purpose. Examination of Sputum.—The following is a summary :— City Residents. Non-Residents. Total. Positive 5 20 25 Negative 20 73 3 Residential Treatment.—The number of patients for whom residential treatment was arranged was 110. Admitted Hospitals Other St. Columbas Brompton to of Institution Hospital Corpn. L.C.C. Institutions. Local Authorities. Corpn. Expense. Expense. Total. Patients resident in the City 11 1 19 1 2 34 Patients non-resident 55 10 11 - - 76 66 11 30 1 2 110 Persons neither resident nor working in the City are usually transferred immediately to their own Tuberculosis Officer, and subsequent arrangements are made by him. This system has worked satisfactorily. Persons Treated and Supervised at the Dispensary.—(i.) Patients resident in the City. All persons suffering from Tuberculosis who are resident in the City may be supervised and treated at the Dispensary. The total number of cases so treated and referred to as patients on the register in Table on page 19 was 58. In addition, 48 contacts were kept under observation. (ii.) Patients non-resident in the City. (a) Who work in the City. On diagnosis, these patients are informed that they can be treated and advised at the Dispensary or transferred tp the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. The majority decide to remain patients at the Dispensary. (b) Who do not work in the City. On diagnosis, these patients are usually transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. The total number of cases so transferred was 187. Total Attendances:— Residents 379 Non-Residents 1,344 1,723 In view of the fact that the cases in the last stages of the disease are extremely infectious, especially in crowded houses, the Corporation have made arrangements to pay for the maintenance of selected City cases at St. Columba's Hospital, Swiss Cottage. One case was admitted in 1931. 17 During past years a certain amount of difficulty has arisen with cases who were residing at the place at which they were employed, when diagnosed as having pulmonary tuberculosis. The provision of Residential treatment by the L.C.C. usually entails the patient waiting two or three weeks before admission; under ordinary circumstances this does not cause any difficulty, but with this particular type of case more prompt action is desirable. The Corporation have now an arrangement with the Brompton Hospital whereby cases of this type can be admitted within 48 hours under Dr. Young's personal care, under a Certificate from the Medical Officer of Health. Two cases have been admitted under this scheme during the year. Artificial Pneumothorax.—Artificial pneumothorax treatment has been used again during the year. Artificial pneumothorax was induced in four cases and 186 Refills done in connection with the Dispensary. The Tuberculosis Nurse.—As an adjunct to the work at the Tuberculosis Clinic, the outside work of the Tuberculosis Nurse has been continued on the same lines as former years. Sixty-two homes have been visited, and 263 visits made in connection with after-care and following up. In addition to the above, patients, some of whom were in an advanced stage of the disease, have been nursed in their own homes. For this purpose 53 nursing visits were made. General.—The following information is supplied in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health:— (i.) The Tuberculosis Dispensary is at St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the Tuberculosis Officer is Dr. F. H. Young, O.B.E. ; one Tuberculosis Nurse is engaged in the work. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for insured and uninsured persons by the London County Council. (ii.) Patients are referred to the Tuberculosis Dispensary from hospitals, school clinics and other institutions, with all of which there is close co-operation. The services of the Staff and all the resources of St. Bartholomew's Hospital are available for diagnosis and treatment. Many patients are referred to departments of the Hospital for these purposes. (iii.) The Tuberculosis Officer is in constant consultation and communication with general practitioners, so that there is close co-operation between them and the Dispensary. He reminds them when reports are due on insured patients under domiciliary treatment and provides them with copies of the form with names and addresses inserted. (iv.) When the diagnosis is in doubt and the patient is under the care of a practitioner, arrangements are made with him for re-examination ; in other cases arrangements are made with the patient, but should he fail to attend, either the Tuberculosis Nurse calls upon him or he is reminded of the appointment in writing. (v.) The Tuberculosis Officer explains to the patients the importance of the examination of home contacts, and in addition to the necessary visits of the Sanitary Inspectors, the Tuberculosis Nurse visits the homes of City residents periodically for the same purpose, and arranges for the attendance of the contacts at the Dispensary at times convenient to them. The supervision of these contacts and the re-examination of suspects among them is secured by the home visits periodically made by the Nurse. (vi.) Considerable use is made of X-rays from the point of view of diagnosis and decision as to method of treatment to be recommended. The usual methods of treatment have been continued in the Dispensary. Tuberculin has been used in a few cases. In addition, 14 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis attended for the continuation of their treatment by artificial pneumothorax and inductions of the treatment have been performed in several cases in the wards of the Hospital. (vii.) Experience shows that when the disease is active, residence in an institution more quickly and certainly brings about arrest than when the treatment is attempted at home on sanatorium lines, and that the lessons learnt in the sanatorium are sometimes put into practice by the patient on his return home to his permanent advantage. (viii.) Dental treatment is provided by the Dental Department of St. Bartholom w's Hospital, and the Corporation defrays the whole or part of the cost of artificial dentures for necessitous cases. (ix.) Nursing in their own homes of patients resident in the City is one of the duties of the Tuberculosis Nurse. Milk has been provided for necessitous persons requiring extra nourishment end in this connection the sum of about £32 has been expended. 18 (x.) Patients suffering from Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis receive advice and treatment from the Surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, to whom they are referred from the Dispensary. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for as in pulmonary cases. The Corporation supplies surgical apparatus free of cost for necessitous residents in the City. (xi.) The arrangements for "care" and "after-care" are carried out by a subcommittee of the Sanitary Committee, on which two ladies are co-opted as members.† It receives detailed reports on all cases of Tuberculosis occurring among City residents. (xii.) No local arrangements exist for providing employment for patients. (xiii.) No opportunity has arisen for the use of a shelter, but arrangements would be made for any suitable case if a site were available. (xiv.) No special points have been noted as to the incidence of Tuberculosis ; the records do not show that the disease is specially prevalent among any class of workers in the City. (xv.) The usual method for preventing the spread of infection is adopted, and pocket sputum flasks are provided free of cost. (xvi.) The principal difficulty encountered occurs on the discharge of a patient from a sanatorium with the disease quiescent. The home environment to which he returns is often unsatisfactory ; suitable occupation near his home may be practically unobtainable, even when remuneration is not the main consideration, and the very considerable benefit gained is in some cases soon lost and the treatment in the sanatorium largely wasted. (xvii.) Difficulties also arise with regard to advanced cases. These are usually very infectious and do not care to go to the Infirmary. This has been largely remedied by the arrangement made by the Corporation already referred to. The following table sets out the number of cases both of Pulmonary and Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis, which were brought to my notice during the year 1931, and also the total number of deaths from Tuberculosis among City residents during the same period:— Age Periods.

In accordance with a request from the Metropolitan Boroughs of Finsbury and Southwark, certain patients resident in those two areas attended at the City Tuberculosis Dispensary at regular intervals during the year, to undergo treatment of Artificial Pneumothorax. The appropriate fees were charged and paid by the two authorities concerned. † The present lady members of the Committee are Lady Cooper, O.B.E., Miss Crosby, and Lady Smith.

(a) Formal Notifications are notifications which are made in pursuance of Article 5 of the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Regulations, 1930, or by Naval, Military or Air Force Medical Authorities, in pursuance of Section 5 (b) of the Local Government (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1916. (b) Primary Notifications, for the purpose of columns (2) — (13) relate to patients who have never previously been formally notified in the area to which the Return relates. A patient who changes his residence from one Sanitary District to another in the same County may properly be the subject of Primary Notification in each such District. Only the first of such notifications, however, should be recorded in columns (2) — (13) of the Return for the County concerned, the subsequent notification(s) being included in column (14). (c) Column (14). All formal notifications, whether duplicate or not, should be included in this column. General.—Patients notified as suffering from combined pulmonary and non-pulmonary tuberculosis should be included among the " pulmonary " returns only. If a patient, already notified as suffering from one form of tuberculosis, is subsequently notified to the Medical Officer of Health of the same Sanitary District as suffering from another form of tuberculosis, the fact should be noted in the Notification Register, but such notification should be recorded as a duplicate notification. PART II. (a) New cases of tuberculosis first coming to knowledge other .vise than by formal notification may, in some instances, afterwards be formally notified under the Regulations. Should such formal notification be received within the same year as that in which the case first came to the knowledge of the Medical Officer of Health, it should be recorded as a " Primary Notification," and excluded from the Supplemental Return. If the formal notification is received in a subsequent year, such notification should be regarded as duplicate, as the case has already been included in the Supplemental Return for a previous year. (b) A formal notification which is not received until after the death of the patient should be included in the Supplemental Return as a " posthumous notification." (c) No case should be included both in the Summary of Notifications and in the Supplemental Return for the same year. (d) In Counties, the particulars for the purposes of this Return should be obtained by the procedure suggested in paragraph 2 of Part. II. of Circular 549. PART III. In Counties, the information should be compiled from the quarterly statements for the year 1931, which are required to be furnished to the County Medical Officer of Health by the Medical Officer of Health of each District in the County, in pursuance of Article 10 (8) of the above-mentioned Regulation, and should represent the sum of the figures relating to each District in the County. If any of these quarterly statements has not been duly received by the County Medical Officer of Health, the Ministry should be furnished with particulars, including the name of the District concerned. Further, if the County Medical Officer of Health is in any doubt as to the accuracy of the figures included in his return, he should record the fact, giving reasons. 23 PUBLIC HEALTH (PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS) REGULATIONS, 1925. It has not been necessary during the year to take any action in regard to the abovementioned Regulations, which provide for the exercise of some control over persons suffering from Tuberculous affections and who are engaged in certain occupations associated with the milk trade. TUBERCULOSIS DISPENSARY.—TRAINING OF HEALTH VISITORS. The facilities available at the Tuberculosis Dispensary are placed at the disposal of the College of Nursing in order that that body can give to their health-visitor students a short course of practical experience in tuberculosis work as undertaken by a tuberculosis nurse. This should prove of considerable value in all future training of health visitors. VENEREAL DISEASES. The Special Centre for the Treatment of Venereal Diseases, which, in accordance with the powers under the Public Health (Venereal Diseases) Regulations, 1916, the City Corporation established at 20/21, Golden Lane—previously occupied as a shelter, and specially altered to meet the requirements—was transferred to St. Bartholomew's Hospital on the 17th February, 1930. This step was deemed expedient for economic and other reasons, and it is satisfactory to note that the number of persons availing themselves of the opportunity afforded has, since that date, shown marked increase, the total number of new cases in the year being 1,075, as compared with 498 during 1929, the last complete year of working at 20/21, Golden Lane. The following is a brief summary of the work carried out during 1931:— At the beginning of the year 510 males and 186 females were registered on the books as being under treatment or observation, which compares with 417 males and 123 females at the beginning of the previous year. Of these patients, 335 males and 166 females were under treatment for syphilis, and 175 males and 20 females for gonorrhoea. No patients were under treatment for conditions other than venereal disease. New patients admitted totalled 1,075, as compared with 1,073 in the previous year, but the total attendances increased from 20,694 in 1930 to 26,378 in 1931, a very satisfactory feature. Unfortunately, 282 cases discharged themselves before completion of treatment, and 65, although completing treatment, failed to submit themselves to final test. Twenty-one males and 2 females were transferred to other centres after treatment, whilst 1 female was discharged after completion of treatment and observation. There were 24 in-patients. The total number of attendances is made up as follows :— Syphilis. Soft Chancre. Gonorrhoea. •Non-Venereal Conditions. Total Attendances. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male.

SANITARY INSPECTORS' ASSOCIATION AT BRIDLINGTON. The Congresses organised by the above-mentioned Institutes and Association were attended by representatives of the City Corporation. Continuing evidence of the utility of attendance at these Congresses was amply afforded. HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. A system of voluntary registration of hairdressers' establishments with the Department of the Medical Officer of Health was instituted in 1904. The following is a list of establishments at present on the register:— Alfred Kingston, 8 and 10, Ludgate Arcade. Charles Lehman, 8 and 9, Aldermanbury Postern. Thos. W. Monk, 5, Angel Court. Ed. Hy. Price, 69, Fore Street. Samuel & Harry Cohen, trading as Cohen & Co., 120, Newgate Street. SMOKE AND ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Sixteen complaints of smoke nuisance or annoyance from chimneys were dealt with during the year, and in connection with these 102 observations were made and one intimation notice served upon the responsible person. Many of the offences were of a temporary character and did not recur. There has been no occasion to take further action. A critical examination of the air in the City was commenced in the year 1914, in conjunction with the Committee for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, appointed by the International Exhibition and Conference in London, 1912. A large rain gauge is mounted upon the roof of one of the Corporation's buildings in Golden Lane, and the rain-water from a known area of surface is collected monthly. This rain-water, containing the soot, grit, and dust washed from the air, has been submitted for examination to the Public Analyst and the results tabulated. For comparison the results obtained from similar observations made at the Meteorological Office, South Kensington, on the west, and Victoria Park, on the east of the rain gauge at Golden Lane, are shown in the attached table. The table also shows the rainfall for the months of January to December of the year 1931, and the amounts found of insoluble matter, tar, soot, and dust, also the soluble matter, together with the sulphates, ammonia and chlorine in the volume collected. The results as given by the Public Analyst have been re-calculated into metric tons per square kilometre during each month. In addition to the foregoing, a daily observation has been made at mid-day at the Guildhall of the purity of the air by a modern dry method, by which the suspended matter can be readily demonstrated. From the 1st January until the 31st December the amount of the impurity at noon has varied from half-milligramme to seven-and-a-half milligrammes per cubic metre of air ; this latter figure includes times when there has been a fog. From 1915 to 1926, Dr. Owens informs us, the increase of gas consumed in the Metropolis was 22,599,000 cub. ft. This is equivalent to 7,800 tons of sulphur had coal been burned, whereas the gas contained only 430 tons—a difference representing 18,425 tons of sulphuric acid. Obviously, modern methods of heating and illumination affect not only the presence of particulate matter in the atmosphere and a precedent and intensifier of fog, but also that damaging element sulphuric acid. 28 SUMMARY OF MONTHLY OBSERVATIONS AND REPORTS DURING THE YEAR 1931.

The number of cremations which have taken place in Great Britain during 1931 is 5,195, the largest in any one year since this method of disposal was first permitted by law in 1885, and an increase over the 1930 figures of more than 14 per cent. The number still, however, only represents approximately 1 per cent, of the total deaths, and this country is far behind the percentage of some of the Continental countries. A comparison of figures given in the following table indicates steady but slow progress. Public opinion is undoubtedly undergoing enlightenment in this matter, and in response to an increasing demand for facilities, burial authorities and others concerned are studying the development of cremation and considering the provision of crematoria before existing burial accommodation becomes difficult of provision. When established, these crematoria should result in an accelerated rate of increase in the number of cremations. An attempt to replace deep-set sentiment and reasonable prejudice has been made at the Corporation Cemetery at Ilford, by the establishment of a Garden of Remembrance. 29 Here sentiment is preserved, but in a very different manner ; decay, so often visibly suggested by the grave, being replaced by a veritable garden for quiet contemplation. Some thought has been given to this subject by the British Undertakers' Association, who believe that funeral directors need a better knowledge of the sanitary care of the dead than they appear to possess at present, and an educational campaign has been started with this object in view. It is, of course, impossible that the general public can approach this subject in a detached frame of mind, but the systematic attempts to remove what appears to be an inherent objection to cremation as a proper, rapid, decent and sanitary course of arriving at the disintegration of the mortal remains of man, should do much to increase the acceptance of this method of disposal.

E 30 In March, 1931, new Offices for the Meat Inspection Branch of my department were occupied. They are well equipped and form an evident and pleasing contrast in working convenience with the former buildings in use. The interior is laid out as follows:— Basement.—Central heating and domestic hot-water supply boilers, drying room for porters' clothes, and coal cellar. Ground Floor.—Entrance hall, general office, unsound food shed and detention room (white-tiled throughout), porters' dining room, and lavatory accommodation. First Floor.—Veterinary surgeon's, typists', waiting and lecture rooms, laboratory. Second Floor.—Senior inspector's, meat inspector's, and dining rooms, with cooking kitchen. The Floors of the main entrance and first landing are laid with india-rubber, and all rooms have oak parquetry floors. Furniture and Fittings.-—All woodwork is of oak. Lighting and Ventilation are good, with electric artificial light, an electric fan extracts to the roof level any offensive odour from the unsound meat shed. Extension.—The roof has been finished flat, so that another storey can be added if and when necessary. Lavatories and W.C.'s are on each mezzanine landing. Lecture Room.—This room is large, well lighted, panelled, fitted with showcases, and it is hoped an epidiascope may be installed. Although only in use a short time, it is filling a long-felt want. Practical examinations for the Diploma of Public Health, lectures to students studying for the meat inspectors' examination, and refresher courses are being held therein. Considering the large opportunity and facilities for education in the practical side of meat inspection the offices thus equipped afford, it is hoped this useful work may now develop therein. MEAT INSPECTION. The report under this heading has been prepared by your Veterinary Officer, Lt.-Col. T. Dunlop Young.

The total amounts converted into figures representing live animals are perhaps more impressive, they are as follows:— Cattle. Per cent. Sheep and Lambs. Per cent. Pigs. Per cent.

Argentina was, as usual, the la rgest sender, with 72 per cent. The imports from other countries being : Australia, 9 per cent. Uruguay 8 per cent., Brazil 5 per cent., New Zealand 3 per cent., the balance being derived from the U.S.A. The imports of preserved beef extracts, etc., was about the same as in 1930, viz., over 50,000 tons. Mutton and Lamb.—There was an increase of 36,639 tons compared with 1930, the increase being chiefly from Australia. Of the total, New Zealand sent nearly 50 per cent., Argentina and Australia each 21 per cent., and Uruguay 4 per cent., the balance being from Other Countries. Sheep's offals amounted to 5,800 tons, and preserved mutton, etc., to 2,850 tons. Fresh Pork.—The Irish Free State sent 5,000 tons more of this food. Frozen Pork.—There was an increase of 300 tons of this food, New Zealand being the largest sender, with 33 per cent. of the total. Bacon.—The increase in the importation of this class of food is worthy of special note, there being 97,332 tons increase over the amount for 1930. Denmark still holds premier place, with 65 per cent, of the total. " Other Countries " grouped together, being second, and the Netherlands third. Hams.—The United States, although sending a slightly less quantity, still holds first place, with over 80 per cent., and " Other Countries " 19 per cent.

In consignments from this country, diseased meat is still found, but the authorities show every desire to eventually establish a thoroughly reliable system of meat inspection. Considering the unsatisfactory condition of Irish Consignments, which were observed previously, there is a very marked improvement, both in quality and freedom from disease. The Supervising Veterinary Meat Inspector has visited Smithfield Markets often, in order to observe our system of inspection, also the faults of his inspectors with regard to carcases, etc., found diseased here. The number of private slaughterhouses in which meat intended for export to Britain was prepared has been very largely reduced in order to ensure better supervision. IRELAND Beef. Mutton. Pork. Veal.

This is to be regretted, as the quality of meat from this country showed improvement, and the same remark applies to the system of inspection.

There were deposited in the Central Markets 13,053 tons of beef, against 9,877 tons, and 1,184 tons of mutton, against 604 tons for 1930. Although the majority of the meat is not of a very high quality, it supplies a ready demand for this class of food. For quantities of unsound food taken, vide Tables Nos. 16 and 17.

One hundred and forty-eight carcases and 98 sides of mutton were found diseased, compared with 153 carcases and 183 sides in 1930. Other Countries.—The inspection of meat from other countries does not call for any special remarks, except on one important feature. Much pork is received into this country as bacon which is difficult of checking as to freedom from disease, because heads are cut off and the vertebrae removed ; those are, from an inspector's point of view, portions in which lesions of tuberculosis are looked for. In other words, the carcase of a pig bred, fed and sent to the markets by a British producer might be condemned for tuberculosis, while the same carcase, by being trimmed and converted into bacon, could be imported into this country and sold as fit for human food.

The supervision of the meat markets and other premises within the scope of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924, has continued on lines similar to those of past years. Smithfield Market.—The general conditions at Smithfield Market in respect of transport and the handling of meat has shown a decided improvement. Carriers.—The carriers rhaintain the high standard of their vehicles already reported. Several new vehicles are in commission, the structure of which shows the exercise of forethought in the direction of ease in cleansing. The use of straw has almost ceased ; this is an objectionable practice at best, and on occasion a distinct infringement of the Regulations. Butchers' Own Vehicles.—There has been a marked improvement in the types and condition of the vehicles coming under this heading in attendance at Smithfield Market. The vehicle in use is sometimes unsatisfactory by reason of its internal construction ; the presence of numerous ledges and angles difficult to cleanse is avoided in better types. With regard to the cleansing of vehicles, this has also shown improvement, although over a period of nine months, it has been found that of the vehicles to which exception had been taken, as regards the cleanliness— 16.6% were washed daily. 62.5% were washed once a week. 15.4% were washed once in 14 days. 5.5% were washed once in 21 days. 72.3% were washed with hot water, etc. 27.7% were washed with cold water. Although it is difficult to make any hard-and-fast rule with regard to cleansing, it is suggested that vehicles attending the markets daily should be cleansed at least twice a week, and more frequently where circumstances indicate. 45 Private Cars.—It is a matter of regret that private cars are increasingly used for the conveyance of meat for human consumption. When cases have been observed, the suggested alterations in providing against contamination have invariably been carried out. Railway Vehicles.—The railway vehicles have not given cause for any complaint of a serious nature during the year. Handling.-—The majority of the licensed porters continue to carry out the regulations affecting them, and an improvement as to retail butchers and their employees is observed. Aldgate Market.—The improvement reported last year in respect to this Market has been maintained. Wholesale and Retail Butchers' Shops.—The above premises have reached a high standard of cleanliness. Distribution Centres for Restaurants.—No serious complaint attaches in respect of these centres ; it is, however, noticed that the amount of business in many cases is beyond that for which the premises would appear to have been designed. Premises Used for the Manufacture of Sausages and Meat Products.—In the above category the premises in the City are at a high standard. Their construction and the improvements which are being made are conducive to easy cleansing and elimination of dirt. Premises Used for Curing Hams and Tongues.—Periodical inspections of these premises have been made, and the improvement reported last year has been maintained. Bacon Shops.—No great improvement has been observed in regard to these premises, but inspections are still being made with a view to obtaining some material improvement. Bacon Stoves and Curing Stoves.—These businesses continue to. be carried out in a satisfactory manner, and comply with the requirements under the Regulations. Transport and Handling of Irish Meat.—There has been a slight improvement in this trade, but the general conditions are not yet satisfactory. General Observations.—There has been a steady general improvement in all matters which are affected by the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924. The co-operation of the many persons and associations concerned will, I am assured, maintain this improvement in the direction of and even beyond the bare requirements of the Regulations.

MERCHANDISE MARKS ACT, 1926. Administration of the above-mentioned Acts has been attended with very little difficulty other than the persuasion of the affected parties to conform to the requirements. Casual street vendors, as a general rule, appear to have but little knowledge of the requirements of the law on this matter, but those regularly engaged in this kind of work having once been acquainted by my Inspector of their obligations, very readily remedy any omission. The forms of notice to traders and shopkeepers directing their attention to the requirements, which on the instruction of the Sanitary Committee have been distributed, have been appreciated by those concerned. (See Appendix F and G.) When neglect is found in shops and stores, it is almost invariably due to assistants having failed to carry out the instructions of the proprietors. During the year, 828 shops and stores, and 294 street vendors, have been visited, and 56 minor offences in the former and 43 in the latter thus found were remedied without delay. FERTILISERS AND FEEDING STUFFS ACT, 1926. During the year, 90 visits have been made in connection with the above-mentioned Act, and 29 special enquiries instituted in connection with reports by other authorities of neglect to comply with the requirements. Such offences as have been discovered have nearly always been due to ignorance of the somewhat intricate clauses, and the assistance which my officer has been able to give in explaining the points of difficulty which are experienced has been much appreciated, and has resulted in prompt rectification and abatement of offences. The quarterly returns required by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries have been made. SUPERVISION OF FOOD AND DRUGS. During the year 1931, 1,011 samples of Food and Drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Of this number, 759 were taken as informal or test samples without the formalities of the Act being observed. Twenty-two of these informal samples were reported against, as follows :— Samples. 5 Sausages 51 5 Desiccated Soup 13 3 Butter (on bread) 19 2 Ointment of Nitrate of Mercury 3 1 Cream 12 1 Mustard 6 1 Vinegar 25 1 Liniment of Turpentine 4 1 Calomel Ointment 1 1 Lemon Squash 18, various beverages. 1 Gelatine 4 22 Of the formal samples, 26 out of 252 were reported against, as follows :— Samples. 12 Milk 204 2 Butter 9 2 Butter (on bread) 2 2 Condensed Full Cream Milk 2 2 Rum 11 2 Ointment of Nitrate of Mercury 2 1 Whisky 12 1 Lemon Squash 1 1 Crystallised Fruit 1 1 Desiccated Soup 1 26 The above-mentioned samples, with the exception of Milk, Condensed Full Cream Milk, Rum and Whisky, were taken as the result of informal samples having been reported against. General Observations.—The percentage rate of adulteration of all foods and drugs sampled in the City was 4.7, as compared with 3.9 in 1930. g2 48 Butter.—Of the 20 samples of butter, two were reported against. These were procured in course of delivery from the wholesaler in connection with a sample of butter (on bread) which had been sold by the proprietor of a cafe and found to contain 45 % of margarine. Legal proceedings were instituted against both the retailer and wholesaler, but at the hearing the summons against the retailer was withdrawn. The wholesaler was fined the maximum penalty of £20 with £5 5s. costs, it being the first offence. Another vendor of butter (on bread), which was found to contain 65% of margarine, was summoned and fined £2, with £1 0s. 6d. costs. Drugs.—Of the 92 samples of drugs taken six were reported against. In two instances the formal sample proved genuine, but in two other cases the formal samples were found to be adulterated equally with the informal samples, and legal proceedings were successfully taken against the two vendors. Spirits.—Thirty-four samples of spirits were taken. Two samples of Rum and one of Whisky were certified to be below the minimum legal strength of 35 degrees under proof, and legal proceedings were taken against the vendors. The summons was dismissed under the Probation of Offendors Act, with costs in two cases, while the third defendant was fined. EXAMINATION OF MILK. Chemical.—Of the 204 samples of milk, all of which were procured formally, 12 were reported against. Three of these were in connection with one consignment. The percentage figure of milk adulteration was 5.8, as compared with 6.3 for 1930. There were three prosecutions. One summons was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders' Act with costs, and in the two other cases penalties were imposed. In those instances where samples were reported against and the circumstances did not warrant legal proceedings being instituted, the vendors were either cautioned or further samples taken which proved genuine. The following table shows the percentage of fat content in each of the 204 samples of milk examined. Five of this number contained fat in amounts below the point which presumes adulteration, i.e., 3 per cent. The average percentage of fat was 3.6. Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. 2.7 3 3.9 17 2.8 l 4.0 14 2.9 l 4.1 8 3.0 6 4.2 1 3.1 6 4.3 2 3.2 18 4.5 2 3.3 18 4.6 2 3.4 25 4.7 1 3.5 23 4.9 1 3.6 23 9.5 1 3.7 12 3.8 19 Total 204 It will be noted that one sample contained an unusually large amount of fat, viz., 9.5. This was in connection with a bottle of milk taken from a milk roundsman. On enquiry at the diary from which it was distributed, it was ascertained that one churn of milk had not been plunged previous to the bottles being hand-filled, which accounted for the heavy fat figure in this particular sample. Seven purveyors of milk from whom samples had been taken served notices upon the Authority requesting samples of milk to be procured from their suppliers in course of delivery to them, in accordance with the provisions of the Food and Drugs (Adulteration) Act. THE MILK AND DAIRIES ORDER, 1926, AND THE MILK AND DAIRIES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1922. Thirteen new applications for registration as retail purveyors of milk were received during the year, all of which were approved. Four of these were from persons who have no premises within the City of London, but purvey milk within the area. 49 Registration Statistics. Number of Retail Purveyors of Milk on the Register at end of 1930 273 New Applications for Registration received 13 Applications granted 13 Applications refused — Names of Retailers removed from Register 8 Number of Retail Purveyors of Milk on the Register at end of 1931 278 Number of Milk Sellers (other than Retail Purveyors of Milk) on the Register at end of 1931 21 Licences issued under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923 14 Inspections of Premises where Milk is Retailed.—During the year 215 inspections were made in connection with the sale of milk. Repairs and renovations of premises were required where necessary, and such requests were complied with without the aid of statutory proceedings. There were 11 prosecutions for breaches of Article 31 (2) of the Milk and Dairies Order, 1926, for failing to cause all milk bottles to be filled and closed on registered premises. Considerable time has been occupied in making observations in connection with this offence. Some milk roundsmen were found to be filling bottles with milk in the entrance halls and on the staircases of suites of offices. Legal proceedings were successful in all cases and penalties imposed, the maximum penalty, viz., £5 for the first offence, being inflicted in two instances. The total fines imposed for this offence amounted to £14 15s. 0d. It was necessary to prosecute a dairyman, who had no premises in the City, in connection with the sale of milk described as "Pasteurised" without holding a supplementary licence for the sale of such milk. A fine of £5 was imposed. THE PUBLIC HEALTH (CONDENSED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1923 AND 1927. THE PUBLIC HEALTH (DRIED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1923 AND 1927. Samples of various brands of condensed milk were taken for analysis. Two samples, of the same brand, were reported against, and these were procured in consequence of a communication received from another Authority. The results of the analyses were communicated to the Ministry of Health, and also to the importer. The attention of the manufacturers of one brand of milk was called to the printing of the prescribed statutory declaration which did not conform to the requirements of the Regulations. Beyond the usual proprietary brands of dried milk, no dried milk was found to be on sale. PUBLIC HEALTH (IMPORTED MILK) REGULATIONS, 1926. For a period of three weeks during the months of November and December a quantity of fresh milk, amounting to 71,671 gallons, was imported from the Continent and landed at a City wharf by a company duly registered with this Authority for the purpose. Eight samples were taken for bacteriological examination, and all were found to be well within the limit of 100,000 bacteria per cubic centimetre and free from tubercle bacilli, as required by the Regulations. It was ascertained that on two occasions fresh milk had been imported from the Continent by one Company which was not registered, and landed at a City wharf. The Company was immediately communicated with. An explanation was submitted that they were registered with another Authority and were not aware of the necessity to register with each Authority within whose district the milk was imported. As the importations did not recur, it was not possible to take samples of the milk for examination. REGISTERED PREMISES. Butter Factories.—No new application for registration was received during the year, the number of premises on the register being two. Samples of butter have been taken from time to time at these premises, and all have been certified to be genuine. Wholesale Dealers in Margarine and Margarine Cheese.—Five new applications for registration were received during the year. Artificial Cream Act, 1929.—Two premises are registered under the Act. 50 51 ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION REGARDING ADULTERATION OR OTHER IRREGULARITY. Serial No. Article. Whether Formal or Informal.

SAMPLES TAKEN AT RAILWAY STATIONS. As has been customary for some years past, a series of samples of milk arriving in the City of London from the country was collected at Liverpool Street Station in September, and submitted to Sir Frederick Andrewes, K.B.E., the City Bacteriologist, for bacteriological examination and investigation as to the presence of dirt. A duplicate of each sample was submitted to Mr. A. J. C. Lickorish, F.I.C., the Public Analyst for the City of London, for chemical examination. Every precaution was taken during collection of the samples to ensure that they were not contaminated during the process. •Forty-two samples were collected, and these were sent from different farms situated in the following counties :— Norfolk 25 Essex 5 Suffolk 10 Cambridge 2 The following is a copy of the report which has been submitted by the Bacteriologist on the results of his examination :— The specimens were placed in conical vessels overnight in a refrigerator, and examined for microscopic dirt. A mixture of deposit and surface cream was then injected into guinea-pigs. Milks producing no animal lesions :— The following specimens produced no animal lesions, the guinea-pigs, killed after five weeks, being found healthy. Number of Specimen. Dirt. Number of Specimen.

Four specimens produced tuberculosis ; the nature of the condition has in each case been confirmed by demonstrating tubercle bacilli in the lesions, and is being confirmed by cultivation in three cases and by histological section of the spleen in one animal, in which the primary lesion also contained pyogenic cocci. Milk No. 3.—Dirt—small trace. Guinea-pig.—Caseous abscess at site of inoculation: typical early lesions in spleen and liver. Milk No. 23.—Dirt—small trace. Guinea-pig.—Local and visceral tuberculosis, as in the above. Milk No. 25.—Dirt—trace. Guinea-pig.—Local and visceral tuberculosis, as in the above. Milk No. 38.—Dirt—small trace. Guinea-pig.—Very large abscess at site of inoculation, containing both pyogenic cocci and tubercle bacilli. Tuberculous lesions in spleen and liver. Other Results. Milk No. 18.—Dirt—small trace. Guinea-pig.—Died of intercurrent disease twelve days after inoculation. In the material remaining at the site of inoculation no tubercle bacilli were demonstrable : this result, however, is inconclusive. Milk No. 19.—Dirt—large trace. Guinea-pig.—Large pyogenic abscess at site of inoculation. No tubercle bacilli found in pus : no lesions elsewhere. Milk No. 27.—Dirt—small trace. Guinea-pig.—Pyogenic abscess at site of inoculation. No tubercle bacilli found in pus : no lesions elsewhere. To summarise these results : Four milks (3, 23, 25, 38), or 9-5 per cent., contain tubercle bacilli ; none of these were classifiable as dirty. Of the remainder, five (2, 16, 19, 33 and 40) were dirty, two (19, 27) contained virulent pyogenic bacteria, but no tubercle bacilli. In one case (18) the result as to tuberculosis is inconclusive. These results, considering the small number of samples, are not of great statistical import, but the investigation is satisfactory, inasmuch as it has resulted in the tracing of definite cases of infection in three of the herds from which milk was being sent to the City. The details in connection with four cases in which the tubercle bacillus was present were forwarded to the appropriate Medical Officers of Health, and the following are extracts from reports which have been received indicating the conditions at the farms of origin :— Sample No. 3. While inspecting the herd by orders of the County Medical Officer, as tubercle bacilli had been found in the milk produced on this farm, I found two cows in milk that had definite lesions in the udder. These animals (Nos. 1 and 2) I took under the Order. These animals were in milk when the sample was taken. All the other animals were in good condition and showed no symptoms of the disease within the meaning of the Order. I took two samples of milk from two other cows that had slight induration of the udder and sent them to the County Laboratories, Ipswich, for testing, but I do not consider they were in any way tubercular, but did so to make certain. A red-and-white Ayrshire cow and a red-and-white shorthorn cow were slaughtered on the 21st instant. The post-mortem examinations revealed that the Ayrshire cow was suffering from Tuberculosis of the Udder in an advanced stage, and that the shorthorn cow was suffering from Tuberculosis of the Udder, the disease not being in an advanced stage. A later report on the result of the samples of milk taken from the two cows which had a light induration of the udder states that tubercle bacilli were not found. Sample No. 23. One cow (No. 3, a black-and-white shorthorn) showed Nodular Induration of the Udder ; a special sample of milk was taken from this cow for examination and, in addition, the animal is being subjected to the tuberculin test. No other cow in the herd was singled out for a special sample or for investigation by the Veterinary Surgeon. The herd was divided into four groups, and four mixed milk samples were taken ; these will be subjected to biological examination, and I will let you have further information when the results are at hand. A later report received indicates that mixed sample, No. 4, contained the tubercle bacilli, and I am now waiting to hear the action taken by the Local Authority. Sample No. 25. Samples were taken and submitted for microscopical and biological examination. The result of these examinations has now come to hand and indicate that none of the samples contained tubercle bacilli. Sample No. 38. One sample gave a positive result, and the animal was slaughtered under the Tuberculosis Order on Thursday, the 19th instant. The mesenteric glands were enlarged for almost the whole length of the mesentery, varying from 1 inch diameter to the size of a cricket ball in places, and on examination showed evidence of tuberculosis. The lungs were also affected, as were many of the glands which were inspected. The udder showed microscopic evidence of tuberculosis, as did the mammary lymphatic glands. The details in connection with the five samples reported as dirty, and the two containing virulent pyogenic bacteria, were forwarded to the appropriate authority for such action as they thought necessary. 58 For purposes of comparison the following summary of results obtained since the examination of milk on arrival in the City was first commenced in 1904 is here inserted.

Artizans' Dwellings, Stoney Lane, Honndsditch.—These Buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five " blocks " of Dwellings, severally named King's, Queen's, Prince's, North, and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class, some of the ground floors being let as shops. The Buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 705 persons, compared with 709 in 1930. 83 per cent, are adults and 17 per cent. children (under 14 years). In addition to these Artizans' Dwellings, the Corporation, in connection with a slum clearance scheme, erected (1) In December, 1927, a block of buildings, Bearsted House, in Hutchison Street, which contains 88 rooms, arranged in 24 tenements, and housing at the end of 1931 101 persons (92 per cent, adults and 8 per cent, children). (2) In January, 1929, a similar block of buildings, Dutton House, in New Street, containing 52 rooms, arranged in 16 tenements, and housing at the end of 1931 65 persons (60 per cent, adults and 40 per cent, children). There are 7 shops, each with a large and well-lighted basement, in Bearsted House, and 8 shops, similarly provided with a basement, in Dutton House. The total population of these dwellings is 871. The number of births was 3, viz. : 2 male and 1 female. The birth-rate was 3 -4 per 1,000, which is 3.7 per 1,000 below the average for the previous five years. The birth-rate in these Dwellings reached a maximum of 46 -9 per 1,000 in 1896, and has since been falling irregularly, but almost progressively. The death rate for 1931 was 18.4 per 1,000 per annum. For the purposes of comparison of birth and death rates, the populations in the whole of these dwellings has been included in the calculation, as probably representing a class homogeneity.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 94 ; and Housing Act, 1925, Sec. 6. The Corporation, as the Sanitary Authority in the City, are required, under the provisions of Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and Section 6 of the Housing Act, 1925, to make and enforce Bye-laws with respect to houses intended or used for occupation by the working classes and let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family for the following purposes :— For regulating the number of persons and separation of the sexes. For the registration and inspection of such houses. For enforcing drainage and promoting cleanliness and ventilation. For requiring adequate and accessible and, where necessary, separate provision of closet accommodation, washing accommodation, and accommodation for the storage, preparation and cooking of food. For the keeping in repair and adequate lighting of any common staircase. For the cleansing and redecorating of the premises, and for the paving of the courts and courtyards. For the provision of handrails for staircases. For securing adequate lighting. For the taking of precautions in any case of infectious disease. Particulars relating to the registered Lodging-houses in the City now on the Register are given in the accompanying table:— District. Number of Houses on Register. Number of Lodgers.

This necessitated the service of 66 notices during 1931. 61 In addition to the foregoing, there are twelve blocks of Dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is "self-contained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that in these circumstances they are not subject to the Byelaws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family:— Name and situation of Artizans' Block Dwellings.

Common Lodging-House, 116, Middlesex Street.—The above premises, which are known as the " Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," and is the only common lodginghouse in the City, was opened on the 7th February, 1906. It was utilised during the War as a Soldiers' Hostel, but is now again in use as a common lodging-house. The premises are periodically inspected, and always found to be well kept and in a generally satisfactory condition. Neglect to comply with Water-closet Bye-laws.— No instance of neglect in this respect has occurred during the year under review. Drainage Plans.—In the course of the year 176 plans were submitted with regard to proposed reconstruction of water-closets or drains in the City. Of these, 161 were approved ; 9 revised and approved ; and 6 not approved. Street Gullies.—The gradual substitution of properly trapped gullies for those formerly existing has greatly reduced the number of complaints received of offensive smells arising from those appliances, especially in warm weather. In some cases this nuisance was doubtless due to want of flushing, but in the majority faulty construction was the cause of the trouble. The City Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past, and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more up-to-date design will, I hope, eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil. 63 Overcrowding.—Overcrowding is a nuisance to be dealt with summarily under Section 2, Sub-section 1 (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and during the year no case was reported by your officers. Sanitary Defects and Infectious Diseases.—In every case of notification of infectious disease, the premises involved were inspected with regard to the drainage system, water supply, ventilation, &c. ; and of the 97 cases so investigated in 1931, it was found necessary to make amendments to soil and waste pipes, water-closets, &c., in 23 instances. House, Trade and other Refuse Removal.—The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1931 consisted of 26,204 cartloads of street sweepings and slops, and 47,152 loads of house and trade refuse, a total of 73,356 loads. The total for the year 1930 was 64,193. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Lett's Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. The horse manure collected from the street orderly bins is not included in the above, but is dealt with by a contractor, who sells it to market gardeners and others. Legal Proceedings.—During the year, 101 notices have been served by the District Inspectors at the order of the Sanitary Committee, and in no case was it found necessary, in consequence of non-compliance therewith, to refer the matter to the City Solicitor. Summer Flushing of Courts.—There are 161 courts and narrow passages throughout the City, which were regularly flushed during the summer months, under the direction of the City Engineer, who informs me that in this service, and the flushing of the main streets, no less than 25,111,418 gallons of water were used. Of these courts and alleys, seven were flushed four times a week, six three times a week, three twice a week, 21 once a week, five once a month, and 119 every two months. Disinfectants are also freely applied where desirable. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Customs House, as heretofore, required special attention. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the immediate vicinity of these places free from nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially during hot weather. Limewashing of Courts.—There are 60 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the City, the walls of which, unless cleansed frequently, become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of passengers or vehicles, together with the action of the smokeladen atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. Of the places so dealt with during 1931, 19 were situated in the East District, 24 in the Middle District, and 17 in the West District. Defective Connections to Sewer.—During the year, 23 reports were received from the City Engineer respecting the condition of connections between the drains of certain City houses and the public sewer. Investigations showed that it was necessary to reconstruct 21 of the connections referred to. As a result of the inspection of the internal drainage system of these premises, reconstruction or alteration was found necessary in 13 instances. In the majority of cases these external drains were brick-barrel drains, in which rats had their breeding-places, and were, undoubtedly, a source of much annoyance to the occupiers of the houses to which they were connected. BASEMENT ROOMS USED FOR SLEEPING PURPOSES. This matter has again been the subject of discussion between the London County Council, The City Corporation and other Local Authorities, with the object of introducing amended legislation. The difficult and controversial nature of the several proposals necessitates careful consideration before they are co-ordinated in the form of an Act of Parliament. PIGEONS. Although complaints continue to be received in regard to damage and nuisance caused by congregations of pigeons within the City area, these have been fewer during 1931 than for many years past. The campaign inaugurated in 1927 under the powers conferred by the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1927, has been continued, and 700 birds i 2 64 captured during the year. Of these, only three were ringed birds, and in accordance with arrangements entered into with the Homing Union, who are naturally desirous that private and perhaps valuable homing pigeons should not be destroyed, these were despatched to the Secretary for return to the owner. The remaining birds were destroyed by dislocation of the vertebrae, under the supervision of one of my officers. The pigeons were captured principally in the neighbourhood of St. Paul's Cathedral, Mansion House, Guildhall, Royal Exchange, Fishmongers' Hall, Carpenters' Hall, Leadenhall Market, and Bishopsgate Churchyard. In view of the fact that I have received numerous letters of protest against the action taken, I would again emphasise the fact that it is not the intention of the City Corporation to clear the City of these birds, the beauty of which is fully appreciated. It is, however, essential that their numbers should be kept within reasonable limits. EXHUMATION AND RE-INTERMENT OF BODIES. City of London Cemetery.—During the year the bodies of seven persons buried at the City of London Cemetery at Ilford have been exhumed and subsequently re-interred in the same Cemetery. In accordance with the terms of the licences issued by the Home Secretary in respect of these cases, the work of removal and re-interment was carried out in the early morning under the supervision of your Medical Officer of Health. HUMAN REMAINS. 33, Cock Lane. During excavation work at No. 33, Cock Lane, a small quantity of human remains was discovered. These bones were very old, and probably of Roman origin, and, with the approval of the Home Office, they were transferred to the Royal College of Surgeons for purposes of examination. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901, &c. Factories, Workshops and Workplaces.—The premises upon the Register number 3,619, in which are included 8,046 workrooms, &c. There were served 1,773 notices during the year for various purposes under the Acts. The number of factories, Workshops and Workplaces at present Registered is as follows:— Registered Places.

Outworkers and Homeworkers.—The provisions of the Act relating to " Outworkers " were carried out as heretofore, and the lists of the names and addresses of workers receiving work from the City firms were duly received without the necessity for legal proceedings. In 27 cases employers neglected to keep lists at their premises and to send copies of the same to the Corporation as required by the Act. Notice in each case was served upon the offender and in all cases complied with. No cases of infectious disease were reported in connection with outworkers' premises in the City. 66 The following figures show the number of Outworkers notified since 1902:— Year.

The entries in column 2 must necessarily be even numbers as there will be two lists for each employer—in some previous returns odd numbers have been inserted.

WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health. Note.—The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (S. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the administration of that Act in workshops and workplaces, and to send a copy of his Annual Report, or so much of it as deals with this subject, to the Secretary of State (Home Office). If the Annual Report is presented otherwise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office, the portions which do not relate to factories, workshops, workplaces, or homework. The duties of Local Authorities, and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Memorandum of March, 1912. SUPERVISION OF THE ICE CREAM TRADE. Inspections in connection with the manufacture or sale of Ice Cream within the City have been carried out. The barrows or stalls of itinerant vendors were visited from time to time during the summer season, and in any instance where lack of cleanliness or other defect was observed, the issue of a caution resulted in appropriate steps being taken to remedy the defect. No additional premises were registered during the year in accordance with the requirements of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1928. CITY MORTUARY.

In addition to the foregoing, some assistance was rendered to the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury during a period when the disinfection apparatus operated by that authority was out of use. Preservation of Bodies of Unknown Dead.—The De Rechter apparatus for the preservation of the dead, installed at the City Mortuary, in March, 1909, was fully described in the Annual Report of that year. It has proved of considerable assistance in connection with the identification of persons found drowned in the River Thames. During 1931 one body was placed in the apparatus. Fire Inquests.—Dr. F. J. Waldo, J.P., Coroner for the Citj' of London and Southwark, has kindly furnished me with the following list of places in the City which were the subject of Fire Inquests held by him during 1931:— INQUESTS HELD UNDER THE CITY OF LONDON FIRE INQUESTS ACT, 1888. Date of Inquest. Premises Burnt. 24th March, 1931 1a, Red Bull Wharf Yard. In addition to the above, the City Coroner personally inquired into 130 " non-fatal " City fires reported to him during the year. DISINFECTANTS. The disinfectants and other chemicals in use in the Public Health Department and in other branches of the Corporation's service, have, as in the past, been supplied under a contract prepared by your Medical Officer of Health. They are used for deodorising and denaturising unsound meat, disinfecting public conveniences, street gulleys, premises after infectious diseases, etc. Special attention was given to the thoroughfares in the vicinity of the Billingsgate and Smithfield Markets, the former of which presents certain difficulties in the matter of deodorisation in the summer months. Very few complaints were, however, received of offensive odours necessarily associated with the fish trade. In the interests of economy the practice of using a disinfectant fluid in conjunction with general street watering has been discontinued. 73 RAT REPRESSION. Rat repression work in the City has been affected to some extent during 1931 by the death of the City Rat Officer, Mr. J. W. Mayne, and the decision, in the interests of economy, to leave the position temporarily vacant. No urgent work, however, has been neglected, as matters that called for immediate attention were dealt with by such members of the staff as could, when the occasion demanded, spare the necessary time to devote to the solution of whatever difficulty was being experienced. The tables set out on page 74 indicate the number of investigations made, and the details of the work carried out under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919. From this summary, it will be seen that 126 buildings, occupied by 161 firms, were inspected, and that 126 of these were found to be rat-infested. One or other of the rat-catchers working in the City was engaged by 10 firms. Poisons were laid down in 86 cases, varnish traps were used in 94 cases, break-backs, wire, and other traps in 181 cases. Nine firms kept cats or dogs on the premises. In all, 101 complaints or applications for advice have been received. Rat-proofing was put into operation in 220 instances. This is the most important means of dealing with the rat problem in an area such as the City. When this is carried out in combination with elimination of hiding places, invariably marked improvement is experienced. It is not, however, possible, even with the most expensive or efficient methods of proofing, to exclude rodents from the buildings, ingress to which they obtain as opportunity occurs through open doors and windows. One of the difficulties experienced in connection with rat-proofing which so often involves structural alterations, is the fact that the duty of disinfesting premises devolves upon the occupiers, who are often loth to spend the necessary money. The owner might reasonably be expected to deal with structure in the matter, but is not legally responsible. It is not possible to report even approximately the total number of rats killed. Messrs. William Dalton & Sons, one of the firms principally engaged in this work in the City, inform me that they killed 17,904 rats in the City during 1931. The substitution of old buildings by modern structures, and the constant attention to drainage and sewage work, have probably resulted in a decrease in the rat population. So far as palliative measures are concerned, we have continued to obtain very satisfactory results from the Varnish Trap. The following figures have been supplied to me by the City Engineer:— Brick sewers reconstructed 7 Brick sewers constructed 4 Brick sewers in course of reconstruction (1st Jan., 1932) Nil. Disused sewers filled in and abolished 6 Brick sewers reinverted, pointed and repaired 19 Pipe sewers reconstructed 3 Miscellaneous repairs to sewers, drains, etc 32 House drains constructed in connection with new buildings 33 Drains of existing buildings reconstructed 25 House drains reconstructed in connection with the reconstruction and rein- verting of certain sewers 134 Gulley drains constructed and reconstructed in connection with the reconstruction and reinverting of certain sewers 44 New gullies and drains constructed 3 Gulley drains reconstructed 64 House and gulley drains repaired 192 Disused drains bricked up 171 Rats killed by sewer foreman and his men 1,402 No poison was used in the sewers during the year. The number of drainage reconstructions carried out under the supervision of inspectors of this Department is set out on page 74. 74 RATS AND MICE (DESTRUCTION) ACT, 1919.

In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or of any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognizance of the appointment, 132 persons were examined by the Medical Officer of Health during 1931. Nine of these persons were reported as physically unfit for office, and the decision in regard to one is pending. Twenty-three officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement. With six exceptions, all were reported to be unfit for duty. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, W M. WILLOUGHBY, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London.

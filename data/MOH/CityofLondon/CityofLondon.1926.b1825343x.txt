R March, 1914 B annual report of the medical officer of health for the year 1926 To the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the Corporation of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C. 25th January, 1927. My Lord Mayor and Gentlemen, I beg to present herewith the report of the Medical Officer of Health for the Corporation of the City of London for the year 1926. It is with considerable regret that I have to report that, owing to an attack of illness, my personal activities in the department have had to be distinctly restricted. I much appreciate the consideration which has been extended to me by the Corporation, and I desire to express to every member of my staff my personal appreciation of the efforts which each has displayed to ensure that the work should proceed on normal lines. My colleague, Dr. Willoughby, for a time held himself available to assist in cases of difficulty, and later on was appointed Acting Medical Officer of Health with the knowledge and approval of the Ministry of Health. There are several matters of more than ordinary interest in this report, among which I may mention : (a) The Meat Regulations, designed to ensure increased cleanliness in the handling and transport of meat, came into operation in April, 1925, and 1926 is the first completed year during which it has been possible to obtain experience as to their working. The regulations affected Smithfield and other City markets, as well as the City shops, and it was found necessary to appoint a special inspector to supervise the observance of these regulations. Although considerable improvement has been effected, it will be some time yet before entirely satisfactory conditions can be reported. In the case of vans transporting meat from the market, a new type has appeared and a general desire is displayed to embody such structural arrangements as will assist cleanliness. Some difficulty is experienced in respect of porters' uniform, but I hope to make certain proposals in the near future. (b) An embargo has been placed on certain imported pork by Government Order. This chiefly affects the trade from the Netherlands. The fundamental cause of the order was the attempt by the Ministry of Agriculture to control epidemics of Foot and Mouth disease. Presumably much of the pork which came in the fresh state from the countries coming under the operation of the restricting order now reaches other countries, and some may come to this country in the form of " green " or other bacon, (c) Attention has previously been directed to the increasing frequency of caseous lymphadenitis in sheep carcases. creasing frequency of caseous lymphadenitis in sheep carcases. A further increase is noted in 1926 over 1925, thus:— Exporting Country. 1925. 1926. Argentine 263 267 Australia 9 143 Chili 10 93 New Zealand 7 30 Uruguay 62 91 Total 351 624 I have to suggest that it is desirable that it should be made an offence to cut out lymph glands from mutton, and probably beef carcases, as is it to cut out lymph glands from pig carcases, (d) The year 1926 witnessed the last of the slaughterings at Aldgate, at which place this work has been carried out for hundreds of years. The powers were obtained by Act of Parliament, and compensation is now being paid either by arrangement or by arbi- b 2 8 tration. (e) It is highly satisfactory to be able to report a negative result for the first year since 1904, when formal samples of milk were first purchased for examination as to the presence of tubercle bacilli. Since that year the annual percentage affected among 50 samples obtained, has varied between 24 in each of two series taken in 1925 to about 25 per cent, in two series taken in 1921. (f) Increased control over imported milk is being attempted by the Public Health (Imported Milk) Regulations, 1926. Among other requirements, it is now necessary for any importer of such milk to register with the Local Authority. At the time of writing this report, none such had registered in the City. (g) Progress continues to be made both with the closure of houses in the Hutchison Street and Vine Street insanitary areas. When a tenant of an unfit house leaves, it is not allowed to be reoccupied. The accommodation which is in course of erection at Shepherdess Walk and Middlesex Street is now well advanced, and when the dwellings are available the tenants in the insanitary areas will be removed thereto, and so enable these areas to be properly dealt with. Accommodation will also be available for many of the occupants of separate insanitary houses within the City, in respect of which at the present moment, owing to lack of alternative accommodation, suitable action cannot be taken. STATISTICAL INFORMATION. Area.—The City of London (excluding The Temple) comprises an area of 661 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 1 .032 square miles, equal to a square of 1 .016 miles to a side. The area of "Registration London" is 74,817 acres (excluding tidal water and foreshore), or 116.9 square miles, equal to a square of 10.81 miles to a side. Density (1926).—City of London, Registration District, at night, 20 0 persons to an acre; City of London, Registration District, during the day, *644.1 persons to an acre; Registration London, at night, 616 persons to an acre. Annual Rateable Value.—The rateable value of property within the administrative county of London (including the City) was £55,917,174 on 6th April, 1926; whilst on the same date the corresponding rateable value of property in the City of London was £8,025,066 or about one-seventh of the whole County. The sum receivable from a penny rate is £33,395. Population.—The undermentioned figures are extracted from the Report of the Registrar-General on the Census of England and Wales, 1921:— Area, Inhabited Houses. Population. Statute Acres. 1911. 1921 1911. 1921. City of London (Not including the Temple) 661 2,784 2,398 19,657 13,709 These figures represent the population on the nights of the 3rd April, 1911, and the 19th Tune. 1921. The following table shows the progressive decline which has taken place since 1861 in the number of inhabitants who reside within the City boundaries, and the progressive increase in the number of workers who are daily employed in the City :— Year. Imperial Census. Night Population. City Census. Day Population 1861 112,063 1866 — 170,133 1871 75,983 — 1881 51,405 261,061 1891 37,705 301,384 1901 26,923 1911 19,657 364,061 1921 13,706 436,721 (Imperial Census). There is only one registration district in the City. The estimated population of the City for the year 1926 is 13,230. The day Census taken in 1911 showed that the day population was 364,061 persons, and also that 1,077,155 persons and 94,095 vehicles entered and left the City on the day the count was taken. * This figure refers only to persons " actively engaged in the City during the daytime," and is based upon the Imperial Census taken in June, 1921. 9 Births.—During the year 1926, 383 births were registered in the City, 311 of which, however, did not belong thereto. To the remaining 72 must be added the births of 34 children born to citizens temporarily residing outside the City boundary. The number of births, therefore, on which the rate should be calculated is 106. The annual birth-rate was 71 per 1,000 persons of all ages, compared with a quinquennial mean rate of 8-6 per 1,000. In the Metropolis the birth-rate in 1926 was 171 per 1,000. Mortality.—During the year under review, 703 deaths were registered in the District, including 644 persons dying in the City, but not belonging thereto. See table, p. 19, for details. Deducting these latter, 59 deaths remain, to which must be added those of 79 persons who died in institutions in outside districts, where they were registered ; the total, therefore, on which the City death-rate is calculated is 138. The death-rate for 1926 was 104 per 1,000 per annum of the population (the previous year being 11 •!), whilst that for the whole of the Metropolis was 11-6. Deaths from Violence.—Of the City deaths, 72 per cent, were caused by injuries or violence, as compared with 5 *3 in 1924 and 4 -4 in 1925. This is 23 above the average for the previous five years.

Infantile Mortality.—The deaths of children under one year of age were at the rate of 66 per 1,000 births, as against 64 for the whole of London. 10 CAUSES OF, AND AGES AT, DEATH DURING THE YEAR 1926.

Vaccination was postponed by medical certificate in no cases, 192 had removed into other districts, or the vaccinations were pending at the end of the year. There were 77 instances of conscientious objection. The Public Vaccinator performed 9 re-vaccinations during the year, and in addition to the 103 successful vaccinations referred to above, 3 adult persons were vaccinated for the first time.

Of these only 75 belonged to the City, and the balance were transferred to the appropriate Authorities. Infant Welfare Work.—Miss Wilkinson, who undertakes the work in connection with the Notification of Births Act and Infant Welfare, reports having made 201 visits in connection with birth notification and 149 special visits in connection with infant welfare. In addition to this figure, 63 visits were made to the homes of expectant mothers. Eleven visits have also been made in respect of cases coming within the scope of the Children Act, 1908; mainly in relation to nurse children. Sixteen visits were made in connection with verminous school children. At the centre above referred to, a total of 750 attendances was made by mothers. Convalescent Homes.—A. suggestion of some value in Maternity and Child Welfare work has been made during the year by one of the adjoining Metropolitan Boroughs. In that Borough it is felt that the time is now opportune for the establishment of a convalescent home, to be placed at the disposal of the several maternity and child welfare committees operating in the metropolis. So far as the City is concerned, active participation in any scheme of this nature does not appear to me to be necessary, as by virtue of the several charities peculiarly associated with the City, convalescent home accommodation is generally available for City residents who require it. The Metropolitan Boroughs, however, are not so favourably situated, and doubtless some such accommodation is urgently needed, especially in those areas which include in their population a large number of the poorer members of the community. 12 VITAL STATISTICS OF WHOLE DISTRICT DURING 1926 AND PREVIOUS YEARS.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES. Few comments are necessary with reference to the incidence of infectious disease during the year 1926. Diphtheria was prevalent to the extent of 47 cases compared with 16 in 1925. The number of Scarlet Fever cases was 38 compared with 24 in 1925. There were 6 cases of Erysipelas. Measles and Rubella are not notifiable diseases and only a few cases of illness of this type were brought to my notice through the medium of the school medical service. Five cases of Chicken-pox were notified and none of Ophthalmia Neonatorum. The percentage of cases removed to hospital for treatment continues satisfactory. In each instance of notified disease a detailed examination is made of the sanitary conditions of the premises where the case occurred and a summary of defects found by the District Inspector is given on page 58. Notification of Infectious Diseases.—In the following tables will be found particulars of certificates relating to cases of infectious disease, and information as to the removal of patients to hospitals, infirmaries, etc. Examination for Pathogenic Bacteria.—During the year the following specimens were so dealt with. It will be seen that positive results were obtained in 14.5 per cent. of these cases. Result. Specimen. Disease suspected. Positive.

Puerperal Fever has been notifiable throughout the country since the Infectious Disease (Notification) Extension Act, 1899, came into force, but experience has shewn that, for a variety of reasons, notification has been far from complete. The main reason for the comparative failure to notify has been found in the fact that Puerperal Fever is ill-defined and is not a specific disease comparable with Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria. There appears to be frequently genuine doubt as to the correct diagnosis. The Ministry of Health, therefore, decided to modify the existing arrangements for notification of Puerperal Fever by requiring prompt notification as soon as symptoms suggestive of septic infection became manifest. It will ultimately doubtless be desirable to replace the term "Puerperal Fever" by the term "Puerperal Pyrexia," but without legislation amending the Infectious Diseases (Notification) Acts, it is not permissible to substitute "Puerperal Pyrexia" for "Puerperal Fever "as a disease notifiable under the Acts. The new Regulations, which came into operation on the 1st October of this year, therefore, whilst prescribing new forms for the notification of cases of Puerperal Fever, also require the notification of Puerperal Pyrexia, thus placing an obligation upon medical practitioners to notify all cases of Puerperal Pyrexia during the puerperium, irrespective of the cause to which the fever may be attributed. It is expected that this requirement will result in an increase in numbers of notifications, and that many cases reported will be relatively trivial in degree, but the importance of securing adequate treatment in the early stages of Puerperal infection is rightly regarded as outweighing any objection to the notification of a certain amount of minor illness. So far as the City is concerned, this possibility of increased notifications is of very small importance in view of the peculiar nature of the City population. There were in fact no notifications during the year of this illness. PUBLIC HEALTH (OPHTHALMIA NEONATORUM) REGULATIONS, 1926. The above-mentioned Regulations, which came into force on the 1st October last, revoked those made in 1914, under which an obligation was laid on certified midwives to notify any case of Ophthalmia Neonatorum unless the case had already been notified by a medical practitioner. This system of dual notification, in some instances resulted in complete failure to notify. The Regulations issued this year, however, place the onus to notify solely on the medical practitioner, and it is hoped that the difficulties which were manifest in the Regulations now superceded will not be again experienced. No notifications of this disease were received during the year. NURSING PROVISION. Measles, etc.—The Corporation has approved of the expenditure of £25 per annum in respect of the nursing of complicated cases of Measles, Encephalitis Lethargica and Cerebrospinal Fever, and have also agreed to expend the sum of £30 on provision of medical assistance and nursing attendance in necessitous cases of Influenza. No action was necessary under this heading during 1926. TEMPORARY ISOLATION ACCOMMODATION. 29, MIDDLESEX STREET. In 1918, the Corporation made provision for suitable accommodation for the isolation and observation of Small-pox contacts at premises situated at 6, Bridegwater Square. These premises were demolished in 1925, and alternative accommodation has been provided at 29, Middlesex Street, E.C. It was not found necessary to use the provision during the year. TUBERCULOSIS. Tuberculosis Dispensary.—The Tuberculosis Dispensary has been open throughout the year for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis of various types on Tuesdays and Fridays from 12-30 to 2-30; on Mondays from 5-0 to 8-0; on Thursdays from 6-0 to 8-0; and on Wednesdays, 11-30 to 1-0. In all, 255 sessions have been held, and in addition the Tuberculosis Officer has visited cases at their homes when necessary. New Patients.—The number of new patients examined was 410 as compared with 374 last year. c 2 16 A.—PATIENTS RESIDENT IN THE CITY. Diagnosis. Pulmonary. Non-Pulmonary. Total. Adults. Children.

This system has worked satisfactorily. Persons Treated and Supervised at the Dispensary.— (A) Patients resident in the City. All persons suffering from tuberculosis who are resident in the City may be supervised and treated at the Dispensary. The total number of cases so treated was 98. In addition a large number of contacts are kept under observation. (B) Patients non-resident in the City. (a) Who work in the City. On diagnosis these patients are informed that they can be treated and advised at the Dispensary or transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough. The majority decide to remain patients at the Dispensary. (b) Who do not work in the City. On diagnosis these patients are transferred to the Tuberculosis Officer of their own Borough, so none are treated here. Total Attendances— Insured. Non-Insured. Total. Residents 267 292 559 Non-Residents 516 900 1,416 1,975 In view of the fact that cases in the last stages of the disease are extremely infectious, especially in crowded houses, the Corporation have made arrangements to pay for the maintenance of selected City cases at St. Columbia's Hospital, Swiss Cottage. One such case was admitted in 1926. Artificial pneumothorax treatment has been used to a larger extent during the year. Artificial Pneumothorax was induced in 5 cases, and 150 Refills done in connection with the Dispensary. The Tuberculosis Nurse.—The work of the Tuberculosis Nurse has been continued on the same lines as former years. Ninety homes have been visited and 503 visits made in connection with after care and following up. In addition to the above, patients, some of whom were in an advanced stage of the disease, have been nursed in their own homes. One of these cases terminated fatally. For nursing purposes 13 visits were paid. General.—The following information is supplied in accordance with the requirements of the Ministry of Health. The paragraph numbers correspond with those in Circular 648, and where a number is omitted the subject matter does not concern City work :— (i.) The Tuberculosis Dispensary is at St. Bartholomew's Hospital; the Tuberculosis Officer is Dr. F. H. Young, O.B.E.; one Tuberculosis Nurse is engaged in the work. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for insured and uninsured persons by the London County Council. (iii.) Patients are referred to the Tuberculosis Dispensary from hospitals, school clinics and other institutions, with all of which there is close co-operation. 18 The services of the Staff and all the resources of St. Bartholomew's Hospital are available for diagnosis and treatment. Many patients are referred to departments of the Hospital for these purposes. (iv.) The Tuberculosis Officer is in constant consultation and communication with general practitioners, so that there is close co-operation between them and the Dispensary. He reminds them when reports are due on insured patients under domiciliary treatment and provides them with copies of the form with names and addresses inserted. (v.) When the diagnosis is in doubt and the patient is under the care of a practitioner arrangements are made with him for re-examination ; in other cases arrangements are made with the patient, but should he fail to attend, either the Tuberculosis Nurse calls upon him or he is reminded of the appointment in writing. (vi.) The Tuberculosis Officer explains to the patients the importance of the examination of home contacts, and in addition to the necessary visits of the Sanitary Inspectors, the Tuberculosis Nurse visits the homes of City residents periodically for the same purpose, and arranges for the attendance of the contacts at the Dispensary at times convenient to them. The supervision of these contacts and the re-examination of suspects among them is secured by the home visits periodically made by the Nurse. (vii.) Considerable use is made of X-rays from the point of view of diagnosis and decision as to method of treatment to be recommended. The usual methods of treatment have been continued in the Dispensary. Tuberculin has been used in a few cases. In addition five cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are attending for the continuation of their treatment by artificial pneumo-thorax and inductions of the treatment have been performed in several cases in the wards of the Hospital. (viii.) Experience shows that when the disease is active, residence in an institution more quickly and certainly brings about arrest than when treatment is attempted at home on sanatorium lines, and that the lessons learnt in the sanatorium are sometimes put into practice by the patient on his return home to his permanent advantage. (ix.) Dental treatment is provided by the Dental Department of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and the Corporation defrays the whole or part of the cost of artificial dentures for necessitous cases. (x.) Nursing in their own homes of patients resident in the City is one of the duties of the Tuberculosis Nurse. Milk has been provided for necessitous persons requiring extra nourishment and in this connection the sum of £55 has been expended. (xi.) Patients suffering from Non-pulmonary Tuberculosis receive advice and treatment from the Surgeons of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, to whom they are referred from the Dispensary. Treatment in residential institutions is provided for as pulmonary cases. The Corporation supplies surgical apparatus free of cost for necessitous residents in the City. (xii.) The arrangements for "care" and "after care" are carried out by a subcommittee of the Sanitary Committee, on which two ladies are co-opted as members.* It receives detailed reports on all cases of Tuberculosis occurring among City residents. (xiii.) No local arrangements exist for providing employment for patients. (xiv.) No opportunity has arisen for the use of a shelter, but arrangements would be made for any suitable case if a site were available. (xv.) No special points have been noted as to the incidence of Tuberculosis; the records do not show that the disease is specially prevalent among any class of workers in the City. (xvi.) The usual method for preventing the spread of infection are adopted, and pocket sputum flasks are provided free of cost. (xvii.) The principal difficulty encountered occurs on the discharge of a patient from a sanatorium with the disease quiescent. The home environment to which he returns is often unsatisfactory; suitable occupation near his home may be practically unobtainable, even when remuneration is not the main consideration, and the very considerable benefit gained is in some cases soon lost and the treatment in the sanatorium largely wasted. (xviii.) Difficulties also arise with regard to advanced cases. These are usually very infectious and do not care to go to the Infirmary. This has been largely remedied by the arrangement made by the Corporation already referred to. The following table sets out the number of cases both of Pulmonary and Non-Pulmonary Tuberculosis, which were brought to my notice during the year 1926, and also the total number of deaths from Tuberculosis among City residents during the same period:— Age Periods.

The following is a brief summary of the work carried out at the Special Treatment Centre for Venereal Diseases during the year 1926:— At the beginning of the year 276 males and 105 females were registered on the books as being under treatment or observation, which compares with 383 males and 145 females at the beginning of the previous year. Of these patients, 181 males and 88 females were under treatment for syphilis and 94 males and 47 females for gonorrhoea. One male was under treatment for conditions other than venereal disease. New patients admitted totalled 485 as compared with 402 in the previous year, and 417 in 1924 and 505 in 1923. 20 males and 18 females suffering from syphilis discharged themselves before completing the first course, and 15 males and 14 females after completing the first course, but before completion of treatment. 16 males and 6 females completed treatment, but failed to submit themselves to final test; 21 males and 2 females were transferred to other centres, whilst 20 males and 1 female were discharged after completion of treatment and observation. In the case of gonorrhoea, 92 males and 12 females, out of the total of 251 and 41 of the respective sexes coming under treatment during the year for the first time, discharged themselves before completion of the first course of treatment. The total number of attendances of all persons at the clinic was 11,656, which total is made up as follows:— Syphilis. Soft Chancre. Gonorrhœa. Non-Venereal Conditions. Total Attendances. Male. Female. Male Female. Male. Female. Male. Female. Male.

For the past fifty years the Royal Sanitary Institute has taken a prominent part in the cause of Public Health, and to celebrate its Jubilee an Imperial Congress was held in London from 5th to 10th July. Much good has been done in the past by these Congresses, as an opportunity is thereby afforded of open and free discussion between those charged with the welfare of the community from the different aspects of preventive medicine. The delegates were representative of every branch of public health work, and an exceedingly interesting programme was arranged which embraced practically all sections of its activities. The opening meeting of the Congress was held in the Guildhall, where also the official reception by the Lord Mayor and Corporation, the final function of the Congress, was held on 9th July. It is a source of satisfaction to a City official to learn that the Congress was regarded generally as one of the most successful ever held by the Institute, and that this success was in no small measure assisted by the active interest taken in the ceremony by the Corporation. ROYAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BRISTOL, MAY 19th—24th. The above-mentioned Congress was attended by the delegates of the Corporation. It was fairly representative, and the business side of it deserved special commendation. The subject submitted for consideration of the delegates could not fail to be of great service. It is not desirable here to make detailed reference to the items, but two papers may be mentioned which were of interest to the City. I refer to that by Dr. Lyster, the County Medical Officer of Health for Hampshire, on "Factory Hygiene as a part of Public Health." Dr. Lyster, together with your Medical Officer of Health, were on a small Committee of the British Medical Association appointed to discuss and consider this matter, and the reader of the paper submitted the decisions arrived at. The moderate nature of the proposals submitted was somewhat objected to by many of the speakers, but the opportunity was favourable to bring forward arguments, and considerable progress was made and many misunderstandings cleared away. The Congress was the subject of a full report to the Corporation by its official delegates. It should be mentioned that the Factories' Bill introduced at the end of 1926 was subsequently withdrawn by the Government. It has been stated, however, that it will be reintroduced at the end of 1926. Another paper of considerable interest to the City was that read by Dr. Savage, on "The Public Health (Meat) Regulations, 1924." This was a well-attended meeting and a very lively discussion followed. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE PREVENTION OF TUBERCULOSIS, GLASGOW, JULY 1st—3rd. The Corporation delegates attended the Twelfth Annual Conference of the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, held at Glasgow in July. The following subjects were dealt with in papers read at the Congress:— (a) Provision for the care of Non-pulmonary Tuberculosis. (b) The place and functions of the Tuberculosis Dispensaries. (c) The age factor in Tuberculosis. (d) The treatment of Tuberculosis by artificial sunlight. An interesting and detailed report on the Conference was submitted to the Corporation by its delegates, to whom I am indebted for the following summary of the views of speakers on the results of treatment of tuberculosis:— 1. At present no certain cure for established tuberculosis is known to science. 2. If taken in time pulmonary* disease can be arrested by proper treatment. 3. The arrest of the disease may be permanent, but there is always a risk that if the patient returns to his former way of life recrudescence may occur. Although little was said of prevention, the speakers laid particular stress on three points which may well be here reproduced: 1. That tuberculosis thrives and spreads in crowded districts. The great difficulty in stamping it out is the overcrowding which prevails, especially in industrial areas. It was shown that even to-day in Glasgow more than half the population live in one or two-roomed houses. D 2 24 2. That wonderful results have been obtained in the treatment of surgical tuberculosis by sunlight, real and artificial, but that fresh air and good food play an equally important part in all such "cures." 3. That pulmonary tuberculosis can be arrested by several methods, notably sanatorium treatment, but as has already been pointed out, there is always the risk of recrudescence if the infected individual returns to insanitary surroundings with bad food. HYGIENE OF HAIRDRESSERS' AND BARBERS' SHOPS. A system of voluntary registration of hairdressers' establishments with the Department of the Medical Officer of Health was instituted in 1904. The following is a list of establishments at present on the register:— Alfred Kingston, 8 and 10, Ludgate Arcade. Charles Lehman. 8 and 9, Aldermanbury Postern. Thos. W. Monk, 5, Angel Court. Ed. Hy. Prince, (69, Fore Street. Harry C. Wicks, trading as Arthur & Co., 42a, Old Broad Street. Einar P. Eilert, 75, Mark Lane. Samuel & Harry Cohen, trading as Cohen & Co., 120, Newgate Street. SMOKE AND ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION. Thirteen instances of smoke nuisance or annoyance from chimneys were dealt with during the year. Some of these were of a temporary character and did not recur, others were abated upon service of the usual form of notice upon the offenders and there has been no occasion to take further action. As mentioned in previous Reports, the annoyance and the evil from coal smoke cannot satisfactorily be dealt with by law until the enactments at present in force are strengthened or amended. Much dirt and discomfort from smoke continues, although to a distinctly less degree than in former years, and for which the enormous number of chimneys, domestic and otherwise, in and surrounding Greater London is largely responsible. A critical examination of the air in the City was commenced in the year 1914, in conjunction with the Committee for the Investigation of Atmospheric Pollution, appointed by the International Exhibition and Conference in London, 1912. A large rain gauge is mounted upon the roof of one of the Corporation's buildings in Golden Lane, and the rain-water from a known area of surface is collected monthly. This rain-water, containing the soot, grit and dust washed from the air, has been submitted for examination to the Public Analyst and the results tabulated. For comparison the results obtained from similar observations made at the Archbishop's Park, Lambeth, by the London County Council, are shown in the attached table. The table also shows the rainfall for the months of January to December of the year 1925 and the amounts found of insoluble matter, tar, soot, and dust, also the soluble matter, together with the sulphates, ammonia and chlorine in the volume collected. The results as given by the Public Analyst have been re-calculated into metric tons per square kilometre during each month. One metric ton per square kilometre is equivalent approximately to 9 lbs. per acre, or 2.56 tons per square mile. Although the presence of much impurity in the atmosphere has been long known the figures given represent a definite record of the facts. In examining the table it will be appreciated that in the month of November only, the amount of deposit registered as falling in the City amounted to 28.77 tons per square kilometre, which is equal (estimating the City as haying an area of one square mile) to no less than about 73 tons avoirdupois. Of this mass of dirt, approximately 41 tons were soluble, and included the chemicals mentioned, and 32 tons were insoluble and consisted of tar, carbon and grit. In addition to the foregoing, a daily observation has been made at mid-day at the Guildhall of the purity of the air by a modern dry method, by which the suspended matter can be readily demonstrated. From the 1st January until the 31st December the amount of the impurity at noon has varied from half a milligramme to six milligrammes per cubic metre of air; this latter figure includes times when there has been a fog. 25 SUMMARY OF MONTHLY OBSERVATIONS AND REPORTS DURING THE YEAR 1926.

During the year 1926, 1,048 samples of Food and Drugs were submitted to the Public Analyst for examination. Of this number, 686 were taken as test examples without the formalities of the Acts being observed; of these, 18 were found adulterated, made upas follows 3 of Butter out of 97 samples taken. 3 of Cream out of 14 samples taken. 3 of Liniment of Turpentine out of 13 samples taken. 2 of Malt Vinegar out of 17 samples taken. 1 of Ginger Wine out of 1 sample taken. 1 of Gregory's Powder out of 8 samples taken. 1 of Calomel Ointment out of 4 samples taken. 1 of Sulpur Ointment out of 2 samples taken. 1 of White Precipitate Ointment out of 5 samples taken. 1 of Purified Borax out of 10 samples taken. 1 of Vinegar out of 23 samples taken. 27 Of the formal samples, 27 out of 362 were found to be adulterated, made up as follows:— 13 of Milk out of 295 samples taken. 3 of Cream out of 3 samples taken. 3 of Gin out of 8 samples taken. 2 of Butter out of 16 samples taken. 1 of Liniment of Turpentine out of 2 samples taken. 1 of Margarine out of 1 sample taken. 1 of Rum out of 6 samples taken. 1 of Vinegar out of 1 sample taken. 1 of Whisky out of 26 samples taken. 1 of White Precipitate Ointment out of 1 sample taken. The above samples, in all cases except Milk, Margarine and Spirits, were taken as the result of informal samples having been certified as adulterated. General Observations:—The percentage rate of adulteration of all foods sampled in the City was 4.2, as compared with 3.7 for 1925. Butter.—Of the 113 samples of butter taken, 64 were of butter served with bread or scone. Of these samples, 5 were certified to consist of Margarine. Drugs.—Ten samples of Drugs were found not to comply with the standards of the British Pharmacopoeia. There was one prosecution. In other instances cautions were issued. Margarine.—One sample of Margarine was sold in an improperly marked wrapper. The attention of the Vendor was called to this and the wrapper altered to comply with the legal requirements. One sample was sold in a plain wrapper and the Vendor prosecuted and fined. Spirits.—Of the 40 samples of Spirits taken, 5 were found to be below the statutory minimum strength of 35 degrees under proof. In 2 instances legal proceedings were institutued, and in the other cases the Vendors were cautioned. Ginger Wine.—In connection with the recorded instance of adulteration of Ginger Wine, the wholesalers withdrew the brew from stock when their attention was called to the matter. SUPERVISED AND REGISTERED PREMISES. Wholesale Dealers in Margarine and Margarine Cheese.—One new application for registration was received during the year from a firm which had carried on the business for several months. This information was obtained during the course of enquiries instituted by reason of a communication from another Local Authority. Legal proceedings were taken against this firm for failing to register, but the case was dismissed under the Probation of Offenders' Act on payment of £1 1s. costs. Ice Cream.—The usual inspections in connection with the manufacture or sale of Ice Cream within the City were made. In all cases where manufacture took place outside the City the Local Authority concerned was informed and requested to state if the premises and manufacture were satisfactory. Replies to these enquiries showed, with one exception, conditions to be satisfactory. In the case mentioned, sanitary improvements were required and executed. The barrows or stalls of itinerant vendors were visited from time to time during the Summer season, and in several instances where a lack of cleanliness of the utensils was observed cautions were administered. THE MILK AND DAIRIES ORDER, 1926, AND THE MILK AND DAIRIES (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1922. Sixteen new applications for registration as retail purveyors of milk were received and approved during the year. Registration Statistics. Number of Retail Purveyors of Milk on the Register at end of 1925 340 New Applications for Registration received 16 Applications granted 16 Applications refused — Names of Retailers transferred to new Register 1 Names of Retailers removed from the Register 22 Number of Retail Purveyors of Milk on the Register at the end of 1926 334 Number of Milksellers (other than Retail Purveyors of Milk) on the Register at the end of 1925 Nil Licences issued under the Milk (Special Designations) Order, 1923 4 28 Inspection of Premises where Milk is Retailed.—During the year, 356 inspections were made in connection with the supervision of the sale of milk. Defects of a minor character were observed in several instances and action taken to ensure that the requirements relating to the sale of milk were complied with. The Milk and Dairies Order, 1926, became operative on 1st October, 1926, and this Order revoked the Dairies, Cowsheds and Milkshops Orders, 1885, 1886 and 1899, so far as they relate to England and Wales, and any regulations made thereunder by a Local Authority. This Order has consolidated and added to the requirements regulating the milk trade. A copy of the Order was sent to each person on the register. EXAMINATION OF MILK. Chemical.—Thirteen samples, all of which were procured formally, were found to be adulterated, giving a percentage of milk adulteration of 4.4 compared with 3.0 for 1925. There were five prosecutions and penalties were imposed in three instances. In the seven cases in which proceedings were not deemed advisable, the vendors or consignors were cautioned. The following table shows the percentage of fat contained in each of the 295 samples of milk examined. Twelveout of thisnumber contained fat in amounts below the point which presumes adulteration, i.e., 3 per cent. The highest amount of fat contained in any sample was 7.2 per cent.:— Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. Percentage of Fat. No. of Samples. 2.5 1 3.9 16 2.6 2 4.0 12 2.7 2 4.1 7 2.8 4 4.2 2 2.9 3 4.3 2 3.0 4 4.4 3 3.1 7 4.5 1 3.2 11 4.6 3 3.3 23 4.9 3 3.4 40 5.1 2 3.5 50 5.5 1 3.6 33 5.7 1 3.7 31 6.5 1 3.8 29 7.2 1 Total 295 In the 18 cases where the percentage of fat exceeded 4.2 special enquiries were made as usual. Ten of these samples were taken from milk vessels in shops, and probably the retailers' neglect to properly plunge the milk accounted for the excessive fat content. Eight other samples were taken from churns in course of delivery at Railway Stations, and two of these were from Jersey cows. By the Milk and Dairies (Consolidation) Act, 1915, where a sample of milk has been taken from a purveyor, such purveyor may serve a notice within sixty hours upon the Local Authority stating the name and address of the seller from whom he received the milk and the time and place of delivery to the purveyor by the seller or consignor of milk from a corresponding milking, requesting the Local Authority to take steps to procure a sample in course of transit from the seller or consignor. Thirty-five such requests were received during the year. Milk sampling has been carried out at irregular hours, and none of those taken on Sunday mornings proved to be below standard. BACTERIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF MILK SAMPLES COLLECTED AT RAILWAY STATIONS. During the month of September, 42 samples of milk were collected on arrival at Liverpool Street Station and submitted to Sir Frederick Andrewes, K.B.E., City Bacteriologist, for bacteriological examination and investigation as to the presence of "dirt." A duplicate of each sample was collected, and this was submitted to Mr. E. A. Pinchin, B.Sc., Public Analyst, for chemical examination. 29 The samples were collected with particular regard to cleanliness and in the manner reported in detail to your Committee in November, 1924. The samples had been despatched from 42 different farms, situated in the following counties:— Cambridgeshire 1 sample. Essex 11 samples. Hertfordshire 1 sample. Huntingdonshire 3 samples. Norfolk 13 samples. Suffolk 13 samples. The following is a summary of Sir Frederick Andrewes' report on the results of the bacteriological examinations:— "Dirt.—28 out of 42 specimens are passed as clean (two-thirds of the whole). The remainder contained minimal traces of dirt—only one had larger traces (No. 42)—and even that I should not class as a dirty milk. The improvement in the cleanness of the milks has been gradual for several years, but I have been struck by the exceptional cleanness of the specimens on this occasion. "Tubercle.—Owing to an outbreak of B. Aertrycke infection in the animal house, several animals died prematurely. In five instances death occurred within the first week after inoculation, and such animals must be struck out as 'Frustrate experiments.' In three more instances death occurred during the second week after inoculation, and although careful search failed to reveal any tubercle bacilli, I have returned these as doubtfully negative. "In 34 cases the result is reasonably certain, and in these no single animal has shown any sign of tubercle. This is, I think, the first time since I began to examine milk samples for the Corporation in 1913, that no tuberculous milk has been found amongst the samples taken. "(Signed) F. W. ANDREWES, M.D." The bacteriological result above shown is distinctly satisfactory, especially in view of the fact that it follows progressively equally satisfactory results in two series of experiments conducted in 1925.

The offences in the three exceptions were :— Sample No. 705 5 per cent. Fat abstracted. „ 743 „ „ 768 ,, „ „ The consignors of the above-mentioned three samples were cautioned and examination of subsequent samples collected from the same sources, on arrival in the City, showed that e 30 in one instance the fat content was below the legal standard. This sample, however, was collected from one of two churns forwarded to the same consignee and the average of the two churns was above the legal standard. Further samples will be examined. The other two samples were in accordance with requirements. PUBLIC HEALTH (MILK AND CREAMi REGULATIONS, 1912 & 1917. During 1926, 295 samples of Milk were examined under these Regulations, and all were found to be free from preservative. Seventeen samples of cream (not preserved) were purchased, six of which were certified to contain Boric Acid but in no instance was the amount in excess of that permitted by the Regulations for Preserved Cream. Of these six samples, three were informal, and three were formal, purchased from the same vendors respectively. Explanations in each case were submitted to the effect that through inadvertence a declaration was omitted to be attached to the receptacle. Ten samples of Preserved Cream were obtained and found to comply with the Regulations as to labelling and the amount of preservative permitted. In no instance did the fat content of Preserved Cream fall below 35 per cent. No contravention of the other requirements relating to preserved cream was found. All the samples of Cream and Preserved Cream were certified to be free from thickening substances. 1. Milk; and Cream not sold as Preserved Cream.

The above-mentioned regulations, made during 1926 under the provisions of the Public Health Acts, 1896 and 1907, and Section 8 of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1922, come into operation on 1st January, 1927. No person after that date is permitted to receive imported milk which is intended for sale for human consumption unless he is registered under these new regulations by the Sanitary Authority into whose district the milk is imported. A standard of bacterial content is established and the milk must be free from tubercle bacilli. Should the milk not comply with this standard, the consignee may be called upon to show cause why the Sanitary Authority should not remove his name from the register. Any breach of the regulations renders the defaulter liable to a penalty of £100 and a daily penalty of £50. At the time of writing this report no importer of milk in liquid form carries on business in the City. MEAT INSPECTION. The following tabulated report has been prepared by Mr. T. Dunlop Young, Veterinary Surgeon. My observation on a few points of importance raised by the Report follow. According to the Board of Trade Returns for the Year ending 31st December, 1926 the imports of Beef, Mutton, Pork and Bacon were as under:— Beef. Cwts. Mutton. Cwts. Pork. Cwts. Bacon. Cwts.

Of the total beef supply, Argentina sent 78 per cent., Australia 9 per cent., Uruguay 7 per cent., New Zealand 4 per cent., and the United States, Denmark and "Other Countries," the balance. Preserved beef (tinned, extract, tongues, etc.) amounted to over 50,000 tons, valued at £5,000,000 sterling. Mutton.—Of the 268,507 tons of mutton and lamb imported, New Zealand sent 50 per cent., Argentina 23 per cent., Australia 14 per cent., and Uruguay 4 per cent. The balance was of Continental origin. Preserved mutton, including tongues, amounted to 2,017 tons, at a value of £430,534. Pork.—Imports due to the embargo on Continental produce showed a reduction. Irish Free State, United States, Argentina and South Africa increased their shipments. Bacon.—Imports were similar to that of 1925. Denmark was the chief exporter to Britain, with a slight reduction compared with 1925. There is also a reduction in the quantities sent from the United States, Canada and the Irish Free State, but this is counterbalanced by the trebled quantity sent from Holland, etc. Hams.—As in former years, the United States sent the majority of hams, consisting of 83 per cent., the balance being sent from Canada and other countries. Live Stock.—Contrary to expectations, the numbers of Canadian cattle imported shows a decrease of over 30,000. The United States sent 688, and South Africa one shipment of 179. There is shown a marked increase in the number of live pigs sent by the Irish Free State, presumably to assist in supplying the deficiency caused by the Continental embargo on fresh pork.

British Meat.—The quality of the British supplies of meat was very good. Continuing observations from last year on the effects of the Public Health (Meat) Regulations, it appears from the following table that there has been, with the exception of tuberculosis in pig carcases, a reduction in the amount of diseased and unsound meat delivered in the Markets. The number of pig carcases found affected with tuberculosis is interesting when careful observations on the difference in macroscopical appearances of the lesions in the lymph glands are made. It is generally assumed that bacilli of bovine origin are, in the majority of cases, the cause of the disease in pigs, but enquiries made of the owners of diseased pigs show that in many cases the affected animals had never been fed on cow's milk or even grazed in contact with cows. The origin in such cases is probably fowls affected with tuberculosis, kept in contact with the pigs; investigation as to this source of infection and the percentage of pigs affected with avian tuberculosis would form an interesting and important study both from a scientific and commercial point of view. The number of diseased pig carcases discovered in the Markets show that the animals had either been killed and sent away without being inspected or the inspection had been inadequate.

The numbers of tubercular quarters of beef and carcases of mutton affected with caseous lymphadenitis showed a slight increase. The Minister of Agriculture in Argentina, with commendable action, has issued instructions that no diseased carcase or any carcase of mutton from which lymph glands showing lesions of caseous lymphadenitis have been cut out, are to be exported, and the prevalence of the latter disease amongst the flocks of sheep is being investigated.

The quality, grading and dressing of the meat were very satisfactory. Unfortunately the majority of the quarters were, on arrival at the Market and unsheeted, found to be mouldy. From observations made and information kindly supplied by the Manager of the Consigning Company, the defects were due to the following reasons, viz.:— 1. Chamber not sufficiently pre-cooled prior to loading. 2. Each quarter was not given enough air space, thus preventing a complete circulation of air around every quarter. 3. Carrying the meat in an atmosphere containing too much moisture, which is known to be conducive to the growth of moulds. 4. It would appear that the air let into the chamber contained the spores of fungi. 5. Opening the chamber at Wyndham to load meat into it. The Wyndham meat should have been carried in a separate compartment, it having been previously observed that meat carried in a "chilled" state should never have the chamber opened from the time of loading until the time of unloading. These defects will doubtless be remedied in future consignments. The Alcock Electric Process of Defrosting Meat, mentioned in last report, was continued experimentally in the Market, but was not favourably approved of by the trade, due chiefly to burning of the meat at the place of entry of the electrodes. The number of sheep carcases found affected with caseous lymphadenitis during the year has considerably increased ; this has caused the Commonwealth inspection officer and the trade a considerable amount of uneasiness. The matter has, with commendable action, been taken up by the inspection staff in Australia, and instructions given that no carcase of mutton which contains lesions of the disease is to be exported or glands cut out of affected carcases. In addition, an investigation into the prevalence of the disease and measures to prevent its spread has been ordered and is now proceeding. DISEASED MEAT SEIZED. Quarters of Beef. Carcases of Mutton.

The effect, it is to be hoped, will stimulate the British and Irish pig feeders to supply the demand for fresh pork which was so excellently carried on by the Dutch senders. Experience in the City Markets showed that the pig carcases from Holland were highly satisfactory as to quality, grading, cleanliness and inspection. diseased meat seized: Mutton Carcases.

By the powers conferred on the City in the "Further Powers Act" of 1920, those registered private slaughterhouses ceased to operate on the last day of December, 1920. Although conducted as private slaughterhouses, the inspection has been as perfect as if the premises had been a public abattoir. Bye-Laws in operation since 1910, confined the hours of slaughter from 0 a.m. until 9 p.m. on week-days and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sundays ; if it was proposed to kill any animals before or after those hours, notice had to be given by the owner of the animals. An Inspector was on duty from 0 a.m. until 1 p.m., and he was replaced by another who remained on duty until killing ceased. Every animal was examined alive and after slaughter, all carcases and organs were subjected to careful inspection. As in former years, tuberculosis, except for parasitic diseases, was the cause of the great majority of lesions. There is a marked reduction in the percentage of cows found affected with the disease ; this may be due to the effect of the Tuberculosis Order or more careful buying of animals by the butchers or a combination of both operating. Foot and Mouth Disease has not been so prevalent during the year, and this may for the increase in the number of animals slaughtered, which were as follows:— 1926. 1925.

Progress under these Regulations has been slow. The results obtained were, however, substantial, although somewhat less than they would have been but for the industrial disputes which occurred during the year. The General Strike was attended and followed by a transitional period of emergency arrangements and measures of reorganization, during which it was deemed desirable to suspend the strict application of certain clauses of the Regulations relating to the transport and handling of meat. During the strike period supplies and transport at Smithfield were maintained under the direction of an Emergency Committee. The distribution of meat from the market was carried out by auxiliary services, and by individuals with vehicles under their own supervision. Having regard to all the circumstances, commendable care was taken by everyone concerned to protect meat from contamination. The effects of the Coal Strike were not so apparent as those of the dispute in May, but numerous instances were found in which proposed improvements of premises or of meatcarrying vehicles were delayed until more normal conditions of business should once more be established. The embargo placed upon foreign fresh meat in May was also followed by a lengthy period of reorganization, during which fresh sources of supply had to be found in Great Britain and Ireland. The necessary transport arrangements for these new supplies are developing satisfactorily and give promise of improvement as the business becomes more established. Shops and Stores.—The supervision of shops and stores used in connection with the sale of meat, bacon, ham, etc., has been continued, and an all-round improvement of these premises can be recorded. In seven instances extensive alterations were undertaken to comply with the Regulations, and in three instances premises were voluntarily renovated and remodelled. The rule adopted for the display of meat in retail shops was that it should be kept within the permanent frontage line of the premises and be given the additional protection afforded by overhead blinds and side screens whenever necessary. The number of retail shops and stores on the Register at the end of 1926 was 76. Stalls.-—With the exception of six stalls used in connection with the wholesale Jewish meat market at Aldgate, there are no meat stalls within the City area. These six, moreover, are removed by 8 a.m. daily, but they have been regularly inspected in order to see that the requirements applicable to them were complied with. Transport and, Handling of Meat.— Continuous supervision has been exercised over the methods of transport and handling of meat at Smithfield Market, Aldgate, the RailwayDepots and through the City streets. Some progress has been made in this direction, but much remains to be done before a uniformly satisfactory compliance with the Regulations is secured. (a) Vehicles.—The type of vehicle used for meat carrying is undergoing a gradual change. The hand barrows used at Aldgate are fewer. The meat vans generally are slowly improving, but there is still a tendency to perpetuate undesirable features of construction in new vehicles ; and up to the present there is little evidence of improvement in those which have been submitted for repair or renewal. There are, however, signs that the new scale of taxes for motor vehicles, to come into operation in 1927, may give an impetus to the construction of light-weight vans and so provide an opportunity for accelerating the progress which is desirable in vehicles used for the distribution of meat. One noteworthy instance may be quoted of definite advancement. A firm of meat carriers at Smithfield has designed a vehicle which is the most satisfactory yet seen. The inside of the body is metal lined, with rounded corners to eliminate dirt-collecting crevices. Small sectional wooden racks cover the bottom, and these can be laid down progressively as loading proceeds. Ventilation is obtained by means of gauze-covered louvred openings in the back and front. Specially placed openings in the floor serve as outlets for water used for cleansing purposes. After some three months' use the van is still giving results which fully justified the methods of construction employed. Other vehicles of this type will be brought into use as circumstances permit. The use of straw in connection with the transport of unwrapped meat is slowly decreasing. In the absence of any specific power to prohibit straw as such, recourse has been had to methods of persuasion and the constant reiteration of its disadvantages for this work. Prosecutions have been instituted in cases where the straw so used was obviously dirty. There seems to be scope in the designing of new vehicles for the inclusion of facilities for K 54 hanging meat, particularly meat in joint form, and for a place to contain articles of driving or wearing apparel, which for reasons of safety are frequently found deposited inside a vehicle and in close proximity to meat, while the persons in charge are in attendance at the market. Several instances of want of cleanliness have been found which were due to the fact that another commodity had been carried in the vehicle immediately prior to a consignment of meat, and the absence of facilities for adequate cleansing. The provision of special lining and covering sheets is a somewhat makeshift arrangement, and necessitates the exercise of constant care in order to preserve an adequate standard of cleanliness. A more effectual method would be for all meat which is carried in vehicles used also for general transport work to be properly wrapped in a stout covering material. (b) Overall Clothing.—This question presented, perhaps, the greatest problem of the year. The observance of the Regulations in this respect at Smithfield and elsewhere is neither uniform nor entirely satisfactory. Careful attention has been given to the matter, and it would appear that a strict enforcement of the requirements would cause hardship in many cases, and particularly to licensed porters and others casually employed. It has been thought desirable, therefore, to consider whether a co-operative scheme could be established under which the necessary clean overall clothing could be supplied and maintained. An arrangement of this kind would secure a degree of uniformity which it is not possible to obtain under present circumstances, and it would enable closer supervision to be exercised in this essential matter. Details of a scheme are at present under consideration. Administrative, Action.—The administrative methods adopted at the commencement of the Regulations have been continued throughout the year. Except in the case of particularly gross offences, a caution has been given in respect of the first infringement. In order to ensure that all the requirements were made known, and to prevent as far as possible subsequent contraventions, copies of Part VI. of the Regulations, relating to the transport and handling of meat, were sent with each caution. During the year 405 letters of caution and 299 copies of Regulations were sent out. In numerous instances where methods were at fault, interviews were arranged with proprietors and employers, and satisfactory improvements were secured without the necessity of legal proceedings. It was found necessary, however, to issue 80 summonses during the year, and the penalties imposed totalled £138 7s. 6d., with £7 1s. 6d. costs. The Regulations are educational in character, and until the principles involved are observed spontaneously constant supervision will be necessary. INSPECTION OF FOOD AT CITY WHARVES.

TINNED LOGANBERRIES. An endeavour was made during the year to solve one of the difficulties associated with the tinned fruit trade. Attention was first directed to the problem by the surrender in one of the Metropolitan Boroughs of a quantity of tins of loganberries which were assumed to be unsound on account of their " blown " condition. Difficulty occasionally arises in deciding whether a tin of loganberries or other fruit containing " pips " (such as raspberries) is fit or unfit for human consumption. The principal method of distinguishing a sound from an unsound tin of foodstuffs is by examination of the flat metal ends of the container. Tinned products are submitted to various processes during preparation, and are finally sealed while hot, which fact results in the creation, after cooling, of a vacuum or partial vacuum inside the tin. Against this vacuum atmospheric pressure causes a depression, or concavity, of the ends of the container. When the product decomposes gas is evolved and the vacuum is replaced by an internal pressure which may result in the ends of the container becoming convex. Cylindrical tins containing foods which show this convex condition are always regarded with grave suspicion and condemned if the convexity is found to be accompanied by much internal pressure. Occasionally, however, bad packing or a low degree of vacuum may cause such convexity, or at least absence of concavity of the ends. In these instances confirmatory evidence one way or the other is usually obtained by opening a few tins of the consignment. With loganberries and certain other fruits, however, it has been observed that the tins in which they are contained may first show the desirable concavity of the ends, and accordingly be passed as sound, but after a few months, and whilst the contents should still be sound—and, moreover, generally are sound—the concavity is replaced by a convexity, and a suspicion of unsoundness is aroused. When opened, the contents of the tins, so far as the usual criteria of taste and smell are concerned, show no decomposition changes to account for the gas production which has undoubtedly taken place. The position—obviously a difficult one—appeared to call for investigation. Six tins of loganberries showing convex ends and apparently " blown," were submitted to Sir Frederick Andrewes, K.B.E., City Bacteriologist, to whom the circumstances were explained. 57 I informed him that I considered the contents sound and asked him, if on opening, that proved to be correct, to undertake a bacteriological investigation, with a view to ascertaining the reason for the conditions observed. Sir Frederick Andrewes reported as follows:— "Re TINS OF LOGANBERRIES. "Although the ends of these two tins were slightly convex, I could not detect, on opening them, any signs of gas under pressure. There was no obvious escape of pent-up gas on puncturing them. "The contents were perfectly sweet and good to smell and taste and showed no evidence of having undergone fermentation. There was abundant sugar in the juice. So good were they, that when I had finished with them, I gave them to a laboratory attendant to take home to eat, and I should have gladly eaten them myself. "I find the contents nearly, but not quite, sterile on culture. I made 6 anaerobic and 5 aerobic cultures, using one or two large loopfuls of juice. "The 6 anaerobic cultures were made on plain agar and on agar containing carbohydrates, in plain broth and in glucose broth. Not one yielded any growth at all. I made these various anaerobic cultures chiefly with the view of detecting B. botulinus, if present. "Of the 5 aerobic cultures, the plain agar showed growth in the case of both tins. In one there were 6 colonies, in the other 3. These colonies were of several different kinds, chiefly bacilli, and I think they came from the contents of the tins as they were unlike ordinary air contaminations. I have not pursued their nature further. One broth culture also showed a motile bacillus. The other two were sterile. "I do not think the 'blown' character of the tins can be due to bacterial action. "(Signed) F. W. ANDREWES." Although the above report supported my expectations, it did not solve the problem, and the City Analyst, Mr. E. A. Pinchin, B.Sc., F.I.C., was next asked to report on a series of tins. The following is Mr. Pinchin's report:— "LOGANBERRIES. "One of these tins was opened and a distinct gas pressure observed ; on standing for a short time minute gas bubbles rose to the surface. A determination of alcohol showed the sample to contain 0.20 per cent. of absolute alcohol by weight, corresponding to 0-46 per cent. of proof spirit. "It would thus appear that the blowing is due to a slight alcoholic fermentation. "(Signed) ERNEST A. PINCHIN." The above circumstances were communicated to the Ministry of Health in the hope that in some way the manufacturers concerned might be induced to undertake research work with the object of reducing the probability of the alcoholic fermentation referred toby Mr. Pinchin. Unless some such action is taken, it is certain that manufacturers will suffer from more or less extensive condemnations of a product which does not justify condemnation. GENERAL SANITARY WORK. Artizans' Dwellings, Stoney Lane, Houndsditch.—These Buildings, erected by the late Commissioners of Sewers and opened in January, 1885, stand upon ground formerly the site of several courts and alleys in the Ward of Portsoken. There are five " blocks " of Dwellings, severally named King's, Queen's, Prince's, North, and South, designed for occupation by persons of the artizan class, some of the ground floors being let as shops. The Buildings contain 501 rooms, arranged in 241 tenements, and are occupied by 743 persons, compared with 777 in 1925. 73 per cent. are adults and 27 per cent. children (under 14 years). The number of births was 2, viz.: 0 males and 2 females. The birth-rate was 2.7 per 1,000, which is 94 per 1,000 below the average for the previous five years. The death-rate for 1926 was 13 4 per 1,000 per annum. 58 TABLE OF BIRTHS AND DEATHS OCCURRING AT THE ARTIZANS' DWELLINGS, STONEY LANE, HOUNDSDITCH, DURING THE YEAR 1926. Name of Block. Births.

The baths, provided for the use of tenants of these Buildings, which were opened in May, 1904, continue to be extensively used, the number of persons bathing during 1926 being 10,701, of whom 4,006 were males and 6,695 were females.

Public Health (London) Act, 1891, Sec. 94. The Corporation, as the Sanitary Authority in the City, are required, under the provisions of Sec. 94 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, to make and enforce Bye-laws applying to houses let in lodgings or occupied by members of more than one family for the following purposes:— For regulating the number of persons and separation of the sexes. For the registration and inspection of such houses. For enforcing drainage and promoting cleanliness and ventilation. For the cleansing and limewashing of the premises at stated times. For the taking of precautions in any case of infectious disease. Unfurnished lodgings, when the rent is not less than 10s. a week, and furnished lodgings when the rent is not less than 12s. 6d. a week, are exempt from the operations of the Bye-laws. These Bye-laws remained in force until September, when they were replaced by new ones approved by the Minister of Health, and similar in all respects to those in operation in the rest of London. A copy of these new Bye-laws is attached to this Report (Appendix E). Particulars relating to the registered Lodging-houses in the City now on the Register are given in the accompanying table:— District. Number of Houses on Register. Number of Lodgers.

This necessitated the service of 136 notices during 1926. In addition to the foregoing, there are ten blocks of Dwellings let out in tenements, but not placed on the Register for the reason that each holding is "self-contained," it having been decided in a Court of Law that in these circumstances they are not subject to the Byelaws for houses let in lodgings, or occupied by members of more than one family:— Name and situation of Artizans' Block Dwellings.

Common Lodging-House, 116, Middlesex Street.—The above premises, which are known as the "Salvation Army Working Men's Hotel and Shelter," and is the only common lodginghouse in the City, was opened on the 7th February, 1900. It was utilised during the War as a Soldiers' Hostel, but is now again in use as a common lodging-house. The premises are periodically inspected, and always found to be well kept and in a generally satisfactory condition. Neglect to comply with Water-closet Bye-laws.—One instance of neglect in this respect has occurred during the year under review. The offenders were communicated with and an explanation received. Plans were ultimately submitted and approved. Drainage Plans.—In the course of the year 230 plans were submitted with regard to proposed reconstruction of water-closets or drains in the City. Of these, 217 were approved; 4 revised and approved; and 15 not approved. Street Gullies.—The gradual substitution of properly trapped gullies for those formerly existing has greatly reduced the number of complaints received of offensive smells arising from those appliances, especially in warm weather. In some cases this nuisance was doubtless due to want of flushing, but in the majority faulty construction was the cause of the trouble. The City Engineer has given special attention to this matter for several years past, and his action in replacing the old pattern gullies with those of a more up-to-date design will, I hope, eventually lead to a complete abatement of the evil. Overcrowding.—Overcrowding is a nuisance to be dealt with summarily under Section 2, Sub-section 1 (e) of the Public Health (London) Act, 1891, and during the year three cases were reported by your officers. On the service of the statutory notice of abatement the overcrowding was discontinued. Sanitary Defects and Infectious Disease.—In every case of notification of infectious disease, the premises involved were inspected with regard to the drainage system, water supply, ventilation, &c.; and of the 130 cases so investigated in 1920, it was found necessary to make amendments to soil and waste pipes, water-closets, &c., in 71 instances. House, Trade and other Refuse Removal.—The City Engineer informs me that the refuse removed from the City in 1920 consisted of 22,532 cartloads of street sweeping sand slops, and 45,022 loads of house and trade refuse, a total of 07,554 loads. The total for the year 1925 was 00,827. The use of the Destructor was discontinued in September, 1905, since which date all refuse has been removed by barge from Lett's Wharf to the Corporation land on Hornchurch Marshes, where it is dealt with. The horse manure collected from the street orderly bins is not included in the above, but is dealt with by a contractor, who sells it to market gardeners and others. Legal Proceedings.—During the year, 309 notices have been served by the District Inspectors at the order of the Sanitary Committee, and in no case was it found necessary, in consequence of non-compliance therewith, to refer the matter to the City Solicitor. Summer Flushing of Courts.—There are 101 courts and narrow passages throughout the City which were regularly flushed during the summer months, under the direction of the City I 62 Engineer, who informs me that in this service, and the flushing of the main streets, no less than 20,464,058 gallons of water were used. Of these courts and alleys, seven were flushed four times a week, six three times a week, three twice a week, 21 once a week, five once a month, and 119 every two months. Disinfectants are also freely applied where desirable. The condition of the approaches to Billingsgate Market and the Customs House, as heretofore, required special attention. There has always been a difficulty in keeping the thoroughfares in the immediate vicinity of these places free from nuisance caused by the drippings from the fish carts, especially during hot weather. Lime-washing of Courts.—There are 60 courts and narrow passages situated in various parts of the Ciry, the walls of which, unless cleansed frequently, become dirty and unsightly through the constant traffic of passengers or vehicles, together with the action of the smokeladen atmosphere. These are cleansed or limewashed twice a year under the direction of the City Engineer. Of the places so dealt with during 1926, 19 were situated in the East District, 24 in the Middle District, and 17 in the West District. Defective Connections to Sewer.—During the year, 16 reports were received from the City Engineer respecting the condition of connections between the drains of certain City houses and the public sewer. Investigations showed that it was necessary to reconstruct all of the connections referred to. Of these, 14 have been completed and the remainder are, at the time of writing this Report, in process of reconstruction. As a result of the inspection of the internal drainage system of these premises, reconstruction or alteration was found necessary in 13 instances. In the majority of cases these external drains were brick-barrel drains, in which rats had their breeding-places, and were, undoubtedly, a source of much annoyance to the occupiers of the houses to which they were connected. FLY NUISANCE. The attention which it has been customary to give to the possibility of the spreading of infection by flies during the summer months has been continued. Leaflets were distributed throughout the City calling attention to the dangers created by the fly, and making special reference to the precautionary measures which should be taken to minimise such dangers. Your officers, where opportunity offered, made a special point of directing attention of householders to the necessity for the strict observance of cleanliness, frequent removal of dust and other refuse and particularly of food-stuffs, especially milk. For the first year since special consideration has been given to this question, the services of the several Ward Beadles were utilized in directing attention to the subject. They were all furnished with a supply of leaflets, and I have reason to believe that the assistance they were able to give in consequence of their intimate knowledge of their districts, has been of considerable value. RAG AND BONE DEALERS' BYE-LAWS. Section 9 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1908, empowers the Corporation to make Bye-laws for regulating the conduct within the City of London of the business of a rag and bone dealer, a fish curer and a fish frier. The Bye-laws with regard to the two latter trades have been completed and are in operation, but certain difficulties in respect of the former resulted in their preparation being deferred. They have, however, now been completed, and will form a useful and necessary addition to the range of powers with which the City is furnished. FACTORY AND WORKSHOP ACT, 1901, &.C.

In 51 cases employers neglected to keep lists at their premises and to send copies of the same to the Corporation as required by the Act. Notice in each case was served upon the offender and in all cases complied with. No case of infectious disease was reported in connection with premises occupied by outworkers in the City i 2 64 The following figures show the number of Outworkers notified since 1902 Year.

Note.—The Factory and Workshop Act, 1901 (S. 132), requires the Medical Officer of Health in his Annual Report to the District Council to report specifically on the factories, workshops, workplaces or homework The duties of Local Authorities, and the Medical Officer of Health under the Act of 1901 are detailed in the Home Office Office). If the Annual Report is presented othenvise than in print, it is unnecessary to include in the copy sent to the Home Office, the portions which do not relate to Memorandum of March, 1912. K 70 EXHUMATION AND REINTERMENT OF BODIES. City of London Cemetery.—During the year the bodies of three persons buried at the City of London Cemetery at Ilford have been exhumed and subsequently re-interred in the same Cemetery. In accordance with the terms of the licences issued by the Home Secretary in respect of these cases, the work of removal and re-interment was carried out in the early morning under the supervision of your Medical Officer of Health. All Hallows' Church, Barking, Great Tower Street.—In the course of the opening up of a crypt of the Church of All Hallows', Barking, Great Tower Street, a considerable number of lead coffins, generally in a state of collapse, were found. These were removed to an adjoining crypt and the opening sealed with brick-work. The work was carried out to my satisfaction and no nuisance was created during the process. 50, Bishopsgate Street.- During building operations a small quantity of human remains were discovered in the ground below No. 50, Bishopsgate. The total quantity of bones found was about half a bushel, and they were in all probability human remains left in the burial ground of the adjoining Church of St. Helens, at some previous excavation. The circumstances were reported to the Police and the Coroner, and the remains later re-interred on the site with the observance of due decency. CITY MORTUARY.

The following table gives the details of the work of disinfection carried out at the Disinfection Station during the year in connection with the export trade:— Number of Certificates issued. Number of articles disinfected. Fees received by the Corporation. 721 299.390 £1.062 Disinfection—Infectious Diseases:— Articles disinfected after cases of infectious disease 6,580 Public Vehicles—Electric Ambulance 1 Police Litter 1 Cleansing of Persons Act, 1897:— Number of verminous persons bathed 33 Cleansing of School Children :— Total number of children cleansed 951 Filthy and Verminous Articles.—An addition to the powers already possessed for dealing with verminous houses or verminous articles in houses has been made by the provisions of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1926, which extends the powers of sanitary authorities in such a manner that they are now authorised to cleanse, disinfect or destroy any verminous articles offered or exposed for sale or stored or deposited with a view to sale in or upon any stall, space, street or place and also any covers or wrappers of any such articles. No action has been necessary in the City during the past year under these new provisions. Preservation of Bodies of Unknown Dead.—The De Rechter apparatus for the preservation of the dead, installed at the City Mortuary, in March, 1909, was fully described in the 71 Annual Report of that year. It has proved of considerable assistance in connection with the identification of persons found drowned in the River Thames. During the year, two bodies were placed in the apparatus and of these one was subsequently identified. Fire Inquests.—Dr. F. J. Waldo, J.P., Coroner for the City of London and Southwark, has kindly furnished me with the following list of places in the City which were the subject of Fire Inquests held bv him during 1926 INQUESTS HELD UNDER THE CITY OF LONDON FIRE INQUESTS ACT, 1888. Date of Inquest. Premises Burnt. 8th January, 1926 55, Farringdon Street. 21st January, 1926 46, Upper Thames Street. 27th January, 1926 3, Sun Court. 24th February, 1926 23, Water Lane. In addition to the above, the City Coroner personally inquired into 171 "non-fatal" City fires reported to him during the year. RAT REPRESSION. The Table set out on page 74 indicates the number of investigations and inspections made and details of work carried out under the Rats and Mice (Destruction) Act, 1919, during the year ended December 31st, 1926. From this summary it will be seen that 1,044 buildings occupied by 2,358 firms were inspected. Of these 412 were found to be ratinfested. One or other of the rat catchers, working in the City, was engaged by business firms in 158 instances, poisons were laid down and traps of the break-back variety were used in 611 instances and wire traps in 149. Varnish traps, which were used in special circumstances, were relied upon in 252 buildings. Cats and dogs were found to be kept by 176 firms. Complaints have been received at the Office, or applications for advice, in 143 instances. The work done in addition to poisons and traps, and the keeping of rodent-destroying animals, include rat-proofing in 341 instances, and the repair of drainage defects in 391 others. In this relationship it should be stated that rat-proofing cannot be relied upon absolutely to exclude rodents from buildings, for reasons I have pointed out from time to time, e.g., the importation of rats into buildings in cases and crates from the docks and ingress through open doors and windows, especially through roof doors provided for exit in case of fire. The value of properly carried out rat-proofing should not be under-estimated for by this means food is protected, the domestic water supply is guarded, fire risk is lessened, insanitary defects are remedied which might otherwise remain undiscovered, and rats are more easily reduced in numbers, since hiding places are eliminated, and absence of hiding places results in a decrease of the rat population. I have pointed out in previous reports that the construction of many City buildings is such as to render rat-proofing practically impossible, and, further, that the owners who are the only persons competent to deal structurally with the buildings, are not responsible under the Act. A large number of old buildings have been demolished throughout the City during the year, and in the course of demolition numbers of rats, which were disturbed, found harbourage in neighbouring buildings, manv of which had not been previously infested. Mr. Lngineer informs me that, during the year, the following, sewerage and drainage works, all of which tended to reduce the breeding places for rats, were carried out by his department:— Pipe sewers reconstructed 12 Pipe sewers in course of reconstruction 1 Brick sewers re-inverted 5 Brick sewers substituted for pipe sewers 2 Brick sewers reconstructed 2 Brick sewers in course of reconstruction 3 Disused sewers filled in 6 Miscellaneous repairs to sewers 3 New drains constructed in connection with new buildings and subways 49 Drains of existing buildings reconstructed 48 New gulley drains constructed 7 Gulley drains reconstructed 48 Disused drains blocked up 75 Amount of poisons used in the sewers during the year 56 lbs. No. of rats killed in sewers, not including those which died from poisoning 1,880 The number of drains reconstructed, carried out under the supervision of the Inspectors attached to my own department, is set out on page 74. It was not found necessary in any case either to serve statutory notices or to take legal proceedings. K2 72 I am indebted to Messrs. Walton & Sons, professional rat-catchers, for the information that, during the year, they caught 26,713 rats in the City. It is, of course, impossible to estimate the number of rats destroyed in the City area during the year ; the impracticability of giving even an approximate estimate was pointed out in a special report I presented to the Sanitary Committee on the 26th September, 1922. Rat-catchers and poisoners are engaged on contract in many of the multiple tea-shops, restaurants, hotels, and business premises; several vacant building sites in the City were dealt with under the supervision of the Department, and all necessary information was given to representatives who called for advice. The attached Table shows that of the 1,044 buildings visited during the year, 412 were found to be rat-infested, and in these rat-proofing work was carried out at 341. This work chiefly consisted of wiring area gratings, ventilators, roof openings, and the stopping of rat holes in walls and floors. Other necessary work, such as the removal of wooden floors from basements and substituting concrete, the stripping of internal walls of the woodwork, such as matchboarding, wainscoting and panelling—behind which rats nest and breed—the cementing of walls and the removal of ceilings in certain cases could only be done to a very limited extent, because it would not be considered a reasonable request to ask an occupier to carry out this expensive work in a building which he does not own. Rat Week.—No special efforts were put forward during Rat Week. Rat repression work in the City being continuous, it is difficult to see what advantage can be gained by distributing circulars to firms who are doing their utmost (in their own interests) to deal adequately with the rat nuisance. Moreover, in previous years some of those firms have expressed their irritation on receipt of those circulars. Virus.—There has again been some little controversy as to the use of Bacterial preparations in the City. It has been the practice of this Department not to encourage the use of these preparations in City premises, the reasons for which I have set forth in detail in my previous reports. Varnish Traps.—Varnish traps continue to be used throughout the City with very great success. It has been found by experiment that the most effective bait for these traps is wholemeal bread. There are very few firms now that are not acquainted with the use of these traps, and many users prefer this method of destroying vermin. Break-back Traps.—Break-back traps also are in general use, and bread again is found to be the most satisfactory bait. A good method of using this trap is to fix a small screw ring in the end of it furthest from the bait, and to suspend it on a nail driven into the skirting, with the bait an inch or so from the floor. Rats at night frequently run round the skirtings of a room, and are not accustomed to find a trap in this position ; frequently the trap is found snapped off and the rat lying dead a little distance away. Poison.—The poison chiefly recommended is Red Squill Extract. Pieces of bread about 1 inch cube are soaked in this and placed about in rat runs. Some authorities have estimated the number of rats killed by the number of baits taken, e.g., if 1,000 baits have been taken, it has been presumed that at least 300 rats have been killed. Many instances in the City have frequently shown the fallacy of this method of calculation. Baits have been laid and counted, and the following morning most of the baits, or perhaps all, of them have disappeared. A few days later the majority of the baits have been discovered behind packages or stores in the building, moved there by the rats. One rat will frequently remove numbers of baits. Piles of poison bait are often found under floors. A liquid bait is therefore preferable to a solid or semi-solid one, which can be carried away. I think it can be safely said that the number of rats in the City is being kept down, but the species R. Rattus, or the Old English black rat, appears to outnumber R. Norvegicus, the so-called sewer rat, by at least 3 to 1. Old City men have said that thirty or forty years ago they were unable to enter their office in the morning until the rats had been cleared out. We hear of nothing so alarming nowadays. These rats were probably of the brown variety, for in those days very few black rats escaped from their attack. They were practically exterminated. Now that the sewers and drains of the City have had so much attention, the brown rats have been greatly reduced in numbers in them, and they have been poisoned and trapped unceasingly. This and overhead travelling facilities, electric cables, etc., have given the black rat his chance, and being a wonderful climber, no place is secure from his invasion. Newly-constructed buildings which are of solid construction offer no difficulty of access to these black rats, 73 An open window or skylight or a chimney are their chief places of ingress, and once inside the building (e.g., a bank, where sacks of papers are stored in large quantities in the basement), they find ample shelter for nesting and breeding. Their food is obtained from the kitchen and dining rooms which most of the large banks and insurance companies have on their premises, and from the garbage bins, which are seldom adequately protected. This, of course, is the difficulty. The object of rat-proofing a building, so that rats can find no place of harbourage in the actual structure, is defeated if large quantities of unmoved stores, waste paper, etc., are piled in the rooms. The black rat, too, needs less water than the brown rat, and whatever care is taken to protect drinking water cisterns, these vermin can generally find sufficient for their needs from sinks or dripping taps, fire buckets and uncovered closet pans. Food, water and undisturbed shelter are' the attractions for rats. Protect all food and water adequately, eliminate all places of refuge, and the rat trouble will lessen. It has been stated in the Press that the Leicestershire mines are free of rats and mice for the first time in the memory of the oldest pitman, the vermin having been starved to death during the Coal Strike, which lasted over six months. 74 RATS AND MICE (DESTRUCTION) ACT, 1919.

In accordance with the Standing Order of the Court that no person shall enter the employ of the Corporation or of any of its Committees without previously passing a medical examination to the satisfaction of the Committee having cognizance of the appointment, 54 persons were examined by the Medical Officer of Health during 1920. One of these persons was reported as physically unfit for office, and the decision with regard to four others was adjourned for later examination. Nine officers were also medically examined with a view to their retirement. All were reported to be unfit for duty except one man who is to be examined again in the early part of 1927. I have the honour to be, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, Medical Officer of Health for the City of London. Public Health Department, Guildhall, E.C.

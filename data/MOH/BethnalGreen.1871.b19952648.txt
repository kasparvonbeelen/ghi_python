REPORT Of the Proceedings of the Vestry of Saint Matthew, Bethnal Green, from the 25th March, 1871, to the 25th March, 1872. NEW APPROACH FROM SHOREDITCH. The Metropolitan Board of "Works having declined to include in the Bill promoted by them in 1871 the Improvement proposed by the Vestry, it was determined again to submit Plans to the Board, and sufficiently early to afford ample time for consideration, and for taking the requisite steps before the then ensuing Session. Fresh Plans were accordingly prepared, shewing two alternative routes from Chilton Street to Shoreditch. The Plans were submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the Board ultimately decided to include the Improvement in a Bill which they had determined to promote in the Session of 1872, for the purpose of procuring powers to effect various Metropolitan Improvements. Plans were deposited by the Board in compliance with the standing orders of the Houses of Parliament, and the Bill has been brought in. Great efforts are being made by some of the London and Suburban Parishes in opposition to the measure, on various grounds. Objections' are taken to the scheme itself, as not being the best that could be devised. The Engineer of the Corporation of London has reported strongly against it. But, apart from the merits of the scheme, as a whole, or the merits of any particular parts of it, it is objected that the Improvements should not be treated as Metropolitan, and that the cost of each should be borne, to a large extent, by the Parish or District in which the Improvement is to be made. Without going into the difficult question of what abstractedly is the most just way of defraying the cost of Improvements on a large scale, which more or less benefit the Metropolis generally, it is manifest that it would be unjust to Parishes and Districts like Bethnal Green, that have for years contributed, and will have to contribute for years to come to the New Streets in Southwark, the Covent Garden Approach, the Kensington and other Improvements, 16 now to make the execution of any great Improvement impossible by annexing a condition, compliance with which would be hopeless— except, perhaps, in the more opulent parts of London. The Vestry have arranged to produce before the Committee of the House of Commons, the evidence of competent witnesses from this and neighbouring Parishes, not only as to the existing necessity for the Improved Approach, but that the necessity becomes rapidly more and more urgent by the continual building of houses and manufactories at the Eastern end of the Parish and the contiguous Districts. The Vestry felt it advisable to concentrate its effort on the Improvement at the Western end of the Parish, and not to press, for the present, the formation of the New Road across the Green from St. John's Church to the Western end of the Approach Road. The Bill, promoted by the Metropolitan Board, seeks for power to make a direct communication by way of Old Street, Clerkenwell, and Bloomsbury, to the West of London, and the Vestry are supporting this Improvement, as well as that which is to this neighbourhood of more immediate importance, the much-needed widening of High Street, Shoreditch. TRAMWAYS. At the date of the last Report, three separate plans for Tramways, which would pass through this Parish, had been deposited by (1) the promoters of "The North-East of London and Columbia Market Approaches Bill;” (2) the promoters of " The North-Eastern Metropolitan Tramway Bill;" (3) "The North Metropolitan Tramway Company." The last named Company applied to the Board of Trade for a provisional order under "The Tramways Act, 1870;” but the Board of Trade ultimately decided to leave the scheme to be dealt with entirely by Parliament. The before-mentioned promoters (1) and (2) amalgamated their schemes, and the Vestry presented a petition to the House of Commons in favour of the amalgamated scheme. The promoters of the amalgamated scheme agreed to insert clauses in their Bill providing for payment to the Vestry on account of the paving laid in the Hackney Road, for laying paving in the roads and streets between and outside the lines of rail, and for various other matters. The North Metropolitan Tramway Company refused to come to any satisfactory terms as to clauses with regard to payment for the paving in the Hackney Road; and it became necessary to appear by counsel before the Committee of the House of Commons. The Vestry of St. Luke's being interested in a similar way, appeared in like manner, and the result was an intimation by the Committee that the Company should come to some terms with the Vestries. 17 The Company accordingly agreed with the Vestry to pay 109. per superficial yard for so much of the paving in Hackney Road as would have to be laid by the Company when putting down their trams, if the road had been a Macadamized road. It was also provided that the surplus material of all. Macadamized roads shall belong to the Vestry, and that whenever a tramway is laid in any road not exceeding 28 ft. in width between the curbs, the Tramway Company shall pave the whole width of the carriageway, and not merely pave between the rails and 18 inches beyond, as provided for other roads. The Committee of the House of Commons reported that the preamble of the North-Eastern Metropolitan Tramways Bill had not been proved, and that the preamble of the North-East of London and Columbia Market Approaches Bill, so far as it related to the tramways, had not been proved. So much of that Bill was passed as will enable the promoters to effect the widening of Birdcage Walk, and to form the new street continuing Brick Lano to Columbia Market; and also to construct a tramway from the goods depot of the Great Eastern Railway Company to Columbia Market. The Bill of the North Metropolitan Tramways Company was passed with certain modifications, one of which was rejecting the proposal to lay down tramways in Prospect Place. COAL-OWNERS' ASSOCIATED LONDON RAILWAY. Arrangements were made with the promoters for the insertion in the Bill of clauses providing for Iron Girder Bridges, in lieu of the existing Bridges over the Canal in Old Ford Road and Grove Road, and for the protection of the interests of the Parish, in other respects. The Bill was strongly opposed, and was before the Special Committee of the House of Commons more than a fortnight. The Committee reported the preamble not proved. FOURNIER'S CHARITY.

Mr. Nathaniel Hardingham, one of the Treasurers, died on the 18th of February, 1872, and Mr. Thomas Watson Francis, of No. 2, Hackney Road, has been elected to succeed him. MISCELLANEOUS. The cost of scavenging being now so serious an item, and increasing every year, it was suggested that some alteration in the mode of carrying out the work might be devised, and the matter was referred to a Committee, but after considering it, the Committee advised that tenders should be invited as before, which was done. The Yestry considering that the whole of the land reclaimed, at the cost of the ratepayers, from the Thames, should be preserved as recreation ground for the public, petitioned the Legislature against the proposal to appropriate any part of the reclaimed ground for building purposes. The Great Eastern Railway Company applied to be allowed to move the entrance gates to their depot from Artillery Street to Clarence Street, and to alter the level of the carriageway of Clarence Street. After investigating the matter, the permission was granted, on condition that the Railway Company obtained the consent, in writing, of the owners of the houses, Nos. 12 to 17, and that the cost of paving the surface of the carriageway be paid by the Company. Several complaints have been made of disorderly houses being kept, but the Yestry have succeeded in putting an end to the nuisances, of which complaints were made, without having recourse to legal proceedings. 18 19 A copy of the Regulations under the "Metropolis Water Act, 1871," submitted by the East London Water Company to the Board of Trade for approval, was sent by the Board for consideration by the Vestry. The regulations are intricate, and appear onerous. They have been referred to a Special Committee for consideration and report. A great nuisance was occasioned by the assembling in Winchester Street, on Mondays and Tuesdays, of numbers of disorderly young persons, under the pretence of holding a fair. There was some difficulty in dealing with the evil, but it is hoped that the efforts of the police have at last put an end to it. Complaints were made of great inconvenience being occasioned by the works of the Great Eastern Railway Company blocking up an old thoroughfare called Three Colt Corner, or Three Colt Street. The Vestry communicated with the Railway Company, who (although they allege they have only exercised their statutory powers), have shown a desire to obviate any inconvenience to the public. It has been arranged for the Company to erect a foot bridge over the line at Three Colt Corner; but the Company reserve the right to remove the bridge should it be found to interfere with the working of the railway. The Vestry Hall Keeper having resigned, the Vestry decided that the qualification and duties of the Hall Keeper should be those defined in the Report of the 19th Sept., 1867, but that the salary be £75 per annum. There were 19 candidates for the office, and, on the 7th March, Mr. William Page was elected. The subject of providing a Mortuary has been repeatedly before the Vestry, and plans for converting the old Watch-house into a Mortuary have been prepared and approved; but it is feared there would not be sufficient space without encroaching on the churchyard, and the Rector contends that the Vestry have no right to convert the Watch-house into a Mortuary. At present the matter remains in abeyance. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk. SURVEYOR'S REPORT OF WORKS BXECUTED, FOR THE YEAR ENDING LADY-DAY, 1872. GENTLEMEN: The work executed during the past year, although not involving so large an expenditure as in the preceding years, has, nevertheless, been of a very extensive character. The works of the greatest importance have been carried out at the expense of the Great Eastern Railway Company, consequent upon the formation of their new line to Broad Street, and the alteration of the old. They may briefly be enumerated thus:— viz., the formation of a new street 40 ft. wide and 470 ft. in length, connecting Winchester Street with London Street. A new brick sewer, 4 ft. 0 in. X 2 ft. 6 in., with Bide entrance and gullies has been constructed, and the surface of the street paved— the footways with 3 in. York, and the carriageway with 7 in. x 3 in. granite. The quantity of paving laid by the Company in the above and other streets upon the line of their works, has been 3,101 yds. super of new carriageway, 2,269 ft. run of new curb, and 25,970 ft. super of new 3 in. footway paving. Also a new brick sewer, 3 ft. 9 in. X 2 ft. 6 in., with side entrance, man holes, and ventilating shafts, has been constructed in Brick Lane, between Saint John Street and Bethnal Green Road. 21 In my Report for the year ending Lady-day, 1868, I drew attention to the very unsatisfactory condition of many of the sewers which had been laid down by the "Vestry a few years before, and expressed a fear that, before many years, extensive works would have to be carried out, so as to maintain the sewers in working order. During the past year, it has been found necessary to open in the undermentioned streets, and in each case the pipe sewers have been found completely choked through improper construction. Princes court Sarah street St. John street Christopher street Nelson street Wolverley street Sclater street Sherwood place King street Queen street Digby walk Digby street Princes street Gosset street Wellington place Cross gtreet, Globe street Nelson street, Collingwood street In a few cases, the sewers have been opened frequency, and it now becomes a question whether it would not be expedient to forthwith make provision for o her sewers in some places. Additional pipe sewers have also been laid in, as follows:—The sewer pipes in Pollard Street have been extended to the corner of Pollard Place, a distance of about 120 ft. The pipes in Busby Street continued (about 130 ft.) to connect with the sewer in Edward Street. Pipes have also been laid in "Wolverley Street, Gardner's and Kenilworth Roads. Numerous gullies have been re-constructed and trapped, and new ones built where required. Seventy-six private connections with the sewers have been made, and a considerable amount of work carried out in flushing and otherwise cleansing the various sewers of the Parish; this has all been done by men in the employ of the Yestrv. The undermentioned paving works have been carried out during the year by the Yestry's Contractor: — In Spicer Street 453 yds. super of carriageway paving has been taken up, dressed, relaid, and grouted, and the deficiency made good with new 7 in. x 3in. granite; 1,553 ft. super of footway paving has been squared and relaid ; 255 ft. super of new 3in. has been laid ; and 640 ft. run of curb reeet. 22 In Meet Street the carriageway paving has been taken up, the ground levelled, and a new bottom of 4 in, concrete laid in; 626 yds. super of new 7 in. x 3 in. granite paving has been laid; 399 yds. super dressed and relaid; and the footway paving and curb relaid and reset where necessary. In consequence of the increased heavy traffic in Selby Street and Tent Street from the Whitechapel Coal Depot of the Great Eastern Railway, it was found necessary to pave the same. This has been done with old carriageway removed from Saint John Street and other streets, and the deficiency made good with new. The following is a list of the principal streets in which jobbing Paving Works have been carried out by the men in the employ of the Yestry:— NAME OF STREET OR PLACE. Carriageway Relaid and Grouted.

In doing so, I think it right to call attention to the increased traffic upon the roads, consequent upon the large works that have been going on for the Great Eastern Railway Company, and also through the development of the omnibus traffic to the extreme east of the Parish.

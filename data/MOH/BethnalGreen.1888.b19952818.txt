REPORT OF The Proceedings of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, from the 25th March, 1888, to the 25th March, 1889. SCAVENGING AND WATERING ROADS. As the existing contracts would expire in August, 1889, the subject of the execution of the work after the expiration of the contracts was referred, in February, to a Special Committee, consisting of the members of the Works and Sanitary Committees. The Sanitary Committee reported, that in order to complete the distribution of Pails for Dust and House Refuse, 1500 more would be required, and that it was desirable to have a stock from which to supply, at cost price, householders desirous of having additional pails, or of replacing those worn out, and recommended that 2000 more Galvanized Iron Dust Pails should be purchased. The recommendation was adopted, making the total number bought 18,000. COMPOSITION RATE. A copy of the accounts of Mr. Churchwarden J. C. B. Richardson will be found at page 46, and it will be seen includes the rate at ¾d., resolved on in July, 1887, and the rate at ½d., resolved on in October, 1887. The account was audited and passed, the item, Piggott Brothers, £1 8s. 0d., being withdrawn. A rate at ¾d. in the pound for the then current year was resolved on in August, 1888, and was made accordingly. 18 It has been referred to a Special Committee, consisting of— Messrs. Forrest, Messrs. J. Y. Jones, Dyer, Hilditch, Richardson, Tilbury, Francis, Bedford, Shrimpton, Kyffin, Ward, Smither, to consider as to the best method of repealing the Composition Rate Act, and to confer on the subject with the members of Parliament for the Borough. PROPOSED NEW TOWN HALL. Since the date of the last Report, the Charity Commissioners decided to propose a scheme for the management of the Poor Lands. This has prevented the final acceptance or otherwise of the conditional offer of the Vestry of £4,000 for the ground between the Western end of Green Street, opposite St. John's Church and Vicarage and the Avenue leading to the Lunatic Asylum, as a site for a New Hall. It is understood the new Scheme is drafted and the issue of it is daily expected. FOURNIER'S CHARITY.

Regulation No. 8 was, on the recommendation of the Committee, altered to allow Coffee Stalls to remain out till 8 instead of 7.30 a.m. In July a Report from the Committee as to the existing Regulations was presented as follows:— Having considered the Regulations your Oommittee recommend that— Regulation No. 8 be altered to read as follows:— No stalls be permitted to remain in the streets between the hours of 12 a.m. and 2 p.m., and coffee stalls shall not be permitted to remain in the streets after 8 o'clock a.m., except such as are of the dimensions specified by rule I. Regulation No. 11 be altered to read as follows: — No stall board shall project more than 18 inches over any footway; but where, in the judgment of the Streets Regulations Committee, 20 the footway is so narrow as to make a projection of 18 inches ( inconvenient, the Committee shall determine to what extent a . stall board may project. Regulation No. 12 be altered to read as follows:— Awnings or sun blinds shall not at their lowest point be less than 6 ft. 6 in. from the footway, and under no circumstances will shop keepers be allowed to hang any goods whatever on the awnings or sun blind which come within 6 ft. 6 in. of the footway or carriageway. That an addition to the regulations be made as follows:— Sunday mornings.— All shop keepers are required to remove, before 11 o'clock on Sunday mornings, all projections on or over and all things put or deposited by them on any footway or carriageway. And all barrows, carts, stalls, and things of every sort belonging to costermongers, street hawkers or itinerant traders, must be removed before 11 o'clock on Sunday mornings. Your Committee also recommend:— That the Street Inspector be placed in connection with the Surveyor's department, and that he work on Sunday until 3 p.m., having a day in the week in place of Sunday. The Report was received and the alterations and additions recommended were ordered to be printed and a copy sent to each Vestryman with a view of being considered seriatim at the next meeting, which was done, and after some verbal corrections the Report was approved and adopted, and the Regulations altered accordingly. The Regulations as altered were— 1.—No Barrow, Cart or Stall for the sale of articles in the street (except coffee stalls) shall exceed 9ft. in length or 3ft. 6in. in width, and no part of any such barrow, cart or stall (except coffee stalls), as regards the width, shall project beyond the wheels. 2.—No Barrow, Cart or Stall shall be placed or stand in any street or public way alongside another barrow, cart or stall so as to lessen or obstruct the breadth of such street or public way by more than the width of one barrow, cart or stall. 21 3.—No Barrow, Cart or Stall shall be placed or stand in any street or public way within 3ft. (measured along the length of any such street or public way) of another barrow, cart or stall, which space of 3ft. shall be kept so as to enable passengers to pass and repass between the road and the footway. 4.—All Costermongers, street hawkers and itinerant traders shall, when requested to do so by any inhabitant, remove their barrows, carts and stalls from before the house of such inhabitant, in order to enable him to load or unload any vehicle at his door. 5.—No Barrow, Cart or Stall shall be placed or stand, either wholly or in part, on any street crossing. 6.—Costermongers, street hawkers, and itinerant traders, and their barrows, carts and stalls, will be liable to be removed from any street and public way in which they create an obstruction to the traffic, or where they are an annoyance to the inhabitants. 7.—Costermongers, street hawkers and itinerant traders may have awnings over their stalls, but such awnings shall not exceed 6ft. in height from the footpath in front of the stall, and 9ft. in length and 3ft. 6in. in width, nor project in front at the top of the awning more than 1ft. 8.—No Stall shall be permitted to remain in the streets between the hours of 12 at midnight and 2 a.m., and coffee stalls shall not be permitted to remain in the streets after 8 o'clock a.m., except such as are of the dimensions specified by rule I. 9.—In Bethnal Green Road, Hackney Road, Cambridge Road and Green Street, no stall or barrow shall be placed within 3ft. of the point of junction with any side street, and no stall or barrow shall be placed in any side street leading out of any of the four before-mentioned main thoroughfares within 3ft. of the line of frontage of the house or building in the main thoroughfare at its, junction with the side street. 10.—In such cases as shall be deemed reasonable, stalls shall be required to have wheels. 11.—No Stall Board shall project more than 18in. over any footway; but where, in the judgment of the Street Regulations Committee, the footway is so narrow as to make a projection of 18in. inconvenient, the Committee shall determine to what extent a stall board may project. 12.—Awnings or Sun Blinds shall not at their lowest point be less 22 than 6ft. 6in. from the footway, and under no circumstances will shopkeepers be allowed to hang any goods whatever on the awning or sun blind which come within 6ft. 6in. of the footway or carriageway. 13.—Sunday Mornings.—All shopkeepers are required to remove at or before 11 o'clock on Sunday mornings, all projections on or over and all things put or deposited by them on any footway or carriageway. And all Barrows, Carts, Stalls, and things of every sort belonging to costermongers, street hawkers or itinerant traders, must be removed and cleared away from the foot and carriageways at or before 11 o'clock on Sunday mornings. In September a deputation presented a petition asking the Yestry to extend the time for shopkeepers having goods on or over the pavement on Sunday mornings from 11 o'clock to 1 o'clock. The petition was referred to the Committee for consideration and report. The Committee in October reported and recommended that no alteration be made in the Regulations, and the recommendation was (after debate, and two amendments being rejected) adopted. In November a deputation presented a letter from Mr. Charles I. Walton, enclosing copy of a resolution of a meeting at Abbey Street Schools as follows:— "That the meeting is of opinion that the prosecutions of the Bethnal Green Yestry against the shopkeepers and stallkeepers for exhibiting their goods on Sundays after 11 a.m. is deserving of the severest censure." The resolution was referred to a Committee of the Whole Yestry. At a meeting on the 15th November, a deputation of shopkeepers from Sclater Street, with Mr. Swaine, a solicitor, asked that the time specified in regulation 13 be altered from 11 to 1, and that the pending summonses should be adjourned for a fortnight. At the same meeting, Mr. Hay presented a letter alleging to the effect that the Regulations were not impartially enforced, and asking that immediate proceedings should be taken against six Vestrymen named by him. 23 A motion that the persons named be proceeded against was made, but not carried. The Report of the Committee off the Whole Vestry with respect to the Resolution passed at the Abbey Street School did not recommend any alteration in the Regulations. The Report, after debate, proposed amendments and adjournments, was approved and adopted. URINALS. . An Iron Urinal for six persons has been erected on the ground at the South East corner of Gibraltar Walk and Bethnal Green Road at a cost, exclusive of fixing, drainage, and paving, of £85 15s. Another Urinal, to accommodate six persons, has been put up in the carriage way of Bethnal Green Road, opposite the Junction with Sclater street, at a cost, exclusive of fixing, draining, and other incidental work, of £172. A recommendation of the Sanitary Committee, that all Public Urinals in the Parish should have a constant supply of water, was adopted and carried into effect. The Vestry have also made arrangements with the Great Eastern Railway Company for putting a Urinal in Tapp Street, close to the Bethnal Green Junction Railway Station, on ground belonging to the Company, and agreed to be let by the Company to the Yestry at a nominal rent. RE-NAMING AND RE-NUMBERING STREETS, LIGHTING; SEWERS WORK, AND ROAD WORK. Particulars as to these matters are given in the Surveyor's Report. NEW STREETS. The Yestry have made orders for "Paving," at the cost of the owners of the houses in and of the land abutting on the following 24 places, viz.:—Medhurst Road, Digby Walk, Thomas Passage, Cambridge Street, Ion Square, Granby Row, and Eastman Street. THAMES COMMUNICATIONS. The Metropolitan Board of Works wrote again in July, 1888, with reference to the Memorials mentioned in the last Report, stating that under the then present circumstances and having regard to the outlay to be made for the Tunnel to be made between Blackwall and Greenwich, the Board did not see its way to apply to Parliament for power to provide means of transit between Rotherhithe and Shadwell. INQUIRY AS TO IMMEDIATE SANITARY REQUIREMENTS OF THE PARISH. The Report of the Inquiry, held by Mr. D. Cubitt Nichols and Mr. Shirley F. Murphy, with the co-operation of Mr. Forrest and Mr. J. G. Hilditch, of which a copy was printed in the Vestry's Report of last year, was referred to a Committee of the Whole Yestry. The recommendations of that Committee that the Report should be referred to a Special Committee, to consist of six Members of the Finance, Works and Sanitary Committees respectively, was adopted. Subsequently the Chairman of each of those three Committees was added to the Special Committee. The Report by the Special Committee was presented to the Yestry on the 21st March, 1889. It was then ordered to bo printed and await consideration. The Report was as follows:— SAINT MATTHEW, BETHNAL GREEN EXTRACT From the Report by Messrs. D. Cubitt Nichols and Shirley F. Murphy on the Inquiry held by them. We aro of opinion that the immediate sanitary requirements of the Parish may be summarised as follows:— 25 1. The re-organisation of the sanitary department, so that the work of the sanitary inspectors is to a greater extent superintended or controlled by the Medical Officer of Health. 2. The appointment of additional Sanitary Inspectors, we believe that two officers, in addition to those now engaged, is the minimum increase which should be made. 3. The institution of a system of periodic house-to-house tion throughout the Parish, especially to those parts occupied by the poorer people. 4. The adoption of regulations as to houses let in lodgings. 5. The exercise by the Yestry and Metropolitan Board of Works respectively of the powers conferred by the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Act, 1868-82, and the Metropolis Local Management Act and Building Act (Amendment) Act, 1882, for the removal of structural conditions rendering houses unfit for occupation. 6. The more complete exercise of the powers under the Nuisance Removal Acts, 1855, &c., and the Metropolis Local Management Act, 1855, as to cleanliness and wholesomeness of houses, water supply to waterclosets, and the better paving of yards and courts. 7. The making of bye-laws as to house drains and drain fittings under section 202 of the Metropolis Local Management Act. SAINT MATTHEW, BETHNAL GREEN. March, 1889. REPORT Of Special Committee appointed to consider the Report by Messrs. D. Cubitt Nichols and Shirley F. Murphy on the Inquiry held by them as to the immediate Sanitary Requirements of the Parish. Your Committee have had numerous meetings, and after considering the Report by Messrs. Nichols and Murphy generally have dealt with the seven requirements summarised in the concluding part of the Report. As to No. 1—It was considered whether the Medical Officer of Health should be made the Head of the Sanitary Department, but the Committee decided not to recommend that the Medical Officer should be made the Head of the Department. 26 As to No. 2—Your Committee are of opinion and recommend that an additional Sanitary Inspector should be appointed,—that the Parish should be divided as nearly as possible into three equal Districts, and one District assigned to each of the three Inspectors. As to No. 3—Your Committee are of opinion there should bo a periodical house to house inspection throughout the Parish, especially in those parts occupied by the poorer classes. As to No. 4—Your Committee are of opinion and recommend that Regulations as to houses let in lodgings should be prepared and adopted. As to No. 5—Your Committee are of opinion that it must be left to the Medical Officer and the Sanitary Committee to determine in any case whether the powers conferred by the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act and the Metropolis Management and Building (Amendment) Act, 1882, should be put in force. As to No. 6—The Committee report that this recommondation is practically being carried out. As to No..7—Your Committee are of opinion that the adoption of this suggestion is not practicable, as there is no power vested in the Yestry to make such bye-laws as suggested. Robert Yoss, Vestry Clerk. THREE COLT CORNER BRIDGE. Much negotiation had taken place with the Great E astern Railway Company as to improving the inconvenient foot-bridge crossing the Railway, at Three Colt Corner. The bridge was originally erected by the Railway Company out of consideration for public convenience, and the Company, on the occasion of widening their lines, endeavoured to meet the wishes of the Vestry, to have the bridge improved so as to be better adapted for the convenience and safety of those using it. The situation made improvement difficult, but ultimately a plan was agreed to, which has been carried out. LAND AT SOUTH EAST CORNER OF GIBRALTAR WALK. The proceeding mentioned in the last Report went on to trial, 27 and resulted in a perpetual injunction being granted against all the Defendants, but, on account of the position of the Defendants, without costs. GREEN STREET IMPROVEMENT. The Metropolitan Board addressed a letter to the Yestry, as follows:— Spring Gardens, S.W., 28th May, 1888. Sir, I have to inform you that the works connected with the Green Street, Bethnal Green, Improvement, authorised by the Metropolitan Street Improvement Act, 1883, have been completed, and that the widened thoroughfare will be opened to the public this day, and I am further to state that under the provisions of that Act the care and management of the widened thoroughfare will from this time forward devolve upon the Yestry of Bethnal Green. I am, Sir, &c., J. E. Wakefield, Clerk to the Board. To the Clerk of the Vestry of Bethnal Green. Some Members of the Metropolitan Board, with some of the Officers of the Board, attended in the afternoon of the day, and having been met by several Members of the Yestry, proceeded to declare the widened thoroughfare opened, and public traffio and the use by the public of the improvement began. BISHOP'S ROAD. The purchase of the fore-courts of the Houses, 1 to 19 inclusive, f has been completed, and the improvement of widening the pavement carried out. ARTIZANS AND LABOURERS' DWELLING ACTS. During the year the Medical Officer of Health has made Reports under these Acts certifying several properties in different parts of 28 the Parish to be in a condition or state dangerous to health so as to be unfit for human habitation, and that they should be dealt with under the provisions of the Artizans and Labourers' Dwelling Acts. The Reports of the Medical Officer were as required by the Acts referred to a Surveyor (Mr. Barratt). In the Surveyor's Report following this will be found particulars of the different properties and the course adopted with regard to them and the results. ST. PETER'S CHURCHYARD. The Yestry being of opinion that the conditions upon which they agreed to pay £20 annually towards the cost of maintaining the Churchyard as an open space were not observed, decided to discontinue the grant, of which notice was given to the Churchwardens, and the grant is no longer made. ELECTRIC LIGHTING. Notice was given by the South Metropolitan Electric Supply Company, Limited, of their intention to apply under the Eleotric Lighting Acts, 1882 to 1888, for a Provisional Order for power to supply Electricity for Lighting and other purposes in oertain streets and places in the Parish to be therein particularly specified. The London Electric Supply Company, Limited, gave notice of their intention to apply for a Provisional Order to enable them to supply Electricity for Public and Private purposes in the whole area of the Parish. Neither Company proceeded to obtain a Provisional Order. METROPOLITAN BOARD OF WORKS. Under the Local Government Act, 1888, the Metropolitan Board of Works, in March, 1889, ceased to exist. The precepts of that Board made in 1888 provided for the expenditure of that year, so that the expenditure for the first Quarter of 1889 had to be provided for. In February the Board issued a precept requiring £4,253 7s. 8d. to be raised and paid by the 1st March. That it 29 was impossible to do. Part of the amount had been provided bj anticipation, but the amount required was much larger than was expected, and providing the balance necessarily stood over till the following Quarter. POYSER (LATE GEORGE) STREET. A suggestion was made that the Great Eastern R. W. Co. had exceeded the powers conferred on them by the Act authorising the construction of their line and encroached on the public property. The matter was investigated, and it appeared the Company had made no encroachment. VACCINATION. A Copy of a Resolution by the Vestry of Shoreditch on the subject of Vaccination and directing the preparation of a Petition to the House of Commons praying for the immediate Repeal of Compulsory Vaccination was forwarded to the Vestry, and by them referred to the Sanitary Committee. The report of that Committee that it was not expedient to attempt to interfere with the existing legislation on the subject of Vaccination was approved by the Vestry. RAILWAY PLANS. The only Plans deposited in November were those of the proposed North and East Junction Railway to connect the Great Eastern and North London Railways. Very serious interference with property and streets was suggested by the plans. The Committee to which the plans were referred felt most strenuous opposition would have to be made to the Scheme, but it became unnecessary by the promoters abandoning the scheme. BILLS IN PARLIAMENT. Early Closing Bill.—The Vestry were of opinion that if this Bill for Early Closing were passed, its effects would be detrimental to the interests of the inhabitants of the East of London, and the Members for the Borough were requested to oppose the Bill. It did not pass. 30 School Board Election Bill.— A. deputation of six members of the Vestry was appointed to attend a Conference as to the Bill held at the Vestry Hall, Paddington. The views adopted at the Conference were in accord with the views of the Yestry. Three delegates were also appointed to attend a Conference in January, at the St. Pancras' Vestry Hall, as to Parliamentary areas being made the Electoral area for the School Board Elections. That idea met with general approval. The Bill was not passed, but will in all probability be reintroduced next Session. School Board for London (Pension) Bill.—This Bill has been withdrawn. LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT, 1888. This Act abolished the Metropolitan Board of Works, and practically the Council for the Administrative County of London created by the Act is the successor of that Board, but with an enlarged area and new rights and powers. Representation.—Each of the two Parliamentary Electoral Divisions of the Parish returns two members to the County Council. Main Roads.—All "Main Roads" are to be maintained at the cost of the Administrative County generally, and not as other roads, at the cost of the Parish or District in which they are. The County Council have to declare what roads shall be "Main Roads," and as the subject is one of serious importance to this Parish, attention was given to it early with the view of considering it in all its bearings, and of being prepared to submit to the Council a list of the streets and roads in the Parish which the Vestry consider should be declared main roads. At present it does not seem doubtful that Bethnal Green will be a loser by the provision in the Act as to main roads. It appears that the provision instead of benefiting tho Parish may put an additional burden oil it without any resulting good. 31 Money Precepts.— In March the Council informed the Vestry that the estimated expenditure for the then coming year was equivalent to a rate of 12.55 pence in the pound over £21,000. The largest sum the Metropolitan Board of Works had levied in any year was £14,059 7s. 8d. for 1888; but the precepts of that Board did not include the County Rate paid by the Board of Guardians. COLLECTION OF RATES. In July, 1888, it was referred to the Finance Committee to consider and report as to the system of Collection of Rates in this Parish and whether any and what alterations were desirable. On the 1st November, the Finance Committee presented a Report as follows:— The Committee have had many meetings, and fully considered the subject of Collection of Rates referred to them. They report and recommend as follows:— 1. That after the expiration of the current quarter the mission to be paid to the Collectors shall be one and a quarter per cent. on the amount of Rates collected and paid into the bank. 2. That no new person appointed a Collector shall engage in any business or occupation without the express sanction of the Yestry. 3. That no Collector shall employ any assistance in collecting Rates without the consent of the Vestry. 4. That the Collectorship of the South Ward be offered to Mr. William Isaac Shenton. 5. That the East Ward, for the purpose of the Collection of Rates, be divided as nearly as possible into two equal parts. That the present Collectors of the North and West Wards have the option, according to seniority, to change to one of the divisions of the East Ward. 6. That the two new Collectors be elected in the usual way (by ballot), and steps be taken accordingly. It was thereupon resolved that it be referred to a Committee of the Whole Yestry to consider the question of the Collectors' 32 remuneration and the advisability of creating districts or areas for the purpose of collection. The Committee of the Whole Board met twice, and at its last meeting, on the 23rd January, it was resolved to refer to a SubCommittee to report, so as to enable the Committee of the Whole Board to deal with the subject under consideration, and as to any re-arrangement of the division of the Parish for the purposes of collection of rates. At the meeting of the Vestry of 21st March it was resolved that the reference to the Committee of the Whole Yestry be discharged, and that the Report of the Sub-Committee when ready be presented direct to the Vestry. Mr. Henry John Bliss, who had for a very great number of years been Collector for the South Ward, died in July, 1888, and pending the existing consideration as to the subject of the Collection of Rates, Mr. Thomas Bliss, one of the sons of the late Mr. Bliss, was appointed temporarily to Collect the Rates of the South Ward. ANNUAL ACCOUNTS. The Finance Committee reported that they were of opinion that 1000 copies of the Statement of Accounts prefixed to the Annual Report should be printed in stitched wrappers, and a copy given gratuitously to any ratepayer applying for the same. The recommendation of the Committee was adopted. MISCELLANEOUS. 1 Two claims have been made for compensation in respect of alleged accidents from defects in paving, but in neither case could the claim be entertained. The Salary of Sanitary Inspector Weston was raised, as recommended by the Committee, from £120 to £150 per annum, as from Christmas, 1887. ROBERT YOSS, j Vestry Clerk. 33 ANALYST'S REPORTS. Analytical Laboratory. Vestry Hall, Harrow Road, W., June 25th, 1888. To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, Chairman and Gentlemen, During the Quarter ending June 24th, 1888, I have received from your Inspectors forty-six samples of food for analysis. These consisted of—Milk, thirty-four samples; Pepper, seven samples; and Mustard, five. Of all these samples of Milk only one was adulterated, and this contained so small a per centage of added water that no proceedings were taken. This almost entire freedom of Milk adulteration is very remarkable for this Parish; such an absence of adulteration has never occurred before; usually about half of the samples are found to be adulterated. It may be that the persistent action of the Sanitary Committee in taking constant samples of this important article of food has resulted in a better supply being given to the Parish. The only other supposition is that somehow the vendors became aware of the intended visit of the Inspectors, and supplied them with a pure article. Experience gained from future samples will show which of these suppositions is correct. Of the seven Pepper samples, two were adulterated; the one with 30 per cent. of ground beans; the other with 40 per cent. of ground rice. In both these cases the vendors were prosecuted and fined. Of the five samples of Mustard, two were mixed with common flour, and to restore the yellow colour, lightened by this addition, a minute quantity of turmeric colouring matter was also added. Prosecutions were undertaken against the vendors, and fines were imposed. The total amount of fines ordered to be paid into the Vestry's account during the quarter was £20.

To the Vestry of tie Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Chairman and Gentlemen, Now that all the prosecutions for adulteration are concluded, I am able to forward you my Report for the Quarter ending September 29th, 1888. During that period 50 samples of food were submitted to mo by your Inspectors for Analysis. These were—Milk 35, Ices 7, Mustard 4, and Popper 4 samples. Of those, 5 samples of Milk and 2 of Pepper wore adulterated. Of the adulterated Milks, one sample had been partly skimmed, and another diluted with only 5 per cent. of water; the vendors of those samples were cautioned not to repeat the offence. In another case, where 20 per cent. of water had been added, the vendor escaped prosecution by leaving the Parish. In two other cases, where 13 and 15 per cent. of water respectively had been added, the vendors were prosecuted, and trifling fines of 10s. each were imposed. It is, however, very satisfactory to find that Milk this quarter is far more free from adulteration than it has boon in the past, and that the adulteration is not now of so severe a character. At one time it was common to meet with samples of Milk containing from 20 to 40 per cent. of added water. Doubtless this decrease of Milk adulteration is partly due to the plentifulness and cheapness of Milk this season. It is, however, I think, mere largely due to the persistent action of the Sanitary Committee in keeping a constant watch on the Milk supply. 37 The only other adulterated articles were 2 samples of Pepper: one these contained 20 per cent. of ground rice; the other 10 per cent. ground ginger. The vendors of these were prosecuted and fined. he vendor of the sample containing ginger disputed the analysis; but on reference to Somerset House my analysis was confirmed, inger, after being well extracted by the ginger-beer manufacturer, occasionally ground up to mix with Pepper, in which it is about as useful as so much saw-dust. Deaths having occurred in neighbouring Parishes to two young children after eating some street Ices, samples of these articles were bought to me by your Inspectors. They were found to consist solely water, milk, and eggs, with occasionally a little vegetable colouring matter, or lemon juice. In no case was any metal found to have been unsolved from the pewter vessels in which the ices are made. All were he from any decomposition, and were in a healthy state; in fact, so hg as the materials are kept frozen no decomposition can take place, hence, I am of opinion that street ices contain no poisonous ingredients, is, however, very improper to allow children so young as those prefferred to (under two years of age) to take such articles. The extreme ed might easily derange their digestions, and lead to serious usequences. The sum of £2 for fines this quarter has been paid into the Vestry's amount. Appending a tabulated list of all the articles analysed, I remain your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, Public Analyst. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875.

To the Vestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Chairman and Gentlemen, The last case of prosecution for adulteration has j ust been concluded, so that I am now able to present to you my Report for the Quarter ending December 25th, 1888. During that period I have received from your Inspectors 31 samples of food, consisting of Milk 19 samples; Butter, 6; and Lard, 6. Of these, 3 samples of Milk and 1 of Butter were adulterated. The adulteration of the Milk consisted in the addition of from 22 to 35 per cent. of water. In all these cases prosecutions woro undertaken and fines of £3, £4, and £4 were imposed. The sample of Butter was, on purchase, acknowledged to be Margarine, but it was exposed for sale without the label demanded by law, henee proceedings were taken under the Margarine Act, when the sample was found to consist principally of beef fat; a conviction was obtained, and a fine of £2 was imposed. That fewer samples of Milk were found adulterated this Quarter than usual, is mainly due, I think, to the plentifulness and consequent cheapness of Milk during this winter. The sum of £13 for fines during the Quarter has been ordered to be paid into the Yestry's account. Reviewing the analytical work of the whole year 1888, we find that altogether 151 samples of food have been examined. These consisted of Milk, 106 samples; Pepper, 14; Mustard, 12; Ices, 7; Butter, 6; and Lard, 6. Of these, 14 Milks, 4 Peppers, 2 Mustards, and 1 Butter were adulterated. None of the samples of Lard or of Ice Cream were adulterated. The per centage of adulteration on the whole of the articles for 1888 is 14; this is the general average found throughout London, and is a great decrease on that of the previous year, when in this Parish 37 per cent. proved to be adulterated. 41 Taking separate articles, we find 13 per cent. of the Milk samples adulterated instead of 44 per cent. as in the previous year. Of the Butters, 17 per cent. were adulterated instead of 30 per cent. Of the Peppers, 28 per cent. were adulterated instead of 43 per cent. The Total sum for fines during the year ordered to be paid into the Vestry's account amounted to £50. I append a tabulated list of all articles analysed during the last Quarter. Gratefully acknowledging the ever-cordial consideration of the Sanitary Committee, and the ready help of their officers, the Sanitary Inspectors, I remain your obedient Servant, ALF. W.

To the Yestry of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Chairman and Gentlemen, During the quarter ending March 25th, 1889, I have received from your Inspectors 42 samples of food for analysis. These consisted entirely of Milk, of which 15 samples, or 35| per cent., were adulterated. The adulteration consisted in the addition of from 7 to 30 per cent, of water, one sample being also slightly skimmed. The vendors of these were in all cases summoned for adulteration, and fines have, in all cases but one, been imposed. In this one case the summons has been adjourned for further evidence. In three of the cases of adulteration the Milk was supplied by a country farmer. At the instance of a member of the Sanitary Committee, samples of this Milk were taken when it was delivered at Cambridge Heath Station, on three different days. In every instance water, from 11 to 21 per cent., was found to have been added. Fines amounting to £7 and costs were imposed on this wholesale vendor. Here good work has been done, since small London dealers buying from such a supplier might innocently have been accused of diluting the Milk; or a fraudulent dealer, not knowing that the Milk was already watered, might add some more, and make the article poor indeed. It is, therefore, specially advisable to stop this wholesale adulteration of Milk at the fountain-head. Besides the 15 really adulterated samples of Milk, 10 samples were of poor quality, and 6 samples contained added cream, leaving only 11 samples of fair average quality Milk out of the 42. The added-cream samples were those where the vendor either keeps a special can of Milk for suspicious or chance customers, which contains an extra amount of cream, or else the measure is merely dipped below the surface of the ordinary can, so as to take off a large proportion of the cream that may be floating on the top. Such samples are of course suspicious, and they leave a poorer article for those coming after. The sum of £25 for fines has so far been ordered to be paid into tho Vestry's account this quarter. Appending a tabulated statement showing the analysis of each sample, I remain your obedient Servant, ALF. W. STOKES, F.C.S., F.I.C., Public Analyst. SALE OF FOOD AND DRUGS ACT, 1875.

Forsaith, Steam Printer, 329, Bethnal Green Road. 1889. Survenor's Department, Vestry Hall, Church Row, Bethnal Green, July, 1889. To the Chairman and Members of the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green. Gentlemen, I have pleasure in laying before you my Report for the year ending Lady-day last. RAILWAY EXTENSIONS. Houses Demolished. The Great Eastern Railway Company have commenced the widening of their railway on the southern side from Brady street eastwards; also from Carlisle street westwards. This involved the demolition of houses in the following streets, viz.:— Brady street Tapp street Southborough place Cudworth street Collingwood street Coventry street Buckhurst street Cambridge road Carlisle street Winchester street Three Colt corner 4 In connection with these works the bridges and arches crossing the following streets are being extended:— Brady street Tapp street Collingwood street Coventry street Buckhurst street Cambridge road Southborough place is abolished. At Three Colt corner a new and more direct footbridge has been erected, which, with the additional lamps provided, will be a great improvement. Winchester crescent and Carlisle street are shortened. The sewer in Carlisle street was a 12 in. pipe sewer, and passed under the Railway to Waterloo Town. It consequently was quite inaccessible in case of stoppage, and under these circumstances the G.E.R. Company have constructed a new 12 in. pipe sewer to fall in the opposite direction and connect with the sewer in Winchester street, so that the pipes under the railway may be abandoned. The Company are also bound to take down the existing arch crossing Buckhurst street and substitute for it a girder bridge. This will remove an obstruction which has been, ever since Buckhurst street was formed, a source of great danger to the public, and a cause of more than one fatal accident. Its removal will also be of pecuniary advantage to the Vestry, as the two danger lamps which have hitherto been maintained there at a cost of about £10 per annum will be unnecessary. The works generally are progressing with rapidity, and the Railway Company's Engineer has taken every care that the public should suffer as little inconvenience as possible. The bridges have been constructed over the roads without stopping the traffic, and the mode of construction justifies the hope that they will bo watertight, and not therefore add to the great nuisance 6 which railway bridges give rise to by reason of water leaking from them on to the roadways and footways beneath. As the works are completed, the lighting, also the paving of the footways and carriageways under the bridges and arches, have to be carried out at the cost of the Railway Company, under your Surveyor's supervision. LIGHTING. Additional Lamps have been erected in the following streets:— Buckhurst street 1 St. John street 1 Busby square 1 Thomas passage 1 Chambord street 1 White street 1 Clarkson street 1 16 Edwards court 1 The following have been discontinued:— Fuller street 1 Gawber street 1 Southborough place 1 Middle row Simpson's place 1 Parliament street 1 2 Princes court 1 Queen Caroline gardens 1 Total additional Lamps 14 Seabright gardens 1 The total number of Lamps maintained at the expense of the Vestry is as follows:— Gas Light and Coke Company, 928 5-feet lamps. ,, ,, 4 3-light Sugg's lamps, supplied by meter. ,, ,, 3 2-light ditto. ,, „ 1 special lamp over Urinal, Austin street, burning 14.4 ft. per hour. ,, ,, 1 ditto over Urinal at corner of Gibraltar walk, burning 15 feet per hour. Commercial Gas Company, 79 5-feet lamps. ,, ,, 1 3-light Sugg's lamp, supplied by meter. „ ,, 2 ditto ditto on Urinal, Bethnal Green road. 6 The following lamps are maintained at the expense of the Great Eastern Railway Company, viz.:— Arundel street 3 Tapp street 1 Brady street 2 Three Colt lane 1 Brick lane 2 Three Colt corner (Bridge) 2 Birkbeck street 1 West street 1 Coventry street 1 Wheler street (lighted clay and night) 2 Collingwood street 1 Grove passage 1 Total 23 Morpeth street 1 Nottingham street 3 Old Bethnal Green road 1 Private Standard Lamps are kept in lighting at private cost during the same hours as the public Lamps as follows:— Grove road (in front of No. 182) 1 Bethnal Green road (in front of No. 343) 2 Old Nichol street (in front of Holy Trinity Club House) 2 Hill street (in front of Seabright Music Hall, and at end of passage leading from Hackney road) 4 The cost of Public Lighting during the past year has been as follows:— £ s. d. Gas-Light and Coke Co.—For Cleaning, Painting, Repairing, Lighting, Extinguishing, and Gas supply to Public Lamps 2889 10 10 The Commercial Gas Co.—For similar services 313 19 7 The Gas-Light and Coke Co. were also paid for Stand Pipes, Cocks, Burners, &c., to new Lamps, and for altering services to Lamps altered in position 12 9 8 £3216 0 1 From this total may be deducted the amount of £1S 4s. 8d. repaid to Vestry for private lighting. On April 1st, 1888, the Commercial Gas Company reduced the price of gas, the reduction amounting to the sum of 3s. 6d. per lamp per annum. It will be observed that although the number of Lamps has increased, there is a decrease in expense of £138 10s. 11d. The cost of the gas supplied, including meter rents, to the Yestry Hall, Mortuary, Clock at St. John's Church, and Digby street yard, was £67 0s. 11d. 7 A Gas Stove (hired from the Gas Light and Coke Company) has been fixed in the Board room for use during the winter months, and the lighting of the Board room has been improved by fixing a new Sun Burner, and two large brackets in the angles behind the Chairman, and the substitution of "Sugg's Christiana" for "Argand " burners at the Chairman's table. ROADS. The following roads have been made up with " broken granite" or "flints," and steam rolled:— Macadam roads. Bunsen street. Bonner road (Approach road to Old Ford road). Catherine street. Canrobert street. Cambridge circus. Centre street. Emma street (part). Felix street. Globe road. Gore road. Lyte street. Mowlem street. Old Ford road (part). Pollard row. Russia lane.

The channels of the following streets have been paved:— Antill road. Bunsen street. Bonner road (part). Catherine street. Canrobert street. Emma street (part). Gore road. Lyte street. Mowlem street. Marion square (part). Matilda street. Teesdale street. Wadeson street. Wood street. Wood's close. 8 Labour. The labour account shows a slight increase as compared with last year. The payments made were as follows:— £ s. d. Foreman (Mr. Stone) 130 0 0 Store Keeper (Mr. Rutty) 93 0 0 Yardmen 116 13 0 Paviors 180 13 1 Masons 185 13 4 Sewer men 416 9 2 Carmen 185 17 3 Roadmen and Labourers 976 10 7 Stone breakers 25 9 5 Tying Trees, &c. 4 9 0 Scavengers (including Sunday Scavenging) 1497 6 2 Additional Labour engaged in Removal of Snow 36 16 6 Watchmen 97 12 8 Sanitary Department 680 10 0 Allowances to men during illness, &c. 20 0 0 Total £4647 0 2 Trenches. The amounts paid by the Gas and Water Companies for repairs to Trenches opened during the year were:— £ s. d. Gas-Light and Coke Co. 252 1 8 Commercial Gas Co. 19 14 8 East London Water Works Co. 395 6 7 £607 2 11 Street Watering The cost of water for Street Watering was £209 10s. 8d., as against £318 6s. 9d. last year. The sum of £35 14s. was paid for meter rents. The quantity of water used being 5,869,000 gallons. Buildings. Notices have been given under Sec. 76 of The Metropolis Local Management Act, of intention to erect 68 houses and 18 other buildings. A Builder who neglected to give notice was summoned and fined 10s. and costs. Improvements. The barriers at Green street were removed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, and the improvement formally handed over to the Vestry on May 29th. A row of trees has been planted in the Churchyard and Vicarage garden, at the expense of the Vestry. 9 The Builder who had taken the land between Chester street and Chester place, had excavated the site, and also part of the footway, but did not proceed with his building operations. It at length became necessary to proceed against him, and on 21st January the Builder was fined £5 and £5 5s. costs for maintaining a hoarding for a longer period than the time permitted by the Licence. As he did not then remove the hoarding or proceed with his building, further proceedings were taken for continuing penalties, and on 18th March, 1889, he was fined the further sum of £9 and £3 3s. costs. The fines and costs in each instance come to the Vestry. The removal of the forecourts and formation of the footway at the North-West corner of Bishop's road has been completed. A small improvement has been made at Cambridge Circus by a give-and-take line with the lessee of the land belonging to the Parmiter Foundation. An extensive improvement has been carried out at the corner of Virginia road and Grascoyne place. The "Loggerheads" Public House and adjoining houses have been pulled down and new buildings erected, set back to the general line of buildings. The land was given up without compensation—the conditions being that the Vestry should at their own cost make the needful alterations to the foot and carriageways, and this has been done. The re-building of the premises at the North-West oorner of Bishop's road having been commenced, complaint was made by persons in the neighbourhood that the buildings were being carried up to a greater height than the buildings by which the site was previously Building Lines. 10 occupied, and would form an encroachment beyond the building line. Application was therefore made to the Superintending Architect of the Metropolitan Board of Works to define the general building line in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 75 of the M.L.M. Act, 1862. The Superintending Architect heard the parties in the case (when your Surveyor represented the Vestry), and afterwards forwarded a letter to the Vestry, of which the following is a copy. Metropolitan Board of Works. Dear Sir, 31st October, 1888. Cane No. 38,692. With reference to your request that I should decide the general line of buildings in relation to the buildings now being erected at Nos. 236, 238 and 240, Cambridge road, Bethnal Green, I beg to apprize you for the information of the Vestry, that I find that buildings formerly existed on the whole of the site of the buildings in question; and, under these circumstances, and having regard to the decision of the Lords Justices in the case of "Aukland v. The Westminster District Board of Works" (Law Reports, 7 c. 597), that it appears to me that no question as to the line of the buildings, Nos. 236, 238 and 240 can be rained under the 75th Sec. of the Metropolis Management Amendment Act. Yours faithfully, Thos. Blashill, R. Voss, Esq. Superintending Architect. On this letter being laid before the Yestry it was resolved that no further action be taken in the matter. Hill street. Two applications were made on behalf of the Proprietor of the Seabright Music Hall for permission to erect a canopy over the footway of Hill Street in front of the Music Hall, but the Yestry declined to approve of the proposal. Compensation. Two claims for compensation for accidents were made against the Vestry. Full enquiries were made into the circumstances and the claims were abandoned. A claim was made for damage to a quantity of sheet iron placed by a tradesman in the roadway, which was 11 wetted, by a passing watercart. Liability was denied on behalf of the Vestry and no further action was taken. The following Tenders were accepted for the supply of materials, &c.:— Tools, Materials, &c. Lime, Pipes, &c. Mr. T. Blyth. Scavengers' Brooms Messrs. Keeves & Sons. Broken Guernsey Granite Mr. W. Griffiths. Lamp Columns Messrs. Jukes, Coulson & Co. Fodder Mr. Cook. Polling Boards Mr. A. Stevens. Watchmen's Lanterns Mr. T. Keeves. Jobbing Cartage Mr. H. Crane. Plumbers' Work Mr. Payne. Granite Pitchings Mr. W. Griffiths. The Steam Roller which was purchased by the Vestry in May, 1879, being thoroughly out of repair, Messrs. Aveling and Porter were invited to examine the same and submit a specification and estimate for repairs. Steam Roller, The Roller was sent to Messrs. Aveling and Porter's Works, at Rochester, and the repairs carried out at a cost of £90 10s. 7d., and the Roller returned. Shortly afterwards, while at work in Bonner road, the driving axle broke through a flaw in the metal. This involved a further expenditure of £14 1s. 3d. The sum of £7 1s. 10d. has been paid to the East London Water Works Co. for repairing mains broken by the Steam Roller. Considerable danger is caused and expense involved by the habit of carmen shooting loads of rubbish on the highways, at night, and unfortunately this mostly occurs under railway arches and in dark places. On the recommendation of the Works Committee a large number of bills were posted in various parts of the Parish, offering a reward for such evidence as would lead to an arrest and conviction. Sufficient evidence has not been obtained to justify a prosecution, but the effect of the offer of the reward has been that the practice has decreased. Shooting Rubbish. 12 PAVING WORKS. Law franc road. The unpaved footway in front of three houses in Lawfranc road has been paved with York paving. Hare street. The carriageway of Hare street has been taken up and a bed of 9 inches of concrete been laid in, and the pitchings redressed and relaid—the deficiency being made up with stone from stock. While this work was in progress an improved approach was made to the footbridge, at Three Colt Corner, the cost of the whole being £1,013 18s. 5d. Kay street The steep portion of the roadway of Kay street, in front of the United Radical Club premises, was paved, jointly at the expense of this Vestry and the Vestry of Shoreditch, and the gradient improved, the cost to the Bethnal Green Parish being £21 5s. 9d. Whitechapel road. The carriageway on the South side of Whitechapel road was relaid at a cost of £84 7s. 5d., of which amount £18 4s. Od. will be repaid to this Vestry by the Vestry of Mile End. H ickney road. The carriageway of Hackney road at its junction with Goldsmiths' row was relaid at a cost of £19 3s. 8d.; also several crossings between Hassard street and Shoreditch Church were relaid at a cost of £10 8s. 5d. Virginia road. The repaving of the carriageway, and the formation of a new footway, at the junction of Virginia road and Gascoyne place was carried out at a cost of £126 3s. 9d. Violet row. The carriageway of Violet row (Green street) was paved with pitchings from stock at a cost of £32 5s. 8d. Old Ford road. The railings surrounding the large lamp at the junction of Old Ford road, St. James'road and Bonner road were removed and a paved "rest" constructed and protected with guard posts. 13 The footways in these streets were paved with old tone from stock; the work being carried out by the Vestry's workmen. Primrose street, Violet row, Garden place. SEWERS, &c. Applications have been made for permission to drain 135 houses and 18 other buildings. All connections with the Sewers and works under the highways are done by the Vestry's workmen, at the expense of the applicant, and plans of all the drains are submitted for approval, and are retained in the office for reference. House Drainage The Public Urinal under the railway arch at Wheler street having become a nuisance, by reason of the unsuitableness of the position and the insufficiency of the accommodation provided, it was resolved that it should be abolished, and that a Urinal to accommodate six persons should be erected in Bethnal Green road, at its junction with Sclater street. This lias been done, the new Urinal being fitted up by Mr. Jennings, of Lambeth, with the most improved fittings. Urinals. It was also resolved that the land belonging to the Vestry at the corner of Gibraltar walk and Bethnal Green road should be occupied by a Urinal. Considerable difficulty was experienced in selecting a suitable pattern, in consequence of the levels of the site, but ultimately an accommodation for six persons, by Messrs. MacFarlane, Ironfounders, was determined on, and with the improved paving of the surrounding area, has materially improved the sanitary condition of the locality. The Urinals at Cabbage court, Northampton street, and Treadway street, have been altered, and a constant water supply furnished on the "Trough" system. 14 The cost of water supplied (including materials) to the Public Urinals during the year was £60 16s. During the erection of the Urinal at Bethnal Green road, a watchman's lantern belonging to the Vestry was stolen. The man was arrested and taken to the Police Court, and fined £2 for unlawful possession. Gibraltar walk. While the cleaning of the sewer at Gibraltar walk was in hand, a man was arrested in the night by a Policeman, having a plank belonging to the Vestry in his possession. He was brought up at Worship street Police Court, and sentenced to 21 days' hard labour. Flushing Sewers. In consequence of the very wet summer season only a small quantity of water was required for flushing Sewers, the cost being £2 14s. Water supply. The cost of water supply at the Yestry Hall for the year was £3; at Digby street Depot, £4 10s. 6d; and at the Mortuary, £2 5s. Disinfectants. The gullies, market places, urinals, &c., were disinfected with Jeye's purifier during the hot weather. RE-NUMBERING, &c. By order of the Metropolitan Board of Works the Houses in the following Streets have been Re-numbered, viz:— Austin street. Anglesea street. Baker street. Chester place. Clarkson street. Morpeth street. Olga street. Wharf road Walter street. Salisbury street and Walter street are now incorporated and known as Walter street throughout. In all 228 houses have been re-numbered. 15 APPLICATIONS FOR PROJECTIONS, &c. The following applications wore made to the Metropolitan Board of Works, and remitted to this Vestry for their opinion. Name of Street. Subject of Application. Recommendation of Vestry.

Plans, Estimates, and Apportionments have been prepared for paving the following new streets:— Eastman street £269 0 2 Ion square 308 3 5 Cambridge street 214 4 9 Digby walk 165 5 8 Gran by row 165 4 7 Medhurst road 505 4 2 Thomas passage 183 2 6 Sweet Apple square 203 6 3 Godfrey's place 164 13 11 The work has been carried out in Medhurst road. Apportionments on the actual cost of paving, &c., Mansford street and Strahan road, have been prepared, and the differences between the estimated and actual cost returned to the owners. In several cases it became necessary to take proceedings at the Police Court to recover the amounts of the apportionments. During the year the sum of £555 0s. 2d. has been collected and paid in to the credit of the "New Streets Account." INSANITARY DWELLINGS. During the year the Medical Officer of Health has condemned a considerable number of houses as being "in a condition or state dangerous to health, so as to be unfit for human habitation," and recommended that they should be dealt with under the provisions of the "Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Acts" (commonly known as Torrens' Acts). A number of these reports have been from time to time referred to your Survoyor for consideration and report. 17 In dealing with houses under these Acts great difficulties and delays arise. The first report referred to me related to Martha court, and the report of the Medical Officer stated:—"These are small two-roomed "houses, built back to back: they are all more or less "damp and dilapidated. The flooring of the lower "rooms is from eight to twelve inches below the level "of the forecourts; the roofs in some instances are "leaky, and the walls and ceilings of the rooms are "(with the exception of No. 1) in a filthy condition. "Houses constructed back to back in this manner "cannot be properly ventilated. The forecourts are "badly and insufficiently paved, and there are only two "water closets for the eight houses." On referring to Section 6 of the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Acts, 1868, I find the instructions to the Surveyor or Engineer defined as follows:— "To consider the report so furnished to him, and "report to the Local Authority what is the cause of the "evil so reported on and the remedy thereof, and if "such evil is occasioned by defects in any premises, "whether the same can be remedied by structural "alterations and improvements or otherwise, or whether "such premises, or any, and what part thereof, ought "to be demolished." Being anxious as far as possible to meet the views of the Medical Officer, I addressed to him the following letter:— Gth February, 1888. Dear Dr. Bate, I have been considering your reports on "Houses unfit for human habitation," and before examining the properties and preparing my report on the subject, should like to clear up one or two points. I see that I am required to state "The cause of the evil reported on, and the remedy thereof." Now, in the report relating to Martha Court the principal points seem to be: 18 (а) That the flooring of the lower rooms is from eight to twelve inches below the level of the forecourts ; (b) That houses constructed back to back cannot be properly ventilated; (c) That there are two W.C.'s only for eight houses. I should be glad of information on the following points, viz.:— (a) Are the houses unfit for habitation because the floors are below the level, &c.? (b) Are they unfit for habitation because they are back to back? If so, the only remedy would be to pull down half of them. (c) How many houses of this character in your opinion should one W.C. serve ? I am sorry to trouble you, but if you can instruct me on these points it will much facilitate the preparation of my report, which I should like to get before the next Vestry, if possible. I am, dear Dr. Bate, Yours faithfully, F. W. BARRATT. The following is Dr. Bate's reply:— 412, Bethnal Green Road, E., February 13th, 1888. Dear Mr. Barratt, I have carefully considered your letter, and also the four conditions which as you say contribute to the insanitary condition of Martha Court. You ask me which of these conditions causes the houses to be in my opinion unfit for human habitation. Now, I object to bind myself to any one of these four items, aud say that the houses in question are unhealthy because all the four conditions you name obtain at one and the same time on these premises, and that this insanitary total is the "evil complained of," and not the separate items. I have looked well into the Act of 1868, and I am sure that section five provides for a health report only. It would be unreasonable to require a Medical Officer of Health or an Inspector of Nuisances (from either of whom the primary report to the Vestry may emanate), to specify works to be done of which a Surveyor is the only professional judge; and I consider that I should have acted up to what is sought for if, in the certificate; read at the last meeting of the Vestry, I had said, "That from the number of deaths and cases of disease in the houses A B C & D, and from their general insanitary surroundings " (without specifying them), "I report that they are in a condition dangerous to health, so as to be unfit for human habitation." The Act does not require me to state reasons, but merely to follow the wording of the fifth section. 19 This would not be so when we come to the instructions to the urveyor, who is required under the sixth section to report on the ause of the evil referred to in the report of the Sanitary Officer, This may mean the cause of the fever, low state of health of the Inhabitants, or what not : the Surveyor may find the cause to be eficient fall of the drainage, that there is no adequate provision r ventilation, or a hundred other things. Next he is to specify ne remedy: the whole responsibility here rests, from my point of iew, upon the Surveyor as to the particular action to be taken. give a medical opinion that the health results from certain houses re unsatisfactory; you have to accept my report, which is not bject to appeal or revision in any way, and from the conclusions f the report you have to work back in an inspection of the premises o hud out what (if anything) justifies that report : having fouud hat out. you have to prescribe the remedy, with a view to the wner disputing your conclusions, but not mine. The object of the two reports is, in my opinion, wholly distinct and different. The Health Officer merely points out an evil; the urveyor reports on the means of removing it. Assuming the Medical Officer says that certain premises are unfit for habitation y reason of perpetual outbreaks of Typhus Fever, the Surveyor hen inspects the buildings and says that structurally they are erfect, but that the fever is produced by overcrowding: the tature of the remedy is at once obviously pointed out. The fact that the Medical Officer of Health should have discovered this for himself, and have taken action under a different statute, does not n any way affect the Surveyor's duty, which is quite definitely kid down. To recapitulate, it would be most unreasonable to require the Health Officer to be an expert in building, or to limit the Surveyor to the consideration of causes that the Health Officer may have dated in his report. I feel sure the Surveyor's report is intended o be altogether independent of that of the Health Officer, and ertaiuly not a report upon it, but dealing with the Health Officer's onclusions, though not accepting his reasons, which he has full ower to disregard, or, if he thinks fit, to take as a guide in his ndependent investigation. I have gone thus fully into the matter as I think of making a special point of the true reading of he Act in my forthcoming report. I look upon the intentions of his Act of Parliament as almost perfect, though whether the machinery by which these intentions are carried out is equally perfect I leave to the lawyers to decide. I am, dear Mr. Barratt, Very faithfully yours, GEORGE PADDOCK BATE. F. W. Barratt, Esq., Surveyor to the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, 20 From this correspondence will readily be seen the nature of the responsibility which is thrown upon a Surveyor to whom these reports are referred. The following is a list of houses which I have reported on, with the results of such reports:— Premises. Recommendation of Surveyor.

Number of Dwellinghouses reported in each year by the Medical Officer of Health as dangerous to health, so as to be unfit for human habitation, in accordance with the provisions of the Artizans' Dwellings Acts, 1868-1882.

Number of such Dwelling - houses for which the orders of the Local Authority for repair or demolition were carried out. Number of Dwelling-houses concerning which a Memorial has been addressed to the Secretary of State or Local Government Board, in accordance with the Provisions of the Artizans and Labourers' Dwellings Act of 1868, to the effect that the Local Authority has declined or neglected to put the Act in force.

Date, May 16th, 1889, Robert Voss, Vestry Clerk. 23 It will be seen from the foregoing statement that considerable work has been accomplished under the Acts, but there are great differences of opinion as to the extent of the powers of the Vestry; if houses are regarded as unfit for habitation because the floor is lower than the street paving, then probably one-third of the houses in the Parish would be condemned for this reason. Again, the smallness of the rooms cannot be regarded as a reasonable objection. The remedy in this case is for the Sanitary Inspectors to take proceedings for over- crowding if and when such overcrowding is discovered. The form of proceedings under the Act is excessively tedious, and an obstructive owner may without carrying out the Vestry's orders to repair, keep his premises in occupation for an indefinite period. I cannot help contrasting this with the proceedings under the Nuisances Removal Acts, against owners of houses which are in the opinion of the Medical Officer unfit for habitation. A Police Court Summons can at once be taken out and a Magistrate's Order obtained to close the premises, which cannot again be occupied, under a penalty of 20s. per day, until the owner can satisfy the Magistrate that the works necessary to render the house fit for habitation have been carried out. When the huts which stood on the north side of Derbyshire street and in Granby row, Elliott's row, and Thomas passage, were closed under these powers, the owners at once demolished them and erected new and improved buildings on the sites.

VI. —Inspectors' Report of the Sanitary Work. REPORT. Gentlemen, I beg to present my Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Condition of the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, during the year 1888, which terminated (for registration purposes) on the 29th day of December last. POPULATION. I estimate the population of the borough at 130,500, being an increase of 905 over the year 1887. I have arrived at this figure after much consideration, for although the number of deaths in the year has increased, yet both the births and the marriages are fewer than they were in 1887. I usually estimate the population upon the number of births registered during the year, as birth rates in large towns are known to vary within very small limits; but 1888 was a year of such remarkably low rates, that the Registrar General remarks in his annual summary that the marriage rate and the death rate in London were each the lowest )n record, while the birth rate was the lowest since 1841. The London birth rate has diminished one per thousand, so that it is )erfectly fair to assume that Bethnal Green has participated in his diminution, and that a population which would give a birth ate of one per thousand below that of 1887 would be about the igure for 1888. The area of Bethnal Green is 755 acres, about 17 of which are overed with water. The number of inhabited houses is 18,668 which gives a ratio of 6.99 persons to each house and 173 to each cre. 2 TABLE A. No. of Houses, Workshops, &c., in the Parish of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green.

This gives an increase of one, but it includes 140 non-parishioners who have died in Bethnal Green hospitals, but whose deaths are excluded from the enumeration. On the other hand I have received information from the General Register Office of the deaths of 261 inhabitants of Bethnal Green in extra parochial hospitals. These deaths must be added, and they raise the net total to 2958. BIRTHS. The births during the year were 4936 against 4989 in the preceding year. This gives a decrease of 53. The excess of the births over the deaths was 1978, as is shewn by the subjoined table. This is 74 fewer than last year. 3 TABLE B. 1888. 1887. Estimated Population in the middle of the year 130,500 129,895 Total Births 4036 4989 Total Deaths 2958 2917 Excess of Births over Deaths, shewing the natural increase of the Population 1978 2072 DEATH RATE. Upon the basis of the population, as estimated, we shew a death rate of 22.65 for the year 1888. This is a fraction above that of the previous year, and greatly exceeds that of the whole Metropolis. It is also above that of the Eastern districts of London, which was 21.1, the rate in the West districts was 16.9, in the North, 16.4, in the South, 17.3, and in the Central, 27.2. The general Metropolitan death rate for 1888 (18.5) is far the lowest as yet recorded; moreover, the three next lowest are the three immediately preceding years, 1885-6-7, when the figures were successively 19.8, 19.9, and 19.6. In the following table are compared the mortality rates for London and for Bethnal Green by quarters. TABLE C. London. Bethnal Green. March Quarter 22.0 28.2 June ,, 16.9 18.3 September ,, 16.2 17.8 December ,, 19.8 26.7 4 BIRTHS AND BIRTH RATE. The number of births registered during the year was 4936, a rate of 37.82 per thousand population. This is a rate (0.89) lower than that of last year, but much greater than that of London, which was 30.7. The Registrar General remarks that this is the lowest birth rate recorded in London since 1841, when the rate was 30.4. In 1876 the rate was 35.9, but from that date it has fallen continuously year by year. I am indebted to the British Medical Journal for the following extract: " THE TRUE DEATH-RATES OF LONDON SANITARY DISTRICTS DURING 1888. "In the accompanying table will be found summarised the vital and mortal Statistics of the forty-one sanitary districts of the Metropolis, based upon the Registrar-General's returns for the year 1888. Quarterly summaries of these statistics have already appeared in these columns. The mortality figures in the table relate to the deaths of persons actually belonging to the respective sanitary districts, and are the result of a complete system of distribution of deaths occurring in the institutions of London among the various sanitary districts in which the patients had previously resided. Thus the precise number of deaths of persons actually belonging to the respective sanitary districts is known, as all deaths occurring in institutions of persons who had previously resided in another district have been excluded from the total number of deaths in the district in which the institution is situated, and have been credited to the district from which they came. By this means alone can trustworthy data be secured upon which to calculate reliable rates of mortality. "The 131,080 births registered in London during the year 1888 were equal to a rate of 30.7 per 1,000 of the population, estimated at 4,282,921 persons, which showed a further decline from the rates in recent years, and was lower than that recorded in any year since 1841, when it was 30.4 per 1,000. In the various sanitary districts the birth-rates showed the usual wide variations, owing to the differences in the age and sex distribution of their populations. In St. George, Hanover Square, Kensington, St. Martin-in-the-Fields, and St. James, Westminster, the birth-rates were considerably below the average : while in East London, St. Luke's, St. Olave, Southwark, and Fulham, where the population contains a large proportion of young married persons, the birthrates showed an excess. "The deaths of persons belonging to London registered during the year under notice were 77,686, equal to an annual rate of 18.2 per 1,000 of the estimated population, which was considerably lower than in any year since civil registration was established in 1837. During the past eight years of the current decade the mean death-rate in London has been only 20.1 per 1,000, while it was equal to 24.4 in the ten years 1861-70, and to 22.5 in 1871-80. The marked decline 5 in the London death-rate since 1880 implies that about 110,000 persons in London have survived, whose deaths would have been recorded had the rate of mortality since 1880 equalled that which prevailed in the twenty years 1861-80. "The lowest death-rates among the forty-one sanitary districts during 1888 were: 12.7 in Hampstead, 13.8 in Plumstead, 14.8 in Kensington, 14.9 in Battersea, 15.1 in Hackney, and 15.5 in Camberwell. In the other districts the rates ranged upwards to 25.0 in Stepney, 25.5 in St. Olave, Southwark, 25.9 in St. Saviour, Southwark, 26.4 in Holborn, and 27.8 in St. George-in-the-East. During the year under notice, 10,727 deaths resulted from the principal zymotic diseases in London; of these, 2,986 were referred to whooping-cough, 2401 to measles, 2,166 to diarrhoea, 1,268 to diphtheria, 1196 to scarlet fever, 701 to different forms of "fever" (including 658 to enteric fever, 33 to simple and illdefined forms of continued fever, and 10 to typhus), and 9 to small-pox. These 10,727 deaths were equal to an annual rate of 2.5 per 1,000, which was lower than the rate in any year on record. The zymotic death-rate during last year in the various sanitary districts ranged from 1.3 per 1,000 in Woolwich and in Plumstead, 1.4 in St. James, Westminster and in Hampstead, and 1.5 in St. George, Hanover Square, to 3 7 in Clerkenwell and in St. Luke's, 3.8 in St. George-in-the-East and in St. Saviour, Southwark, 4.0 inFulham,4.2 in Bethnal Green, and 4.5 in Stepney. Compared with the preceding year, the mortality from measles, scarlet fever and diarrhœa showed a decline, while that from diphtheria showed a marked excess. Only 9 deaths from small-pox were recorded in London during the year under notice, corresponding with the number in 1887. which was the lowest on record; of these, 3 belonged to South London, 2 to West, 2 to East, 1 to North, and 1 to Central London. Sixtyeight small-pox patients were admitted into the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals during 1888, but none remained under treatment at the end of December. Measles showed the highest proportional fatality in Clerkenwell, Bethnal Green, Mile End Old Town, Fulham, St. Saviour, Southwark, and Stepney; scarlet fever in Westminster, Camberwell, St. Luke's, Stepney, Mile-End Old Town, Poplar, and Bethnal Green; diphtheria in Kensington, St. George, Hanover Square, St. Saviour, Southwark, Wandsworth, Lewisham, Westminster, and Paddington; whooping-cough in St. Luke's, Shoreditch, Stepney, Bethnal Green, and Westminster; and diarrhœa in Clerkenwell, St. Luke's, Whitechapel, St. George-in-the-East, and Fulham. The number of ) scarlet fever patients under treatment in the Metropolitan Asylums Hospitals, which had been 2,046 at the beginning of the year 1888, was only 738 at the end of December; the admissions were 4,457, the number in each quarter being 1,416, 1,025, 1,095, and 921 respectively. "Infant mortality in London during 1888, measured by the proportion of deaths under one year of age to births registered, was equal to 146 per 1,000, against an average rate of 154 in the ten preceding years, 1878-87. While the rate of infant mortality did not exceed 99 in Plumstead, 110 in Hampstead, 131 in Paddington, and 132 in St. George, Hanover Square, it ranged upwards in the other sanitary districts to 186 in Clerkenwell, 190 in Holborn, 191 in Stepney, 195 in St. George-in-the-East, and 203 in St. Saviour, Southwark." N.B.—It will be noted that the population of Bethnal Green as given by the Editor of the British Medical Journal greatly exceeds my estimate. I am, however, bold enough to hold the opinion that my figure is more nearly correct than his.

The Registrar General is of opinion that these several excesses appear not to be due merely to temporary influences, but to indicate the operation of some permanent causes; for if the corresponding tables in the last five annual summaries be examined, it will be found that, in each of the last five years, 1883 to 1887, there are similar excesses. Similarly, under the headings under which there has been a diminished mortality in 1888, there are 10 in which there was also a diminution in each of the preceding five years, namely Scarlet Fever, Typhus, Simple and Ill-defined Fever, Enteric Fever, Diseases of the Nervous System, Accident and Murder, and one or two others. MARRIAGES. In this parish there are 14 churches, 15 chapels, and one registry office licensed for marriages: of these there were in the First Quarter 417 Second Quarter 567 Third Quarter 587 Fourth Quarter 711 Total 2282 This total indicates a marriage rate of 17.49 to every thousand persons; or, as in each marriage there are two contracting parties, 34.68 per thousand of our population entered the bonds of matrimony. Fifty-five of these weddings were purely civil contraots, and required the presence of the Registrar to legalize them; 28 of them took place in the Registrar's office and the remainder in chapels. The rate for London was 16.1 persons married to one thousand of the population. This, the lowest marriage rate as yet recorded in the Metropolis, was 18.5 per thousand lower than that of Bethnal Green. DEATHS OF INFANTS. Twenty-six per cent of the deaths from all causes were those of infants aged less than 12 months; for out of 4936 children born alive, 770 died before reaching the age of one year, leaving only 4166 who attained that age; this gives a death rate, calculated upon the births, of 156 per thousand. The corresponding rate for the whole of London was 146; the diseases most fatal to infants 9 were: Inflammatory Chest Diseases, 158; Atrophy and Debility, 147; "Whooping Cough, 57; Premature Birth, 56; Convulsions, 82; Suffocation, 40; Diarrhœa, 36 ; Tabes, 28; and Measles, 22. DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. As usual, nearly half the deaths (1443, equal that is to 48.7 per cent.), were those of young children aged less than five years. Assuming that the proportion of young children to adults has been maintained since the last census, the number of young children in 1888 would be 19,923. Upon this estimated population we show a death rate of 72.1. SPECIAL CAUSES OF DEATH. SUMMARY OF TABLE III. No. of Deaths. Per centage on Total Deaths. Mortality Rate on Population. Order.

The total number of deaths referred to this group of diseases was 576; of which 460 were cases of young children under five years of age; of whom 133 did not complete the first year of life; 167 of the deaths were from Whooping Cough; 124 from Measles; 120 from Scarlet Fever; 66 from Diarrhœa; and 52 from Diphtheria, THE SEVEN PRINCIPAL ZYMOTIC DISEASES. The deaths from the diseases grouped under the orders Miasmatic and Diarrhœal were 552 against 416 last year ; an increase of 136. The decennial average of Zymotic deaths for the ten years, 1878 to 1887, was 522 (see Table V).

The death rate from Zymotic diseases was 4.22 against 3.20 last year; the corresponding rates for London were 3,02 in 1887 and 2.53 in 1888. 11 The Zymotic diseases showing increase over tlio preceding year wore Measles, Scarlet Fever, Diphtheria, and Whooping Cough, the mortality from each of whioh was nearly double that of 1887. In the following table is shown the por-centago of each as compared with the total number of Zymotic deaths. TABLE F. Small Pox 0.18 per cent., or 1 in 552.00 deaths.

(Decennial average 36.1,). The deaths from Small Pox registered in the whole of London during the year were only nine, and this had also been the number in the preceding year 1887. In Bethnal Green a single death was registered; this was of a child aged two years in Arbery Road on the 18th of February, who was stated to have been vaccinated, and I was unable to trace the source of infection. Eleven cases of Small Pox, including the death above noted, were reported to us during the year. The first case we heard of was in Columbia Road; and was that of a child 20 months old. Its mother assured me that it had been vaccinated. The eruption appeared on the 12th of January, and the patient was removed on the 16th to hospital. I could not trace the source of infection. Next came the fatal case in February; then on the 27th of the same month a young fellow, aged 24 years, was removed to the Small Pox Hospital. I could not discover that he had been 12 exposed to infection, but I ascertained that he worked at Messrs. Waterlow's, and that several of his "mates" had been away ill. On the 3rd of March another young follow, aged 19 years, was removed from Turin Street. He also was one of Messrs. Waterlow's hands. On the same day another employe of that firm, aged 18, was removed from a house in Prince's Court suffering from the same disease; and ten days afterwards his three sisters, aged respectively 16, 13, and 9 were attacked. They were removed on the 12th of March. On the 15th the disease appeared in a family in Quinn's Buildings,—a young girl was attacked and removed to hospital, her "young man " worked at Messrs. Waterlow's. From this family the disease spread to some relations in Poplar who had visited the sick girl; but I heard of no more cases in Bethnal Green till April the 7th, when a girl, aged 14, was removed from Cheshire Street, and on April 25th, a man, aged 30, was removed from Bacon Street. I failed to trace the source of infection in both these cases. The 11 cases of Small Pox reported occurred in eight houses; in two of these the sanitary arrangements were fairly satisfactory, but in all the others there were grave defects, and three of the houses were in a very bad state indeed. I feared at this time we were about to have a serious epidemic, and I still think that had not the infected persons been promptly removed we should have experienced one. Manufactories and schools undoubtedly assist in spreading infectious disease; but for my part I do not see why the plan now adopted at all large public schools should not be extended to board schools and factories, and the production of a certificate of freedom from infection be made compulsory on all persons returning to school or work after temporary absence. SCARLET FEVER. (Decennial average 91.0) The number of cases of Scarlet Fever reported to us during the year was 282 against 266 last year. The disease caused 120 deaths, exactly double the mortality of 1887, which was itself 13 twice that of 1886. The 282 reported cases occurred in 213 houses. In 60 cases the premises were in a fairly satisfactory condition; in 26 they were more or less unsatisfactory; and in the remaining 127 grave sanitary defects were discovered. To get these remedied it was necessary to take legal proceedings in 18 cases, and to obtain Magistrates' orders for the necessary work to be done. In December, Scarlet Fever broke out in the family of the caretaker of the Nichol Street Board School; the patient, a child, was removed to the Fever Hospital on the 20th of the month. Upon examining the premises I found the caretaker's residence was in direct communication with the schoo1 buildings by means of a doorway between the house and the master's private room; had it not been for the fact that the pupils broke up for the Christmas holidays on the day following the notification, I should have felt it my duty to advise the Vestry to order the closure of the schools. I, however, communicated with the Clerk to the School Board for London, and recommended that, in view of any future outbreak of infectious disease in the family of the caretaker, the door of communication between his residence and the school should be permanently closed, as the danger of the disease spreading to the pupils would be thereby minimised. My recommendation was immediately attended to and the doorway was bricked up. FEVERS. (Decennial average 39.9). Enteric Fever caused 20 deaths last year. A few cases of simple fever were also reported, and one (fatal) case of Typhus. A total of 39 cases of Fever were reported; 37 houses were inspected; seven of these were found to be in good condition; an equal number were more or less defective; and 27 were in a very bad state indeed ; while legal proceedings were necessary in two instances to get our requirements carried out. In the following Table is shown the number and kind of the various infectious cases reported during the year, month by month, the termination of the hospital cases is also indicated.

(Decennial average 14.7). Diphtheria was the registered cause of 52 deaths; but 46 others were returned under the head of Croup; many of these were probably cases of Diphtheria. The Registrar General in his Annual Summary remarks that the mortality from this disease has been increasing in London since 1877. The rise up to 1887 was gradual, but in 1888 there was a sudden bound, the total deaths increasing from 953 to 1301; a rise of 30 per cent, in a single year. The increase in this parish was actually 50 per cent. I think this increase is to some extent more apparent than real; for i note that nearly all the hospital deaths from Membranous Laryngitis are now returned as Diphtheria, whilst most of those amongst the patients of private practitioners are certified as Croup.* There is a fashion in medical terms as in other things, and it now seems to be the fashion amongst Hospital Medical Officers to call all cases of Membranous Laryngitis, "Diphtheria,'' whereas a year or two ago they would have been returned as "Croup." Fifty houses, where cases of Diphtheria had occurred, were inspected; 13 of the premises were in a fairly satisfactory condition; in 16 they were more or less defective ; and in 21 the state was very bad indeed. It was necessary to take legal proceedings and to obtain Magistrates' orders in four of these cases, before the bad sanitary conditicn was remedied. WHOOPING COUGH. (Decennial average 133.5,). Whooping Cough caused 167 deaths. A large proportion of this mortality was registered in the first quarter of the year. The epidemic commenced in the latter part of 1887, and continued to the middle of March, 1888, after which the number of deaths gradually fell, and the mortality remained low during the remainder of the year. * Cases of Diphtheria are now admitted to the Asylums' Board Hospitals. 16 MEASLES. (Decennial average 95.1). Measles caused 124 deaths; out of which all except 14 were those of young children. A large proportion of these deaths occurred in the last quarter of the year. DIETETIC DISEASES. Seven deaths were attributed to intemperance. The following is a list (most of them were returned by the Coroner):— Cause of Death. Sex. Age. Effusion of Blood on Brain Female 52 Hæmatemesis Male 78 Suffocation whilst Drunk Female 30 Coma (found Dead) Female 37 Ditto Male 36 Delirium Tremens Male 27 Suicide whilst Drunk (Carbolic Acid) Male 36 PRIVATION. Two infants were certified to have died from want of breast milk; a male, aged 72, died from Bronchitis, accelerated by cold; an infant, aged 12 weeks, died from the same cause; a man, aged 60, died from Pericardial Effusion, accelerated by inclement weather; a female infant, two-and-a-half days old, died from defective vitality and destitution of its mother; a female infant died from congestion of the lungs and want of proper care; and a man and a woman, aged respectively 41 and 49, died from want of the proper necessaries of life. CONSTITUTIONAL DISEASE. Under this head 439 deaths were returned. Of these Cancer caused 69; the chief organs affected were liver and intestines, 21; womb, 16; tongue, 7; breast, 4. 17 TUBERCULAR DISEASE. The total number of deaths in this group was 308; of which Phthisis caused 236, nearly eight per cent, of the total mortality from all causes. In six instances the immediate cause of death was stated to be bleeding from the lungs. The deaths from the tubercular group of diseases formed 10½ per cent, of the mortality from all causes, and corresponded to a rate of 2.3 per 1000 population. DEVELOPMENTAL DISEASES. Fifty-six infants died because they were prematurely born; 16 others could not live as their lungs never properly expanded; and 11 were so deformed as to render them incapable of living; of these five had deformed, hearts, three deformed spines, one an imperforate anus, another a deformed liver, and a third a deformed brain. One hundred and twelve old people died from natural decay. DISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. Under this head 306 deaths were returned, 10 per cent, of the total mortality; a rate of 2.3 per 1000 population. Acute Inflammatory Diseases of the Brain caused 62 deaths; 167 persons died from Chronic Brain Disease; 79 infants died from Convulsions. The convulsive diseases of infants (a group which, in addition to those just mentioned, includes Hydrocephalus and Dentition), caused 125 deaths, a mortality of 25 per 1000 births, or 16 per cent, of the total infantile deaths from all causes (see Table IV). RESPIRATORY ORGANS. The deaths from this group of diseases, exclusive of Phthisis, were 756, about oneTfourth of the total mortality from all causes, and corresponded to a rate of 5.7 per 1000 population. This 18 mortality, though high, is below that of the last two years. Table H separates this mortality into quarters, and shews the age distribution and also the mean temperature and rainfall for each period of three months. TABLE H. Quarter ending.

This group, which includes Atrophy and Debility, Want of Breast Milk, and Premature Birth, accounts for 205 deaths, a proportion of 26½ per cent, of the total infantile mortality, giving a rate of 41.5 per thousand births. 19 INQUESTS. The Coroner held 28 inquests, 7.7 of the total mortality, or one in every 13.5 deaths, The violont deaths numbered 105, threeand-a-half per cent, of the total deaths ; of these 89 were from accident or negligence; 16 were suicides, of whom three men and ono woman hanged themselves; four took poison, two of them wero men, one taking cyanide of potassium and tho other oxalic acid; tho two women both took carbolic acid. Two men cut their throats; a woman threw herself in front of an advancing train; and an elderly man drowned himsolf whilst in a state of great destitution. All the suicides were, in the opinion of the Coroner's juries, of unsound mind at the time they destroyed themselves. UNCERTIFIED DEATHS, Only two deaths were uncertified, one was a case of Apoplexy, a man aged 41, the other was a prematurely born infant. In respect of uncertified deaths we compare very favourably with the rest of tho Metropolis, as the uncertified mortality of London is about one per thousand deaths; perhaps one reason for this may be that Bethnal Green is the happy hunting ground of the proprietors of fourpenny dispensaries, and it would be strange indeed were many persons to die in this district without some sort of medical attendance; for here the services of registered medical practitioners can bo obtained for the small sum of one shilling per week, medicine included. It is, however, to be regretted that some modical gentlemen are not a little more particular in making out their death certificates, since in nearly seven per cent, of these documents tho causes of death were stated in such an ill-defined manner that it was impossible to classify them, so that 202 deaths had to be placed in the category of ill-defined and not specified causes. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. The number of persons who died in Hospital in Bethnal Green was 556; of these 389 died in the Workhouse (223 males and 156 20 females); 92 in the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, Victoria Park (64 males and 28 females); and 22 in the Mildma Mission Hospital.

The Eighteen Slaughter Houses in the Parish were carefully Inspected; seven of them were in good order, but eleven others were in a more or less unsatisfactory condition. No new licence was applied for; and as our requirements had been complied with every instance, it was not necessary to oppose any of the old nes COW HOUSES. Of these there are in Bethnal Green forty-three—twenty-five of them were in good condition, when visited. It was necessary to serve notices on the remainder, but as all our requirements were satisfied before the licensing day, no opposition was offered to any of the renewals. Mr. William Sykes again applied for a licence to keep cows in fear of 15, Cambridge Circus. This application was refused by the Justices in 1887 by reason of the proximity of the proposed shed to inhabited houses; as no change had taken place in the surroundings of the premises, the licence was again refused. BAKEHOUSES. The Bakehouses, numbering 128, have been regularly inspected. Ten wore temporarily closed; 41 were found to be in a fairly satisfactory condition; 46 shewed defects in cleanliness; 21 others presented still worse defects, and three were in such a filthy condition and so neglected that I decided to summon their owners, more especially as, on referring to past reports, I found that these particular bakers had persistently permitted their premises to get into this condition, and that notices had been frequently served upon them to cleanse and whitewash. The following are the names and addresses:—Henry Charles Vogt, 17, Turin Street; E. R. Jones, 87, Roman Road; Gustav Giss, 109, Roman Road. All were summoned for contravention of the 3rd and 34th Section of 41 Vict. chap. 16. They were taken before Mr. Montagu Williams, at Worship Street. After hearing evidence, 24 the Magistrate decided to adjourn the consideration of all three cases for seven days, in order to allow the owners to put their Bakehouses in proper condition. I re-inspected them on the day fixed for the adjourned hearing, and found that Giss and Yogt had fairly complied with my requirements, but that Jones, though he had limewashed the walls, had not cleansed the woodwork of his Bakehouse, and that this was still in a very filthy condition. The summonses against Giss and Yogt were accordingly withdrawn, but Jones was fined £5. OFFENSIVE TRADES. Numerous letters have been received from persons complaining of offensive smells, dust and noise proceeding from a recently started Flock Mill, situated at the corner of Satchwell's Rents and Satchwell Street, two narrow streets of densely populated cottages. The Mill forms the angle of the two streets; houses run close up to it on two sides, and there is no yard space. The building is in the occupation of Mr. Sanderson, of 146, Shoreditch, who has carried on the business of flock making therein since January, 1888. The premises were formerly used as a saw mill, and the engine, together with its boiler and chimney shaft, was constructed for the purpose of driving the woodworking machinery. I inspected the premises and reported that, as then conducted, the business was a dangerous nuisance. By direction of the Vestry a notice was served by Inspector Weston, to the effect that unless the manufacture was at once stopped an indictment would be presented. On receipt of this notice the factory was closed, and remained so for six weeks. Mr. Sanderson then gave notice that he had made certain alterations and improvements and that he intended to resume work, which he did on the llth of August. I re-inspected the premises and found that very little alteration had been made, and that the nuisance was not abated; moreover, numerous fresh complaints were received from the neighbours. 25 The following is a description of the factory and the process of manufacture:— The building comprises a ground floor and a first floor. The whole of the machinery is on the ground floor. The flocks are manufactured from woollen rags; these are brought from the various marine stores in the district, and consist chiefly of filthy worn-out woollen clothing, much of it saturated with the exhalations of human beings, and alive with vermin. The process of manufacture is as follows:— The rags, taken out of the bales just as they are brought in, are fed by hand into a machine called a "Devil," where a wooden cylinder, covered with small spikes and revolving at great speed, rapidly tears up the material into its component fibres; as fast as it is broken up it is transferred by means of an endless band to the interior of another cylinder, also in rapid revolution, through which a current of air is drawn by means of a powerful fan. After being well winnowed and tossed about in this cylinder the flocks are discharged through an opening at the side, and are ready for use. They are sold to the manufacturers of cheap furniture and bedding. About 25 per cent, of the devilled rags consists of dust and fluffs; the fau extracts this from the flocks, and drives it along a sheet-iron tube into what is called a dust room; this is a chamber in four parts, three of these are underground, and one is at the floor level. Their dimensions are as follows:— 13 x 6 x 5 = 390 cubic feet. 13 x 6 x 5 = 390 7 x 5 x 3 = 105 81 x 7 x 5 = 298 Total capacity, 1183 cubic feet. The heavier portion of the dust is deposited in these chambers, but the finest is discharged through two tubes leading from the top of the fourth division of the dust room. One of these tubes delivers into the ashpit of the boiler furnace, but the other is taken into a smaller chamber on the floor above. The dimensions of this are about 7 X 5 x 6 = 210 cubic feet. The exhaust steam 26 from the engine is admitted to this chamber, and this wets the dust and causes a large portion of it to fall to the bottom, where it forms a pulpy, evil-smelling mass. The remainder of the blast, together with the uncondensed steam, passes out through a sheetiron tube to the open-air. The dust chambers are periodically cleaned out, and the refuse is sold for manure. The factory is small and the space is still further encroached upon by the bales of rags ready for tearing up. The engine is a good deal worn and is very noisy in its working. The machines do not appear to be fixed on very substantial foundations, and vibrate a good deal. Quantities of dust and fluffs escape from the machines whilst they are at work, and much of this is deposited on the walls and woodwork of the factory; but more passes through the open windows and is distributed over the neighbourhood. It is evident that if the rags contain any infectious matter (and it is certain that some, at least, of them must do so) it will be in the form of spores and bacteria, and these would constitute a portion of the fine dust spoken of. I look upon this as a constant source of danger to the neighbourhood, and I am of opinion that all rags before their conversion into flocks should be thoroughly disinfected in a Washington Lyon Apparatus. The Sanitary Committee visited the factory with me on several occasions, and at a meeting held on the 19th of September it was determined to view some other flock factories in various parts of London. Inspector Weston obtained permission from four manufacturers for the Committee to view their premises, and on Wednesday, the 26th, ten Members of the Committee, accompanied by your Medical Officer and the Inspectors, proceeded on a tour of inspection. The following were the factories visited:— Messrs. Bates Bbos., 84, Rodney Road, Walworth. This is a wadding factory, but flocks are also manufactured. The process and machines are similar to those used by Mr. Sanderson, but the situation of the factory is much more open ; the 27 machinery is much more substantially constructed and the dust room is much larger, the waste blast is allowed to escape through an opening1 in the roof. The London Flock Co., 53, Glengall Road, Old Kent Road. The same process is in use here but the dust room is 60 feet long by 30 wide. The waste blast escapes through large apertures in tho sides of the dust room, over which sacking is nailed. This stops the dust, but allows the air to pass. The factory is situated in a large open space. Messrs. E. Lywood & Sons, Marlboro'' Road, Old Kent Road. These are extensive lofty premises, covering about an acre of ground, and standing in a large open space. The buildings were evidently constructed for the purpose to which they are put, and no expense has been spared by the proprietors to prevent any nuisance arising from the business. The rags are first carefully sorted, the worst are cut up by a chopping machine and sold for manure. The better ones are broken up by the devil in the manner previously described, but the dust room in use here is over 100 feet long, and the waste blast is led into the furnace shaft, which is very lofty. The last factory visited was that of Messrs. Thomas & Co., Bishopsgate; hero the rags are broken up on tho ground floor, carried up to the first floor, where the dust is extracted in the usual manner; this is then driven by means of a strong blast up a vertical shaft to the top of the building, which is used as a dust room. This room is about 30 feet square by seven high; the waste blast escapes by some openings covered with sacking. As a result of their inspection, the Sanitary Committee reported that they were of opinion, that:— 1. The business of flock manufacturing should not be carried on in a close neighbourhood, such as that in which the Satchwell Street factory is. 2. If carried on at all, means should bo taken to prevent the dust, generated in the process of breaking up the rags, from passing through the open windows and doors of the factory. 3. The dust room should be, at least, 100 feet in length by 20 in width, and 10 in height. The waste blast from the dust room should be burnt in the furnace. 28 4. The chimney shaft should bo, at least, twice the height of the out at the Satchwell Street factory. This Report was presented to the Vestry, by whom it was considered, and it was resolved that before moving further in the matter it would bo advisable to take the opinion of an expert; accordingly Dr. Thomas Stevenson was asked to inspect the factory and to communicate his opinion to the Vestry. The following is Dr. Stevenson's report:— Chemical Laboratory, Guy's Hospital, London, S.E., November 22nd, 1SS8. FLOCK FACTORY NUISANCE. Sir, On the 19th inst. I visited, without notice, the Flock Factory of Mr. Sanderson, in company with one of the Sanitary Inspectors of Bethnal Green, Mr. Weston. The machinery appeared to be in full working when I visited. I have read the report embodying the opinion of your Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Bate, furnished me by you, and also one by Dr. Septimus Gibbon, sent to me by Mr. Sanderson. The situation of the factory—at the junction of Satchwell’s Rents, and Satchwell Street—and the limited area of the premises (for there is no yard) render the site a most undesirable one; and I have no hesitation in stating that, in my opinion, the factory is unfitted for the purpose, causes nuisance, and entails danger to the public health. It is evident that endeavours have recently been made to obviate nuisance; but with only a measure of success. The report which you sent to me sufficiently explains the process of manufacture. Briefly, filthy woollen rags are received in bags from the marine store dealers, and without any cleansing or disinfecting process are fed by hand, to the extent of 15 cwt. a day, into a machine technically known as a "devil," and by this arc torn into shreds. Much flutt and dust are driven out during this rending process, and a cloud of fine dust rises through the crevices in the machine and is disseminated through the atmosphere, and thence through the open door and windows into the outside air, and must be carried into the houses situated in close proximity, in Satchwell’s Rents, Orange Street, and Satchwell Street. This dust, I find, is of a highly complex character, containing fine broken fragments of woollen and cotton, starch, animal cells, mineral matter, and spores of vegetable organisms. The dirty fluffy roof of the entry testifies to the escape of this dust. From the devil the torn rags pass into a second machine, which by means of a fan extracts the fluff, dust, and lighter particles which form a considerable percentage of the torn up material. The flocks fall out of the side of this machine and are placed in bags for removal. The lighter portion—fluff and dust—is driven by the blast from the fan along a tube into successive chambers of the aggregate capacity of nearly 1,200 cubic feet, divided into compartments. Means are taken to divide and slacken the current of air entering these chambers, so as to allow the heavier particles of fluff and dust to settle out of the 29 air. From the winnowed flocks the finer suspended dust is conveyed by a pipe which opens immediately below the furnace bars of the boiler furnace. The organic and noxious dust passing this tube is thereby destroyed by combustion. Another pipe or tube from the settling chambers passes into the chimney shaft beyond the furnace lire, and the dust is of necessity carried up the chimney shaft and discharged into the open air. This is objectionable; the whole of the residual air from the settling chambers ought to pass through the furnace fire, so as to ensure destruction of its combustible ingredients. The fluffy dust deposited in the settling chambers is periodically removed to the extent of several hundred weight a day, packed in bags and used as manure. It is an indescribable mass of debris—woollen fibres, cotton fibres, other vegetable fibres, sand and earth, spores, ova of insects, and animal cells. Fleas abound on the premises. The processes carried on are defective in consequence of the inadequate size of the settling chambers. These ought to be much more capacious so as to secure more efficient subsidence of the dust and fluff; but the limited space available on the premises would appear to preclude the provision of chambers of adequate size. Screens of sacking should be employed to detain fine dust. Besides the injurious nuisance arising from escape of filthy dust, which is likely to contain from time to time the germs of contagious diseases, and so disseminate disease in the neighbourhood, there is an additional danger to public health in the dissemination of disease by means of flocks sent to furniture dealers. The use of flock beds made from filthy, and perhaps specifically infected, rags is an undoubted source of danger to the public. To summarise:— 1. The factory in question is so situated as to expose the neighbourhood to nuisance and danger to health by the dissemination of filthy dust through the t air. 2. The space is too limited to admit of the construction of settling chambers of adequate size. 3. The whole of the dust is not passed through the fire, so as to ensure destruction of its deleterious components. 4. No disinfecting process is applied to the rags and flocks: but this is a customary defect in the manufacture of low-class flocks. 5. The best available means of obviating nuisance are not used, and the limited space at command prevents the adoption of means which would be easily available were the factory more favourably situated, and of adequate size and area.

Examiner in Public Health to the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, Vice-President of the Society of Medical Officers of Health. To Robert Voss, Esq., Vestry Clerk, Bethnal Green. 30 These reports were under consideration when Mr. Sanderson again made some alterations in the working of his factory, which, though not satisfactory, had the effect of abating the nuisance to some extent so far as the adjoining houses were concerned, and we got no more complaints; but so much dust seemed to be generated inside the factory itself that I communicated with Mr. Lakeman, H.M. Inspector of Factories for this district. That gentleman's opinion is, that "Sanderson's means for carrying off the dust and impurities are not sufficient; his plant is also defective, the place is totally unfit for the work, and the locality suffers through the dissemination of noxious particles." Pending Mr. Lakeman’s action the matter rests for the present so far as we are concerned, but I recently visited the premises and found no improvement. THE ARTIZANS' AND LABOURERS’ DWELLINGS ACTS, 1868. The following is a list of premises reported to tho vestry under this Act:— 1.

Monkfort, Court, Three Colt Lane;—Four small two-roomed cottages, consisting of a ground floor only; tho brickwork is old, decayed and damp, the woodwork rotten, and the floor boards are laid on tho earth. These repoits were from time to time handed to Mr. Yoss, laid before the Yestry, and subsequently referred to the Surveyor, who in turn reported upon the premises to the Yestry ; for a detailed account of the action taken I beg to refer to the report of my colleague, Mr. Barratt. The first report presented referred to Martha Court, the Surveyor and I had some correspondence over the form of that report, and as the question raised by him is of interest, I give copies of Mr. Barratt's letter and of my reply. Dear Dr. Bate, Gth February, 188S. I have been considering your reports on "Houses unfit for human habitation," and before examining the properties and preparing my report on 32 the subject, should like to clear up one or two points. I see that I am required to state "The cause of the evil reported on, and tho remedy thereof." Now, in the report relating to Martha Court the principal points seem to be : (a) That the flooring of the lower rooms is from eight to twelve inches below the level of the forecourts ; (b) That houses constructed back to back cannot be properly ventilated; (c) That there are two W.C.'s only for eight houses. I should be glad of information on the following points, viz. : — (a) Are the houses unfit for habitation because the floors are below the level, &c. ? (b) Are they unfit for habitation because they are back to back ? If so, the only remedy would be to pull down half of them. (c) How many houses of this character in your opinion should one W.C. serve ? I am sorry to trouble you, but if you can instruct me on these points it will much facilitate the preparation of my report, which I should like to get before tho next Vestry, if possible. I am, dear Dr. Hate, Yours faithfully, F. W. BARRATT. The following is my reply:— February 13 th, 1888. Dear Mr. Barratt, I have carefully considered your letter, and also the four conditions which as you say contribute to the insanitary condition of Martha Court. You ask me which of these conditions causes the houses to be in my opinion unfit for human habitation. Now, I object to bind myself to any one of these four items, and say that the houses in question are unhealthy because all the four conditions you name obtain at one and the same time on these premises, and that this insanitary total is the "evil complained of," and not the separate items. I have looked well into tho Act of 1868, and I am sure that section five provides for a health report only. It would be plainly unreasonable to require a Medical Officer of Health to specify works to be done of which a Surveyor is the only competent judge; and I consider that I should have acted up to what is sought for if, in the certificate read at the last meeting of the Vestry, I had said, "That from the number of deaths and cases of disease in the houses ABC and D, and from their general insanitary surroundings" (without specifying them), "I report that they are in a condition dangerous to health, so as to bo unfit for human habitation." The Act nowhere requires me to state reasons, but merely to follow the wording of the fifth section. This is not so when we come to the instructions to the Surveyor, who is required under the sixth section to report on the cause of the evil referred to in the report of the Sanitary Officer. This may mean the cause of the fever, low state of health of the inhabitants, or what not: the Surveyor may find the cause to be deficient fall of the drainage, that there is no adequate provision for ventilation, or a hundred other things. Next he is to specify the remedy; the 33 whole responsibility here rests, from my point of view, upon the Surveyor as to the particular action to be taken. I give a medical report that the health results from certain houses are unsatisfactory; you have to accept my opinion, which is not subject to appeal or revision in any way, and from the conclusions of the report you have to work back in an inspection of the premises to find out what (if anything) justifies my report: having found that out. you have to prescribe the remedy, with a view to the owner disputing your conclusions, but not mine. The object of the two reports is, in my opinion, wholly distinct and different. The Health Officer merely points out an evil; the Surveyor reports on the means of removing it. To give an extreme case, we will assume that the Medical Officer says certain premises are unfit for habitation by reason of perpetual outbreaks of Typhus Fever, the Surveyor then inspects the buildings and says that structurally they are perfect, but that the fever is produced by overcrowding. The nature of the remedy is at once obviously pointed out. The fact that the Medical Officer of Health should have discovered this for himself, and have taken action under a different statute, does not in any way affect the Surveyor's duty, which is quite definitely laid down. To recapitulate, it would be most unreasonable to require the Health Officer to be an expert in building, or to limit the Surveyor to the consideration of causes that the Health Officer may have stated in his report. I feel sure the Surveyor's report is intended to be altogether independent of that of the Health Officer, and certainly not a report upon it; but dealing with the Health Officer's conclusions, though not accepting his reasons, which he has full power to disregard, or, if he thinks fit, to take as a guide in his independent investigation. I have gone thus fully into the matter as I think of making a special point of the true reading of the Act in my forthcoming report. I look upon the intentions of this Act of Parliament as almost perfect, though whether the machinery by which these intentions are carried out is equally perfect I leave to the lawyers to decide. I am, dear Mr. Barratt, Very faithfully yours, F. W. Barratt, ESQ., GEORGE PADDOCK BATE. Surveyor to the Parish of St. Matthew, Betlival Green.

District No. 1. (Mr. Weston). 105 74 31 District No. 2. (Mr. Lapworth). 327 172 155 Total 432 246 186 By order of the Sanitary Committee 432 summonses were taken but under the Nuisances Removal Acts during the year, and many Afternoons have been spent (I had almost written wasted) by your officers in Worship Street Police Court. Two hundred and fortysix of the summonses were withdrawn, as the necessary work was Completed and the nuisance abated before the day fixed for the hearing; 186 cases were heard and adjudicated upon by the sitting Magistrate, who, in every instance, made an order for the Work to be completed within a fixed period and gave costs against he defendant. Your Medical Officer and one of the Inspectors gave evidence in each of these cases, many of which were adjourned once and sometimes even twice owing to pressure of business at he Court. Now that the London County Council has relieved the Justices of much of their work, perhaps some of these gentlemen may feel aclined to sit in Petty Sessions at the vestry Halls of the various arishes to hear and adjudicate upon sanitary and other similar cases. By this method of procedure the time of hard-worked officers would be economised and the congestion of the Metropolitan police Courts materially relieved.

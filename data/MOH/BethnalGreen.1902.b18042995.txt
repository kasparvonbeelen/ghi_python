To the Chairman and Gentlemen of the Public Health and Housing Committee of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, I respectfully beg to submit my Seventh Annual Report of the work and proceedings carried out in your department for the year ending December 31st, 1902. As regards the total number of inspections "Work of the made, it is practically impossible to make any District comparison of this past twelve months with Inspectors (5). any other previous year, in consequence of the outbreak of Small Pox, which commenced towards the latter part of 1901, and continued more or less spasmodically until October, 1902. Although the total number of cases only amounted to 511, it is apparent that arising out of them the number of enquiries to be made and "contacts" to be kept uDder observation were so numerous that the ordinary routine 4 house-to-house work is of necessity much less than in any previous year. The actual figures for the primary inspections are:— Infectious Cases 2,253 Complaints 1,988 House-to-House Inspections 1,447 Trades Inspections 174 Ee-inspection of Cases in Hand, Supervision of Eepairs, etc 20,852 Making a Total of 26,714 primary visits made by the five District Inspectors. Deducting the re-inspections, this gives the total of primary inspections as 5,862, and taking the balance of 20,852 re-inspections, we find that every case coming to the office has taken about 3.6 visits for its completion. The nuisances abated amounted to 3,607. The number of cases in band at the end of the year were 508, or not quite 102 per District Inspector. To ensure the abatement of the nuisances found Notices Served existing by the above visits, there were served : and 2,767 Intimation Notices uuder Section 3, 1,576 Proceedings Statutory Notices, and 535 Final Notices.

Summons dismissed as the vendor proved that the milk was sent in an adulterated condition by the country farmers, who were subsequently summoned and fined £20, and £5 5s. costs. W. & Co., milk containing 17 per cent. of added water. The same as above. P. Bros., milk containing 7 per cent. of added water. No penalty, it having been proved that the milk was sent in an adulterated state by the farmer from the country. Farmer's milk subsequently sampled and found correct. Dairies, The provisions of this order with respect to Cowsheds, and dairies and milkshops is being most rigidly Mii.kshofs enforced by Inspector Bare, and in view of the Order. fact that numbers of Jew immigrants with most crude ideas as to the keeping clean of milkshops and vessels are becoming the "dairymen" of the Borough, it is 25 most essential that almost constant and repeated inspection of the shops shall be continued. The visits made by Inspector Bare were as under: — The number of cowsheds on the register for the year were 19, and to these 39 visits were made. The retail milkshops were 344, and to these 1,248 visits were made. It may, I think, be safely added that these shops have never been so closely looked after at any time previously. It is quite certain many of them require it. As mentioned higher up two persons were prosecuted and fined and several others cautioned in respect of the uncleanly condition of their premises or vessels. Factory and The work commenced last year under this Act Workshops has been continued with most satisfactory reAet. suits. The number of factories and shops visited were 178, and the number of outworkers' houses inspected were 603. Particulars of outworkers sent to other authorities, 117.

Urinal Flusher, 30s. per week. Mortuary Keeper, 24s. per week, also caretaker at Coroner's Court, with residence. Note.—The weekly staff, from general assistant, are entitled to the Council's sick fund allowance during illness, and to one Aveek's annual holiday. Drain-layers and Labourers.—Numbers vary according to amount of work in hand, engaged at per hour—drain-layers, lOd.; labourers, 7d. N.B.—The staif of inspectors will, when complete, number ten, and may be considered sufficient until further legislation places new duties upon Public Health authorities. The changes or rearrangements made since the last report are:—Inspector Jones to New Buildings, etc., vice Grice, resigned. Inspector Bare to Cowsheds, etc., vice Jones. Inspector Ainley from district E to C, vice Weston retired, and the newly-appointed Inspector Weeks to district E, leaving, of couise, one additional officer to be appointed. 36 To prevent any misunderstanding I should like to add, my reason for moving Mr. Ainley was because district C requires persistent and systematic working. From the entirely satisfactory manner in which he has hitherto performed the duties entrusted to him I have every confidence that he will effect considerable improvement in this part of the Borough where it is most needed. As stated above, now that certain sources of friction and unsettlement have been removed, I trust that all members of the staff will proceed to further efforts, and endeavour to place the work of the Department on the highest possible level. The younger members, Messrs. Rowsell, Bare, and Jones, have begun well in their respective positions, and I trust they, as well as their more senior colleagues, will persevere in the good work. In conclusion, I desire to thank the Committee for the great assistance they have given me during the past year. The kindness and confidence shown by the Members have been a constant source of help and encouragement. I am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, JOHN FOOT, Chief Inspector, Member Royal Institute of Public Health.

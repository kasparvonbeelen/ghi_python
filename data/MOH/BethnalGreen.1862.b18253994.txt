BET 77 YEAR 1862. EIGHTH REPORT on the HEALTH of BETHAL GREEN by SAMUEL PEARCE, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY, by J. s. Forsaith, 118, Bethnal Green Road, N. E. 1863. YEAR 1862. EIGHTH REPO R T on the HEALTH of BETHNAL GREEN by SAMUEL PEARCE, Medical Officer of Health. LONDON : PRINTED BY ORDER OF VESTRY, by J. S. Forsaith, 118, Bethnal Green Road, N.E. 1863. THIS REPORT on THE HEALTH OF BETHNAL GREEN DURING 1862, IS DEDICATED with profound respect and esteem to F. H. RAMSBOTHAM, ESQ., obstetric physician to the london hospital; TO WHOSE friendly bearing, invaluable lectures, and extraordinary work on "the principles of obstetric medicine and surgery," THE AUTHOR owes great and life-long regard. 135, Bethnal Green Road, June 20th, 1863. Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, Last year was, in point of health, unpropitious to Bethnal Green. The Pauper Illness and Mortality both increased; the one from a fatality of 2225 in 1861 to 2537 in 1862, the other from 8442 New Cases of Disease to 8871. In the first quarter, during which the "temperature of the air was for a few days together cold and then for a few days together warm, the degree of salubrity "exceeded the ratio of the preceding year. The Epidemic Deaths also decreased. Co-temporaneously the mortality of London was less, but the epidemic mortality more. The mean temperature (53.3°) of April, May, and June, slightly surpassed "the average of the same period in 21 years." Sixty more deaths than in the like three months of 1861, and an addition of 14 from Epidemics occurred in Bethnal Green; while correspondingly a surplus of 457 and 630 happened in London. "The cold summer was less healthy than the still colder summer of 1860 it was also less healthy "than the warmer summer of last year." Our fatality in that time was higher by 143, that of London by 201. During the last quarter the deaths of the two increased respectively 174 and 1851. In two of the weeks "the mean temperature fell nearly as low as 37°. The mortality was high chiefly in consequence of the sudden and premature invasion of winter soon after November had commenced," for "a cold winter makes many funerals; it cuts off quickly the old and infirm." The minimum mortality (29) of any one week in Bethnal Green was recorded 4 on May 17th, the maximum mortality (74) on November 22nd. Seven of our inhabitants died every day, 49 every week, and 211 in each month of the year. Numerically the Males amounted to 1262 and the Females to 1275. One out of every 149 deaths was "Not Certified," and to one out of every 158 "No Medical Attendant" was called. The deathrolls monthly and yearly of London and Bethnal Green, with the Epidemic contingencies and the meteorological characteristics, as observed at Greenwich, constitute the first Table in the Appendix of this Report. If our population in 1862 be estimated on a tenth of the rate from 1851 to 1861, it consisted in April of 106,592 persons; of whom 26,537 occupied the 141 acres of Hackney Road; 32,612 the 391 acres of the Green; 25,902 the 132 acres of the Church; and 21,541 the 96 acres of the Town. Divisionally, under five years of age, the numbers amounted to 15,702; between five and ten, to 13,320; between ten and twenty, to 21,273; between twenty and forty, to 32,863; between forty and sixty, to 17,548; between sixty and eighty, to 5,499; between eighty and a hundred, to 386; and beyond one hundred years, to 1. They each and all bear the same ratio to the living as at the Census of 1851. Besides the still-born, 4052 living Children, or 2057 Boys and 1995 Girls were registered in the Parish in the year. They are 27 less than in 1861. The Births exceeded the Deaths by, and formed a natural increase of 1515. Of these, 1122 occurred in the "Winter, 982 in the Spring, 951 in the Summer, and 997 in the Autumn. They give a proportion of 103 Boys to 100 Girls, and of a Birth to the living in every 26. Throughout London the proportion was 1 in 29. Where 100 died 160 came into life, and to each 1000 of these the infantile loss was 323. The Table below represents our last published Illegitimate list. 5 Illegitimate Sub-District Births. Males. Females. Total. Hackney Eoad 6 10 16 Green 3 34 67 Church 9 6 15 Town 11 7 18 59 57 116 The above apportions us only 28 Births out of wedlock in every 1000; while, "in all England the proportion of Illegitimate Births amounts to about 65 per 1000 of all the Births; in the City it reaches to only 30 per 1000." Of the "Newly Born," so often found in our Canal and Park, some no doubt are born elsewhere;—these will therefore exonerate us from some of the crimes that are hidden there. Bethnal Green, in 1862, attained the unenviable mortality of 2537; a mortality lower indeed by 409 than in the Cholera year 1849, but higher by 100 than when Cholera prevailed in 1854. It figured also 38 higher than its average for the last ten years. One death afflicted every 42 of the inhabitants of Bethnal Green, every 42.57 in London, every 38 78 in the Central Districts of the Metropolis, and every 38.58 in the East Districts in which we live. The Causes of Death in the Obituary Table (No. 2) show, when compared with the totals of 1861, that we owe our high rate of death to the increased fatality of the Zymotic and Tubercular Classes of Disease. The first of these, which contains the Epidemics, enumerates a loss of 783. As the epidemic frequency is "a most important testimony to the salubrity or insalubrity of a district," I cannot but regret that it told strongly against us last year. Small Pox was fatal in 16 cases, or to 12 infants under five, to 1 at sixteen, and to 3 at twenty-one, twenty-six, and 6 thirty years. Latterly Small Pox has been frightfully on the increase. Its "natural history in unprotected communities is, that of every 100 persons attacked 35 die." But " this is not the extent of the evil. Blindness is very frequently the result of Small Pox. Then there is the disfigurement by scars, the destruction—the total destruction in many cases—of the good looks of the patient; and lastly, the general health is frequently profoundly shattered by a bad attack of Small Pox." To prevent such destruction there is but one prophylaxis—the god-like discovery of Dr. Jenner ! It has however been noticed, that in "some vaccinated persons the insusceptibility conferred by cow pox is not of life-long duration," but "that the renascent liability to Small Pox may be guarded against by re-vaccination." Thus, in the Small Pox Hospital, "during the last twenty-seven years, not one instance has been known of a nurse or attendant contracting Small Pox, for all have been vaccinated or revaccinated immediately on their entering the Institution." What mischief from Small Pox is propagated by cabs the the following fatal case incontestably proves:—" A cabman drove a physician to a house where a patient had been suffering from Small Pox. On arrival the patient was dead and the blinds were drawn down, and when the physician returned to the cab, the driver enquired if a death had occurred in the house, and what was the cause ? The circumstances having been explained, the conscientious cabman stated, that two or three weeks before he had driven a lady to the door in question immediately after having taken a patient to the Small Pox Hospital. The lady turned out to be the patient now dead, and the period between her occupation of the infected cab and the commencement of her illness corresponded to the ordinary latent period of the disease." 7 167 against 17 in 1861 fell victims to Measles, of whom 162 had not reached the age of five. Scarlatina, the ruling epidemic, (with Diptheria) cut off 192, an amount more than double its onslaught in the year before. In one house in Bethnal Green Road 5 children of the ages of fifteen months, of two, five, eight, and eleven years were swept away. These cases are recorded in the Registrar's return as "aggravated by the fetid exhalations of an adjoining Sausage Factory." "Occasionally Scarlatina is more fatal even than Typhus, and approaches nearer to the nature of plague than any other disease." Such pestilences not only "spread by contagion, but from time to time arise up here and there de novo, out of the malaria, or the defective drainage, or the want of ventilation." Whooping Cough, unlike its predecessors, fell from 151 in 1861 to 88 in 1862. Diarrhoea too was less prevalent than usual, and declined from 90 deaths to 71. By Fever our loss was heavy and severe, for in the two periods its deaths augmented from 65 to 156. Severally, and in the order of rotation, Small Pox caused 1 in 158 deaths, Measles 1 in 15, Scarlatina and Diptheria 1 in 13, Whooping Congh 1 in 29, Diarrhoea 1 in 36, and Typhus 1 in 16. On the other hand, out of every 10,000 of the population, Small Pox cut off 1.5 of the number, Measles 15.6, Scarlatina and Diptheria 18, Whooping Cough 8, Diarrhoea 6.6, and Typhus 14.6. In London, however, Small Pox numbered a death out of each 194, Measles out of each 29, Scarlatina and Diptheria out of each 16, Whooping Cough out of each 31, Diarrhoea out of each 38, and Typhus out of each 18. So likewise to every myriad of London, Small Pox was fatal to 1.2, Measles to 7.9, Scarlatina and Diptheria to 14.6, Whooping Cough to 7.5, Diarrhoea to 6.6, and Typhus to 12.7. 8 By the entire Epidemic Group 486 of our children died under the age of five; 108 of our young persons from five to twenty years; 35 of our adults between twenty and forty; 31 others between forty and sixty; 28 between sixty and eighty; and two more after their eightieth year. Next in succession follow 65 deaths from causes in the second class; among which 19 are ascribed to Cancer and Mortification, 12 to Haemorrhage, or "the effusion of blood," and 23 to Dropsy, or "the effusion of serum." Out of the 442 "Constitutional or Specific Diseases" of Class 3,—14 individuals sank from Scrofula, 140 from Mesenteric Disease, 34 from Water on the Brain, and 254 from Consumption. At different periods Consumption was fatal to 56 in the first twenty years, of whom 20 did not reach the age of five; to 132 in the second vicenniad, to 55 in the third, and to 11 in the fourth. In our social position, Consumption cost the Gentry 1 death in 6, the Tradesmen 1 in 10, and the Artizans 1 in 10 too. Its ratio with us was 1 out of every 9.9 deaths, its ratio in London 1 in 8 6. From our population there was 1 in 419 persons, and from that of London 1 in 369 persons taken away Pure Air, and plenty of it, is the grand prophylactic of this destructive disease. Without it, like the monkeys of old in the unventilated rooms of the Zoological Gardens, we "rot and rot, and drop and drop." By Affections of the 4th Class, the first of "the eight principal Organic Systems," 244 persons closed their earthly account. Convulsions hurried away 88, Apoplexy 32, and Paralysis 55. 115 had not completed their fifth year, and 7 only had passed fourscore. Aneurism and Diseases of the Heart cut short 60 lives. During the last five years their average has been 58. From Pulmonary Diseases there perished 421, or one among us out of every 253. They form a sixth of all who 9 died in 1862. I here append, as I have done before, the returns, month by month, of our mortal enemies—the Epidemics, Consumption, and Diseases of the Lungs:— Diseases. January February March April May June July August September October November December Small Pox 2 1 2 .. 1 .. .. 1 1 2 1 5 Measles .. .. 2 4 6 8 21 34 28 39 21 4 Scarlatina 7 11 11 12 3 7 11 26 24 31 31 18 Whooping Cough 12 12 6 5 9 6 2 8 3 8 8 9 Diarrhœa 2 2 .. 1 1 2 6 24 20 8 3 2 Typhus 10 7 15 4 16 15 13 14 17 19 15 11 Consumption 33 15 15 23 25 21 23 17 17 30 11 24 Organs of Respiration 52 32 41 39 37 27 14 29 26 22 60 42 Totals 118 80 92 88 98 86 90 153 136 159 150 115 Their total amount is 1365, and they killed 1 out of every 78 of the population of Bethnal Green. Teething, which forms one of the Causes of Death in the Class of "Stomach and Digestive Organs," carried off 61 Infants; Quinsey, Gastric Inflammation, Rupture, and Jaundice destroyed 8 more; 10 persons succumbed to Diseases of the Stomach, 27 to Affections of the Liver, and 13 to those of the Intestinal Canal. In the Classes 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, which comprehend the Diseases of the Kidneys, Childbirth, Joints, Bones, Skin, Cellular Tissue, and Malformation, there died respectively 18 in No. 8; 14 in No. 9; 14 in No. 10; 3 in No. 11; and 5 in No. 12. One death therein—that of our late Inspector, Mr. Cornwell—from Carbuncle, has occasioned much and very sincere regret. He was ever faithful in the path of duty, and conscientious in all he did. Though he suffered much, he died full of hope, and his last words were—"All is Pcace." b 10 Under "Premature Birth and Debility" our loss was 59; three of whom wore out between forty and sixty years, of premature decay. The mortality in the next two groups includes 11 from "Atrophy" and 119 from "Old Age." In the latter class 4 perished untimely under sixty years. Lastly, Classes 16 and 17 register 96 "Sudden" and 53 "Violent Deaths;" the former from Natural Causes, from Epidemics, Spasm of the Glottis and Diseases of the Brain, Heart and Lungs; the latter from Intemperance, from Privation of food, Burns, Suffocation, and various violent and suicidal means. In 1862, 154 Inquests were held in Bethnal Green; 88, or 38 Adults and 50 Boys belonged to the Male, and 66, or 34 Adults and 32 Girls to the Female sex. The verdicts separately and collectively have been thus returned:—1 by a "Shock from falling down a Sewer;" 1 by a "Shock from Burns;" 1 by "Effusion of Serum on the Brain;" 1 by "Suffocation from food getting into the air passages whilst coughing;" 1 by "Congestion of Brain from excessive drinking;" 1 by "An Irritant Poison, how taken not known;" 1 by "Self-Suffocation;" 1 by "Self-Cut-Throat;" 1 "Knocked down by a horse and cart;" 1 "Run over by a railway van 2 by "Accidental Drowning;" 4 by "Concussion and Inflammation of Brain from a fall;" 4 by "Wilful Murder;" 4 by "Self-Drowning;" 7 by "Strangulation by Hanging;" 11 "Found Dying or Dead;" 16 by "Suffocation;" and 96 by "Sudden Deaths." Fourteen individuals, or 1 out of every 7614 committed Suicide in the year. The positions and ages of these SelfDestroyers are annexed below. The wife of a Clerk ended her days at 26, a Hawker at 28, the wife of a Porter at 29, the widow of a Bricklayer at 35, a Male unknown at 40, a 11 Weaver at 41, a Male unknown at 45, another Weaver at 48, a third Weaver at 52, a fourth at 62, the wife of a Butcher at 62, a Sawyer at 64, an Undertaker at 64, and a Chair Carver at 67. The wife of the Clerk cut her throat and murdered her child, the Hawker and the wife of the Porter poisoned and suffocatcd themselves, the Sawyer, one Weaver and two Males unknown precipitated themselves into a watery grave; the wife of the Butcher, the widow of the Bricklayer, the Undertaker, three of the Weavers, and the Chair Carver resorted to Self-Strangulation. The sum of the ages of the 2537 persons who died in 1862 amounted to 56,164 years. The latter, when divided by the deaths, give a mean age of 22.13, which, with two-thirds of its difference on the number living to each death, make the mean lifetime 35.37.* The first places us under a decrease of .52 and the second of 2.94 years on the average of the preceding five. Throughout England " the mean age at death is 25.18 years, and the mean lifetime 41." Relatively, the mean age of the Gentry—who consist principally of persons who have retired late in life—was 48.07 years, the mean of the Tradesmen 23.56, and of the Artisans 21.08. After the age of twenty, the mean of the thousand dying reached only 51.8l, that is 8.19 years less than the English rate of Adults. * One Death in 42.00 Living. Mean 22.13 Age. 19.87 2 3)39.74 13.24 22.13 35.37 12 With respect to the fatality at certain ages, "The young, like leaves in Spring, were blown away ;" For 220 perished under three months, 117 from three to six months, 207 from six to twelve months, and 767 from one year to five; making together the appalling number of 1311, and forming 516 out of every 1000 deaths. If, again, we take the population under five, 83.4 of each 1000 living never reached that age. In all England the proportions are—"398 per 1000 of the deaths, and 73 6 per 1000 of the living." "Infancy has to creep into life in the midst of foes, in impoverished or poisoned air, or in rooms unfit for habitation, and where it is thus cribbed, cabined, and confined, hecatombs of young lives are lost, and the human blossom most surely falls unexpanded." To home influences we must therefore look to raise the vitality of infant life. In the next five years and onwards through the succeeding ten, 138 more children and 86 other young persons died. Consequently, under the age of twenty 1535 of our numbers living, or a percentage exceeding 60, yielded to remorseless Death. During the following twenty years, 297 left this busy scene and departed each to an early grave. Through the third and fourth vicenniads, 308 and 335 besides, having played their parts, journied hence to the land unknown. Finally, with 62 between eighty and a hundred years, "the weary wheel of life at length stood still." Among "the ancient of days," 152 had passed three score and ten, 52 over four score, and 9 beyond four score and ten. One nearly completed the cycle of one hundred years and died beyond ninety-nine. "The number living and the number dying at given intervals," are fully exhibited in Table 7. There, of each number 13 living, 83 per 1000 died below five years, 10 between five and ten, 4 in the next ten, 9 in the following twenty, 11 between forty and sixty, 61 between sixty and eighty, and 161 between eighty and a hundred years. The fatality therein is smaller to infants than in 1857, and less to the old than in 1857—58. Respectively in the Sub-Districts, the Births and Deaths affected each population thus:—In the Hackney Road there was a Birth to each 26, in the Green to each 27, in the Church to each 28, and in the Town to each 24. Correspondingly, in Sub-District 1, there was a death to every 45; in Sub-District 2, to every 33; in Sub-District 3, to every 51; and to Sub-District 4, to every 48, So likewise under the age of five, out of every 73, 81, 91 and 76 inhabitants, each in rotation lost a child. In regard to longevity, 16 60 years constituted the mean age in the Hackney Road, 28.83 years in the Green, 20.08 years in the Church, and 17.06 years in the Town; while of adults the lifetime was 50.56 in the first Sub-Division, 53.46 in the second 52.14, in the third, and 47.29 years in the fourth. Consumption caused to each in succession 1 out of every 11, 8, 14 and 19 deaths; Fever 1 out of 14,20,13 and 19; and the Epidemic Diseases 1 out of 3, 4, 3 and 4. More Males by 17 died in the Hackney Road, more Females by 13 in the Green, more Males by 6 in the Church, and more Females by 15 in the Town. Of 130 Adult Weavers, Male and Female, 38 passed over seventy, and 15 over eighty years; they lived to a mean length of 61.78, or nearly ten years longer than the average generally of the dying adults. Six of them resided in the Hackney Road, 58 in the Green, 43 in the Church, and 23 in the Town. Consumption destroyed 14, and the Epidemics 10; 5 went off suddenly, and 1 was "found dead from exhaustion." Four, or 1 in 33, committed Suicide, whereas 14 1 only out of 181 adults dying in 1862 sacrificed thus insanrly every earthly tie. As "the tendency to suicide is least among persons who carry on occupations out of doors, and greatest among artisans who are weakly from birth, are confined in-doors, or have little muscular exercise," the solution probably may depend thereon. Among the Male Adults living above twenty years, we lost 1 in 2 of the Relieving Officers, 1 in 3 of the Officers of the Local Board, 1 in 8 of the Solicitors, 1 in 41 of the Surgeons, 1 in 8 of the Merchants, 1 in 19 of the Clerks, 1 in 24 of the Hawkers, 1 in 29 of the Porters, 1 in 41 of the Cowkeepers, 1 in 137 of the Butchers, 1 in 121 of the Bakers, 1 in 71 of the Carpenters, 1 in 61 of the Cabinetmakers, 1 in 17 of the Labourers, 1 in 65 of the Weavers, 1 in 15 of the House Proprietors, 1 in 16 of the Gentlemen, and 1 in 15 of the Annuitants. 86 of the 463 described in Table 9, belonged to the Hackney Road, 229 to the Green, 84 to the Church, and 64 to the Town. The Mortality Statistics of our several Institutions, Public and Private, show that 9 of the residents died in the Trinity Ground, 18 in the Model Lodgings of Columbia Square, 27 in the City of London Hospital, 36 in Bethnal House Asylum, and 237 in the Refuge for the helpless and destitute Poor. In the latter noble Institution the death-roll comprised 127 of the male and 110 of the female sex. Directly or indirectly by descent, the deceased consisted of 1 Merchant, 1 Silversmith 1 Engineer, 1 Painter, 1 Dyer, 1 Mason, 1 Wheelwright, 1 Currier, 1 Wax-maker, 1 Bookbinder, 1 Bricklayer, 1 Sawyer, 1 Wood Chopper, 1 Chair Maker, 1 French Polisher, 1 Cabinet-maker, 1 Gas Fitter, 1 Smith, 1 Shirt Cutter, 1 General Dealer, 1 Sweep, 1 Ostler, 1 Brush Drawer, 1 Dress-maker, 1 Bonnet-maker, 1 Washerwoman, 1 15 brella-maker, 1 Potman, 2 Tailors, 2 Box-makers, 2 Blacksmiths, 2 Harness-makers, 2 Porters, 2 Pipe-makers, 2 Watch-makers, 3 Clerks, 3 Turners, 4 Charwomen, 5 Winders, 5 Hawkers, 7 Boot and Shoe Binders, 9 Washers, 9 Seamstresses, 9 Unknown, 13 Shoe-makers, 29 Labourers, 47 Weavers, and 52 Servants. The fatality of each class of diseases was 16.8 per cent. of the Zymotic, 1.6 of Dropsy, 21.1 of the Tubercular, 12.6 of the Brain, 2.5 of the Heart, 14"3 of the Lungs, 2.1 of the Digestive Organs, 1.2 of the Violent and Sudden, 23.6 of Old Age, and 3.7 of other forms. The ratio of deaths to the five vicenniads of life was that 52 succumbed in the first, 32 in the second, 52 in the third, 85 in the fourth, and 16 in the fifth. At Christmas ult. "the Vital forces" included 14 Boys and 38 Girls under two years of age, 81 Boys and 58 Girls from two to nine years, and 62 Boys and 41 Girls from nine to sixteen years. After the age of sixteen the grown-up numbered 52 AbieBodied Men and Women, 368 Temporarily Disabled, and 521 Old Men and Women;—making together a grand total of 1235. Besides the Sick—206 Men and 253 Women—there were 24 Insane Men and 28 Insane Women in the House, while there were in addition 111 Boys and 87 Girls under Instruction in the Schools, and 24 Boys in training for different trades. Certain localities, with affinities somewhat alike, differed materially in their death returns. Thus, 10 died in Half Nichol Street, 11 in New Nichol Street, and 21 in Old Nichol Street. The depopulating rate stood high also in other parts. In Lisbon Street there was a mortality of 11, in Scott Street of 11, in Turville Street of 15, in Thomas Street of 19, and in Old Castle Street of 23. Then, too, every 100 living, lost 16 above 3 in Providence Place, above 4 in Miring, Ely, and Accidental Places, above 4 in Shepherd's Court and Prospect Terrace, above 5 in Fief's Court, and above 7 in Sweet Apple Square. The Health of the In and Out-door Poor in 1862 suffered much more than in 1861. Small Pox, Whooping Cough, and Diarrhœa numbered 10, 59, and 176 cases less, while Measles rose from 33 to 544, Scarlatina from 148 to 220, and Fever* from 581 to 935. Cholera increased from 1 to 4, and Diarrhoea assumed occasionally a Choleraic form. Acute Pulmonary Affections fell from 1122 to 957; Bronchitis and Pleuritis prevailing less but Pneumonia somewhat more. Rheumatic Fever declined 10, Ague and Diptheria did not occur, and Delirium Tremens was more by 2. Attacks of Erysipelas and Carbuncle were lower by 28, but Insanity rose 14. Puerperal Fever furnished each year a like return. Among the 8871 new cases, 1266 had the advice and attention of Dr. Moore; 1399 of Mr. Vandenbergh; 1422 of Mr. Defriez; 1438 of Dr. Welch; 1525 of Mr. Massingham; and 1821 of Mr. Smart. The old cases out of doors left from 1861, amounted to 15 in District 1; to 56 in No. 2; to 74 in No. 3; to 17 in No. 4; and to 41 in No. 5. In Obstetric Practice 21 Labours were returned by Mr. Vandenbergh; 23 by Dr. Welch; 40 by Mr. Massingham; 62 by Mr. Smart; 62 by Mr. Defriez; and 95 by Dr. Moore. The ratio of Deaths to cases in the Workhouse and in the Out-door Districts, 3, 4, and 5, is 1 to 8 under Mr. Smart; 1 to 17 under Mr. Vandenbergh; 1 to 20 under Mr. Massingham; and 1 to 20 under Dr. Welch. In Districts 1 and 2, the Mortality was not supplied. "The Medical Report of Queen Adelaide's Dispensary * Fever is only registered in Table 11, when attended at home. Several of the Cases, and many also of Insanity, have a double entry. (1.) in one of the Outdoor Districts ; and (2.) in the Workhouse return. 17 for the year ending December 31st, 1862," gives the New Patients as 2043; of whom "the average number daily attended at their own homes, amounted to 20, and the average daily attendance at the Dispensary amounted to 57." There "died 58." In the City of London Hospital, "the number of Inpatients under treatment last year was 440, and the number of Out-patients was 9074, while the average attendance each week was 1041." The Practice in the Guardian Asylum consisted of 1 case of Small Pox, 6 of Diarrhoea, 2 of Rheumatic Fever, 6 of Catarrh, and 5 of other forms of disease. I now pass to the Sanitary Miscellanea from Ladyday, 1861, to Lady-day, 1862. For the figures I am indebted to your Surveyor, who has very kindly filled up Table 12. It is there shown that 720 Houses were Inspected, 203 Drains Constructed, 249 Drains Trapped and 86 Improved, that 357 Cesspools were Filled up and 80 Emptied, that 89 New Closets were Constructed and 302 Improved, that the Dust Removals amounted to 16,700, the Gullies made to 120, the Gullies Emptied to 2576, the Gullies Trapped to 150, and the Houses connected with Sewers to 173. Besides all these—the suppression of Trade Nuisances, the checking of Overcrowding, the improvements in Paving and Ventilation, the cleansing of certain Filthy Dwellings, the doing away (in many instances) with the keeping of Pigs, and the inspection and supervision of the Cow and Slaughterhouses, have doubtless, as "preventive agencies," warded off and blotted out disease. Our statistical history shows in 1862:— 1. That in comparison with London, our Birth and Death Rates were both in excess. 2. That where 23.5 per 1000 of the population died in London, 23.8 per 1000 died in Bethnal Green. c 18 3. That in Bethnal Green the epidemic ratio was higher by nearly 6 per cent. 4. That where London lost an inhabitant from Consumption in every 369, Bethnal Green lost but 1 in 419. 5. That where, in like manner, London lost from Fever 1 in 786, Bethnal Green had the greater loss of 1 in 683. 6. That of every 1000 living infants under five years of age, London lost about 8 less than Bethnal Green. You will see by these "sensitive tests" how inauspicious our retrospect is, and how sadly we retrograded last year. "Brief as the ephemera" was our Infant life—1311 Infants departed from us and left our homes for evermore! Hence it will tax our best energies to fortify that life, on which the future of Bethnal Green must so largely depend. And "as it is the home that makes the man," we must therefore make our homes "elements of health and long life." When preventive agencies are fully brought to bear on the physical evils which tell so fearfully on infant life, there will be less generation of, and predisposition to, disease, and the mortality under the age of five, will correspondingly be reduced. Then shall we suffer less from such "terrible correctives" as the 690 Epidemic Deaths in 1862.—Then, too, there will be more grow up; we shall have an "increased proportion of adults who are of the age, and strength, and skill, for productive industry, and an extended period during which each occupies his post." I have the honor to be, Rev. Sir and Gentlemen, With great respect, very faithfully yours, SAMUEL PEARCE, Medical Officer of Health. To the Rector and the Gentlemen of the Vestry of Saint Matthew, Bethnal Green. 19 APPENDIX TO THE EIGHTH REPORT; Or, Tables of the Deaths, Pauper Health, and Sanitary Operations of Bethnal Green, during the Year 1862. 1.

REPORT Of Proceedings of the Vestry of St. Matthew, Bethnal Green, from the 25th March, 1868, to the 25th March, 1869. PAYING CARRIAGEWAYS. The Vestry having obtained (as appears by the last Report) the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of "Works to raise £23,000, for the purpose of defraying the cost of paving the carriageways of the parts in this Parish of Hackney Road and Whitechapel Road, of Cambridge Heath, Green Street, and the Eastern Part of Bethnal Green Road, raised in December, 1867, the sum of £16,000, to meet the cost of the work in Hackney and Whitechapel Roads. The Vestry have arranged with the London Life Association to advance £7000, the balance of the £23,000, at 4½ per cent., and have determined in the first place to pave the carriageway of Green Street. The Vestry will consider hereafter whether the balance left after paying for the work in Green Street, shall be applied in paving (so far as it will enable them to do) the carriageway of the Eastern End of Bethnal Green Road or Cambridge Heath. PAVING FOOTWAYS OF OLD STREETS. After the execution of the orders already given, the balance of the fund borrowed for paving the footways of the old streets will be exhausted. It is estimated, that to complete the paving of all those streets a further 6um of £10,000 will be required. The Vestry consider that justice requires that all the old streets should be paved, and have resolved to apply for the sanction of the Metropolitan Board of Works for borrowing the £10,000. Details of the work done during the year will be found in the Surveyor's Report. 16 PAYING NEW STREETS. The details of work actually clone will be found in the Surveyor's Report. During the year the Vestry have made orders for paving the new streets called Gardiner's Road and Wennington Road, at the cost of the owners of the property in the roads. Application has been also made to the Vestry to pave the new streets known as Cordova Road, Hamilton Road, Theydon Road, and Gernon Road, and the cross-road leading from Kenilworth Road to Grove Road. The case of Cordova Road has had to stand over for a fresh survey to be made of the properties abutting on the road, as it will be necessary, to do justice in this case, to apportion the estimated cost to be paid by the owners according to value, instead of according to frontage, because the factories or warehouses at the western end of the road bring so much and such heavy traffic as to require that the carriageway be made up with, more durable and much more costly material than would be necessary if the road consisted entirely of the small houses which form by far the greater part of it. The Vestry did not think that Theydon and Gernon Roads were yet fit for paving, being only partially formed, and the building works not nearly completed. The Surveyor has been directed to prepare an estimate of the cost of paving Cranbrook Road, Hamilton Road, and the cross-road leading from Kenilworth Road. It has been found necessary to have a fresh estimate and apportionment of the cost of paving the new parts of Peel Grove, those prepared by the former Surveyor being inapplicable. The new estimate and apportionment were submitted to the Vestry at the meeting held on the 18th March, 1869, and were approved and adopted; but application has since been made to the Vestry to let the paving work stand over for the present, as houses are about to be built on, and a new street formed through, the large piece of vacant ground abutting on Peel Grove, and which was part of, or adjoining, the Peel Grove Cemetery. The Yestry made an order for paving Sewardstone Road West, at the cost of the owners of the property in the street; but it appearing that the road had been repaired by the Vestry in 1861, on condition of the owners kerbing the footpaths opposite their respective properties, the Yestry have agreed finally to take to the road, on the owners paying for the kerbing. 17 COUNTY RATE. In August a calculation for a new Basis for the County Rate was prepared by the Committee of Justices, and as far as regarded this Parish, was as follows:— / Gross estimated Rental, as charged to the Poor Rate . £328,565 Deduct 10 per cent. for Taxes, &c 32,856 £295,709 The present County Rate Assessment is £192,116 Increase 103,593 The Vestry Clerk was instructed to object to the Basis, and if necessary, to take steps to appeal against it. At the meetings held for hearing objections, it appeared that the Committee of Justices had taken the Property Tax as the Basis, excepting in the few Parishes, in which (as in this) the gross estimated rental exceeded the Property Tax assessment, and in those Parishes adopted the gross estimated rental. The effect of this was to benefit most unfairly those rich Parishes where the gross estimated rental was below the true value. Other objections were made to the Basis. The Magistrates reserved their decision, and ultimately the proposed Basis was abandoned. SCAVENGING, DUSTING, AND WATERING. In July, on the receipt of tenders, sent in pursuant to advertisement, a resolution was passed referring the subject of scavenging, dusting, and watering to a special committee of nine vestrymen. A proposal was made to the committee to provide a shoot for the deposit of the slop, within the radius of a mile from the entrance to Victoria Park, and to purchase the dust (to be collected and delivered by the Vestry), for £50. Negotiations were also entered into with the Great Eastern Railway Company for taking all the dust, ashes, and slop. After full consideration by the Vestry and committee, it was determined again to contract for the execution of the whole of the work. 18 The tenders accepted were— District No. 1, North—Mr. Winn £1050 „ „ 2, South—Mr. Irons 1120 „ „ 3, East—Messrs. Baker 1120 In consequence of the bankruptcy of Messrs. Baker, in .February, the Vestry arranged with Mr. Job Mansfield to do the work in District No. 3, at the price which would have been paid to Messrs. Baker. The East London Waterworks Company, in consequence of the longcontinued drought, found it necessary, at the end of July, to decline supplying water for watering the streets, and the watering had to be discontinued, until a fall of rain put an end to the fear that the water available would be insufficient for the wants of the district. METROPOLITAN TRAMWAYS BILL. EASTERN METROPOLITAN UNDERGROUND RAILWAY BILL. The latter Bill, to authorize making an underground railway from Aldgate to Bow, was withdrawn. The Tramways Bill has become law. It authorizes the construction of a tramway from Whitechapel Church to Stratford. Various clauses for protecting the interests of this and other Parishes were introduced in the progress of the Bill through Parliament, and by arrangement with the promoters a sum of £400 is to be paid to the Vestry, in respect of paving work done by the Vestry. The company, after the formation of the tramway, is to maintain and cleanse the road within the trams, and to the extent of eighteen inches beyond. MISCELLANEOUS. The Yestry deemed it advisable to join in opposing the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Bill, and Mr. Jacobs was specially appointed to attend the meeting of delegates from other Parishes, held for the purpose of taking measures against the Bill. Ultimately the provisions of the Bill were much modified, and as modified, the Bill passed. The Yestry expressed their objection to the Park Lane Improvement 19 Bill, considering the plan of the proposed improvement involved an enormous unnecessary cost, a large part of which would have to be borne by the East-end of London, while the benefit—which could be obtained at a much smaller cost—would be exclusively for the "West. The Bill was withdrawn. In May, some ratepayers in Brick Lane (which is supplied with gas by the Commercial Gas Company) complained that, as they believed, they were charged for more gas than they consumed, and desired to have the gas tested, and the evil complained of remedied. Under the direction of the Sanitary Committee, the Medical Officer of Health tested the gas, and reported he found the quality above the standard prescribed by the statute. A serious explosion took place on the premises in Cambridge Road, of Messrs. Baker, the makers and sellers of fireworks. As this was not the first explosion on the premises of Messrs. Baker, it caused great alarm to the whole neighbourhood, and the Vestry were strongly urged by the inhabitants to take measures to prevent Messrs. Baker carrying on their business in a place surrounded by houses and densely populated. Messrs. Baker denied that they made fireworks on the premises. Notice was given to them that' the grant of the renewal of the licence to sell fireworks would be opposed by the Vestry, and ultimately the application for a renewal of the licence was withdrawn. In January, the Rev. G. H. Tidcombe resigned the appointment of Afternoon Lecturer of the Parish Church, on his appointment to the Vicarage of St. Peter's, Hammersmith, and the Rev. H. M. Baker was elected as his successor. The subject of an improved approach from Shoreditch, and from Bethnal Green Road to Approach Road, is under consideration, and the Surveyor is preparing plans, with the view of a proposal being submitted to the Metropolitan Board of Works. It is felt a new approach from Shoreditch would be of great benefit to the Parish. The cost of making it will of course be large, and a special Act of Parliament will have to be obtained, as in the case of the "Whitechapel improvement. Deputations from the Vestry have attended meetings, and taken part in the movements, for securing an equalization of rates in the metropolis. The Bill for the valuation of property in the metropolis will probably secure a more uniform assessment of all the metropolitan Unions and Parishes, and so, to some extent, benefit this Parish. 20 The Vestry have carefully watched the Assessed Rates Bill. In the form it was at first introduced into Parliament it would have afforded but little relief from the difficulties and hardships resulting from the abolition of compounding, but changes have been made in it, on the suggestion of Vestries and Parish officers, which will make it a more useful, but still very defective measure. On the completion of the new railway to the Whitechapel Coal Depot, and the new siding on the main line of the Great Eastern Railway, the Vestry assessed the line and siding, and the property connected with them, as follows— Gross Eental. Rateable Value. New Line and Siding £2500 £2000 Each Arch 50 40 Each Counting-house 12 8 Yard 120 100 In making the assessment, the Vestry wished to keep it low, bearing in mind that the expected traffic had not been developed. The railway company appealed against the assessment, and the persons who were considered as occupiers of the arches objected that they had not such an occupation as rendered them liable to be rated in respect of the arches, The railway company agreed to be rated for the arches, and ultimately the assessment on the whole was fixed for the present at— Gross Rental £1800 Rateable Value £1500 This assessment will have to be increased if the expectations with which the new line was constructed are realized, but at present fears arc entertained that the line is almost a complete failure. In April, Mr. Rigg, the Town Hall Keeper, resigned, and Mr. David Brooks was elected as his successor. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk. Lady-day, 1869. SURVEYOR'S REPORT Of Works executed from Lady-day, 1868, to Lady-day, 1869. Gentlemen : I have the satisfaction to Report, that during the year from Lady-day, 1868, to Lady-day, 1869, the quantity and the extent of the works executed exceed that of any preceding year since the formation of your Vestry. This fact is sufficient to prove a corresponding improvement in the general condition and appearance of the Parish. The scheme for paving the footways of the old streets has been vigorously prosecuted, and many streets have received attention, a list of which will be found in this Report. The necessary work of cleansing and repairing the sewers and gullies in the Parish have been carried out by men in the employ of the Vestry. Necessity has arisen for opening some of the sewers, for the purpose of cleansing, and in some cases the levels have been altered for the purpose of improving the gradient. Sundry new gullies have been constructed ; new gully gratings, flushing-boxes, and ventilating gratings have been fixed, and during the summer months extensive flushing operations were carried on by means of stand-pipes and hose. The amount paid the East London Waterworks Company for water used for this purpose during the year was £81 6s. The principal amount expended for paving work was for paving the carriageway of the Hackney Road within the Parish: this work was carried out by Messrs. Booth and Griffiths, under a special contract, the amount of which was £14,999. The contract stipulated that the contractor should break up the surface of the road, and cart the material removed to such portions of the Parish as might be directed; the quantity of material carted away and spread in side streets was 2646 loads : the cost for road material for the year was therefore proportionately less than for previous years. During the progress of this work some alterations were made to the line of kerb, and considerable improvement effected thereby. 839.0 ft. run of kerb were reset, 3331 ft. of footway paving were relaid, and 4090 ft. sup. of new stone were provided —the cost of this work (including incidental works in connexion therewith) was £174 18s. 8d. 22 NAMES OF STREETS.

During the year 22,244 ft. super of new 3 in. footway paving have been laid, and 3209 ft. run of kerb reset. The cost of this work, together with incidental works in connection therewith, has been £836 8s. 1d. The carriageway paving in Bethnal Green Road, between Boundary Street and Brick Lane, has been entirely relaid. The worst of the stones were thrown out, and the whole of those fit for re-use were dressed. New Guernsey channels were introduced, and the deficiency made good with new 9x4 channels. The cost of this work was £454 15s. 4d. A similar work has been carried out in Hare Street; 2311 yards of carriageway paving were relaid, 1681 yards of which were dressed. 433 yards of new carriageway were provided, and new Guernsey channels laid in. The cost of this work (including incidental works in connection therewith) was £589 11s. 10d. Several smaller works have been carried out by the contractors, such as forming carriageway entrances to private premises, and relaying old paving, consequent upon other works being done. Large quantities of old stone, removed from some of the streets, have been laid in the following and numerous other streets :— Sale Street. Viaduct Street. Artillery Street Selby Street. Nottingham Street. Satchwell Street. Satchwell Eents. Old Nichol Street. Half Nicbol Street Swan Street, Sclater Street. Hart's Lane. Gosset Stx-eet Treadway Street Clarkson Street. Fuller Street. Edward Street. Chester Street. Oakley Street. Mount Street. Chilton Street. London Street, North Street. Cheshire Street. Hague Street. Cambridge Eoad. Essex Street. The above and other important works have been carried out by men employed by the vestry, the principal of which was making good paving disturbed by the gas and water companies, and by persons carrying out private drainage works, erecting scaffolds, &c.

The obelisk lamp lately removed from opposite St. John's Church, has been fixed at the junction of Old Ford Road, St. James's Road, and Bonner Road. An' improvement has been effected to Twig Folly Bridge, by raising the iron parapet, and fixing in same two ornamental iron standard lamps. In consequence of these and other works, nine additional lamps have been provided, and alterations carried out to seven. Four additional lamps have been erected under the railway arches in Carlisle Street, Manchester Street, Nottingham Street, and Arundel Street, Waterloo Town. These have been provided at the cost of the Great Eastern Railway Company, and are lighted at their expense. The amount paid for lighting to the Imperial Gas Company has been £3066 17s. 8d., and to the Commercial Gas Company £268 10s. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, WILLIAM MUNDY. Saint Mathew, Bethnal Green SANITARY STATISTICS AND PROCEEDINGS For THE YEAR 1868. THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., medical officer or health. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER Of THE VESTRY, by j. s. forsaith and son, rethnal green road, k. 1869. REPORT. June, 1869. Gentlemen, In presenting my Fifth Annual Report, and the Thirteenth compiled for this District in accordance with the provisions of the "Metropolitan Management Act," I have deviated from my ordinary course. Hitherto I have followed the plan of my predecessor, who brought the Vital Statistics up to the end of the year, and the Sanitary Statistics to the end of March. Now, it appears to me that the Vital and Sanitary Statistics should be co-relative, so that while we are looking to our death rate, we should be able to view the sanitary works accomplished, and thus be able to judge the improvement in the health of the population as affected by such measures. I have, therefore, brought the whole of the statistics to the end of the March quarter, as that is the quarter which terminates the year of the Metropolitan and Poor Law Boards. For the future my yearly Report will be taken from March to March. That great sanitary improvements have been effected will be seen upon inspection of Sanitary Miscellanea (page 22); and the appearance of the streets is a conclusive evidence of our advancement. Numbers of streets hitherto unpaved are now paved, and roads levelled; channels that were irregular and uneven are so no longer; gullies untrapped have been trapped, and our roads have been kept clean. I am not, I consider, paying any unmerited compliment by saying, that very much of this improvement has ensued since the appointment of our present Surveyor; and, although he has been ably and generously encouraged by the countenance and support of the Vestry and Works Committee, yet, the evident and most conspicuous improvements in our highways and thoroughfares are so prominent a feature to our daily observation, it becomes most obviously manifest, that without the watchful eye, the vigilant and active supervision of the chief of the department, such a pleasant and healthful state of things could scarcely be anticipated. 4 Notwithstanding these improvements, the death rate was rather higher than the year before, and the increase was mainly of the Zymotic class, as is shewn by the following table :— 1867. 1868. Fever 88 96 Small pox 65 24 Measles 46 120 Scarlatina 40 97 Diptheria 10 11 Diarrhœa 129 158 Cholera 7 10 Whooping Cough 123 102 508 618 Increase 110 It will be seen that there was an increase in all deaths from Zymotic disease, except Small Pox, which fell from 65 to 24 ; and Whooping Cough, which fell from 123 to 102. The increase was in Fever from 88 to 96 ; Measles 46 to 120 ; Scarlatina 40 to 97 ; Diptheria 10 to 11 ; Diarrhoea from 129 to 158 ; Cholera, so registered, 7 to 10. Thus, if we take Fever, Measles, Scarlatina, Diptheria, and Cholera, we find they form 172 of the 176 deaths that took place in 1868 beyond the number that occurred in 1867. The full limits and legitimate boundary-line of our Parish—Bethnal Green—is like an unknown region to those resident beyond its precincts ; and to a large portion of its actual inhabitants little, perhaps, is accurately known. I propose, therefore, for the sake of a pleasing diversion from the arid details of statistical studies, and for the better instruction of the more curious in such matters, to give in this place a superficial geographical outline of the boundaries which encompass it. Let the pedestrian start upon his journey of investigation, and let the point of his departure be the Church of Shoreditch; ere, however, he sets forth, let him note well the fact, that a portion of the burial ground attached to this ancient church, as well as the vestry of this venerable edifice, is within our Parish ; from thence, he will proceed along the right-hand side of Hackney Poad throughout its whole extent, 5 and he is still on the Northern line; on this line, and almost at its commencement, his attention will be at once arrested by the handsome and elegant building—an object of high interest—Columbia Square and its Market, with its spacious premises; from Gloucester Place, however, in Hackney Road, the line diverges upon the left, and Gloucester Place, with the streets running parallel as far as the Cambridge Road, and the Regent's Canal, and a small portion on the extreme side, viz., Baden Place, and he will here see the gas-holders of the Imperial Gas Light Company. Pursuing his tour along the Hackney Road to Prospect Place and the Bishop's Road, he still includes a few streets upon his left, but arrives in his path at our Workhouse, and the junctions of Bishop's and Approach Roads. Here our pedestrian friend may pause, and behold the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, a noble structure raised by the munificence of liberal hands and generous hearts, for the treatment of a disease at once the most formidable in the sad catalogue of human afflictions—a withering scourge and bane to humanity, and for which no antidote has hitherto been vouchsafed to mankind. Starting once again, and from this point, the traveller will wend his way through that most interesting and elegant part of our domain— emphatically and graphically one of the lungs of this huge metropolis— Victoria Park, the entire of which first park, and about half the second, is included within the circle of our limits ; and about the central point of the latter park he will perceive the boundary-stone, or landmark, of Bethnal Green. Here our pedestrian friend may rest awhile, and resuming his journey in a southerly direction, he crosses Duckett's Canal, and arrives at the Old Ford Road—Foresters' Bridge ; and at Ellesmere Road he reaches the furthermost confines to our Parish. Included within this space hereabout, a large portion of the Roman Road (generally designated Bow), Palmer's brick field, and Grove Road, as far as the railway arch, are also comprehended within this line. Returning from thence to the Cambridge Heath Road, the Great Eastern Railroad will constitute the boundary in that direction. With the face towards the Mile End Road, our walking friend will find John and Thomas Streets on his left, as also Purim Place, and the line of shops extending to the spot where Mile End Gate once stood, which was in its day also circumvented by our borders. Here again, a small portion of 6 the road belongs to us, a part of Messrs. Davis's oilcloth works, Mann and Crossman's brewery, and the public house known far and wide—"The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green"—of traditionary fame, are parts and parcels within our sphere. Proceeding in a direct line from these prominent objects, he arrives at Brick Lane, on the borders of Spitalfields, and to Truman and Hanbury's brewery, which is partly within our line of march; and from drawing an imaginary line to Shoreditch Church—the goal from whence he set out—our tired, but enterprising pedestrian friend, will have skirted the marginal lines of Bethnal Green; in other, and homelier, and familiar words, he will have "beaten the bounds of our Parish," having acccomplished, during his rambles, a distance of 7 miles, and comprised within that space 48 miles of streetway. Bethnal Green, with its population of 122,000, located on 760 acres of gravelly soil, at a mean elevation of 38 feet above high-water mark, is divided into 13 Clerical Districts—St. Andrew's, St. Bartholomew's, St. James-the-Great, St. James-the-Less, St. John's, St. Jude's, St. Matthias, St. Peter's, St. Philip's, St. Simon Zelotes', St. Thomas's, and St. Paul's ; these, though severally designated parishes by their incumbents, are all merged into one—that of St. Matthew's—to which is appointed a rector, the Rev. S. Hansard, M.A. I may here observe, that portions of our Parish—purely for ecclesiastical purposes—have been arbitrarily annexed to adjoining Parishes; for example—a portion to St. Stephen's, Spitalfields ; to Holy Trinity, Shoreditch ; to St. Augustine, Haggerston ; and to St. Stephen's, Haggerston. For the purposes of registration, it is divided into 4 Districts—Hackney Road, Church, Town, and Green. There are 7 Medical Officers, appointed under the Poor Law Board, for the purpose of attending and supplying medicines to the pauper sick ; they are distinct from the Workhouse, to which is attached a Surgeon and a Resident Medical Officer. We have also 3 Relieving Officers, 3 Assistants, and a Pay Clerk, for the relief of the out-door poor; 3 Sanitary Inspectors, two w holly and one partially engaged in the duties. The greatest number of our poor, and the chief inmates of our Workhouse, are broken-down weavers—weaving having been the principal occupation of the inhabitants half a century ago, and remained so up to the time I first became acquainted with the district, a quarter of a century since. This business has, from various causes, become nearly extinct; those 7 who could, have found other employment; those who have kept to it eke out an existence as best they may, and, when all other resources fail, they become inmates of our poor-house When the generation of weavers have passed away, I see looming in the distance a brighter day for Bethnal Green. We are essentially a working population : we find clerks and labourers for City warehouses, the docks and markets, also railway employees; many of the female portion pass daily into the City as machinists, &c., and a vast number go West as servants; these, when overtaken by accident or disease, are sent back to be cared for and maintained at the cost of the parish. We have but few wealthy persons living in our midst, as most of our large manufacturers, who draw their incomes from here, live in snug country houses about Walthamstow, Leytonstone, Woodford, &c., &c. Our present manufactures are large numbers of boots and shoes, of all kinds, both for home use and export. Here are made slippers of all kinds; some are stamped "Paris," and supposed to be French by those who wear them. Next in order comes cabinet and chair work, which is carried on extensively ; some of the best and some of the worst descriptions find their way over both town and country. This is the emporium for japanned furniture, and we supply many of the West-end houses which profess to make all their goods on their premises. Ladies' trimmings of all kinds form a staple production ; and here are made, fancy buttons, which, when put on French card boards, form the Bouton de Paris of commerce. Large quantities of lupifers are here made, as well as lucifer boxes, and this gives employment to the young of both sexes. I estimate the population of Bethnal Green to the middle of the past year at 122,000, aud although many small houses about the Hackney Road have been pulled down to make way for approaches to the Columbia Market, yet has there been no diminution in house room, owing to Miss B. Coutts having extended the building in Columbia Square, which forms dwellings for artisans and labourers, with good accommodation and superior style, at moderate rents, thus more than compensating for the houses demolished. It may not be out of place to say, that the evils of the rate-paying clauses have been obviated by the lady before named, as well as by many of our largest householders, who pay all tho taxes in the names of the tenants, thus securing to them the franchise without the voter having to pay for it. 8 I cannot permit this opportunity to pass without recording my deep and profound estimation—the warm and cordial appreciation—of those high and lofty philanthropic deeds which have sprung from the Queenly munificence of Miss Burdett-Coutts. The elegant—and as useful as elegant—edifice, which, through her generous and bounteous liberality, now adorns a portion of the northern boundary of our Parish, reflects, in every sense, a double lustre. On the one hand, profound respect and deep gratitude must be ever entertained for the wise and accomplished benefactress of her time, and of the age ; on the other, everyone must appreciate the civilizing influence a structure erected for purposes so ennobling and so worthy—is calculated to cast around a neighbourhood graced by its shadow and humanized by its presence. Strong indeed is the contrast, and striking the vicissitude. But a few years ago, and the spot on which Columbia Square and its Market stands was the dwelling-place of the thief, and the abode of the assassin ; the cesspool of vice, and a garden of crime—the dwellings alone fit emblems of the character of the occupiers ; and the once noted Nova Scotia gardens have at length passed away, and shall be no more seen. The salutary influence which buildings of this nature cast around and about them, is, in my opinion, incalcnlable, and the highway it opens up to the graceful embellishment of the surroundings is not the only good arising. The artisan and the labourer—the man, as he issues forth from the gates, intent on the duties of the day before him; the woman, as she steps forth to her lighter toil; the youth and the maiden, just entering upon the bustling stage of life; the child, as he scampers away to his school;—one and all feel the elastic bound—the atmospherical buoyancy; is conscious of being in the mere corporeal feeling, and reciprocally in his mental condition, lighter, nobler, better, with a healthier vigour and stronger energy, very far better equipped to encounter and to vanquish the stern and arduous difficulties that ever beset the rugged road of life's highway. Shakespeare has said, and truly too :— " The evil some men do lives after them, The good is oft interred!" But never will the good which the comprehensive wisdom, widespread and bright intelligence—that wealth of benevolence which ever characterizes all the actions of this noble lady—be interred, so long as those beautiful monuments—raised by her queenly hand, and consecrated by her boundless generosity—adorn and enrich the land of her birth, and maintain their existence amongst the works of man: nor will her memory, dear to the heart, and lasting in the recollection of every Englishman and 9 Englishwoman, in whose minds and memories there will ever dwell, engraved as on tablets of gold, in letters of silver, the hallowed and beloved name of Angela Georgina Burdett-Coutts. The Great Eastern Railway Company have ceased to encroach upon our house-room, and some few new houses have been built upon land not hitherto occupied by dwellings, so that, with the increase of population, our over-crowding remains much as heretofore, and the good that was expected to be derived from the "Public Health Act of 1866" has never been realized in this Parish, nor, to my knowledge, in any other ; and the time having elapsed for which the "Lodging-House Regulations" received the sanction of the Secretary of State, no further application has been made, and the law has become a dead letter. The average deaths for the whole of London in 1867 was 23 per 1000, or one person died of every 43 living. For Bethnal Green they are exactly the same, one death in 5.4 being from Zymotic Diseases. In 1868 the average deaths for the whole of London was 23.6 per 1000, or one person died of every 41.7 living. For Bethnal Green they were 24.3 per 1000, or one person died of every 41.3 living—one death in 4.7 being from Zymotic Disease. This shews our death rate to be slightly above the average for the whole of London ; or, in other words, there was ¾ of a person to the 1000 died in Bethnal Green more than the average for the whole of London. The births registered in Bethnal Green in 1868 were—Boys, 2525; Girls, 2408 : total, 4933, being 1 birth to every 24.5 persons living in 1868, against 1 birth to every 23 persons living in 1867. For the whole of London the rate was, in 1868, 1 birth to every 27 persons living. In 1867 it was exactly the same, so that our birth rate was far above the average for the whole of London in both years. PAUPER ILLNESS. The following is the number of new cases attended during the year by the District Medical Officers :— District No.1 Mr. Massingham 2735 Cases. „ 2 Mr. Defriez 969 „ „ 3 Dr. Burgess 701 „ „ 4 Dr. Richards 2180 „ „ 5 Dr. Welch 2091 „ 6 Dr. Sarvis 626 ,, „ 7 Dr. Brotherton 990 „ Total 10,292 Cases. 10 The very able Report of Mr. Smart, which I give herewith, supersedes the necessity of my rendering any statistics in relation to the Workhouse :— To the Guardians : Gentlemen,—I beg to lay before you the following Report of the Infirmary, in connection with this "Workhouse, shewing the number of Sick on the 1st January, 1869 ; also, the Admissions and Discharges during the past year : concluding with a brief Summary of the past three years. On the 1st January, 1869, the numbers on the Medical Relief Book (exclusive of Insane), were 218 males, 240 females, and 10 children—making a total of 468. Of that number, 56 were bedridden from complete Paralysis, or General Debility; 126 were suffering from the Infirmities of Age; 26 from partial Paralysis ; 47 from Asthma; and 41 from Consumption—making a total of 296 cases incurable and permanently disabled; 275 are over sixty years of age ; and 156 have been in the Infirmary one year and upwards. The number under medical treatment during the past year has been 2606 (exclusive of Insane), viz.:—524 on the Medical Relief Book on the 1st January, 1868; 807 admitted from among the inmates, and 1275 by the Relieving Officers and other officials (of these 2082 were fresh admissions); 1846 have been discharged cured or relieved; 12 sent to the Fever Hospital; 1 to the Small Pox Hospital; 12 to the Insane Ward; 267 died; and 468 remained on the 1st January, 1869.

Births,—109 Children have been born (59 males, 50 females)—of these 47 were Legitimate, 62 Illegitimate, 11 were Stillborn, and 4 prematurely. It will be seen, on 13 a comparison with former years, the numbers during the past four years have greatly exceeded those of previous years : thus, in 1853, the number was 30; in 1859, 56; and since 1864 it has exceeded 100. Vaccination.—The number of Children Vaccinated has been 45, and are included in my Summary of Vaccinations. Fever Cases.—10 males and 2 females have been sent to the Fever Hospital, only 1 of the above arising in the Tfouse ; in the others Fever developed itself from twenty-four to forty-eight hours after admission. In most of them they were traced as coming from fever localities. Small Pox.—1 case was sent to the Small Pox Hospital, and 1 treated in the Receiving "Ward of the Workhouse, the Hospital being full. Tramps.—22 Tramps have been admitted to the Infirmary from the Casual Wards, suffering principally from Debility. One was found to be insane, and removed to an asylum; the others (with the exception of one, a Negro, now in the Infirmary) have been discharged cured. Inquests.—18 Inquests have been held during the year, principally upon Aged Inmates; the verdict in each case being, "Death from natural causes." Insane and Imbeciles.—116 Insane cases were admitted by the Relieving Officers, and 12 sent from the Infirmary, making, with 90 previously in the House, a total of 218 under Medical Supervision during the year. Of that number 114 have been sent to Asylums, 37 discharged Cured or Relieved, 23 have Died (most of them old Paralytic cases), leaving 44 still in the House. Total Cases. Sent to Asylums.

There were two applications for new cow-houses—one from Mr. John Rose, for a shed in Hollybush Gardens, but as it was badly built, and the drainage very defective, accompanied with absence of manure pit, the application was opposed and finally rejected. The second application was from Mr. Baxter, of Brick Lane, just without our parish, though keeper of a cow within it. This application, however, was not within the time specified for such purpose. As this person keeps a cow for the ostensible use of a domestic nature, the question arises—Is he actually compelled to possess a licence ? The matter is, for the present, sub judica, and his cow at least tolerated. John Bailey, whose licence was refused upon the last occasion, owing to the unfitness of his premises, stocked his cow-house in defiance of the law; but after some controversy, he removed them without forcing us to institute proceedings of a legal character. There were three applications for slaughter-houses, all in Brick Lane; from Mr. Stevens, Messrs. Knight and Spencer, and from Mr. Wooster. The application of Mr. Stevens was rejected, as the premises were not at all adapted to such purposes. That of Messrs. Spencer and Knight was granted. These parties had constructed commodious, and thorough premises, commanding every requisite for such occupation. The premises occupied by Mr. Wooster, though not exactly of the description I approved, yet as they had been licensed previously, and as no urgent reason appeared against the renewal of the licence, it was extended to him again, It will be remembered that the application of Mr. J. Long, of Essex Street, Cambridge Road, was successfully opposed on the grounds that he sub-let the premises to Charles Geary, who was in the habit of killing diseased animals, for which he suffered three months' imprisonment at the suit of the Yestry. Now that Mr. Long has found a respectable occupier for his premises, the objections hitherto in force have been withdrawn, and his licence granted.

During the past year, large quantities of diseased and putrid meat have been seized in a condition unfit for human food; in all cases prosecutions have been instituted, convictions obtained, and penalties enforced, and in one instance accompanied by imprisonment. FISH. It having been ascertained that large quantities of fish, in a putrid state and otherwise unfit for human food, were brought into the parish by the small fishmongers and costermongers, purchased at Billingsgate, and sold there to these vendors, an investigation was made into the subject, when it was found that great facility was offered to this traffic by the peculiar mode adopted at Billingsgate for transacting their sales. 19 A vessel comes alongside the quay, filled with pads (or baskets) of various kinds of fish; or a railway van conveys it to the place of sale. Men in the employ of the consignees unload the vessel or the van, and the sale commences. One or more pads are put up at a time, until a purchaser is found; so that the fish so sold is never seen either by the seller or the buyer, and without being examined by the inspector. Until the fish arrives at the house of the purchaser, he is in total ignorance of the utter worthlessness of his bargain; although the odour emitted from some of these pads, which I have frequently inspected very soon after their arrival, should have warned them very pungently of what they might not unreasonably expect upon opening the hidden treasure. Occasionally some few sound fish would be found at the top, but so impregnated with disgusting effluvia as to render them unfit for domestic use. When this fish was returned upon the hands of the salesman, the money was frequently refused to be refunded, or the parties had disappeared for the day; so that the loss to the purchaser was often considerable. Under these circumstances a plan was organized whereby the public could be protected from the danger of such unwholesome food, and, at the same time, by prompt condemnation of the article in official character and form, ensure the refunding of the cash to the buyer, and thereby destroy entirely the strong temptation to lessen his loss by the sale of impure fish. I annex a form of certificate adopted, and am happy to say that in no case has repayment been refused, no loss sustained by a large class of industrious citizens, and the public at large shielded from harm. SAINT MATTHEW, BETHNAL GREEN. Sanitary Department. No. Vestry Hall, Church Row. ...18 I hereby Certify that I have this day examined... ...in the possession ofresiding at ...and that the said...are in a... state, and unfit for the food of man. ...M.D., Medical Officer of Health. 20 I would just add, that the quantities of such fish condemned by me and the inspectors have been larg ; and it is a matter to be much regretted that the authorities of the Market, with such ample opportunities for mischief, do not adopt some stringent measures to prevent so grave a wrong. FEEL GROVE CEMETERY. Some time ago it became known to me that preparations were being made to build upon this ground, which had been closed for several years. The Government of the day was communicated with, and I met Dr. Holland (Inspector of Burial Grounds), and Mr. Keldy, the freeholder. We learned from Mr. Keldy that there certainly was no power to prevent him building upon this ground; and we were informed by him that he had already leased the land to Mr. Willsmer, of Leyton. The ground being unconsecrated, and the remains of the dead not disturbed, no opposition could be effectually made to frustrate their object. Much conversation ensued upon the matter, and subsequently an Order in Council was obtained, which directed that it was to be covered by vegetation. The same order extended to the cemetery in Globe Road, in the parish of Mile End Old Town. This order was as powerless for good and as worthless as the paper on which it was inscribed, and as such, it was totally disregarded—not a single requirement could be enforced. No plant or evergreen has taken root there—no germ budded—no flower blossomed; but over the graves of our departed neighbours interred in the Globe Road Cemetery there are buildings and dwelling houses as thickly peopled as any other portion of our city. A like inevitable fate awaits Peel Grove. In Peel Grove, at the commencement of this year, the work of demolition began: monuments which recorded the last resting-places of friends and relations were removed, and assigned to base uses never contemplated by affection and kindly hands which placed them there ; dry rubbish was thickly strewed over the ground to the depth of three feet, and the sad spot once watered by the tears of sorrowing friends made ready for the erection of buildings and the construction of highways for busy feet to trample on and desecrate. Dr. Holland and myself met again, and by appointment, the lessee; we remonstrated strongly and urgently, but we found that the counsel's opinion—that of Sir Roundell Palmer—was adverse to us ; that the Order in Council was of no avail; 21 there was no law to prohibit the doom, the greed of wealth must go on, and the hallowed spot of many a fond recollection, endeared to many a memory, should be utterly obliterated and be no more seen. It appears strange—stranger than fiction—that Government should issue orders, and in Council too, having no more power or authority than a piece of waste paper. It would thus appear that some special A.ct of the Legislature can alone prevent a similar occurrence. In a sanitary point there is no cause for alarm—no room for fear or apprehension—all organic matter has long since been resolved into its ultimate elements, and eliminated throughout boundless space; the inorganic residue has passed through successive changes peculiar to it, and has long since assumed its crustaceous form and commingled with its fellow-earth. In a social aspect, however, the prominent features of the case stand out in bold relief upon the canvas, and the picture, in all its barefaced deformity, exhibits in glaring colours and defined outline an outrage upon the finer feelings of our nature. THE WORKSHOPS ACT. This Act of Parliament came into operation during the present year, and provides for the better regulation of Workshops, and the lessening of the hours of labour of children. Placards have been issued and extensively distributed over the Parish, and many of the Workshops visited. In a Parish like this, to carry out the provisions of this Act in their entirety, would entail a vast amount of work upon all concerned, and therefore, at present, educating, as it were, towards more efficient operations, is as much as we can expect to attain just now. SANITARY MISCELLANEA. The Reports of the three Sanitary Inspectors—Mr. Chmstie, Mr. Ruerows, and Mr. W. W. Buhkows—give the following results Houses Inspected 7097 Notices Served , 2673 Compulsory Notices Served 566 22 Summonses Issued 3.5 Number of Summonses Heard 35 Number of Visits to ascertain the Progress of Work required to be done under Notices served 13195 Work executed in Compliance with Notices Served:— Houses Cleansed and Purified 2594 Houses Closed as unfit for Human Habitation 37 Cases in which Defective Drainage has been Remedied 1514 Cesspools Abolished 193 Closets Cleansed and Purified 971 Privy Accommodation Provided 106 Urinals Cleansed 150 Removals of Accumulations of Dung and other Offensive Matter 246 Animals Removed in consequence of being a Nuisance, or kept in a condition Injurious to Public Health 452 Ash Bins Provided 163 SCAVENGING AND DUSTING. Considerable improvement has taken place in this department, and altogether I may report favourably in relation thereto. In the first quarter of the present year (1869) there were 1297 Births— viz., 631 Boys and 648 Girls; the Deaths were 721. The causes of, and the ages at death, will be found in Table V.

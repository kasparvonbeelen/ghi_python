To the Mayor, Aldermen and Councillors of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to report on the health and sanitary circumstances of the Borough for 1964. This is the last Annual Report for Bethnal Green Council, as its independent existence will terminate on the 31st March, 1965. Perhaps this is an opportune time to pause and reflect on what was achieved over the years since May 1956, when I had the honour to become Medical Officer of Health for the Borough. Slum Clearance I represented 16 Areas for Slum Clearance and, together with individial Closing Orders dealt with 1,479 properties in this period which is one-tenth of the total number of dwellings in the Borough. This is not the sum total of slum clearance activities which so radically transformed Bethual Green into a pleasantly modernised area with a surprising number of new dwellings, since it does not include the slum clearance work of the London County Council. Clean Air Act. 1956 The implementation of this Act had a very slow start, indeed in the early days it looked very much as though it would not commence at all. The Council was greatly concerned that the price of smokeless fuel would be an added burden on the finances of the ratepayers, but, unexpectedly, a change of attitude to Clean Air came about and I was instructed to proceed with establishing smokeless zones. I had the advantage of the experience of those Boroughs who had started earlier. The Borough was divided into five areas and it was intended to complete the work in 5 years but subsequently it was found that this period could be reduced. The Orders were made as follows: 4 Smoke Control Area 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Year Order Made 1959 1960 1961 1962 1962 The year following the making of each Order it became operative, with the exception of Area 4 where one solitary chimney of a factory burning wood waste held up progress. Eventually agreement was reached with the firm concerned but this Order did not become operative in 1963 and even failed to do so in 1964 (it will become operative on 1st July, 1965). Bethnal Green is in the fortunate position of having a large Park within its boundaries and there at least no contamination of air is taking place. Nevertheless this Borough was considered one of the blackest spots in London from the Clean Mr point of view, and I am pleased to report that the task of making the whole Borough a Smoke Control Area has now been completed. I know that this will contribute in no small measure to the well-being of the population. Old People's Welfare This is a service in which I have always been greatly interested. It is obvious that it is a problem which will demand more and more attention since there are increasing numbers of retired people living in the community. A number of amenities are provided for the old people by various voluntary organisations which perform excellent work in serving this section of the community. The Public Health Department's main task should be to locate those who are unable or unwilling to accept the services provided by the voluntary organisationsj unable because they may be physically incapacitated, unwilling because they may have isolated themselves to such an extent that they have to be guided back into society. There is a third large group who are well able to look after themselves or perhaps live with their families and who need no help, but even these should be known to us in case the picture changes as it so quickly can in old age. It was considered that in the population of Bethnal Green there must be some 9,000 Old Age Pensioners and it was my objective, with the help of the three Old People's Visitors, to get as many of them as possible known to the department. In 1963 some 1,200 became known which increased to over 5,000 by the end of 1964. Although this represented a high percentage of the total number of aged persons I had hoped to improve on this figure. It was intended to have every one on the list visited once a year at least and more often to those who needed attention depending on conditions found. 5 I am sure that our activities have contributed to the well-being of the aged by visiting and bringing to their notice the various services available by statutory and voluntary organisations. Food Hygiene In this field perhaps standards did not rise to the extent I would have liked to see. The Pood Hygiene (General) Regulations 1960 gave us a powerful weapon to improve conditions generally but there are so many snail businesses which come and go with such rapidity that it is extremely difficult over a short period to institute improvements. I would pay that the better food establishments have improved beyond measure over the last eight years I have been in the Borough but I must confoss this improvement very often was undertaken by the proprietor himself without action by my Department. Owners must have found it to be good business to show a high standard of cleanliness. At the other end of the scale the very poor shops still remain very poor or have improved only slightly -there is much work yet to be done. The unsatisfactory standards of hygiene in Street Markets caused me to recommend to the Public Health Committee on a number of occasions that licences for the sale of open foods should not be granted. In 1959 the Committee agreed with my recommendations and referred them to the Street Trading Committee who resolved that no new applications for licences to sell meat, fish and poultry should be considered. It follows that in due course the sale of all such open foods in the street markets of the Borough will cease. The foregoing are some of the positive contributions that were made to environmental health improvement. Perhaps the most important negative point is that in the past 8 years there has not been a serious outbreak of infectious disease this may be due not so much to my vigilance as to the fact that such outbreaks occur only on rare occasions in this country. Statistics; During 1964 the Registrar-General estimated the population to be 46,420 as compared with 50,940 in 1957, a reduction of 4,520; it is considered that no further reduction will take place, but possibly a slight increase in the future. As to causes of death I have to report again, as I have done in previous years, on the number of deaths from cancer of the lung. There were 31 male and only 3 female deaths from this disease. The difference is remarkable and no doubt due to the fact that in times past women did not smoke. I am afraid in years to come this marked 6 difference will be greatly reduced, and that the number of such deaths among women will increase as their use of the "noxious weed" increases. Of the men 16 died before the age of 65 and all the women beyond that age. The second cause of death showing a marked difference between the sexes is coronary disease, the figures being 60 males and 35 females. Of the male deaths 25 occurred before the age of 65, and of the females 3 occurred before that age. Other causes of death of special interest are motor vehicle accidents, being 6 deaths in all, 4 male and 2 female distributed at random between the ages of 5 and 65. Under the heading of other accidents, there were 4 deaths, 2 male and 2 female. The cause of death in these cases very often is due to accidents in the home. A matter of special note is the number of suicides for the year which totalled 11, 6 males and 5 females. This is a most unusual occurrence for Bethnal Green and I hope it is but an isolated instance. The three last mentioned causes of death must be considered preventable and should be taken note of and followed up to observe the trend. Action has been taken with the aid of Health Education to reduce road accidents and home accidents. The Council is conscious of the problem of suicide amongst people who become isolated and unable to cope with their problems and is contributing to support the functions of the Samaritan organisation, accepting that there is need for preventive work in this field. In conclusion, I wish to thank the Chairman and Members of the Public Health Committee for their encouragement and support and I acknowledge too the co-operation of other Chief Officers and their staffs. I wish also to convey my appreciation to every member of the Department and as this address is a survey of the past eight years I wish, to thank those members of the staff who have worked with me and who have since retired or transferred to other posts. I have the honour to be, Your obedient Servant, S. A.

Bacteriological and chemical examination of the water is carried out at frequent intervals by the Metropolitan Water Board, but following complaints two samples from domestic premises were submitted for chemical analysis and reported upon as satisfactory. Notices were sent to the Board in 25 cases where wastage of water due to defective pipes or fittings was observed. Luring the year 493 new premises were certified as having a proper and sufficient water supply in accordance with Section 95 of the Public Health (London) Act, 1.936, In addition to the supply from the Metropolitan Water Board, there are four wells in use in the Borough. These are as followss Attached to Council's Public Baths 1 (not used for domestic purposes) Attached to a hospital 1 (used for all purposes) Supplementary supply for industrial purposes 2 (used for refrigeration purposes only) These wells are sampled at regular intervals. Sewerage and Sewage Lisposal Arrangements for sewerage and sewage disposal in the Borough are adequate. Sanitary Inspection of theBorough Following the 1,707 complaints of insanitary conditions, defects were found requiring the service of Intimation Notices in 946 cases, in accordance with the Public Health (London) Act, 1936. Of these, Statutory Notices were required in 255 instances and legal proceedings were instituted in 12 cases. In addition, 22 notices in accordance with the London Comity Council (General Powers) Act, 1955 > Section 27, were served. In connection with the supervision of drainage works a total of 1,165 inspections were made during the year and an ever increasing amount of time is spent by the Inspectors in the examination of drawings submitted for proposed new buildings or amendments to existing buildings. Fifty-two notices in accordance with Section 25 of the London County Council (General Powers) Act, 1955, were served. Defects covered related mainly to chokages and defects in drains requiring urgent attention. In 16 instances the necessary work was carried out by the Council and the expenses incurred recovered from the owners of the properties. Table 2 RECORD.

Personal Cleans in,Station During the year, 3 persons had baths for verminous conditions at the Personal Cleansing Station, simultaneous disinfection of clothing being carried out. In addition, 8 persons received treatment for Scabies at the Station. Public Health Inspectors visit and advise in all cases of scabies and in those cases where verminous conditions persistently recur. During the year the mobile bathing equipment for the cleansing, by consent, of aged persons in their own homes where the persons concerned are so enfeebled as not to be able to attend at the Personal Cleansing Station was used on 805 occasions. This is a complicated and difficult service but one which is most worth while and for which the homebound and often disabled persons concerned are very thankful. 19 Laundry Service for Incontinent Persons The arrangement with Hackney Borough Council for the laundering of articles of bed linen and personal clothing from incontinent persons continued during the year. There were 976 collections and deliveries compared with 174 during 1963 This service continued to expan . during the year particularly during the latter part when a regular twice-weakly collection of soiled articles was ensured. Twenty-six cases received the service in 1964 and the twice-weekly collection resulted in several hundreds of items being laundered. Prevents on of Damage by Pests Act, 1949 During the year, 266 complaints of infestation by rats or mice were received and in most cases of rat infestation smoke tests of the drainage of the premises affected were carried out by the rodent operatives under the supervision of the Public Health Inspectors. Systematic baiting and poisoning was carried out by the Rodent Operatives, with satisfactory results. In accordance with the suggestion of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Pood, all sewers under the control of the Council were baited twice during the year. National Assistance Act, 1948 Under Section 47 of the National Assistance Act, 1948, as amended by the National Assistance (Amendment) Act, 1951 provision is made whereby a court of summary jurisdiction may make an order for the removal of ill, infirm or incapacitated persons who are not receiving proper care and attention. During the year five applications were made for orders for removal to hospital or institution, and removal orders were granted in each instance. Old People's Welfare The Old People's Welfare Committee, comprising representatives of the Council and the various local organisations and social settlements, continued to provide all possible assistance to old people in the Borough by the provision of clubs, meals-on-wheels, chiropody, holidays and outings, etc. The Department's three welfare visitors continued to assist in 20 the provision of all possible help to aged and infirm persons in the Borough and during the year under review they carried out 10,331 visit and interviews. 2,011 new cases were added to the register and 243 cases were removed therefrom. At the end of the year, there were 3,828 cases on the register. Offensive Trades There are two premises in the :3orough carrying on offensive trades, one being the business of a fur skin dresser and the other a poultry slaughterhouse. Six inspections were made in 1964, notice being served. Rag Flock and Other Filling Materials Act, 1951 This Act provides for the licensing by the local authority of all premises used for the manufacture and/or storage of filling materials to which the Act applies, and for the registration of certain premises where such materials are used in upholstering, stuffing or lining of bedding, toys, baby carriages, etc There are no premises in the Borough where rag flock or other filling materials are manufactured but 20 premises are registered for the use of such aterials in the trades conducted therein. Pet Animala Act1_1951 The operation of this Act is very important in Bethnal Green on account of the well-known Sunday morning dog market which has been held in Bethnal Green for many years and which serves both vendors and purchasers throughout the whole of the County of London and even beyond. During the year 8 licences for the sale of pet animals were granted in respect of shops and 49 licences in respect of stalls. Common Lodging Houses There are no Common Lodging Houses in the Borough. Clean Air Turing the year, the Minister of Housing and Local Government confirmed No.4 Smoke Control Order which comes into operation on 1st July, 1965. This area, covers the last outstanding portion of the Borough which had not been subject to such control. 21 SECTION C HOUSING Clearance Areas During the period under review representation of unfit properties included in the agreed slum clearance programme continued.

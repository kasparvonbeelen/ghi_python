REPORT Of the Proceedings of the Vestry of Saint Matthew, Bethnal Green from the 25th March, 1873, to the 25th March, 1874. SCAVENGING. Notwithstanding the improvement in late years, the imperfect way in which part of the Contractors' work is done, and the cost of it, have suggested the wish to devise some better plan for Cleansing and Watering the Streets and Roads, and removing Dust and refuse from houses and other buildings. In April the subject was referred to the Works Committee, who recommended that Tenders should be advertised for. Only four Tenders were sent in, which were referred to the Works Committee. The recommendation of the Committee to advertise again was adopted, and the Tenders sent in pursuant to the further advertisement were also referred to the Works Committee for consideration and report. The Committee recommended the acceptance of the Tender by Mr. Lansbury, for District No. 1, at £1445 ; by Mr. Irons, for District No. 2, at £1630; and by Mr. Box, for District No. 3, at £1585 ; but between the Meeting of the Committee, and the next Meeting of the Vestry, Mr. Lansbury withdrew his Tender. The Tenders for Districts No. 2 and 3 were accepted, and ultimately an offer by Mr. Crane to execute the Scavenging work of District No. 1 for £1600, (an increase of £155 on Mr. Lansbury's Tender) was also accepted; and Mr. Crane was Contracted with accordingly. In November, the Contractor for District No. 2 was fined three sums of £5 each for sweeping mud into the Gullies of Sewers. 14 On the death of Mr. Box, the Contractor for District No. 3, permission was given to his Administratrix to assign the Intestate's contract to Mr. Holloway one of the sureties of the Intestate. In January last, the subject of the execution of Scavenging work after the expiration (in August, 1874), of the current Contracts, was referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry. After making enquiries as to the practice, and the result of experiments, in other Parishes, the Committee advised that Tenders for the execution of the work for a year, from 10th August, 1874, should bo invited. This recommendation was adopted, and the Tenders accepted were: — By Mr. Holloway, for District No. 1 £1455. „ Mr. Parsons, „ „ 2 1400. „ Mr. Irons, „ „ 3 1510. PASSAGE ROUND NORTH TERRACE. Mr. Harvey appealed against the Certificate of the Justices, "that the highway was unnecessary, and should be entirely stopped up." The appeal was heard in April, when Counsel appeared on behalf of Mrs. Natt. The Jury found " that the highway was unnecessary, and should be stopped up." Subsequently proceedings were taken to quosh the Certificate of the Justices on Technical grounds, but with those proceedings— as on the appeal—the Vestry have not interfered, and the Certificate is being supported by, and at the cost of, Mrs. Natt. In February, it was moved "that the Clerk should be instructed to make an application to have the name of the Vestry struck out from the proceedings, and that of Mrs. Natt, ths real prosecutor, substituted." But the motion was not carried. To obviate any question as to the liability of the Vestry to costs, on the form of the proceedings, the Solicitors of Mrs. Natt have given on undertaking to indemnify the Vestry against any claim for costs. RAILWAY TO COLUMBIA MARKET. The Vestry presented a petition to Parliament in opposition to the " Columbia Market Approaches and Tramways Bill," mentioned in the last Report; but the Corporation of the City having agreed to strike out 15 the clause authorizing the use in the streets, on the trams or rails, of locomotives propelled by steam, the Vestry withdrew the petition, and the Bill passed. INCREASE IN NUMBER OF VESTRYMEN. In April, application was made to the Metropolitan Board of "Works for an order to increase the number of Vestrymen returned by the East Ward from 9 to 15 ; and the number returned by the North Ward from 9 to 12. The Board made an order accordingly. The East, West, and South Wards now return 15 members each, and the North Ward 12, making a total of 57 elected members for the whole Parish. PARISH BOUNDARIES. The Septennial perambulation of the Parish Bounds was made this year. In consequence of the progress of buildings at the East and South-Eastern part of the Parish, and of alterations made along the boundaries elsewhere, fresh boundary marks hud to be placed at various places, and tablets substituted for stones in others. To facilitate the perambulation, the Churchwardens, with the Surveyor and Collectors, made a preliminary survey of the Bounds where any difficulty—caused by new buildings, or by removal, or unauthorized change of the boundary marks—existed. A dispute as to Boundary is pending with Mile End. The Churchwardens of this Parish agreed to meet the Churchwardens and Overseers of Mile End to go over the disputed Boundaries, and went accordingly with the Clerk, the Surveyor, and the Collectors of the East and South Wards. At the meeting it was referred to the Surveyor of this Parish and to Mr. Knight, the Surveyor of Mile End, to define the real boundary line. After examining the old maps and the boundaries, the two Surveyors did not differ, and a plan was prepared and approved by both, shewing the exact line, but the Churchwardens and Overseers of Mile End refused to be bound by the report of the Surveyors. The Surveyors had adopted tho line of the old ditch as the boundary, and the correctness of doing so is not disputed, except with regard to two houses ; and with egard to that part, the Clerk to the Vestry of Mile End says, the line 16 of ditch may have been altered, as Mile End has for more than thirty years rated the entirety of the two houses. From the plan agreed upon by the Surveyors, it appears the principal parts of tho two houses are in this Parish. Where favourable to Mile End, tho Officers of that Parish have adopted the line laid down by the two Surveyors, and have rated parts of several gardens at the rear of houses in Cambridge Road, which had never before been rated by Milo End. NEW STREETS. The order for paving and constructing sewers in Burgoyno Road, Conyers Street, Lawfranc Road, Theydon Road, and Gernon Road, have been carried into effect; and the Vestry have also resolved that Olga Street shall be paved and a sewer constructed therein at the cost of the owners of the property abutting on the Street; and that Havelock Place and Cranbrook Road shall be paved at the cost of the owners of the properties abutting thereon respectively. Baroness Road and the Hackney Road end of Crab Tree Row having been completed to the satisfaction of the Vestry, have been taken by them as public roads. INCREASE IN PRICE OF GAS. The Imperial Gas Company having, as mentioned in tho last Report, given notico to determine in June their contract for supplying Gas to Public Lamps, raised the price from that date— For Lamps consuming 5 ft. per hour, from £4 8s. to £4 18s. „ i, 3 ft. „ £3 Os. to £3 6s. In November, the Company gave notico of their intention farther to raise their charge for supplying Public Lamps, and alleged it was necessary to do so on account of the still higher price of coal and other materials, and the increase in tho expense attending the manufacture of gas. The Vestry considered that the proposed further increase should bo opposed, and communicated this opinion to the Metropolitan Board of Works, the "Local Authority" under the Gas Acts. The Board informed the \ estry of their intention to oppose the application by the Company to the Board of Trade, for permission to raise the price of Gas, and asked the \ estry to furnish evidence. The communication from the Metro- 17 politan "Board was referred to a Select Committee, with power to call a public meeting. It appeared that the evidence needed was of a purely scientific, technical kind, which the Metropolitan Board was better able / to obtain ; but a public meeting was called, at which Mr. Flintoff, a Gas Engineer, attended, and gave, at great length, detailed information. According to his statement, the price of Gas is much in excess of what it need be. The Commissioners appointed by the Board of Trade—notwithstanding the strenuous opposition to the application for permission to increase the price of Gas—reported in favour of the application, and the prices charged in respect of Public Lamps are now— Lamps consuming 5 ft. per hour £5 0 0 Lighting, extinguishing, cleaning, repairing, & c 0 18 0 £5 18 0 Lamps consuming 3 ft. per hour £3 0 0 Lighting, &cc 0 18 0 £3 18 0 With a few exceptions the lamps are those supposed to consume 5 ft. per hour, and the increase of price made during the year will cause an additional expenditure of above £1200, equivalent to a rate of l½d. in the pound.

Numerous complaints were made to the Vestry of the conduct of the East London "Water Works Company in carrying out arrangements for a constant supply, under the provisions of the Act of 1871. The use of the Vestry Hall for a public meeting on the subject was granted, and it was proposed that a deputation should wait on the Company. A meeting was held, at which numerous complaints of harsh and arbitrary conduct were made. The Clerk wrote, asking the directors to receive a deputation. In reply, the Company stated the directors were in attendance every Monday to hear complaints, and therefore did not think a deputation necessary, but consented to receive a small deputation (not to exceed six or seven), subject to being furnished with a statement of the cases respecting which complaints were made, to enable the Company to make enquiries previous to the conference. The Yestry did not accept the conditions laid down by the Company, and as it was believed the public protest would effect the object desired, the matter was allowed to drop. "ADULTERATION OF FOOD ACT, 1872." The Local Government Board required, as stated in the last Report, evidence of the qualification of the Medical Officer before confirming his temporary appointment. The term for which he was appointed (six months) having expired, the subject of appointing an Analyst was referred to a Committee of the whole Vestry; and, in conformity with the recommendation of the Committee, the Vestry, on the 6th of November, appointed Dr. Charles Meymott Tidy, Analyst for this Parish during the pleasure of the Yestry, with a salary at the rate of £52 10s. per annum, and an allowance of 7s. 6d. for each analysis. The Yestry appointed the three Sanitary Inspectors to be Inspectors for the Parish, to procure and submit samples, and do the duties prescribed for Inspectors by the "Adulteration of Eood Act, 1872," and resolved that the price to be paid under sec. 9 of the Act by the purchaser of any article of food or drink or drugs for an analysis be 5s. The question as to any remuneration to the Inspectors of Nuisances for acting as Inspectors under the Act stands over for future consideration. 19 BYE LAWS. It was referred to a Special Committee to revise the existing Bye Laws, and the New Bye Laws prepared by the Committee have been adopted by the Yestry. COMPOSITION RATE. A Special Committee has been appointed to consider what steps (if any) should be taken for the abolition of the Composition Rate. The Committee have met twice, but without arriving at any result. SCHOOL BOARD PRECEPT. The precept from the School Board issued in February is for £2021 2s. 5d., to be paid in moieties in June and December. To raise the amount will require more than a rate of 2d. in the pound. INCREASED CHARGES FOR THE COMING YEAR. £1200 0 0 In Amount of School Board Precept 1184 6 9 ,, Metropolitan Board Precept 1992 4 1 £4376 10 10 An additional rate of 4d. will not quite meet this increase. MISCELLANEOUS. An application was made for permission to drain into the sewer some houses in Wellington Street, North Street, and which are within this Parish. The sewer in Wellington Street having been laid down by the Whitechapel District Board of Works, the Vestry applied to that Board, and an arrangement was made for this Parish having the use of the sewer on payment of a moiety of the cost of its construction—£30. The subject of providing a mortuary, and apparatus for disinfecting bedding, clothes, &c., has been again referred to the Sanitary Committee. 20 The "Works Committee recommended that the wharf belonging to the Vestry should be let, or the lease of it sold, but it was determined to retain it for twelve months. An obelisk lamp has been ordered to be erected in the Old Ford Road, at the junction with Grove Road. Tenders for providing it have been obtained, and that by Messrs. McLaren at £22, being the lowest, has been accepted. Particulars as to the other new lamps are given in the Surveyor's Report. The salary of the Hall Keeper has been raised to £105 per annum. In January, Mr. William John Bradbrook, a very old member of the Vestry, died. The Vestry passed a resolution expressing regret for the loss they had sustained, and directing the Clerk to communicate the resolution to Mr. Bradbrook's son. ROBERT VOSS, Vestry Clerk. SURVEYOR'S REPORT OF WORKS EXECUTED, FROM LADY-DAY, 1873, TO LADY-DAY, 1874. Gentlemen, The work carried out during the year has been very extensive, although not large, if taken singly. The cleansing and repairing to the different sewers has been a work of importance, and is likely to involve considerable expenditure in the future. In a previous report (1867-8), I drew attention to the imperfect construction of many of the sewers, and the fears then expressed have been realized. I have enumerated the places where the most important works have been carried out to the various sewers:— Bonner's lane Royston street West street, North street Granby street London street Elizabeth street St. Peter's street Sheldon place Pollard row Gibraltar walk Barnet street Gardincrs road South streot William street Thomas's passage Felix street Sclater street Wennington road Spicer street George street Canrobert street Garden place Birdcage walk Fleet street 22 About 150 ft. additional 12 in. pipe were laid in Hare street, to communicate with sewer in Brick lane. About 80 ft. of ditto laid in Pollard row, to communicate with sewer in Old Bethnal Green road. About 60 ft. of ditto laid in Helen place, to communicate with sewer in Green street. Sixty-nine private drains have been connected with sewers. Two hundred and sixty-four loads of sewer deposit have been cleared from the sewers and carted away. This is chiefly the silt from off the roads, which is washed or swept into the gullies. The sum of £268 10s. has been paid to East London Water Company for watering streets, including the sum of £27 6s. paid for the use of meters to tho various stand posts throughout the district. The cost of water for flushing the various sewers amounts to £41 10s. During the year the Tramway Company have completed their lines in the Parish, and the work of paving in Cambridge road to the extent of 9333 yards super carriageway rclaid and grouted, which was carried out in a most satisfactory manner. The relaying of the carriageway paving in the Hackney road was well carried out, although it was a work of some difficulty, in consequence of the straight lines of rails in some places interfering with the curve of the road. I caused a wide width of paving to be relaid on the outside of each outer rail: this necessitated the relaying of carriageway paving to the extent of 5649 yards. In Boundary street, 376 yards of dressed pitching has been laid and grouted, 259 yards of ditto provided and laid, 171 yards of carriageway relaid and grouted, 101 yards of second-hand pitching provided and laid, 84 yards super now 3 in. by 7 in. pitching laid and grouted, a moiety of which will be borne by the Yestry of Shoreditch. The following roads in this Parish have been made up, sewers laid in, and the footways curbed, with 12 in. by 6 in. granite curb, and paved with new York stone, at the cost of the owners:— Lawfranc road Conyers street Theydon road Burgoyne road Gernon road Extensive jobbing repairs have been carried out to the footway in the following streets and roads by men in the employ of the Vestry:— 23 Old Bethnal Green road Middleton street Canrobcrt street Mape street Turin street Church row Pott street Roman road St. Peter's street Globe street Bonner lane Bath street Collingwood street West street Clarkson street Hope street A quantity of new paving has also been laid in Old Ford road and Hare place. Considerable work has been done in repairing carriageways, channels, and crossings, in the following streets and roads:— Bath street Hackney road, by London street Shackelwell street Sclater street Fleet street Austin street Satchwell street Gibraltar walk Bethnal Green road Church row Hare place Providence place Cross street, St. Peter street Wellington place Selby street Globe street Spicer street George street, Cambridge road George street Old Nichol street North street Hague street Mape street Menotti street Viaduct street Thomas's passage Statement shewing amounts paid for materials, labour, and cartage, from and including March, 1864, to March, 1874: — Date.

A column lamp has also been erected in Hare street, opposite Hare court, and one in Peacock place, Cambridge road. The amount paid to the Imperial Gas Company for gas supplied to the public lamps was £3685 10s. 6d.; ditto to Commercial Gas Company, £264 15s. 6d. The price paid to the Imperial Gas Company for gas for lighting street lamps was raised by them at Christmas last from £4 18s. 0d. to £5 18s. 0d. per lamp per annum. I am, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, WILLIAM MUNDY. Saint Matthew Bethnal Green. VITAL STATISTICS AND SANITARY PROCEEDINGS FOR THE YEAR ENDING MARCH, 1874. Annual Report, by THOMAS SARVIS, M.D., Medical Officer of Health. LONDON: PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE VESTRY, by J. S. Forsaith & Sons, 329, Bethnal Green Road, E. 1874. Report. July. 1874. Gentlemen, In accordance with the requirements of the Metropolis Local Management Act, I have the honour to lay before you the Eighteenth: Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Proceedings of this Parish. The Vital Statistics are not so favourable as they were in the preceding year, when our death rate was only 20.8 per 1000; but such a death rate is very exceptional, and we can scarcely hope, even under the most favourable circumstances, to constantly maintain such a low one. In compiling the Statistics for this Report, I have separately enumerated the deaths under one year, which has not been done by me heretofore. In our Sanitary proceedings great endeavours have been made to remedy the defects in the structure of houses, their ventilation and drainage, and to improve the condition of the Parish generally; but where there are such a large number of badly-constructed houses— inhabited mainly by working men and labourers of the indigent class— we find it most difficult to keep them in good condition, for many of the people are of such uncleanly habits, that if the tenements be put in thorough repair by the landlord, they soon become dirty and dilapidated through the carelessness of the occupiers, thus requiring a constant supervision to be exercised by the Sanitary Staff. The total number of births registered in this district during the year was 5050, while the total deaths registered amounted to 3129, shewing an increase of 1929. The total for the preceding year was: births, 5187; deaths, 2588; the excess of births numbered 2599. 4 There was an increase in the number of deaths from Zymotic disease, which were registered as follows:— 1873. 1874. Small Pox 41 7 Measles 43 192 Scarlatine 17 103 Diptheria 6 5 Whooping Cough 147 101 Fever 44 58 Diarrhœa 143 159 Cholera 12 12 443 637 Increase 194 The deaths from Zymotic disease increased by 194; but even then they were below the average for the preceding five years. The mortality from this class was— In 1809 618 1870 963 1871 715 1872 745 1873 443 5 /3484.0/ 696.8 Thus it will be seen that the numbers were, for the preceding five years, on the average of 696.8, whilst for the past year it was 637, so that the annual decrease was, on the average, 59.8. The diseases which swelled our Zymotic death rate were Measles, which rose from 43 to 192; Scarlatina, from 17 to 103; Diarrhoea, from 143 to 159; Fever, from 44 to 51. Those that fell were Whooping Cough from 147 to 101; Small Pox, from 41 to 7; Diphtheria, from 6 to 5; Cholera (so registered), 12 each year. Small Pox, I trust, will never again become so widely spread as during the last epidemic; for I am happy to say Vaccination is being carried out thoroughly, and the Vaccination Officer continues to perform his duties vigorously. 5 POPULATION. I estimate the population of this Parish at 125,000, and the number of houses over 16,000 (there were 15,981 at the last census); this gives an average of 8 persons to each house; but I fear that some of our smallest tenements have more inhabitants than the largest, and that many cases of overcrowding exist. I am at a loss how to obviate this while rents are so high and houses so scarce. BIRTHS. The births during the year were 5050; the increase at the rate of 40 per 1000, while for the same period the average for the whole of London was 35.5, so that our birth rate was 4.5 per 1000 above the average for the entire Metropolis. DEATHS. The deaths during the year were 3129, and the annual rate of mortality 25 per 1000, one death in 5 being attributable to Zymotic disease. The average death rate for the whole of London during the same period was 22.5 per 1000. DEATHS IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. Workhouse 179 135 314 City of London Hospital 45 20 65 Bethnal House Lunatic Asylum 24 21 45 PAUPER ILLNESS. The following is the number of new cases attended during the year by the District Medical Officers:— District No. 1 Mr. Massingham 838 Cases. „ 2 Dr. Welch 936 „ „ 3 Dr. Richards 633 „ ,, 4 Mr. Defriez 666 „ „ 5 Dr. Burgess 535 „ „ 6 Dr. Sarvis 690 „ Total 4298 Cases. 6 These comprise the following crises of Zymotic disease Small Pox, 35; Measles, 209; Scarlet Fever, 74; Diphtheria, 18; Whooping Cough, 62; Fever, 231; Diarrhoea, 222. The Dispensary arrangements remain as at my last Report, and are found to work efficiently. CITY OF LONDON HOSPITAL FOR DISEASES OF THE CHEST. The following is the Medical Report for the Year, 1873:— in-patients. Patients under treatment on the 1st January, 187 93 Adimitted since 825 Remaining under treatment 31st December, 1873 91 Total under treatment during the year 734 Of these there have been—More or less relieved 671 9,492 Died 63 Patients admitted from the opening of the Wards in 1855, to the 31st December, 1873 Average number resident throughout the year 77 out-patients.

These have been frequently inspected during the year, and kept in good order. An application for a license was made by Mr. Farrow, 479, Bethnal Green Road, who had previously kept a cow for private use, but now wished to sell the milk. The Sanitary Committee having viewed the premises, and found them suitable, the license was unopposed, and consequently granted. Two new applications were made for slaughter-house licences, one by Mr. Frisby, 144, Barnet Grove, and one by Mr. John Long, 4, Essex Street, Cambridge Road. The Committee having viewed the premises, deemed them unsuitable in both cases, and the licenses were opposed and refused. The application of Mr. Mansfield, 7½, Digby Street, for renewal of a slaughter house license was opposed, and refused on the ground that it was not judicious to have a cow and slaughter house on the same premises. Mr. Day, 21, West Street, likewise applied for a renewal of a slaughter house license, but was opposed, and consequently refused (see page 19). The following are the Licensed Cow Houses:— Name.

Youdan, Georage 53, Green Street THE SLAUGHTER HOUSES call for special consideration, as the thirty years fixed for their entire suppression has nearly elapsed. It was by the Act of 7 & 8 Vic., cap. 84, sec. 55, passed in 1844, that certain businesses, deemed to be offensive or noxious, were forbidden to be established anew, and at the expiration of thirty years all old businesses were to be abolished if they were carried on within a specified distance of roadways or premises. The following is the clause:— LV. "For the purpose of making provision concerning businesses, offensive or noxious, be it enactcd, with regard to the following businesses, that is to say, blood-boiler, bone- 10 boiler, fellmonger, slaughterer of cattle, sheep, or horses, soap-boiler, tallow-melter, tripe-boiler, and any other like business, offensive or noxious, so far as relates to the erection of buildings in the neighbourhood of any such business, and so far as relates to the carrying on of any such business in the neighbourhood of any public way or of other buildings of the first or dwelling-house class. That it shall not be lawful hereafter to erect any buildings of the first or dwelling-house class nearer to than fifty feet from any building which shall be in use for any such offensive or noxious business ; but if a building already existing within fifty feet be hereafter burnt, pulled down, or destroyed by tempest, such building may be rebuilt; and that it shall not be lawful for any person to establish or newly carry on any such business, either in any building or vault, or in the open-air, at. a less distance than forty feet from any public way, or than fifty feet from any other such buildings of the first or dwelling-house class, and that if any such business be now carried on in any situation within such distances, then, from the expiration of the period of thirty years next, after the passing of this Act, it shall cease to be lawful to continue to carry on such business in such situation, save as is hereinafter provided; and that if any person erect any building in the neighbourhood of any such business contrary to this Act, then, on conviction thereof before two justices, he shall forfeit a sum not exceeding fifty pounds, for every day during which such building shall remain near to such offensive or noxious business; or if any person establish anew any such business, or carry on any such business contrary to this Act, then, on conviction thereof before two justices, such person is hereby made liable to forfeit, for every day during which such business shall be carried on, a sum not exceeding fifty pounds, as the justices shall determine, and that it shall be lawful for the justices also to award to the prosecutor such costs as shall be deemed reasonable." Now, although by this clause the newly-setting up of private slaughter houses was prohibited, yet, many new ones have been licensed during the past few years, and, for the benefit of those unacquainted with the system, I will here describe the routine that has to be gone through when a person desires to get such license. This can only be obtained once a year; that is in the month of October. A month's prior notice must be given to the Clerk to the Magistrates, and also to the Vestry, of the intention to apply at the special session holden for the purpose. Then the Sanitary Staff inspect the premises; see that they are properly constructed, ventilated, paved, and drained. A Report is sent up to the Sanitary Committee, who then visit the premises, and in their turn send up a Report to the Vestry, who have always, in my experience, adopted such Report, and voted powers for the Committee to carry out the resolutions contained therein. The Medical Officer of Health then takes his instructions as to who shall be opposed and who shall not. He attends at the sessions, when the names of those applying are called over; and when no opposition is given by the Vestry or others, the license is invariably granted. 11 "When the vestry oppose, then the ground for such opposition is heard by the Magistrates (sometimes counsel are employed on both sides, and the case argued), and I have never known a license granted in this Parish that was opposed by us, although, in many cases, it has been the reverse in other Parishes. All licenses have to be renewed year by year, and it is the custom of myself and Inspectors to visit some time prior to licensing day all slaughter houses in the several districts of the Parish, and if there is any defect in the drainage, paving, or cleanliness of the premises inspected (for they frequently get out of order), then a notice is served upon the occupier, when, if the work is not done by licensing day, then opposition is made provisionally, that is until the adjourned session, which takes place about a month after the ordinary one—and we always find that the fear of losing the license makes them carry out our requirements—and if all be done, the opposition is withdrawn and the license granted. It is in consequence of the belief that the law of 1844 would be carried into effect that many slaughter houses, not of the most eligible kind, have been allowed to remain, the Sanitary Authorities not wishing to interfere with them as they believed all would be so soon swept away. Last Year, however, Dr. Brewer brought in a Bill to repeal the abolishing clause. Dr. Brewer's short Bill consists of the following clause:— "From and after the passing of this Act, the slaughtering of cattle or sheep by a butcher, in his slaughter house, duly licensed, shall not be held to be carrying on an offensive or noxious business within the meaning of the said Act, 7 and 8 Vic., c. 84." But this was withdrawn, and the matter referred to a Select Committee of the House of Commons, The evidence given was very conflicting : seme asserting that they were quite inoffensive, while others averred that they were most deleterious to the public health. Most of the Medical Officers of Health investigated the matter, and a paper was read at a meeting of the Association by T. Orme Dodfield, Esq., M.D., Medical Officer of Health for the Parish of Kensington, when a lengthy discussion ensued, and the following motion and amendment were moved. Dr. Liddle then moved, and Professor Tidy seconded:— "That in the opinion of this meeting, the slaughtering of cattle in the private slaughter houses in London should be abolished, and that a certain number of public slaughter houses should be created either 12 under the supervision of the Corporation of London or the Metropolitan Board of Work; and that those Corporations should be urged to undertake the erection of such buildings, and also the management of them forthwith." Mr. Iliff proposed an amendment, which Mr. Burge seconded:—'" That it is expedient that the 55th section of the Act of 1844 be repealed, but that the number of slaughter houses be gradually diminished by the abolition of many which are not in a thoroughly fit condition, and which have been in a measure tolerated on account of the uncertainty of the law ; and that general, precise, stringent, and uniform regulations should be laid down to be adopted by the Vestries, and that greater power be given to the Local Authority to take proceedings at any time of the year, in cases where untrapped drains, want of care and cleanliness, cruelty, and generally deficient arrangements for layerage are found to exist—penalties being recoverable in any Police Court; and that no slaughter house be licensed until the owner has signed a copy of bye-laws, pledging himself to carry them out fully and faithfully." On a show of hands being taken, only the mover and seconder appeared for the amendment. The motion was then put and carried. A paper was also read at a meeting of the National Association for the promotion of Social Science, by Dr. Hardwicke, Medical Officer of Health for Paddington, on the "Abolition of Private Slaughter Houses in Towns, and on Future Legislation for Noxious Trades," the main purport of which was to shew the unhealthiness of private slaughter houses and the desirability of abolishing them, and in their stead to erect public abattoirs. The following are the conclusions arrived at by the reader of the paper*:— The site most convenient for the establishing of a public abattoir should be an open space or field, not farther distant in the suburbs of a town or city than a short drive or walk; it should be suitable for one or more blocks of building, near a railway, water communication, or the cattle market. Tho following buildings should be contiguous, but distinct from each other:— 1. Slaughter house for bullocks, sheep, and pigs, with good water supply at high pressure; open ventilation, good drainage, asphalte floor, with convenience for the removal of blood, offal, and carcases of animals. 2. A set of cattle pens or layerage, with store for fodder, water trough, facility for cleansing, and the removal of manure, &c. 3. An engine and boiler house, with tall chimney for carrying off gases, according to the necessity of trade, with sufficient steam power for the tallow-melting tanks, grease works, bone boiling, glue making, &c. ; hot water for washing and cleansiug. * Sessional proceeding)* of the National Association for the Promotion of Science; with which is united tho Society for Promoting tho Amendment of the Law, Tuesday, April 7th, 1874. 13 4. A store-house for hide3, for bones, wool, hair, &c.; and the blood and offal, and all offensive materials, to be kept in covered tanks. The making of animal charcoal may be desirable, and other processes which 1 need not mention here. 5. In an adjoining part of the same premises, or field, should be the knacker's yard, with suitable appliances. 6. Dwellings for men and stabling for horses may have to be provided for those who have to be employed on the premises, or for carrying out the work. The main points I endeavour to prove are these:— 1. The impracticability of attempting to re-construct the old slaughter houses in built up parts of towns. 2. The impossibility of securing, in the present private slaughter houses, ample air space, means of cleansing, and drainage sufficient to prevent them from becoming nuisances injurious to the health of people living in their vicinity—nuisances arising from the pollution of the air, drains, and subsoil. The remedy I propose is the erection of abattoirs in convenient suburban localities, or where the objectionable practice of driving cattle in streets and thoroughfares can be avoided; where cattle can be kept sweet and clean in well-kept pens, duly provided with pure water, fresh air, shade in hot and shelter in cold weather; where they are less exposed to violence and brutality of person; and where the transport of blood, offal, hides, and tallow can be effected, without nuisance or complaint of neighbours, to places where they can either be sold, or preserved by methods free from objection, or utilized at once for the owners thereof. And lastly, this is the most important recommendation, where, as I maintain, there is no difficulty in the inspection, by competent judges, of the cattle before they are killed, or of the meat supplied, either in carcase or otherwise, to the public markets, or to retail dealers. In conclusion, permit me to remark, that it will neither be creditable to Parliament, nor to the local governing bodies of the metropolis and large towns, to endure the present state of things a day longer than is necessary. The Act, as I have said, will shortly come into operation, and a great achievement will be performed by simply remaining quiet and doing nothing at all. Should any efforts be made by persons interested in the prolongation of the Act, it will then, I urge, become the duty of this Association to make some representation to Government, with a view to effectually putting a stop to a system so offensive, so injurious, and so repugnant to the feelings of all right-minded persons. 14 discussion. F. S. POWELL, Esq., in the chair. Among those present were the following: Mr. R. T. Arnold, Dr. Bateson, Mr. J. J. .Brown, Mr. Sneade Brown, Mr. It. Calvert, Dr. Carpenter, Mr. W. J. Cooper, Dr. Thomas Dudfield, Professor Gamgee, Mr. C. V. Game, Mr. P. C. Greatorex, Mr. C. J. Greece, Dr. Hardwicke, Mr. E. L. Jacob, Mr. D. Jarvis, Mr. II. N. Mozley, Mr. C. A Radcliffe, Dr. George Ross, Dr. Sarvis, Mr. G. W. Shaw, Mr. Joseph Shrout, Mr. J. Simont, jun., Mr. Thomas Webber. Dr. Sarvis (Medical Officer of Health for Bethnal Green), while agreeing in the main with the writer of the paper, thought there were some points mentioned in it which were hardly capable of being carried out in practice. It was all very well to say that in the public abattoirs you could see to the quality of the meat during life, but, judging from the way the regulations of the present markets are carried out, it would, he thought, be difficult to secure this. It is supposed that all the meat which comes to the markets is seen by the inspectors, but, as a matter of fact, a large portion is never seen at all by them ; and besides this, a great quantity that is sold never reaches the markets. lie was doubtfnl whether the measure proposed would have much influence in the direction intended. In the hot summer weather, he thought, there was an advantage in having slaughter houses in the vicinity of the place where the meat was to be sold. Nothing, at this season, was so injurious to meat as exposing it to transit. It was impossible to remove it then safely to a great distance. It was, therefore, necessary to give our veto against the total abolition of slaughter houses. Those which were badly drained and ventilated we might cease to license; but it would be better, he thought, rather than entirely abolish them, to feel our way gradually to the desired end, keeping the best, and providing that no other should be licensed except such as had the best appliances. With regard to the noxious trades, he was entirely of opinion that they should all be carried out of London. Professor Gamgee was much astonished to hear a medical officer of health advocate the continuance for one day of a single private slaughter house in any city of the world. It was also astonishing to him to find how hard it was for the public interest to be protected in opposition to that of a trade, which always would have advocates looking out for, and seeking in every possible way, to add to its pecuniary advantages, and counting as nothing the sanitary well-being of the public at large. He was stating a fact, when he said that private slaughter houses rendered it impossible to inspect animals, and prevent tho sale of diseased meat. He was sorry to have to acknowledge the fact that even the government virtually sanctioned the trade in diseased animals, which was attended with such bad consequences. In 1869 he had had occasion specially to notice the tendency there was to consider it a venial offence to sell the carcases of animals so tainted, and he had been favoured with evidence intended to show that it was impossible to put a stop to the trade in diseased meat. He, however, confidently affirmed, that wherever this was sanctioned, the production of animal food was curtailed. Since 1842, when the freetrade in cattle disease, rather than free-trade in meat, had been established, the country had been drained of its cows, and the reproduction of these animals had been diminished, 15 in comparison with the increase of population. The private slaughter houses offered facilities for keeping up this trade of supplying meat which was often poisonous. It was wrong to bring forward medical men to give evidence in regard to diseased meat. There was but one safe rule, and that was the one which had been given by the great law-giver, Moses, namely, that such meat should not be eaten. If we had had a law to suppress the trade in this kind of meat, we should probably have meat twenty-five or thirty per cent. cheaper than it is now. Any rational method to put a stop to disease would, if successful, add largely to the food of the country. It was very difficult to impress this fact on the public mind. Last century this country was invaded by cattle disease. Cattle were brought freely from other countries, and they propagated the disease throughout the land. The attention of our physicians was called to the subject, and it was here that the principle, which had been lately recognized and credited to other countries, namely, that of stamping out the disease, was first brought into practice. After that, the traffic in diseased animals was stopped, and the British cattle were isolated from the foreign. Up to 1840 animals increased in numbers, and instead of the price of meat going up, it went down. But after this date, Sir Robert Peel opened the ports to foreign cattle, and since then we have seen nothing but a steady deterioration. This country would have been many millions of money richer in cattle if foreign ones had not been imported. With regard to the safeguards which the present system kept up against diseased meat, he could assure the meeting that he would have no difficulty whatever in getting a large quantity of such meat if he desired it. This showed a condition of things inherent to, and inseparable from, the system of private slaughter houses. In Edinburgh the opposite system had been brought to a state of great efficiency. The ignorance in the minds of those who were able to introduce a better state of things was, he thought, disgraceful, and it was intolerable that there should be no system of watchfulness, the want of which condemned our people, in many instances, virtually to starvation. Simple precautions, such as were mentioned in the paper, would obviate these evils. He would develope, as much as possible, the free-trade in meat, but stop that in disease. He thought its abolition was impossible so long as the private slaughter houses existed. He had come to the conclusion, from what he had seen of the use made of diseased meat in sausages, and by the third-rate butchers, that it was with them impossible to have any system adequate to protect the public. Mr. Sneade Brown called attention to the evidence which had been given in a former number of the "Transactions" of the Society, in regard to Leith and other towns, where private slaughter houses were not allowed, and in which it was shown that there had been an advantage to everyone. He himself had, in common with others who lived in his neighbourhood, experienced the nuisance the vicinity of one of these places created in a very unpleasant way; and he could feel for the poor in a similar case, for, not being in a position to defend themselves, it being much worse for them than for those who could do so. In a Report issued by the Government in 1865, where the slaughter houses had been examined, in the course of an inquiry instituted for the purpose of devising measures for the prevention of a disease which had appeared on the continent, there were some terrible pictures of the condition of slaughter houses. All of them were found to have objectionable features. In his (Mr. Brown's) opinion, unless these places could be put into proper condition, they should be closed altogether. Dr. Alfred Carpenter said the question ought to be taken up in reference to every large town in the kingdom. In the district with which he was connected new slaughter houses had been forbidden and public abattoirs erected. But he was sorry to say they 16 had not been much used. The butchers preferred to continue using their private places; perhaps because they could slaughter their diseased cattle without being observed. The adoption of the public abattoirs would be an advantage for the poor. In the private slaughter houses even good meat became tainted by contact with the bad conditions which prevailed. As for the objection taken against their abolition, on the ground of the difficulty of transit in hot weather, he (Dr. Carpenter) thought there would be no harm done if at such a time meat were not eaten at all. Much of the disease that prevailed then was produced by eating animal food in a state of change, and people would be much better without it. The law required to be altered to meet the requirements of the case in many ways. And first with regard to the inspectors. It could not be cxpected that the class of men who were appointed to this office were likely to be really efficient; nor was the remuneration they received such as was sufficient to overcome the temptation to shut their eyes when occasion offered, and "palm oil" offered a strong inducement to do so. In company with brother magistrates, he had had to ait in court, and hear an application for the renewal of a slaughter house license, and in face of strong and unanimous evidence against it on the part of those who lived in its vicinity, they had found that the law did not allow them to interfere at all, because the officer of the local authority could not see it was a nuisance. He hoped this Society would make a strong effort against the continuance of such places. The evidence of the Parliamentary Committee which sat upon the subject was entirely one-sided—no one was heard adverse to them. Dr. George Ross (Medical Officer of Health for St. Giles') supported the views contained in the paper. lie thought Dr. Sarvis had been misled by the evidence of the butchers. The principal point in their declaration was that meat would be made dearer to the consumer. And this had influenced certain medical officers to support their views. But he did not believe in this reason. The real one was that they desired to keep the matter in their own hands. Now they could, by keeping back the live stock, always command the market. It was not the interest of the public the butcher sought, but his own. Nothing was more abominable than the condition of the slaughter houses, and there could be no doubt that if they were abolished it would be a great boon to the public. He was opposed to any compromise, because he could see no way to improvement short of entire abolition. There was a much greater difficulty in dealing with the subject in this metropolis than in small towns. There would be a great difficulty in providing for four abattoirs for the metropolis as proposed, and in his opinion it would be better that Copenhagen Market should be supplied with accommodation adequate to the wants of the whole metropolis. Under proper regulations for the prevention of nuisances, if this were the case, there would be no more than there are now connected with live cattle. Some nuisances there must always be attendant upon the work, but by this system, taken as a whole, he thought there would be less than by any other. The butcher could communicate by telegraph from any part of London, and order any number of cattle he might choose to be killed. Subdividing in this matter he thought would not succeed. He had never found that compromises answered. Five-sixths of our legislation was of the nature of compromise, and the same proportion ended in faiiure. Mr. Charles V. Game had been interested in the paper; but he looked upon it as entirely theoretical. He had, perhaps, had as much experience of slaughtering and of the markets as any man in London. It appeared to him that the law on the subject of slaughter houses was not understood. These places were licensed by the magistrates after application had been made to the local authorities, and an inspection by the medical officer. If there were no objections the license was granted. But the premises were 17 under the supervision of the police and the medical officer, and were accessible to them at all times. If they were not in proper order they would report them, and the consequence would be that the license would be suspended, and the place would not be allowed to be opened again until the requirements were complied with. The license was renewed annually, and the person requiring it had to appear either personally or by deputy. The supervision thus carried out was much better, he thought, than it would be for larger places. If a private slaughter house were objectionable, the evils would be multiplied fifty-fold in the place where the larger one was located. He denied that private slaughter houses were necessarily injurious to health. He had lived for twenty years, and brought up a family over one, and they had been as healthy a family as any in London. He did not think animal matter was so injurious as vegetable matter. The nearer the man lived to the slaughter house, the more likely was he to keep it in a good state. In his own business the blood had always been taken away immediately, and there was not any objectionable matter left at night. It would be impossible to do as much as this in public slaughter houses. With them the expense of conveying the meat to the shops would increase its price. He would rather see facilities given for keeping the present slaughter houses in a cleanly and creditable manner. Mr. R. C. Gkeatorex said that the gentleman who had last spoken had noticed the immense supervision that was necessary, and which he said was carried out. That he (Mr. Greatorex) thought was rather—as so much was required—a reason why the private slaughter houses should be abolished, for there would then be no necessity for any at all. Their position was bad, and all sanitary science agreed that they were not only injurious to the health of the people, but also to the food. The poor animals passing through several dealers' hands, and driven from one place to the other, became in such a state to be unfit for food. This also enhanced the price to the consumer, for each person must have his per centage of profit. On economical grounds he advocated the abolition of the slaughter houses. And he would call attention to the very unnatural way in which cow-houses are constructed. The animal is shut up in a kind of black hole, and there fed upon all kinds of stimulating food, and hence we do not get healthy milk. Mr. H. N. Mozley asked if there was any means of forming a definite idea of the proportionate amount of diseased meat actually sold to that which was seized ? Dr. Hardwicke, in reply, stated that there were no facts sufficiently certain whereon to found any data; but there was no doubt at all that the quantity was enormous, and was made up into sausages, or sold by the low-class butchers. The Chairman said he had taken much interest in the subject, and a year or two ago had felt it his duty to take such parliamentary action as led to the defeat of Dr. Brewer's bill. Something more precise in the definition, and more stringent in the remedies, was required to meet the condition of the slaughter houses in our large towns. The matter, as it concerned them, should not be left till found to be a nuisance, but taken as being, in a degree, a nuisance per se. And the only question was whether these places should be under strict regulations or entirely forbidden. He had taken note of the evidence offered before the Select Committee of the House of Commons of 1873, on this subject, and of the character of the witnesses, and had found that many frivolous and irrelevant questions were asked. A great experiment had been carried on at Edinburgh, which had resulted in a great saving financially, and an improvement in the public health. But no one from that city was examined as to these matters. A great discussion had likewise been carried on at Liverpool on the subject, and definite results arrived at; but no gentleman from that town was consulted. Most of the witnesses examined were interested persons 18 carrying on the very trades, the nature and effect of which were under discussion. A medical man or two was among them, and examined; but he (the Chairman) feared not respected. It was a misfortune that this inquiry should have led to so disappointing an issue With regard to the divergence in the facts stated by two of the speakers on the subject of the powers of the magistrates, he thought the letter of the law was with Mr. Game, whose opinion was the more exact of the two. But there was a difference in the law as applied to the metropolis and places outside it. If the favourable conditions, which that gentleman had induced in his case, were general, the public health would be the gainer. But he (the Chairman) was afraid this was a theoretical condition, and, as such, must be thrown aside. With regard to dairies lie could not see why we should have them in London at all. He was quite convinced, in his own mind, that we should have in our great cities slaughter houses under the control of the public authority. lis felt doubt, however, whether they should be open to any one to slaughter in them when he chose. He would have them let to individuals. If they were placed entirely and exclusively in the hands of the public authority, that authority would go to sleep. But if let to individuals under suitable conditions, it would take care that the tenants observed these conditions. If we were to have private places we must have a license on the one hand, and bye-laws on the other. The license must be granted by the authority which supervised, with rigid conditions and rigid bye-laws regulating the manner in which the business should be conducted. These should be enforced by a fine before the magistrate, and absolute confiscation of the license in extreme cases. In this matter it was our duty to stimulate public opinion, and watch its operation. It was impossible to enforce such things greatly in advance of public sentiments. But before we could have what we desired in a really efficient manner, we must have a strong municipal authority. The first element of success was an authority possessing the public confidcnce. To the spread of scientific education he looked for good results, and he was convinced that one of the results of the public education of the country would eventually be far more effective than laws relating to the public health. Dr. Carpenter moved—"That the subject be referred to the Standing Committee of the Health Department, in order that the Council may be recommended to take action in the matter if necessary." Dr. T. Dudfield seconded the motion, and in doing so, called attention to the fact that a great many slaughter houses had been tolerated by the medical inspectors, which would never have been allowed to continue had it not been known that they were, as a whole, in consequence of the law, non-permanent. Mr. Sneade. Brown proposed, and Dr. Carpenter seconded, a vote of thanks to the Chairman, which was carried unanimously. I have placed before you the opinions of various gentlemen thoroughly conversant with the subject, and you will see the great diversity that exists amongst those best informed. I do so, as I feel, that should a new Act be passed this session, thus allowing the continuance of private slaughter houses, it will still leave the power of licensing them mainly in the hands of the Local Authorities; and it will bo for you to consider what course ought to be taken to protect the vested rights and interests of the trade on the one hand, and the health, comfort, and well-being of the population at large on the other. 19 DISEASED MEAT. About 2 cwt. of putrid meat was seized by Sanitary Inspector W. W. Burrows, from the premises of Mr. Bridges, 5, Virginia Row, a Germansausage maker. The meat in question had been kept for a considerable length of time, and was salted preparatory to its being manufactured into saveloys. It was condemned, and subsequently destroyed, the case being tried before Mr. Bushby, at "Worship Street Police Court, and the defendant was mulcted in the fine of £10 and costs. A body of Cow-beef was seized on the premises occupied by Thomas Hanchant Day, cow-keeper, 21, West Street, Prospect Place. It was taken before Mr. Bushby, at Worship Street, condemned, and destroyed. Mr. Day had a license to slaughter as well as keep cows, and there is no doubt that the intention was to sell this meat for human food, as it was dressed in the ordinary manner that beef is prepared for market. Proceedings were taken, when it was endeavoured to shew that it was intended for cat's meat. This the Magistrate did not believe, and he fined the defendant £10 and costs.* Five legs of mutton were seized from the Workhouse. They were taken to Worship Street, condemned, and destroyed. Proceedings were instituted against the contractor, Mr. Joseph Green, of Hackney Road, the Magistrate inflicting a fine of £50 and costs. PUTRID FISH. A quantity of Haddocks, in a putrid state, was seized by Sanitary Inspector Lapworth, from the premises of a man named Harper. The Inspectors at Billingsgate were sent for, who gave their opinion that the fish was fit for the purpose intended, viz., to be smoked, and afterwards sold for food. This case was likewise tried before Mr. Bushby, and the sequel shewed that that Magistrate took a different view of the case, for the defendant was fined £3 and costs. ADULTERATION ACT. An Analyst has been appointed, and a great deal of preliminary matter gone into. Samples have been obtained by the Inspectors and submitted for analyzation, but owing to the present unsatisfactory state of the law, very little business of a decisive character has been transacted. * Mr. Day's license was opposed at the adjourned sessions and consequently refused. 20 SANITARY MISCELLANEA. The returns of the Sanitary Inspectors give the following results:— Houses or Premises inspected 8568 Workshops inspected 1069 Notices served 3717 Summonses issued 57 Number of Summonses heard 57 Number of Visits to ascertain the progress of work required to be done under notices Served 34,272 Work Executed in compliance with Notices served. Houses cleansed and purified 1357 Workshops cleansed and purified 347 Houses closed as unfit for human habitation 1 Cases in which defective drainage has been remedied 1800 Cesspools abolished 11 Closets cleansed and purified 2136 Removals of accumulations of Dung and other offensive matter 1404 Animals removed in consequence of being a nuisance, or kept in a condition injurious to public health 144 The number of houses and premises inspected during the year was 8568, including 1069 workshops. These required 3717 notices to be served. The number of visits to ascertain progress of work was, at the lowest computation, 34,272, for some had to be visited 10 or 12 times before owners would remedy the defects complained of, whilst others would only require one or two, so that I have taken the moderate average of four to each case, which gives the number as above. Fifty-seven summonses have been taken out and heard by the Magistrates, at Worship Street. This has caused great loss of time, as constant adjournments have taken place, causing the attendance of the Inspectors and myself three times before a case has been adjudicated. The Sanitary Committee have met nearly every week, the Sanitary Staff being in attendance for nearly two or three hours each time, and frequently after the sitting the Committee have viewed premises whero nuisances have existed, being ten or eleven o'clock before finishing. All known cases of fever have been attended to, and the rooms disinfected and cleanscd. When necessary the beds have been burnt. A 21 more disagreeable duty than this could scarcely be conceived, for not only do the Inspectors run the risk of taking the fever, but the things are generally so filthy as to be most repulsive. Then there is the want of proper accommodation for burning. Various places have been tried for the purpose, but so great is the nuisance that where we destroy them the neighbourhood becomes alarmed, and it is only by securing the presence of the police that we prevent a breach of the peace. All cow and slaughter-houses have been kept under supervision, and one cow keeper has been fined for not removing the dung in a proper manner. The water supply has called for constant attention, owing to the reluctance of some owners to conform with the requirements of the Company, and the water was in consequence cut off from 1072 houses. In all these cases notices had to be served, and the premises visited several times before it was again laid on. DUSTING, &c. This is still a very vexatious point, for it appears that whoever the contractor may be, he seems to try "how not to do it." Complaints are continually being made that dust is left in the bins for months. Even the public receptacles are frequently overflowing, thus engendering disease by their impure exhalations, and giving to passers by an impression of the uncleanliness and want of care of the inhabitants. Whilst I am on this subject, I may state that great exertions have been made by the Sanitary Staff to get the costermongers to take away the refuse of the stalls, especially on Saturday nights, so that the streets should present a cleanly appearance on Sunday; but although bills have been distributed, the men cautioned, and some summoned and fined, I am sorry to say that I cannot report much improvement. Thanking the Vestry, and especially those Members forming the Sanitary Committee, for their cordial co-operation and support, I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen, Yours obediently, THOS. SARVIS.

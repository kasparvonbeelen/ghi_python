REPORT. TO THE MAYOR, ALDERMEN AND COUNCILLORS OF THE METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF BETHNAL GREEN. Sir and Gentlemen, I have the honour to place before you my thirtieth Annual Report on the Vital Statistics and Sanitary Condition of the Borough of Bethnal Green. The report covers the fifty-two weeks included in the registration year 1905 which terminated on 30th day of December last. BIRTHS. The total number of births registered in Bethnal Green during the year is 4,321, against 4,526 in 1904, a decrease of 205. The excess of the births over the deaths is 1,903. Table "A" shews this and compares the two vears. TABLE A. 1904. 1905. Estimated population in the middle of the year 130,207 130,401 Total Births 4.526 4,321 Total Deaths 2,489 2,418 Excess of Births over Deaths, shewing the natural increase of the population 2,037 1,903 8 ESTIMATE OF POPULATION. The Registrar General estimates the population of Bethnal Green at 130,401 in the middle of the year 1905; judged by the fall in the number of births this figure appears to over-estimate our numbers, but I have no doubt that it fairly represents the population of the Borough, inasmuch as the alien immigration, which has been going on for some years, continues unchecked; many whole streets and blocks of new buildings in Bethnal Green are full of Russian Jews to the entire exclusion of our own people. These particular aliens, when they settle in London, herd together in colonies where they retain and continue their filthy habits and customs, and as they do not trouble to learn the language of their adopted country it is difficult to teach them better. I did hope that the effect of recent legislation would have placed some check upon the influx of these undesirables, but unfortunately for East London the present Government appears to be swayed by sentimental rather than practical considerations, for their anxiety lest a few bona-fide political refugees should be denied sanctuary has resulted in rendering the Alien Immigration Act of last session a dead letter. The recently issued memorandum of the Home Secretary to the immigration officers directs that permission to land is to be given to any immigrant who simply alleges that he is flying from persecution in disturbed districts; the "inexactitude" of any statement made by these Russian aliens, even in the most 9 solemn circumstances, is common knowledge to all whose duty compels their attendance at Worship Street Police Court. The following extract is taken from the British Medical Journal of March 24th, 1906:— THE ABROGATION OF THE ALIENS ACT. The Home Secretary has issued an Order directing that whereas formerly on the grounds of economy, small batches of aliens—that is to say, batches numbering less than thirteen—were allowed to land without inspection, that number shall now be raised to twenty. The cost of applying the Act to every port where ships might arrive with one or two foreigners would have been enormous and quite unnecessary. The alien laws are directed chiefly, if not entirely, against the wave of immigration through Riga, Bremen and Hamburg to this country. They would not have been enacted had it not been for the fact that America, by selecting the best for herself, leaves the worst class for England. By a judicious observation of the arrivals on non-immigrant ships, it would have been easy to have named the lines trafficking in undesirables, and to have brought these lines under the Act by special order. The naming of any single line would have certainly acted as a powerful deterrent to others from indulging in the same class of traffic, as the delay occasioned by inspection means a loss which cannot be covered by the passage money of some dozen immigrants. With this power in his hands, with the knowledge that Russian undesirables are, in fact, being brought over in small numbers, and can only be stopped by the moral effect in the ports of embarkation of rigid measures at home, the action taken by the Secretary of State is very open to criticism. By raising the number of undesirables that a ship may bring with impunity from 12 to 20, he has relieved the minds of the less scrupulous ship-owners of any fears they may have entertained as to the consequences of bringing the leavings of regular immigrant lines. By a memorandum to immigration officers he has expressed a desire which is tantamount to an order, that leave to land should be given to any immigrants who allege they are flying from persecution in disturbed districts, and that where any doubt exists as to the truth of an alien's statement to this effect, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the alien. Medical inspectors are asked to be mindful of the fact that 10 cruel hardship might result to any alien in a critical state of health, should he be peremptorily ordered back to his own country. In one brief debate, the reports of which are in the hands of all the powerful agencies who encourage this tide of immigration for profit or from motives of racial sympathy, the moral effect of the Act has been destroyed, not so much by this or that new regulation or memorandum as by the patent disloyalty of the Home Secretary to the spirit of the provisions, which he has so manipulated as to render the Act a dead letter. With a delicate irony he has asked for a period of time during which he may watch the operation of the Act. Given the regulations and the memorandum by which immigration officers are effectually debarred from any kind of useful action, there should be no difficulty in finding at the end of six months' trial that the new law has entailed a vast expenditure with a minimum or even a negative result. BIRTHS IN SUB-DISTRICTS. The number of Births registered in the three subdistricts into which Bethnal Green is sub-divided is shewn in the following table, while for purposes of comparison the population of each sub-district, estimated to the middle of the year 1905, is also shewn. TABLE B. BIRTHS IN SUB-DISTRICTS. District. Births. 1904. Births. 1905. Estimated Population in 1905 North 1,892 1,808 51,617 South 1,194 1,088 33,266 East 1,440 1.425 45,518 11 DEATHS. The weekly returns of the Local Registrars forwarded to me shew particulars of 2,351 deaths in Bethnal Green, indicating a crude death rate of 18.03. Amongst the deaths so registered are included those of 295 nonresidents, who died whilst under treatment in Bethnal Green Public Institutions; eight other persons, also nonresidents, died violent or sudden deaths while temporarily within the boundaries of the Borough; a Coroner's Inquest was held in each case. They were:— The librarian of the Bethnal Green Free Library who resided at Dalston and died at the library from syncope and pleuritic effusion; a shop assistant of Notting Hill Gate shot himself with a pistol at Cambridge Heath Station; a hairdresser from Manchester died at 284, Brick Lane, he suffered from heart disease and fainted from excitement in the street; an aged warehouse porter from Walthamstow died from bronchitis and kidney disease at 54, Turin Street; a bandsawyer from Hackney was found drowned in the Regent's Canal; a dock labourer from Commercial Road was chased out of Victoria Park by some boys and died from excitement and heart disease in Old Ford Road; a female school teacher from Hackney drowned herself in the canal; a porter, aged sixteen, residing in Hackney, died after a blow over the heart at 250, Cambridge Road; he suffered from heart disease. For purposes of correction the deaths of these 303 non-residents must be struck out of the number actually returned by the registrars. On the other hand, I have received information from Somerset House of the 12 deaths of 356 persons ordinarily resident in Bethnal Green but who died in Public Institutions outside our boundaries; also of fourteen inhabitants of Bethnal Green who died suddenly in various parts of London and upon whose bodies Coroner's Inquests were held. The following are the particulars:—A drunken carman was suffocated by his own vomit while lying upon some straw at Orange Mews, Mile End; a teacher of Hebrew, who suffered from heart disease, died from syncope following exposure to cold at 85, Kingsland road; a man aged 56 died from heart disease at 59, Mare Street; a man aged 51 hanged himself at Dunloe Street, Shoreditch; a man aged 21 was fighting in Middlesex Street, City, he fell, and was run over and killed by a passing van; a woman aged 66 died in Mansell Street from heart disease; a man aged 53 shot himself with a pistol at 52, Commercial Street. The following persons were found drowned:— In the Thames—A female aged 69; a male aged 43. In the River Lea—Males aged respectively 43, 68 7, 28 (a suicide). In the Regent's Canal—A male aged 13. These fourteen, together with the 356 Hospital deaths form a total of 370, and after adding these and substracting the 303 non-residents, there remains a net total of 2418. 1905. Death from all causes. 13 The deaths in the sub-districts were as under:— North 979 South 629 East 781 Previous residence unknown 29 Total 2,418 DEATH RATE. We show a mortality for the year 1904 of 18.55. This is 0.5 per thousand below the rate of the previous year, but our usual relation to the general Metropolitan rate is not quite maintained, for this also has decreased, and is one per thousand below that of the previous year. The death rate for the whole of London was 15.1 as against 16.1 for 1904. MORTALITY RATES IN SUB-DISTRICTS.

The births registered during the year numbered 4,321, and were equal to a rate of 33T3 per thousand population. This rate is one-and-a-half per thousand lower than that of the preceding year, which was 34.75. The general Metropolitan rate has also decreased and stands at 27T. This is the lowest on record, it is as usual about six below our own. In the registration sub-districts of the Borough the birth rates were as under; for purposes of comparison the death rate in each sub-district is also shewn:— TABLE F. Sub-Districts. Birth Rate.

First Quarter 156 Second Quarter 284 Third Quarter 241 Fourth Quarter 331 Total 1,012 These figures indicate a marriage rate of 15.5 to every thousand persons, as against 16.9 in the County of London. 16 DEATHS OF INFANTS. Twenty-seven and a half per cent. of the total deaths from all causes were those of infants aged less than twelve months; for out of 4,321 infants born alive, 652 died within one year of their birth; thus giving a rate, calculated upon the total births, of 151 per thousand. The corresponding rate for the whole of London is 129. In the March quarter 25.7 per cent of the total births during the year were registered but the proportion of infantile deaths was only 22 per cent. of the yearly number. In the June quarter the births were 24.7 per cent. of the whole with 20 per cent. of the deaths. In the September quarter the mortality increased, for though only 25.8 per cent. of the yearly births were registered yet the deaths rose to 31.5 per cent. In the last quarter the births fell to 23.8 per cent. whilst the infantile deaths registered were 26.3 per cent. of the year's total. In the appendix will be found a new set of tables (Table V. in four parts) referring exclusively to infantile deaths. These tables are prepared by direction of the Local Government Board and will repay careful examination. Of the total 652 infantile deaths, 140 a proportion of 21.5 per cent. occurred in the first week of life, and 203 or 31.2 per cent. in the first four weeks of life. In the second month 11.4 and in the third 9.6 per cent. of the total deaths during the first year occurred. The great mortality during the first week of life is principally due to ante-natal causes. Table V. shows that 124, or 88.6 per cent. of the deaths during this period, were due to premature birth and congenital debility. Five newly 17 born infants died from convulsions (they were probably injured during birth) and seven were overlaid. With the exception of the last seven, all these deaths must be considered, so far as the infants themselves are concerned, as unpreventable. Any measures having for their object the reduction of this mortality must be directed to improve the condition and environment of the mothers during the last months of pregnancy. Referring again to Table V. and classifying the chief causes of infantile deaths in order of fatality we find them as under:— 1. Premature birth and congenital defects (excluding atrophy and debility) 140 2. Diarrhoeal Diseases 123 3. Bronchitis and Pneumonia 120 4. Want of breast milk, Atrophy, Debility and Marasmus 85 5. Convulsions and simple meningitis 43 6. Tubercular diseases 42 7. Overlaying 41 8. Zymotic diseases (excluding diarrhoea) 34 9. Syphilis 7 1. Premature birth and congenital defects have already been referred to. All prematurely born infants who succumbed (with the exception of four) died within the first three months of life. 2. 123 deaths were attributed to Diarrhoeal diseases, of which the infective or Zymotic form was responsible for 93. A large amount of this mortality as well as that from Marasmus and other wasting diseases is due to artificial feeding. Very few infants who draw their sustenance solely from nature's fount suffer from diarrhoea. Most women are able if they so choose, to suckle their children ; moreover it must always be borne in mind that cow's milk and condensed milk are much 18 more costly foods than breast milk. Cow's milk properly diluted and sweetened is the best available substitute, but is a very imperfect one as it is deficient in fat and contains too much casein (cheesy matter). Condensed milk, even of the best kind, is very fatal. It is twice as dangerous as fresh cow's milk, for it is a preserved food and may cause scurvy rickets. It has been estimated that babies fed upon condensed milk have one hundred times as many deaths as breast fed children. Most of the widely advertised patent foods are absolutely poisonous. They all contain starch which infants are quite unable to digest, and their use should be prohibited by law. One cause of the deleterious effect of condensed milk arises from the fact that the whole tin is not consumed at once so soon as it is opened but is allowed to lie open and exposed to contamination from dust and flies. Flies are very foul feeders; they browse indifferently upon tuberculous sputum, dust bins and sweet condensed milk, to which latter they constantly convey the germs of disease. Another cause of trouble is the dummy or baby's comforter. I have often seen this article, which has been dropped on to the floor of a tram car, picked up by the mother and after a perfunctory wipe with a foul handkerchief, popped back again into the child's mouth. Feeding bottles with long tubes and foul teats need only mention to be reprobated. 4. Bronchitis and Pneumonia caused 120 deaths— all except twenty-one amongst infants aged less than three months. For statistical purposes the distinction between these two diseases is purely artificial. Pneumonia is of course the more serious of these two, and 19 deaths certified as broncho-pneumonia are usually classified under the latter heading. In addition to these nearly all those certified as from Measles and Whooping Cough were actually due to some pulmonary complication. Cleanliness, careful nursing, and avoidance of chill should reduce the mortality from all kinds of pulmonary diseases. 4. Wasting diseases caused 85 deaths, and though only two certificates gave "want of breast milk" as the cause of death, yet I have no doubt that this privation was responsible for much of the mortality from this class of disease. In no instance does rickets alone figure in the death certificate, though in several of the pulmonary deaths this disease was stated to be a contributory cause, breast fed babies rarely suffer from rickets, it is almost invariably due to artificial feeding. 5. To convulsions and non-tuberculous meningitis were due 43 deaths; some of the meningitis cases were probably tubercular in origin though undiagnosed as such; and the deaths from convulsions were in many instances due to indigestible food. 6. Tubercular deaths numbered 42; of these tubercular meningitis was responsible for eleven, tabes mesenterica for sixteen, and other forms of tubercular disease for fifteen; the mesenteric cases may have been infected from the milk of diseased cows, but most of the others were probably cases of inherited tuberculosis. 7. Forty-one deaths were caused by suffocation or over-laying, all due to parental carelessness. 20 8. The zymotic deaths (excluding those from diarrhoea) numbered thirty-four—eighteen of them were from whooping-cough and thirteen from measles. There were two deaths from membranous croup and one from scarlet fever. 9. Only seven deaths were returned as from congenital syphilis, but probably many of the premature births were due to this cause. Of late years the frightful waste of infantile life daily going on in London and other large towns has increasingly rivetted public attention. This huge mortality is serious enough in itself, but recent investigations by Dr. Kerr, the medical officer to the Education Department of the London County Council, conclusively prove that the conditions which are responsible for it are more far-reaching than at first appear. Maimed and stunted bodies are in many instances the toll taken by diseases which only just fail to destroy life. Infantile mortality varies from year to year, and Dr. Kerr finds that amongst the children attending public Elementary schools in London, the average of the bodily physique and mental activity of those born in years when infantile mortality is heaviest is distinctly inferior to that of those born in more favourable years. The causes of this heavy mortality are not far to seek—poverty, ignorance and intemperance work out their natural consequence. As a result of insufficient means of housing, the infant breathes foul air in overcrowded rooms. Want of knowledge on the part of the mother results in improper feeding and clothing, 21 and should intemperance be added to ignorance there is privation and neglect. Poverty brings yet another evil result, for should the natural breadwinner be absent or out of employment the wife must surrender her maternal duties in order to do her part towards the support of the family. The law certainly prohibits the employment of a woman in a factory or workshop for the four weeks subsequent to her confinement, and is good (when not evaded) so far; but the month old infant deprived of maternal care and natural food has its chance of surviving enormously diminished. A large number of the infantile deaths in Bethnal Green are amongst the bottle fed children of working class parents. The poverty which compels mothers to go out to work transfers their infants, that should be suckled, to the charge of incompetent nurses (very often mere children themselves) and causes them to be fed on condensed milk or patent foods from dirty bottles with foul rubber tubes. Worse still, morsels of whatever food is at hand are administered to the unfortunate infant, with the intention to soothe it, but with frequently fatal results. No wonder that bowel complaints, convulsions and wasting diseases are rife! Unfortunately the women know no better, they read and act upon the lying advertisements of patent food manufacturers, and their children die. Sanitary notices and printed circulars are of little use as they are usually left unread. Some attention is however paid to a personal visit and instructions given by word of mouth, and this can be done by means of a health visitor. When this matter was under discussion I strongly urged upon the Public Health Committee the 22 appointment of a female Sanitary Inspector who, in addition to the Statutory qualification, should be required to produce evidence of special training, preferably in a children's hospital. I suggested that in addition to the ordinary duties of a sanitary inspector the officer appointed should be required to call upon recently delivered women, and instruct them how to properly feed and care for their infants. I also advised the visitation of such cases of measles as are notified by the school authorities, of which a very large proportion go without medical attendance, and are often most improperly treated. Cases of infantile diarrhoea might be similarly dealt with. I firmly believe that a tactful, energetic officer entrusted with duties such as I have sketched out, and working under the supervision of the Medical Officer of Health, might be the means of preventing much illness and death. The subject was most carefully considered by the Public Health Committee, who eventually decided to recommend the Council to appoint a female sanitary inspector. I append the Minute of the Committee of November 1st, 1905. "Female Sanitary Inspector. We have had under consideration the question of the appointment of a female sanitary inspector, it being apparent that in certain circumstances a female officer might be able to accomplish much useful work which a male officer is not fitted to perform. 23 WE RECOMMEND That the Council sanction the appointment of a female sanitary inspector, who will be required to reside in the Borough, at a salary of £100 per annum, rising by annual increments of £5 to £120 per annum, and that it be referred to the Committee to determine the duties of such officer, with power to advertise for and select candidates to appear before the Council for the appointment." This report was adopted by the Council. I take this opportunity of offering my grateful thanks to Mr. Felton, the chairman of the Public Health Committee, for his assistance in bringing the matter forward, I am convinced that without his help, the sanction of the Borough Council to the appointment would not have been given. At its next meeting the Committee proceeded to consider the appointment of the new officer. I explained that if any duties which are not included in those set forth in the order of the Local Government Board of December 8th, 1891, are performed by an inspector, the London County Council refuses to refund half the amount of the officer's salary. I suggested that I should be authorised to write to the Medical Officer to the London County Council respecting proposed duties and repayment of salary. After discussion it was " RESOLVED That the suggestion of the Medical Officer be adopted and a letter be written to the London County Council accordingly." The following letter was written and sent:— 24 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF BETHNAL GREEN. Public Health Department, 2, Paradise Row, Cambridge Road, N.E. 27th November, 1905. Sir Shirley F. Murphy, Principal Medical Officer, London County Council, 8, St. Martin's Place, W.C. Dear Sir, Infant Mortality and Appointment of Sanitary Inspector. I beg to inform you that the Council of this Borough has, on the recommendation of the Public Health Committee, decided to appoint a Female Sanitary Inspector. As the duties of the proposed Officer will shortly be under consideration by the Committee I enclose herewith a memorandum of such duties as I think should be performed by the Officer, in addition to those strictly laid down in the Order of the Local Government Board defining the duties of Sanitary Inspectors. I shall be much obliged if you will look through my list of proposed duties and give me your opinion as to which of them would be likely to be approved by the Examiner of Claims when the question of recoupment is before him. 25 You will see from the memorandum that my view is in favour of the Officer acting as a Health Visitor rather than a Female Sanitary Inspector, but I do not think my Committee will fall in with my suggestions unless half of the salary of the proposed Officer be repayable by the London County Council. Unfortunately the Examiner of Claims of the London County Council has taken up a somewhat unsympathetic attitude towards the Borough Councils, as he absolutely declines to recognise for recoupment any duties performed by an inspector which are outside his own rigid interpretation of the Order of the Local Government Board of the 8th December, 1891. It is now 14 years since this Order was issued and apparently it does not contemplate that an Inspector might be required to act as a Health Visitor in addition to his other duties. In the circumstances obtaining to-day the Order may be looked upon as antiquated, it is therefore desirable that the Board should be approached with a view to its revision. I am strongly of 'opinion that any health work a Sanitary Authority may direct an Inspector to perform should be considered as within his or her proper duties and should not give rise to a quibble as to repayment of half salary. Faithfully yours, (Signed) GEORGE PADDOCK BATE, M.D. Medical Officer of Health. 26 METROPOLITAN BOROUGH OF BETHNAL GREEN Female Sanitary Inspector. Memorandum of proposed duties in addition to those laid down in the Order of the Local Government Board. (a) To visit under the direction of the Medical Officer of Health, women who have been recently delivered, and advise them as to proper care and feeding of the infants. (b) To visit houses where children are reported to be suffering from measles and, where no medical man is in attendance, to give simple instructions as to care and nursing of the children. (c) To visit workshops including those of outworkers' where women only are employed and report as to the sanitary conveniences, ventilation and conditions generally, of the premises. Sir Shirley Murphy, in a private letter to me, replied that he was afraid (a) and (b) would be considered as outside the ordinary duties of a sanitary officer but that (c) certainly came within the terms of the Order; he advised than an official communication should be made to the Local Government Board by the Town Clerk; this was done and the following reply was received:— 27 Local Government Board, Whitehall, 19th January, 1906. Sir, I am directed by the Local Government Board to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant and to request that the particulars of the proposal of the Bethnal Green Borough Council in regard to the appointment of a female Sanitary Inspector in the Borough may be submitted to the Board in one of the enclosed forms. The Board gather that it is intended that the female inspector should act over the whole Borough. If this is so, it should be stated in the form. As regards the additional duties (a) and (b) proposed to be assigned to the officer, I am to state that the Board sympathise with the desire of the Borough Council to take steps to reduce the present heavy rate of infant mortality, but they must point out that it forms no part of the duty assignable to a sanitary inspector, as such, to advise mothers as to the proper methods of infant feeding, or to give instruction as to the nursing of children suffering from measles, and that there could be no repayment from the County Fund of any portion of the salary paid for that work. It will therefore be necessary for the Borough Council to assign to the officer a remuneration for this dutv, separate from the salary paid to her as sanitary inspector. At the same time the Board would observe that the work of advising mothers as to the proper methods of 28 infant feeding is not only a work of a delicate nature, but is also one which requires special training of a high order if it is to be carried out with any advantage. Such a training does not come within the experience which a sanitary inspector is necessarily required to obtain, and the possession of the certificate which a sanitary inspector is required to hold as the requisite evidence of qualification for that office is no evidence that its holder has any such training. The Borough Council are doubtless alive to these considerations, and the Board assume that they will satisfy themselves that the person appointed is competent to undertake this work. The Board would add that, if the duties in question are entrusted to the officer, they should be carried out under the direct control of the Medical Officer of Health. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (Signed) NOEL KERSHAW, Assistant Secretary• G. S. This letter was laid before the Committee and carefully considered. Ultimately an advertisement was inserted in certain papers, replies were received, candidates were selected and an appointment was made by the Borough Council, but as this action does not come within the period covered by this report details are omitted. 29 MUNICIPAL MILK DEPOTS. In August I received a communication from Dr. Carpenter, one of the physicians to the North Eastern Hospital for Children in this Borough, enclosing a print of an article by him on the subject of excessive infantile mortality. The article is a very suggestive one and points out that amongst other measures for the reduction of waste of child life, milk depots on the lines of the one at Battersea, should take a most important place. Dr. Carpenter suggests that the Borough Council, in conjunction with the authorities of the North Eastern Hospital for Children, should establish such a milk depot, and that the medical officers of the Hospital and the district should jointly be authorised in suitable cases, to prescribe milk food properly prepared and diluted. The suggestion was laid before the Public Health Committee and was discussed by them at some length. A general opinion was expressed that the municipalization of the milk supply is as important as the public control of the water supply; but that a milk depot on the Battersea lines could never be entirely satisfactory, inasmuch as to ensure an absolutely clean and pure supply, the milk must be kept under observation from the cow to the feeding bottle. With bought milk this would be impossible and a dairy farm in conjunction with the depot would be necessary—a project not likely to be adopted by the Council. The Committee were advised of the possibility of sterilizing or pasteurizing dirty milk by heat, but in view of the conflict of medical opinion as to the 30 tive value of the product, any action was not considered advisable. So far as can be ascertained milk depots on the Battersea plan cannot be made self-supporting, and must entail a more or less heavy charge upon the ratepayers. Moreover it is doubtful whether a Borough Council may legally incur this expense. Ultimately the Public Health Committee declined to entertain Dr. Carpenter's proposal. Journal of the Board of Agriculture. PASTEURISED MILK. The Board of Agriculture have received through the Foreign Office a translation of an article by Dr. Ostertag, which appeared in the Danish Monthly Review for Veterinary Surgeons for August, 1905, dealing with the question of pasteurised milk. Dr. Ostertag observes that in the course of the last fifteen years it has been repeatedly proposed in Germany that a law should be passed prescribing that all milk sold for human consumption should be pasteurised. Against this proposal it was at first objected that it would be impossible to carry it out, and, subsequently, as our knowledge of the bacteriological and chemical properties of milk has become more extensive, other objections of a sanitary nature have been brought forward. It is now believed that if milk is heated for pasteurisation in the ordinary way, its condition becomes so much altered that instead of being an article of nourishment it may become a source of danger; and Dr. Ostertag adds that he does not believe there exists at the present time any expert who will recommend a general obligation for the 31 ing of all milk offered for sale; on the contrary, efforts are now generally directed to producing the milk under such conditions that it may, without fear, be consumed raw even by infants. Dr. Ostertag, in the article above-mentioned, goes on to discuss some of the dangers which, in his opinion, may arise from the unrestricted sale of pasteurised milk. Memorandum by the Incorporated Society of Medical Officers of Health on the Feeding and Rearing of Infants. A child fed at the breast up to nine months is almost certain to be healthy and strong. It will give much less trouble to its mother and will be less like to suffer from children's illnesses. Before deciding not to nurse her child the mother should have advice from a Doctor. During the suckling period the mother should take plenty of good plain nourishing food, but should avoid alcoholic stimulants and spices. Milk, and cocoa made with milk, are better than tea. It is better to feed a child even partly on the breast than not at all. The child should be put to the breast once every two hours during the day and once every four hours during the night until it is about two months old; after that age gradually increase the intervals to once in three hours during the day, and as a rule avoid suckling between eleven at night and five in the morning. 32 Table Showing the Number of Breast Feeds. Age. Day. Night. First 2 months Every 2 hours Every 4 hours After 2 months to end of 6 months Every 4 hours Twice at night After 6 months till weaning begins Every 3½ to 4 hours Once at night If the child cannot be fed on the breast, cow's milk with water (or barley water) added must be given. Children fed at the breast obtain about one pint of milk in 24 hours for the first few weeks. This quantity gradually increases until in the latter months it reaches about three pints. These are the quantities of cow's milk and water (or barley water) which should be given. During the first month put twice as much water (or barley water) as milk adding a teaspoonful of sugar. At the end of a month gradually put more milk, until at three months there is equal parts of milk and water (or barley water). At the end of three months gradually put more milk in until at six months there is twice as much milk as water (or barley water). At the end of six months gradually put more milk in, until all milk is being given by the time the child is nine months old. The number of meals should be the same as those when the child is breast fed (see Table). 33 Table showing the way to Prepare the Food, the Quantity at Each Meal, and the Number of Meals Daily. Large Tablespoons Meals Daily 1st month One part of milk to two parts of water (or barley water), one teaspoonful of sugar to the pint 4 10 2nd month to end of 3rd month Increase milk until there are equal parts of and water (or barley water), with a teaspoonful of sugar to the pint 6 10 3rd month to end of 6th month Increase milk until there is twice as much milk as water (or barley water), with a teaspoonful of sugar to the pint 8 to 12 5 6 months to end of 9 months Increase milk until pure milk is being given, with a teaspoonful of sugar to the pint 12 5 A feeding bottle with a long tube should never be used. The best kind of bottle is boat-shaped, and the teat should be turned inside out and thoroughly cleaned after each time it is used. As soon as it has been used the bottle should be thoroughly rinsed out with cold water and then scalded. It is a good plan to have two bottles and use them alternately. 34 Barley Water. Every day put two teaspoonfuls of prepared barley in powder into a pint of water, heat to boiling and strain through muslin. If pearl barley is used twice as much water is necessary, and it must be boiled for at least twenty minutes. Only enough barley water should be made for each day, as it does not keep well. If it is not freshly made, it will give the child colic. Important. Feed regularly. Do not hurry an infant's feeding. It causes indigestion. Do not give any milk left over from a previous meal. Do not try to quiet an infant every time it cries by feeding it. Do not let an infant suck at an empty bottle. Do not leave milk uncovered, or in a warm place, or near to a drain or sink. No starchy foods (such as bread, common flour, cornflour, arrowroot, sago, tapioca, rice, &c.,) should be given to an infant until at least two teeth are cut. No potatoes should be given till the child is at least a year old, and no solid meat until it is at least eighteen months old. 35 DEATHS OF YOUNG CHILDREN. The deaths of young children aged less than five years numbered 996, and formed forty-one per cent. of the deaths from all causes; this is equivalent to a rate of 56.0 per thousand calculated upon the estimated population of young children. ELDERLY PERSONS DEATH RATE. Of the 2,418 deaths at all ages, 473 were those of persons aged over 65 years, a proportion of about twenty per cent. This gives a death rate, calculated upon the estimated population of elderly persons of 98.4. WEEKLY MORTALITY.

The total number of these, including eighty deaths in hospital was 284 against 361 in 1904, a decrease of 77.

Table VI. in the appendix shews this average to be 404. Table K compares the deaths from each one of the Zymotic diseases in the two years 1904 and 1905; examination of the table shews that the decrease 39 in the mortality is confined to Measles, Diphtheria and Diarrhoea, whilst each of the others shews a slight increase.

The total number of notification certificates received during the year, including 461 Chicken-pox cases was 1928; of these 103 were duplicates, a proportion of fiveand-one-third per cent. on the whole number. Three certificates sent to me in error were forwarded to the Medical Officers of other Boroughs. The fees for four certificates were disallowed on the ground of delay in notification, and six others, which referred to persons whose addresses could not be traced, were cancelled. The certificates relate to a total of 1,825 persons. Table III. in the appendix indicates the number of persons suffering from each disease. It also shows the sub-district in which each person had resided and the number (1,041) of those removed to hospital. Table M gives full details of all these. 41 TABLE M. Nature of Disease.

In a number of instances, after consulting a private medical man and obtaining from him an expression of opinion as to the disease (Scarlet Fever or Diphtheria) from which the sick child was suffering, parents had taken their children to the London Hospital without proper precautions, contrary to Section 68 of the Public Health (London) Act 1891, but in two cases only did the Public Health Committee authorize a prosecution. Particulars of these are as follows:— L.F., aged five years, residing at a milk shop in Mount Street, was taken to Dr. O'Malley on April 11th; the mother was told by him to take the child home and put it to bed as it had Scarlet Fever. She did so, but the father took the child the same afternoon to the London Hospital, where it was detained and sent by ambulance to Homerton Fever Hospital. The two notification certificates (private and hospital) were received next morning, April 12th. Inspector Henley called about 1.30 o'clock and found the sale of milk still in progress, although the premises had not been disinfected. The case was reported to the Public Health Ccmmittee and a summons was ordered. At the hearing, Dr. O'Malley gave evidence as to the facts, but the father of the child swore that he was not aware that it had Scarlet Fever when he took it to the hospital. He said his wife told him that Dr. O'Malley said the child had only a little fever and the wife confirmed the statement. The Magistrate disbelieved both husband and wife, but as we were unable to prove to his satisfaction that the father had been told by his wife the exact nature of his child's illness, he dismissed the summons. At 2 o'clock in the afternoon of Sunday, October 1st, Dr. Corner was called to visit I.L., aged seven years at No. 8, Fellbrigg Street. This is a general shop where milk is sold. Dr. Corner informed the father that his child was suffering from Scarlet Fever and directed that the patient should be kept isolated until it could be removed to the hospital; the notification certificate was forwarded by post in the usual way and was received by me the following morning together with a duplicate certificate from Dr. Cook of the London Hospital. Inspector Bare then ascertained 43 that an hour after Dr. Corner's visit the child was carried in its father's arms to the London Hospital, whence it was removed to Homerton Fever Hospital. These facts were reported to the Public Health Committee and W.L., the father of the child was summoned to Worship Street. The summons was heard by Mr. Mead. Dr. Corner gave evidence that the child was suffering from Scarlet Fever when taken from home, and that he had warned the father of its infectious nature. The defendant admitted knowledge of the nature of the child's illness, but denied that fear of damage to the milk business influenced his action ; he tried to justify his conduct and said he was not aware that the child could have been removed on application to the Public Health Office. There were other children in the house, and as the day was Sunday he thought the only way of getting thesickchild removed was to take it to the London Hospital. All this was cleverly argued by the solicitor for the defence, and Mr. Mead's sympathies were evidently worked upon. He did not consider the case a bad one and he inflicted the nominal penalty 0 10/- and 2/- costs. It afterwards transpired that Dr. Corner himself was unaware that the Public Health Office is always open day and night for urgent removals. As the expense to the Borough Council in these two cases was nearly £10 the results did not encourage the Public Health Committee to follow them up with action in other cases, several of which occurred and were reported. Moreover, in no instance was absolute proof of wilful exposure, within the meaning of Section 58, obtainable, so no other prosecutions were authorized. SMALL POX. No Deaths (Decennial average 8.) Four cases of small-pox were notified during the year. All were stated to have been vaccinated in infancy, and all recovered; only three were true cases of small-pox. 44 Early in March I was requested by the Medical Superintendent of Bethnal Green Infirmary to visit a supposed case of small-pox; the patient, a woman aged 26, vaccinated, had been an out-patient of the London Hospital and was admitted into the Infirmary on February 25th. She had fever, back ache and a very suspicious looking rash; the case was an extremely doubtful one, and in the circumstances I agreed to her removal to the Asylums Board Hospital; ultimately the case proved to be one of Syphilis. In June I received a notification from one of the Medical Officers of the London Hospital to the effect that A. M., a woman, aged 26, residing at 31, Felix Street, had been removed to the Small-pox Hospital. I visited the home and found a sister of A. M., aged nine, evidently sickening for Small-pox; I had her removed as soon as possible. No history of any previous contact was obtainable. The premises were carefully disinfected and the contacts kept under observation and no subsequent case arose. In July, J. G., a girl aged eight years, was removed from 44, Busby Street. I did not see the patient before removal, but I understand the disease was of a very modified type. No history of previous contact could be obtained. CHICKEN-POX. The Order making this disease notifiable was in force during the whole of the year, and 461 cases were certified. All the patients over 12 years of age and any others presenting symptoms in the slightest degree suspicious, were personally visited by me, but no case of Small-pox was discovered. 1905 Small Pox. 45 SCARLET FEVER. Deaths 27. (Decennial average 22). The number of Scarlet Fever cases reported during the year was 796, of which 27 terminated fatally, indicating a case mortality of 3.3 per cent. The death rate from Scarlet Fever is equal to 0.20 per thousand population, whilst that for the whole of London is 0.12. All the fatal cases in Bethnal Green except six were amongst young children of less than five years of age. From the North sub-district 344 cases were reported ; from the South, 191; and from the East, 261. 734 of these were removed to hospital, but with respect to 11 of them a report was received that the patient was not suffering from any form of notifiable disease. From the Inspector's reports I gather that the homes of 457 of the sufferers were in a fairly satisfactory condition ; in 60 the closets were defective, in 10 the drain inside the house was leaky or otherwise out of order, and in 19 the external drains required amendment. In 5 instances the premises were over-crowded, and minor insanitary defects were noted in 229. Amongst families inhabiting single room tenements 57 cases occurred. DIPHTHERIA (INCLUDING MEMBRANOUS CROUP). Total Deaths 31. (Decennial average 62). The number of cases reported as Diphtheria was 293, 10 others were designated "diphtheritic" or membranous croup. The two diseases are identical in 46 nature, though varying in locality. The total deaths were 31, indicating a case mortality of 10.2 per cent. The death rate on the estimated population was 0.24. In the County of London the death rate was 0.12. The North sub-district contributed 112 of the cases, the South 79 and the East 112. Of the 303 persons notified as suffering from Diphtheria 260 were removed to hospital; 34 of these were found by the Asylums Board Medical Officers to have been incorrectly reported and were sent home again. Five children suffering from membranous croup and requiring immediate operation to prevent suffocation were treated either at the London Hospital or at the North Eastern Hospital for Children. All except five of the Diphtheria deaths were amongst young children less than five years old. Swabs for cultivation were taken from the throats of six persons who were suspected to be suffering from Diphtheria, a negative result was reported in five of them. The Inspectors report that in 147 instances the home of the patient was in a satisfactory condition, but in 37 the w.c.'s were defective. In two the internal drainage was out of order, in five the external drains required amendment and minor insanitary defects were found in 114 instances; 37 cases were removed from single room tenements. RETURN CASES OF SCARLET FEVER AND DIPHTHERIA. A voluminous report on this subject has been presented to the Metropolitan Asylums Board by Dr. Cameron, the official medical investigator. The report 1905. Scarlatina. 1905. Diptheria. 47 covers the thirteen months between July, 1901, and July, 1902, and contains much valuable information and some most useful suggestions. The value of the report is enhanced by the criticisms and recommendations of the Asylums Board medical superintendents printed at the end of the volume. It is most difficult to fix the period at which a person suffering from scarlet fever ceases to be infectious, for (unlike diphtheria) the bacillus of this disease has never been discovered. An apparently healthy person may transmit infection yet a bacteriological examination would afford no evidence of it. Until recently the medical profession regarded an inspection of the skin of a scarlet fever convalescent as a certain means of deciding the question as to infectivity. This inspection is still useful within certain limits, but it has been proved that late desquamation is by itself no evidence of infectiousness. Dr. Cameron defines as an "infecting case"(or quasi infecting case) any patient who on discharge from hospital infects, or is alleged to infect, some other person, and he restricts the term "return case" to the person who is so infected. Many of these so called return cases are merely coincidences, that is to say the sufferer catches scarlet fever from some source other than the so-called "infecting" case. On the other hand a certain proportion are true "return cases" and undoubtedly contract their illness from the recently discharged patient. Bethnal Green has been comparatively free from cases of this kind. 48 In 1905, 796 persons suffering from scarlet fever were removed to hospital from this Borough, and I have records of thirteen instances in which, after the return of a hospital patient, secondary cases followed within a period of four weeks. I investigated each of these and satisfied myself that eleven of the recently discharged patients presented no exceptional symptom; two however had a nasal discharge, this in one case was very slight but in the other was free and from both nostrils and in addition there was a purulent discharge from one ear. I was of opinion that this particular child was in a very infectious condition so I sent her back to hospital where she was retained until she was quite well. I am told by the parents in both cases that the discharge did not appear until the child had been several days at home. Dr. Cameron states that during the thirteen months covered by his report, four per cent. of the discharged hospital patients were alleged to have infected others with scarlet fever. In about half of these (46.5 per cent.) his investigations bore out the allegation, so that roughly speaking, out of every one hundred persons discharged from hospital as presumably free from disease, two were in a more or less infectious condition and actually communicated scarlet fever. Dr Cameron is of opinion that the medical officers of the Asylums Board hospitals do all in their power to prevent the discharge of patients in an infectious condition and he practically excludes carelessness on the part of these gentlemen as a cause of return cases. 49 The report shows (inter alia)— a. That the type of scarlet fever communicated to return cases is more virulent than the ordinary form of the disease. b. Patients who suffer from complications in hospital are more prone to infect others on discharge than simple uncomplicated cases. c. The complications most usually causing trouble are morbid conditions of the nose with purulent discharges. d. Although a patient on discharge from hospital may appear to be free from morbid conditions of the nose and throat, yet if that patient gets a chill and develops sore throat or running from the nostrils this condition is apt to be attended by a recrudescence of infectivity. k. The length of detention in hospital is no criterion of infectability, as the more serious cases, requiring prolonged treatment, are undoubtedly more likely to cause infection on discharge than slight cases which soon recover and only make a short stay in the hospital. f. Return cases are more common in the winter months of the year. g. A person suffering from what appears to be a common sore throat may convey scarlet fever infection to others. 50 Dr. Cameron in his report gives an account of the method of dealing with infectious diseases in certain French hospitals. The essence of this method lies in the strict aseptic treatment of the patient and his surroundings. For this purpose the wards are divided by glass screens and each patient is placed in a small chamber or cubicle by himself. Dr. Cameron suggests the trial of this plan by the Board. The medical superintendents approve of the suggestion and hope it will be adopted. The present custom in London is to bath all patients immediately before discharge from hospital, they are then dressed in clean fresh clothing and sent home. Dr. Cameron suggests that in order to avoid the risk of a chill the bath should be taken on the previous evening during the winter months. The recommendations of the medical superintendents, based partly upon the report but amplified by their own enormous experience, are so important that I reproduce them in extenso. RECOMMENDATIONS. As a result of our examination of the facts brought forward by Dr. Cameron and such other sources of information as are known to us, we recommend— 1. That as far as practicable, every patient as soon as he is in a fit condition, and without regard to age or sex, be transferred from the acute to the convalescent hospitals. 51 2. That a discharge ward for scarlet fever be established at each hospital, into which the patient could be admitted and bathed not later than the day before discharge. 3. As we are of opinion that harm has resulted from the abrupt transition from hospital to home conditions undergone by patients immediately on discharge, we recommend that every endeavour should be made to prepare patients for this change, especially by providing facilities for their being in the open air. At some of the hospitals this will involve the erection of verandahs or other form of shelter. 4. That the following notice be printed and a copy sent with the notice of discharge to the parent or guardians of every discharged scarlet fever patient— "Although every endeavour is made to send out patients free from infection, it is advisable as an additional precaution, that they should as far as possible be kept away from other children, including attendance at school, for the first three weeks after their return home. They should certainly not sleep in the same bed, and if possible, not in the same room with children who have not had the disease. "It is also advisable that articles used by the patients, such as cups, plates, spoons, handkerchiefs, towels and toys, should during this period, be kept distinct by those used by other children. "The above precautions are specially important in the case of those patients suffering from discharge from either nose or ears." 5. That at one hospital, say the South-Eastern, now in course of re-building, two or more wards be divided by glass partitions into separate rooms, and that scarlet 52 fever patients be treated therein on the system of complete isolation during the whole period of detention so far as that may be found practicable; and that the effect of this procedure on the occurrence of return cases should be carefully observed. 6. That similar rooms be erected at two other acute hospitals in which scarlet fever patients may be isolated for at least three weeks after admission. The patients being afterwards drafted into convalescent wards, the complicated and uncomplicated cases being kept separate. The structural arrangements of the rooms mentioned in this and the preceding recommendations to be carefully considered by the medical superintendents. 7. That inquiry into the subject of return cases should be continued, on lines to be suggested by the medical superintendents. 8. That arrangements be made to notify each return case to the superintendent of the hospital from which the infecting patient was discharged. The adoption of certain of the above recommendations would necessitate an increased staff, and would also diminish the accommodation available for the direct admission of cases. We consider that both these changes are justified by the prospect of reaching a higher standard of efficiency in the purpose for which the hospitals are primarily intended, viz., the protection of the public from infection. 53 DIPHTHERIA. Return cases of diphtheria are not so common as those of scarlet fever. We only had one case in 1905 and that doubtful. Most of the cases from Bethnal Green go to the Eastern Hospital. Dr. Goodall informs me that no patient is discharged from this hospital until two consecutive bacteriological examinations of swabs from the throat prove negative. Since this practice has been adopted we have had no true return cases in Bethnal Green. REMOVAL OF INFECTIOUS SICK. In November the Metropolitan Asylums Board issued some amended regulations for facilitating the removal to hospital of patients suffering from infectious disease. The procedure is much simplified; all that is now necessary is for the doctor in attendance to write out and leave with the friends an informal certificate stating the name, age, sex, disease and full address of the sick person; these particulars must be communicated by telephone (any private instrument or public call office) to the Metropolitan Asylums Board (2461 Holborn) and the patient will be removed without the intervention of the sanitary officers or any further formality. Except in times of pressure it is usually possible to remove patients from most parts of London within an hour of the receipt of the application. The formal notification required by Sec. 55 of The Public Health (London) Act, 1891, must be forwarded by the doctor to the Medical Officer of Health in due course. 54 ENTERIC FEVER. Deaths 8. (Decennial average 18). The total number of cases reported was 61 with eight deaths. The case mortality is 13.1 per cent., and the death rate on the estimated population 0.06; the corresponding mortality for the County of London is 0.05. 16 of the sufferers were treated in general hospitals and 40 were removed by the Metropolitan Asylums Board; six of these last were reported not to be suffering from Enteric Fever. Upon enquiry by the Inspectors it was ascertained that 22 of the patients had been in the habit of eating fried fish, six had recently eaten shell fish, seven watercress and five ice-cream. In 26 instances the premises from which cases of Enteric had been reported were in a satisfactory condition, seven defective w.c.'s were found and the same number of faulty drains; minor insanitary defects obtained in 27 instances. OTHER FORMS OF FEVER. Two cases of simple continued fever were reported, one of which was fatal. WHOOPING COUGH. Deaths 50. (Decennial average 50). This disease was very prevalent, the mortality on the estimated population at all ages is 0.38 whilst that of London is 0.32. The whole of the deaths from Whooping Cough in Bethnal Green were amongst young children less than five years of age and formed a death rate on the estimated population of young children of 2.81. 1905. Enteric Fever. 55 DIARRHŒAL DISEASES. Deaths 119. (Decennial average 125). Diarrhoea was the registered cause of 119 deaths including those specially certified as epidemic or zymotic enteritis; 75 per cent. of these were registered in the September quarter. The death rate on the estimated population was 0.91 per thousand in Bethnal Green whilst that in the whole of the County of London was 0.72. All the deaths except four were amongst young children and formed a mortality rate of 6.46 upon the estimated population of young children. Diarrhœal diseases are caused by eating food which has been contaminated by germs; these are carried by dust and flies and the only feasible method of reducing diarrhoea mortality is by strict cleanliness and careful food storage. The dust-bin is the greatest offender; this should be kept covered and in a position as remote as possible from the meat safe. Animal and vegetable refuse should be burned and not placed in the dust-bin. Milk is specially receptive of germs; it should be stored in clean vessels in a cool place and kept carefully covered with muslin to exclude flies and dirt. In hot weather it is wise to boil all milk before use, though this method undoubtedly deteriorates its nutritive value. Tainted meat, over ripe fruit and stale vegetables are poisonous. Tinned foods should be regarded with a certain amount of suspicion; they should not be kept for an indefinite time after being opened, and so much as cannot be used within twentyfour hours should be destroyed. 56 MEASLES. (Deaths 48. Decennial average 99.) The Deaths from Measles numbered 48 and were 51 below the decennial average; the mortality on the estimated population at all ages is 036 and is identical with that of the County of London. All the deaths in Bethnal Green except one were amongst young children less than five years of age. The child mortality from Measles and its complications and sequelae is in the proportion of 2.6 on the estimated population of young children. During the year 606 cases of Measles have been reported to us by the School Authorities. A reported case of Measles now leads to a visit by a sanitary inspector who advises precautionary measures and takes care that children from an infected house shall not attend school. I am sorry to learn that a recent regulation of the Education Department of the London County Council relaxes this last requirement in so far that children who reside in infected houses but have already suffered from measles are to be required to attend school; young children are still to be excluded from the infant departments whether they have had Measles or not. Disinfection is invariably proffered by the Inspectors but was accepted in 33 instances only. Of the school reports 80 were found to be incorrect; in 187 of the cases said to be Measles no doctor was in attendance and such information as was obtainable had to be accepted. 57 TUBERCULAR DISEASE. Phthisis was responsible for 252 deaths; other forms of tubercular disease caused 110. The deaths from diseases of this class form 15 per cent. of the total mortality from all causes and are equal to a death rate of 2.8 per thousand on the estimated population of the Borough. The tubercular diseases of children caused 84 deaths, a mortality upon the estimated population of young children of 4.7 per thousand. The death rate from Phthisis alone is equal to 1.9 per thousand population at all ages in Bethnal Green, whilst that for the whole of London is 1.4. DISEASES OF PARTURITION. Two women died from Puerperal fever, and 10 others from diseases and accidents incidental to child-birth. These were:— Hoemorrhage 5 Miscarriage and Peritonitis 3 Puerperal Mania 1 Obstruction from uterine fibroid 1 Six cases of Puerperal Fever were reported, in each case a midwife was in attendance; one midwife had two cases at the same time. MIDWIVES ACT, 1902. This Act is administered in London by the County Council as Local Supervising Authority, but certain important duties under the Act devolve upon the Public Health Committee as Local Sanitary Authority. Puerperal Fever is a notifiable disease and as such is 58 reportable under penalty in default. Upon receipt of a notification the residence of the patient is visited, and the condition of the premises carefully investigated; the doctor in attendance is communicated with and certain particulars are obtained from him which are forwarded to the Medical Officer to the London County Council. Should the case have occurred in the practice of a midwife I see her and endeavour to trace the source of the disease. I instruct her as to quarantine &c., and require certain methods of disinfection to be carried out; I also usually advise a short holiday in the country before resuming practice. No. 5 of the rules framed by the Central Midwives' Board provides as follows:— 5. Whenever a Midwife has been in attendance upon a patient suffering from Puerperal Fever or any other illness supposed to be infectious, she must disinfect herself and all her instruments and other appliances to the satisfaction of the Local Sanitary Authority, and must have her clothing thoroughly disinfected before going to another labour. Unless otherwise directed by the local supervising authority, all washable clothing should be boiled and other clothing should be sent to be stoved (by the local sanitary authority), and then exposed freely to the open air for several days. RESPIRATORY DISEASES. The deaths from diseases of the respiratory organs exclusive of Phthisis numbered 528 and formed 21.8 per cent. of the total mortality from all causes. This is equal to a rate of 4.0 per thousand population at all ages. Nearly half the respiratory deaths (216) were amongst young children, a mortality of 12T per thousand on the estimated population under five. 59 MALIGNANT DISEASE. Cancerous diseases caused 108 deaths; all except two amongst persons aged over 25 years. The estimated number of inhabitants of Bethnal Green aged over 25 years is 56,900; on this number we shew a cancer mortality of T8 per thousand living. The parts of the body chiefly affected by Malignant disease were:— Uterus & female organs of generation 18 Liver and Pancreas 18 Stomach 16 Rectum 11 Intestines 9 Female breast 7 Œsophagus 5 Jaw 4 Tongue 3 Bladder 2 SUICIDES. These numbered 20:—seven hanged themselves; six took poison (Oxalic Acid three, Muriatic Acid one, Carbolic Acid one, Bichromate of Potash one); three drowned themselves; two strangled themselves; one shot himself and another jumped out of window. INQUEST CASES. The Coroner held 247 inquests at the Court in Church Row; 114 of these were upon persons who had died by violence. Nine deaths were registered without medical certificates, they were nearly all cases of premature birth or convulsions causing death shortly after birth. 60 CHOLERA. In view of the possible occurrence of casual cases of cholera in London, arrangements were made by the Metropolitan Asylums Board for the reception and treatment of patients. The Asylums Board also agreed to receive suspected cases of the disease for observation, pending a bacteriological investigation to settle the diagnosis; fortunately the Board was not called upon to receive any patients suffering or supposed to be suffering from cholera. SHELTER. Public Health (London) Act, 1891, section 60, sub-section 4. The Council now possesses a shelter for the accommodation of families whose homes are in process of disinfection after infectious disease, situated at No. 3, St. James Road in this Borough. The premises were originally erected for the ordinary purpose of a dwellinghouse and contain, a basement two rooms, ground floor two rooms, first floor two rooms, and second floor three rooms. "Contacts" pay for their own food so far as is possible, but when means are lacking the Council provides all necessaries. There is a resident caretaker who with his wife lives upon the premises and occupies four of the rooms, the basement and ground floor. At present no baths are provided, but there is a workshop in the rear of the building which it is proposed to fit up as a common room with bath rooms behind. 61 The number of times the shelter has been in use during the five years ending 1905 and the number of "contacts" housed were as follows:— Year. Times used. Contacts housed 1901 0 0 1902 86 291 1903 5 19 1904 27 94 1905 11 21 In the event of an outbreak of Cholera in the Borough the Council is prepared to receive "contacts" to the extent of the accommodation at its disposal. CUSTOMS AND INLAND REVENUE ACTS, 1890 to 1903, Applications for certificates under these Acts were made in respect of the following buildings:— Cambridge Buildings, Darling Row, Nos. 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41, 43, and two basements, eight tenements in all. Upon inspection, the premises were found to be in a dirty and neglected condition, several of the w.c.'s were choked and all of them were filthy, the sink wastes were defective, the yards ill-paved and strewn with rubbish, moreover the w.c. accommodation did not comply with my requirements as only a single closet is provided for each two lettings. I consider the application a piece of colossal impudence. The application was of course refused, and by order of the Public Health Committee a full sanitary notice was served and enforced. Church Street, No. 30 (six tenements). The certificate was refused as the lower portion of the building is used for trade purposes. Ross House, Moss Street (six tenements). The construction and arrangement of these buildings is satisfactory, but as the passages, staircases and several of the rooms were in a dirty condition at the time of my visit the certificate was refused, but was granted after the necessary cleansing had been effected. 62 Nos. 7 to 31, Derbyshire Street (39 tenements). Extensive drainage amendments were necessary in these cases. They were not quite complete at the date of inspection, but a written promise was given by Messrs. Bliss and Sons that these should be satisfactorily carried out. HOUSING OF THE WORKING CLASSES ACTS, 1690 to 1903. Digby Street and Brady Street Schemes. No advance has been made towards the clearing of these two unhealthy areas. In March, by direction of the Public Health Committee, I wrote to the London County Council to ask for a reconsideration of their refusal to deal with the Brady Street area. On April 20th a reply was received from the Clerk to the Council to the effect that the Housing of the Working Classes Committee had reconsidered the matter but were still unable to see their way to recommend the Council to prepare a scheme for the improvement of the area under Part 1 of the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1890, for the following reasons:— "In dealing with the matter the Committee have been given to understand that it is proposed to erect new buildings on a portion of the area, and in view of the alterations which are being effected in the character of the surrounding property, it would appear probable that at no distant date the area will be redeveloped through private enterprise. Under these circumstances the Committee cannot but feel that the rearrangement of the area at the public expense may not be altogether justifiable, and they trust, therefore, that pending the redevelopment the Borough Council will exercise, as far as possible, its powers under the Public Health and other Acts for remedying the evils connected with this area." 63 From what I can ascertain the hopes of the London County Council are premature, there is no prospect of this area being redeveloped by private enterprise for many years, and in the opinion of the Borough Council it is nothing less than a public scandal that the present condition of things should continue indefinitely. The early rebuilding excuse is an old one and does not redound much to the inventiveness of the L.C.C. and its Officers; for recently Mr. Foot, our Chief Inspector, during a search in the Record office at Spring Gardens, amongst some old plans and drainage applications fell across a bundle of correspondence, dated 1854, respecting the removal of some cesspools and the redrainage of certain premises in this very area. The then Surveyor to the Metropolitan Board of Works (the predecessors of the London County Council) recommended:— "That having regard to the small and fourth class character of the property and its aged and worn out condition generally, it would only be necessary to make arrangements for its temporary drainage as the premises would soon come down." This occurred over fifty years ago, yet the temporary system of drainage was only recently remodelled and the houses are standing and inhabited to-day, notwithstanding my repeated representations under the Housing Acts backed up as these are by the Borough Council. As a result of the frequent inspection of the area by the officers of the London County Council and the supposed probability of the early acquirement of the property by that Authority, some speculative house jobbers thought they saw their way to make a profit out of the scheme by resale at an advanced price. Upon the abandonment 64 of the scheme these gentlemen found themselves left in the lurch. Moreover, having paid full value for the property they are naturally indisposed to spend more money upon repairs than they are absolutely compelled to do. As a result the decay and dilapidation of the houses has increased, many of them are void, and the appearance of the fronts is most forlorn and depressing. Although hundreds of pounds have been spent by the Borough Council upon combined drains (sewers by law) the unhealthiness of the area has intensified. We are advised by the London County Council to use our powers and deal with individual houses, but even supposing we dealt with all the houses in the area one by one and got them patched up, such action would not widen any of the narrow streets or abolish the blind slums. Nothing short of an improvement scheme can effect any real and permanent good. We know by bitter experience the result of applications for closing orders under Part II of the Housing Act. If we are successful and the order is granted, the houses are temporarily closed, patched up and relet, but in the course of a few months they revert to their original condition. Worse still, we may be unsuccessful, and may fail to obtain closing orders as actually happened in one of the worst slums of this very area. In November last I made a careful inspection of Neath Place, Pereira Street, and Little Collingwood Street. I made a report to the Public Health Committee and advised proceedings under the amending Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1903. This Act dispenses with the requirement to serve notice to render premises fit for LITTLE COLLINGWOOD STREET (Now Colling Place). 65 habitation, and permits a Magistrate to close a house upon proof of uninhabitable condition. The Committee decided to take action with respect to four houses in Little Collingwood Street, a narrow slum 9 feet 10 inches wide and fairly represented in the photograph overleaf. The houses are small two-roomed huts, dirty, damp, dilapidated and unprovided with back light or through ventilation, the lower floors are below street level and unventilated beneath the boards. I was of opinion that the houses were incapable of repair and certified accordingly. Summonses were applied for on November 8th and were made returnable on November 21st, the earliest date possible. No sooner were the summonses served upon the owners than they determined to defeat us. They called in a builder of good repute and gave him a free hand. He immediately set his men to work, tore up the floors and relaid them, put windows in the back of each room so as to provide back light and through ventilation, removed all decayed plaster and woodwork and thoroughly renovated the premises. On the morning of the day fixed for the hearing 1 visited Little Collingwood Street and found a small army of builders hard at work; it was one of the coldest days in the year and, notwithstanding this, the workmen were then engaged upon No. 8. They had knocked a hole in the back front of the house for the purpose of inserting a window in the lower room and the street door was wide open for the men to pass in and out. The house was still occupied and the scantily clad mother and her two little ones were cowering over a bit of fire for such 66 warmth as they could obtain. The three other houses named in the summons had been similarly treated whilst still inhabited and the window frames were already in position. I prefer not to express my opinion as to the humanity of the procedure. I am afraid my language would not be printable. The fact remains that so much work had been accomplished that our only possible course was to offer to withdraw the summons, this, however, the sitting Magistrate, Mr. Cluer, would not permit and we were called upon to prove that the houses were uninhabitable at the time the summons was applied for. This presented no difficulty, but the allegation that the premises were incapable of repair was, on the face of it, incorrect and had to be abandoned. Ultimately the hearing was adjourned for the work to be completed. Mr. Cluer expressed the opinion that had he heard the case earlier he would have closed the premises in the interests of the occupiers. We have followed the advice of the County Council and have attempted to deal with single houses but the result so far is not encouraging. We appear to have arrived at an absolute impasse. Bethnal Green cannot clear these sites and the Statutory Authority under Part I of the Housing Acts refuses to help. I am afraid the London County Council is of opinion that Bethnal Green has had its share of public money in Boundary Street. Moreover, the members of this august body form to a certain extent a mutual admiration society. They are not particularly anxious to clear areas in back slums, but prefer public improvement schemes in prominent positions to which they can refer for their own glorification. 67 FACTORIES, WORKSHOPS, LAUNDRIES, WORKPLACES AND HOMEWORK. 1.—INSPECTION.

This man makes fancy bread of a kind much liked by Jews; he does not sell by retail but supplies small shops and street stalls in the neighbourhood; the premises are therefore technically a "workshop" bakehouse and so far as the special clauses of the Factory Acts apply are beyond the control of the Borough Council. In 1904 (when the underground bakehouse clauses of the Factory Act of 1901 were about to come into operation) notice of the requirements of the Council for all underground bakehouses in the Borough was served upon the occupier of 141, Bethnal Green Road. An undertaking was given by the owner of the premises that, for the future, the bakehouse should only be used in connection with the retail shop on the street level. On this undertaking certain works in connection with the underground bakehouse were sanctioned for the purpose of bringing the premises into conformity with the regulations of the Council. 70 The works were completed and in due course the certificate was applied for. The premises were now visited by the Public Health Committee; the structural condition was found to be fairly satisfactory but the bakehouse was very filthy. Moreover, the original intention of the owner to devote the shop above the bakehouse to the sale of bread had been abandoned, and the premises had been leased to a tailor who was then in occupation. The upper part of the house was let off in tenements and occupied by a number of dirty aliens, who were in the habit of throwing their slops out of window into the back yard. This yard, which is level with the bakehouse floor and common to the whole house, was in a very filthy condition. The Committee took into consideration the whole facts of the case and refused to grant the certificate until the original agreement had been plied with and some responsible person placed in charge of the whole premises. The house was visited from time to time by the Inspector of the District, who reported that the bakehouse, which was in constant use, was kept reasonably clean. This condition, however, was not maintained, and the bakehouse was permitted to lapse into its previously insanitary state. I visited the bakehouse on several occasions and never found it satisfactory. The floor was always dirty, and the tables and utensils filthy; the men employed were in the habit of smoking whilst at work and spat all over the place. By direction of the Public Health Committee the occupier was summoned to Worship Street, and fined 40/- and 23/- costs. The fine was paid, but very little improvement resulted and, as we were advised that we had no locus standi under the Factory Acts in a 71 shop" Bakehouse, the whole matter was referred to the Factory Department of the Home Office. H.M. Factory Inspector visited the premises and demanded from the occupier the certificate necessary under section 6 of the Factory Act of 1901; as this was not forthcoming and the use of the bakehouse was continued, a summons was issued upon the application of Mr. Bellhouse, H.M. Inspector. I proved the condition of the bakehouse and the refusal of the Certificate by the Council, and the Magistrate inflicted a fine of seven shillings and twenty-three shillings costs. On the 17th of January, 1906, the owner of the premises made another application to the Committee for a Certificate, the application was refused and the owner was advised to close his bakehouse. OUTWORKERS. During the year the Secretary of State issued a new Home-work Order, which will materially increase the duties of your Sanitary Staff, as the last four trades specified in the Order (dated August 15th, 1905) are carried on to a very large extent in domestic workshops in this borough. 72 STATUTORY RULES AND ORDERS, 1905.

CLEANSING OF PERSONS ACT, 1897. In March a circular letter was received from the London County Council calling attention to this Act and suggesting that more use might be made of its provisions. The letter was referred to the Public Health Committee, but as no application under the Act has ever been received the Committee decided to take no action at present. It would be quite easy to allocate one of the bath-rooms at the new disinfecting station to the purposes of the Act should the necessity arise. 76 SANITARY PROCEEDINGS DURING 1905 Premises Number of Places Number of inspections, 1905 Number of notices, 1905 Number of prosecutions 1905 On register at end of 1904 Added in 1905 Removed in 1905 On register at end of 1905 Milk premises 352 31 27 356 945 12 4 Cowsheds 15 — — 15 84 3 — Slaughter-houses 6 — — 6 26 — — Other offensive trade premises — — — - — — — Ice cream premises 65 23 16 72 176 29 — Registered houses let in lodgings 445 27 17 455 1088 Nuisances treated under Public Health Act.

The report of Mr. Foot, the Chief Sanitary Inspector, accompanies mine and contains details of the work performed by the staff under his control. A perusal of this report, which contains much interesting matter, will shew that an enormous amount of useful and important work is being steadily and quietly accomplished. Much of this work is underground, a large number of leaky old drains have been abolished and modern glazed pipes substituted for antiquated porous ones (in many instances I regret to say at the cost of the ratepayers). During Mr. Foot's term of office nearly the whole drainage system of Bethnal Green has been reconstructed. Improvements of this kind make very little show but must render the district more healthy and eventually lead to a diminished mortality. I have the honour to be, Sir and Gentlemen, Your very obedient servant, GEORGE PADDOCK BATE. 78 TABLE I. Vital Statistics of Whole District during 1905 and Previous Years.

THE Chief Inspector's Tenth Annual Report ON THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. FOR The Year ending December 31st, 1905. Arrangement of Staff. Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen. In presenting my Tenth Annual Report on the work of your department, it would I think be well to revert to certain alterations which were submitted for your approval towards the end of last year, and about the time the last annual report was being issued. Unless this is done, some little confusion may arise as to the working arrangements of your staff. Members of the Committee will recollect that up to the time mentioned, there had been special inspectors for visiting Workshops and Trade Premises, as well as all Tenement Houses, and that the District Inspectors were not concerned in any duties in connection with any of these premises. Local Conditions Having regard to the local conditions peculiar to this district, it was found to be quite a common occurrence to have under one roof, or in one set of premises, a set of circumstances that led to the presence of two or three different officers almost at the same time. Dwelling, Workshop and Tenement in one house Many of our houses constitute in themselves a workshop, as well as a dwelling, which may be and often is a registered tenement house. Consequently it often happened (particularly if a case of infectious disease occurred) that both the special inspectors, as well as the district inspector, were all making visits to one set of premises. 4 Reason for re-arrangement of duties and districts. Arrangements proposed. Special Officers. District Inspectors and Districts. This led to some overlapping of work, and also resulted in a little friction between the different officers. A district inspector could not brook the presence of a special inspector on his ground and the special man considered the other as more or less a nuisance and in the way. To prevent this growing into any great difficulty, I recommended that the duties be re cast, and the borough be divided up into six equal areas, and that on each of these small areas or districts there should be one inspector to carry out all the ordinary duties. This left Mr. Rowsell free to carry on the Food and Market Inspection, Mr. Jones for drainage, &c., both as heretofore, and Mr. Bilham to have charge of the indoor work, which had got into arrears, and needed moreover the assistance of a qualified inspector rather than a clerk. Your committee adopted these recommendations, and for about a year the following arrangements have been in force—so far as districts are concerned. Messrs. Richards and Bridel have the part of the borough east of Cambridge Road, divided into about equal parts; Messrs. Henley and Ainley the part of the borough north of Bethnal Green Road between them ; Messrs. Bare and Weeks the remainder south of Bethnal Green Road. System depends on loyal assistance. No one system of working can be made to include all the advantages, and at the same time exclude all the disadvantages, and the most carefully planned and well thought out scheme that can be introduced must, in the last resource, depend for successful application upon the loyal and intelligent co-operation of every member of the staff. It is with the greatest regret I am compelled to record the fact that in one or two instances during the present year there has been shown a disposition to make foolish difficulties about small things. Particularly in connection with making out report papers have I noticed this, and whilst I have no desire to go further into the matter at present I must remind those who do not at all times see the reason for what they are asked to do that I have a personal responsibility to your Committee for the due and proper execution of all your departmental work. Personal responsibility. This responsibility cannot be discharged unless a free and ready assistance is given, and much as I should personally regret it, an appeal 5 will have to be made to your Committee unless this position is fully recognised. No good results can be obtained on other lines, and I trust a proper feeling of good sense and some little tact may be shown by all concerned in order that any further reference to this may be obviated. These small faults and blemishes are the more irritating because there is no real reason for them, and because in the main and as a whole your staff is doing good sound and satisfactory work, and the sanitary condition of your borough is improving to an enormous extent and the improvement is being continued each year. Improved sanitary conditions. It is not easy to exactly describe in an annual report how the sanitary conditions of the borough do improve, but apart from one's knowledge and observations we may perhaps be allowed to take as a measure the operations of the Oxford House Sanitary Aid Committee which it is hardly necessary to add is the local branch of the Mansion House Council on the Dwellings of the Poor. Local Sanitary Aid Committees These local aid bodies or committees were formed some years ago with a view to inducing the several sanitary authorities to take up their duties more energetically and much more extensively. Our branch here was especially active and one can certainly say now there was undoubtedly a very good field indeed for its operations. Standard of comparison. As a convenient standard of comparison we may take the history and proceedings of this committee as a very useful guide. Some years ago, say fifteen or sixteen, this committee had not the slightest difficulty in getting literally hundreds of cases to send in to your predecessors in each year. This went on for some time, but very soon after the organisation of your Health Department on a practical working basis, your staff having got to work they soon found they had a difficulty in keeping up to their desired level of only one hundred cases per year. This was some few years ago, and not only has every succeeding year increased the difficulty they experienced in getting cases, but for 6 the present year, they have had to go out and make enquiries from house to house in order to find work to do. Difference in nature of complaints. Special totals. Primary Inspections. Tenement Houses and Regulations. Housing Question not solved. The difference in numbers is not by any means the only noticeable feature. Appreciable as this is, it is as nothing compared to the difference in the seriousness of the cases they send in now. Not only are serious nuisances becoming more rare, but a still more gratifying feature is the fact that large numbers of these are already under notice from your staff prior to their receipt from Oxford House. Before proceeding to the consideration of the details of general work, perhaps two or three totals may be of interest, and may not perhaps appear so " dry '' if dealt with apart from mere tables of figures. Firstly, our primary inspections may be worthy of note. In this would be included all first visits or new cases,—House-to-House, Complaints, Trade Inspections, Infectious Cases, Workshops, and Outworkers, &c.,—and the total of these visits for the year amount to the large number of 9,851. Of these, no less than 1,626 were to Factories and Workshops, and 1,88r to Outworkers Homes, or Domestic Workshops, and when it is considered that only a very few years back this duty was to all intents and purposes not even attempted, it forms a good guide as to the standard of sanitary supervision now exercised. Anqther item of interest may be found in the inspection of Registered or Tenement Houses. The number of Houses on the Register is 455, and the visits made to these, and Houses likely for Registration, were 1,088. Numbers of these were made at early morning or late in the evening. I do not suppose that anyone is now quite so foolish as to believe all the exaggerated nonsense that a few years ago was talked about the value of Tenement House Regulations, when some of our good friends were apparently trying hard to deceive themselves that even the great Housing Question itself was well on the way to solution by means of such Regulations. Apart from this somewhat far-drawn idea, these Regulations do 7 afford some sort of machinery for the regular inspection and supervision of some of the poorest and most squalid parts, but the solution of and permanent remedy for dealing with the conditions existing amongst that section of the people who inhabit Tenement Houses lies much deeper than these, or any such Regulations. Overcrowding a Poverty Problem. We may call overcrowding by this or any other name we may choose. We may invent Bye-Laws for harassing quite a large number of the poorer and more helpless classes of the population, and we may succeed in driving a good number of them about from place to place, whilst others may get fined or sent to prison, but whatever we may call it, and whatever it is pretended is and may be done with it, the fact remains that this overcrowding, with all its attendant evils, is a poverty problem, nothing more nor less. High Rents and Overcrowding. Poverty causes 98 per cent, of cases. Some few years ago, amongst many other things, it was put forward as an argument for more Regulations, that it was quite wrong to suppose that high rents made overcrowding. The contrary was suggested as the case, and it was said that the landlords farmed out the rooms to each family, and so made the enormous rents possible; in other words, that the overcrowding made high rents. Since then I have gone somewhat fully into the matter from this point of view, and, as a result of inquiry and observation, I am able to say that if the cases of overcrowding are taken, and careful inquiries made into the circumstances, it will be found that poverty and inability to pay the rent is the cause of 98 per cent, of all the cases that come under our notice. Police Court Fines no remedy. No check on bad landlords In many of the cases it will be found further that, from a variety of circumstances, there are many who formerly had three rooms, and can now only pay for two; and several others, who previously had two, can now scarcely pay the rent of one. No Regulations, with police-court fines and imprisonments can, nor does, alter these facts. So far from Regulations having checked the " rapacious landlord," they are, in many cases, only proving an additional burden on the poor weekly tenants. The "rapacious landlord" does not, of necessity, 8 get hit at all. He just simply lets the house to one tenant, who sub lets to the lodgers, and so becomes the legal registered keeper, and, as such, liable for carrying out the Regulations, whilst the actual landlord, rapacious or otherwise, is completely relieved of all trouble about Tenement House Registration. Undoubtedly, high rents and overcrowding act and react, the one on the other, in a manner somewhat difficult to determine, but whilst I have not found one single case where direct letting on an overcrowded basis has made an increased rental possible, I have found numerous instances where increase of rents has directly, and unquestionably, led to overcrowding. Rent Courts required. Of many instances I will take one of the most recent, and the most outrageous. It will serve as a practical illustration to the many. Take a row of houses, not a slum, but in what is termed a respectable street, and fairly good locality. Decent Tenants Harassed. The houses are occupied by a clean, decent class of working people, who, with a few exceptions, have kept their cottage to their own family. Originally these houses were what may be termed very moderately rented, and some few years back the rents were increased one shilling per week. On a recent change of ownership, each tenant had notice that an increase of four shillings per week would be made in the rents. Sub-lettiug to get the rent by tenants. The result is that in every house one or more rooms will have to be let, and in addition to their burden of increased rent, plus the inconvenience of lodgers, all these decent people can be harassed by Tenement House Regulations, which do not touch the landlord, or reduce the rents one iota. Many cases similar. There are many cases on similar lines which it is mere repetition to refer to, but all of which go to show, what everyone with practical acquaintance of the matter knew years ago, that deeper and broader measures are required, and that Regulations provide no remedy. 9 Foods and Drugs. Samples taken. The samples of Food taken, and the operations under the Food and Drugs Acts, do not call for special mention beyond the fact that the total number of samples taken amounted to 656. This is a larger number of samples than has hitherto been taken in any one year previously. Summonses, Foods and Drugs Acts. Sixty-one summonses were issued, and the fines and costs recovered amounted to ^170 2s. od. Legal Technicalities Having regard to the many technicalities and subtle loopholes of the Adulteration Acts, by means of which all persons who are sufficiently " tricky " can escape, and which is fast reducing the whole procedure to a solemn farce, the year's proceedings in this respect will, I venture to suggest, be considered quite as satisfactory as could be expected. Food Inspection in Markets. Whilst on the subject of Food it may be added here that the excellent results of the daily market inspections by Mr. Rowsell have continued. During the year four prosecutions were taken. Two of the defendants, who were aliens, absconded on the service of summonses. The other two were fined £10 and £12 respectively. Details ot General Work Full details of all the work performed are dealt with in the Appendices which follow further on, but special mention may, I think, be made of the list of sanitary improvements effected. As in previous years, an enormous amount of drainage amendment (or new drainage) has been accomplished, and is included in this total. Combined Drainage Decrease in Cost. I am happy to be able to add that this very important part of your sanitary work carried out by Mr. Jones is now getting more closely upto-date, and I have every confidence that your combined drainage bill will now commence to decrease, and your staff be released from trouble in this direction, and will be able to devote their attention more fully to other matters in connection with the upkeep of your district. 10 Reference to Appendices.

Consideration of Council. Full consideration of the detail works set out in the above will, 1 trust, go to satisfy the Members of the Council that the work of your Committee and its department has been maintained at its previous good level, and that the sanitary work of the Borough is being well looked after. The results of the legal proceedings, having regard to the glorious 11 Drainage Prosecution dismissed with costs. uncertainty connected with all legal work are, I venture to submit, on the whole satisfactory. The only cases that resulted somewhat unfortunately were those taken under the Drainage Bye-Laws of the L.C.C. The following special report, presented to your Committee at the time (and on your instructions sent to the L.C.C. and members of the Council), sufficiently explains the whole matter, and I do not think I can with advantage add thereto. Bye-Laws of L.c.c. held to be bad. To the Public Health Committee. Gentlemen, Re Legal Proceedings Against ihe Owner of 94, Cyprus Street. With reference to the summonses issued against the owner of these premises I beg to report as follows:— The Committee will recollect that the defendant took up the drain, which was found to be defective, and re-laid the same under the following conditions :— He provided an intercepting trap with two vertical pipes under the front parlour floor, but provided no manhole or chamber. He was told by the Officers of the Council that the position of the interceptor was contrary to Bye-Law No. 5 of the London County Council, and that the two vertical pipes connected with the interceptor did not provide means of access to the drain at the end of the building as required by Bye-Law No. 4 Bye-Law No. 5 reads :— " Every person shall provide in every main drain or other drain of such " building which may immediately communicate with any sewer a suitable and " efficient intercepting trap at a point as distant as may be practicable from such " building, and as near as may be practicable to the point at which such drain " may be connected with the sewer." Bye-Law No. 4 reads :— " He shall, whenever practicable, cause adequate means of access to such " drain to be provided at each end of such portion thereof as is beneath such " building." The defendant was advised to place the interceptor in a manhole or chamber under the footway, so that, in the event of any stoppage, the obstruction in the drain could be removed from without, and not from within the building. This provision would also comply with Bye-Law No. 9, which reads :— " A person shall not construct a drain of a building communicating with a " sewer in such a manner that there shall be within such building any inlet to " the drain except such inlet as may be necessary, from the apparatus of any " water-closet, slop sink, or urinal." 12 The defendant refused to carry out the suggestions of the Officers, and legal proceedings were therefore taken against him. The Magistrate, after hearing witnesses on the 5th December, adjourned the summonses for fourteen days. At the resumed hearing he said in effect that, during the adjournment, he had read the Bye-Laws carefully, and had come to the conclusion that the proceedings were bad, as the Bye-Laws gave no power to the Local Authority to compel any owner to place an interceptor or inspection-chamber under the footway, thereby increasing the owner's liability. He pointed out that any accident to a person, caused by the chamber under the footway, would increase the owner's liability. He then dismissed the summonses, and awarded the defendant five guineas' costs. This matter is of great importance apart from the result in this particular case. It means in this Borough, where probably at least 95 per cent, of the premises abut close on to the public footways, and have no intervening forecourts or areas in which to place these intercepting chambers, that the requirements of the Bye-Laws cannot be enforced, and do not, in fact, legally apply if an owner of existing premises cannot be made to use the footway for this purpose, although the Local Authority has given its consent. It is obviously a most unsatisfactory arrangement, and quite contrary to all ideas of good sanitation that this trap should be permitted to remain under a parlour floor, and I venture to suggest that, as these Bye-Laws are made by the London County Council, the facts should be reported to them. I am, Gentlemen, Your obedient Servant, John Foot. Local Governmerit Board. Repayment of half of Inspector's salaries. Adverting to correspondence with the L.G.B., the following memorandum was prepared for the information of your Chairman at the time, and which I reproduce here for the information of the members of the Council generally. Nothing that has occurred since in connection with this matter makes any alteration necessary, except to add that the " Board's Order " is antiquated and requires revising, so as to make it include all reasonable and practical sanitary work and supervision. The mere fact that a narrow and strict interpretation of this Order excludes the amendment of defective drains from its operation, does not get rid of the further fact that work of this character is sanitary work of the highest possible importance, and should be recognised as such. 13 fttrmoranbum bu tfje Cfjirf Inspector re Local Government Board repayment of one-half of Sanitary Inspectors' Salary. Dispute not new. The dispute respecting the allowance of these salaries has been going on for a very long period, not only as regards Bethnal Green, hut as regards other Metropolitan Sanitary Authorities. Merits of case. On the merits of the case the Local Government Eoard take up an attitude that cannot be described as encouraging to those local sanitary authorities who desire to carry out their duties, and to employ an efficient staff for that purpose. From time to time, and particularly on the appointment of a new inspector, or any re-arrangement of the duties of those existing, a number of questions are raised as to whether the proposed duties are strictly in accordance with the terms of the Order of the Board relating to the duties of a Sanitary Inspector, and objection is taken to the repayment of the half salary unless it can be shown that these duties are strictly within the terms of that Order. Objections by L. G. B. Special objection appears to be taken in respect to— (a) The supervision of repairs and amendments to house drains ; and (b) The supervision of drains and sanitary fittings in new buildings when in course of erection. Extraordinary as it may appear, the Local Government Board do not, apparently, consider that supervising the amendment of house drains, inspecting the laying of new house drains, or the fitting up of sanitary conveniences, w.c's., sinks, &c , in new houses is sanitary work of sufficient importance to justify them in sanctioning repayment of the half salaries of those sanitary inspectors who may be engaged in this work. So far has this objection been carried, that to avoid any dispute Mr. Jones has for the last four years been specially deputed to carry out this work, and the whole of his salary has been borne by this Council, and no allowance claimed from, or allowed by the Local 14 Government Board, although in truth—and in fact—his entire duties can only be described as sanitary work of the highest possible importance, and well within the intention, if not within the letter of the Public Health (London) Act. From an efficient sanitary point of view the action of the Board is most regrettable, and having regard to the statutory provisions of the Public Health (London) Act, 189c, its legality is, to say the least, very much open to dispute. Amendment of existing defective drains. Take first the question of amendment of old house drains. Section II. of the Act declares, infer alia, that any drain so foul and defective as to be a nuisance or injurious to health, shall be deemed to be a nuisance liable to be dealt with under this Act. Board's Order as to Nuisances. The Sanitary Inspector is required not only by the terms of the Act, but also by the terms of the Board's own order, to visit premises and ascertain what nuisances exist, and then to take the necessary measures for the suppression and removal of all such nuisances within his district. Clause II. of the Order specifically requires the officer to " superintend and see to the due execution of all works which may be undertaken under the direction of the Authority for the suppression and removal of nuisances, &c." It is not clear what words mean if these do not include the supervision of works necessary for the abatement of all nuisances, including those that arise from defective house drainage. New Buildings. As regards new buildings, the practical outcome of the position taken up by the Board would apparently be that the Sanitary Authority should stand by until the house is built and occupied, and after this has taken place should then direct their Inspector to visit and ascertain whether the house possesses any drains, w.c's., or sanitary conveniences. This is apparently carrying the traditions of hampering local sanitary authorities a little further than it has hitherto been taken, and I venture to submit that apart from the question of practicable methods of carrying out sanitary duties, the legal position in this case is at least as doubtful as that in the former. 15 Provisions ot Public Health (London) Act. Refer first to Section 48 (2), which enacts that no newly erected house shall be occupied until the Sanitary Authority has issued a certificate respecting the water supply. Section 37 forbids the erection of, or re-building of any house without sufficient ashpits, one or more proper and sufficient w.c's., with water supply, apparatus, fittings, trapped soil pan, &c. Section 38 enacts similar provisions as regards factories, work shops, and workplaces, whether built before or after the passing of this Act. Section 39 empowers the County Council to make bye-laws with respect to the provision of water closets, ashpits, and other things; and Sub-section 3 makes it the statutory duty of the sanitary authority to enforce the bye-laws so made. There are other sections equally emphatic, but these are sufficient for the purpose of pressing home the point that sanitary authorities have statutory duties to perform in connection with buildings, and it would be interesting to know how they are to execute these duties except by the visitation and report of their sanitary inspectors, who are appointed for this amongst other similar purposes. If this is the position—and its correctness cannot be denied—I suggest that the interference of the Board is no more legal than it is practical, and most certainly it is contrary to the letter and spirit of Clause I. of the Board's own Order, which requires every inspector, as a condition of appointment, to carry out all the duties imposed by any statute or statutes. The sections referred to above prove, I submit, that the duties are specifically imposed by statute, and in these circumstances the action of the Board appears somewhat inexplicable. Indoor and clerical work of Inspectors. The remaining point in dispute is on the question of book-keeping, or the clerical side of the inspector's work, and in this, as in other cases referred to, the action of the Board is equally regrettable. To comply with the statutory duties a number of books, &c., have to be kept, such as Nuisance Registers, Forms, and the like. To execute this part of the duty a number of qualified inspectors could, if so desired, be kept in the office filling up these books and forms for at least one-half of their time. 16 and the Board would apparently raise no objection to paying one-hall the salaries for duties so performed. Wasting Inspectors on office work. The wastefulness of a system that permits technically trained inspectors to remain in office doing clerical work, instead of being on their district inspecting premises, is too obvious to need explanation and it is to the credit of the Council that rather than continue any apparent difference on this point they have placed Mr. Bilham in charge of the indoor work, and are paying the whole of his salary without claim on the Local Government Board. The result is, that whilst according to all these technicalities there are two inspectors less (Mr. Jones and Mr. Bilham), there is in actual fact just the same number of officers who are doing precisely similar duties as before. Go on with your duty. There is nothing to be angry about, neither is there anything that needs altering. If it pleases the Government Department to take up such a difficult and discouraging attitude to a local authority which is endeavouring to do its whole duty to the best of its ability, we must allow that department to do so. In the meantime we will get on with our work, and trust that in due course the Local Government Board will adopt a more liberal attitude, and recognise the good work that has been accomplished, and the improvement that is taking place in the sanitary condition of the Borough. JOHN FOOT. Registration of Coftee Houses, etc. For the better protection ot those persons who purchase their food at coffee houses and similar places your Committee after careful consideration decided to make a representation to the L.C.C. to the effect that all places where food is prepared for sale to the public should be registered, and that the occupiers should be liable for annual re-registration and made amenable to suitable regulations for the better inspection and supervision of all such places. The Committee suggested that the L.C.C. should in one of their General Powers Bills, insert a clause to obtain the requisite parliamentary sanction. 17 Unfortunately the authorities at Spring Gardens are of opinion that the existing powers are quite sufficient, and they declined to entertain your Committee's suggestion. Margarine on Bread. With regard to the practice of selling margarine on bread, when bread and butter is asked for, the following letter was sent to the proprietors of all coffee houses, &c., in the borough. This letter has had a good effect. Sir or Madam, In consequence of complaints that have been made to the Public Health Committee that in many cases where bread and butter is asked for in certain coffee shops, bread and margarine is in fact supplied, I am directed to inform all the proprietors of coffee houses and refreshment places within the borough that instructions have been given that in future the law relating to adulteration and the substitution of inferior articles for those asked for will be rigidly enforced in the cases above mentioned. This letter is sent to give each proprietor notice in order that the practice where it exists, of substituting margarine for butter when butter is asked for, should be at once discontinued. I am, Sir or Madam, Your obedient Servant, JOHN FOOT. Transfer 01 Schools. Education Act. Under the provisions of the new Education Act respecting the transfer of what is usually called the non-provided schools, a considerable amount of work has been thrown upon the department in connection with drainage amendments, alterations of sanitary conveniences and repairs. In most of the cases the works have been arranged and carried out in a very satisfactory manner, and the remainder will I believe be shortly in hand. Shelter during Disinfection ot Houses. Having had some few years experience of trying to provide accommodation in temporary premises for those persons requiring shelter during the time their homes are being disinfected, and finding the experience not at all satisfactory, your committee after enquiry decided to recommend the Council to purchase the premises No. 3, St. James Road. 18 The recommendation was adopted, and the premises having been purchased your Committee are now in a position to carry out all its obligations in respect of this matter, and can provide accommodation sufficient to meet all ordinary requirements. New Acts Affecting this authority. The only legislation coming into force during the year and likely to affect the department, is the Alien Immigration Act, and the New Order under the Factory and Workshops Act, making certain additions to the outworkers' lists in respect of several trades. This will make some additional work for the department but it is too early as yet to express an opinion as to how much. New appointments. The only new appointments that have taken effect during the year are those of Messrs. Bull and Saunders, two junior clerks in the office. Mr. Bull has since his appointment here, been most courteous and obliging, and I have every reason to believe he will make a good officer. I greatly regret the other appointment has not proved more fortunate than it has. Night visits. Tenement and similar houses. I mentioned earlier in the report that a large number of visits had been made to registered tenement houses, out of usual office hours, that is, very late at night or early in the morning. In connection with this matter, I am of opinion that your inspectors have a somewhat substantial grievance. It is by no means a pleasant duty to get up at 4 a.m. to visit a number of tenement houses, with a view to detecting over-crowding. Neither is it at all times an agreeable task to be visiting these same tenements until perhaps midnight, and I venture to suggest that the duties so discharged should rank for the remuneration that is allowed in the case of taking samples of food late at night or early morning. At present " time off" is the only consideration made or allowed for this extra duty, and I am strongly of opinion that this matter should receive your favourable consideration in the direction indicated. 19 In concluding this report of the work carried out on your behalf during 1905, I venture to commend to your most favourable notice the efforts made by your staff to further improve the sanitary condition of the borough. And am, Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, Your most obedient Servant, JOHN FOOT, Chief Sanitary Inspector and Associate Member, Royal Institute of Public Health, etc., etc. 20 21 APPENDIX A.

Theoretically, of course, these three columns should agree. The following are the reasons why they do not:—In the case of Milk six samples were found but slightly adulterated, and the vendors were warned by letter by order of the Committee. Of thirty-two summonses issued re Adulterated Milk, two were dismissed on the " warranty " defence, one on the decision of the magistrate that the certificate was ambiguous, and three were withdrawn, one on production of a warranty, one by reason of a conviction being obtained on another summons respecting the same sample, and one by the Public Health Committee, who accepted the explanation of the vendor. 30 As to Butter, of eighteen summonses issued, two were dismissed on the decision of the magistrate that sufficient notice had been given by the vendor, and three were withdrawn, one on a technical difficulty arising, and two by reason of convictions being obtained on other summonses in respect of the same sample. Respecting Demerara Sugar, the fraud in these cases consisted of supplying beet sugar, coloured with a minute quantity of aniline dye, instead of cane sugar. One conviction was obtained, one summons was dismissed by the magistrate on the facts above stated, as disclosed by the analyst's certificate, and in two later instances the summonses were not issued owing to the magistrate's remarks, he being of the opinion that no real fraud had been committed. In the case of Sausages, the seven samples found adulterated contained boric acid. In four of these cases the Committee decided not to prosecute owing to a previous adverse decision at the Police Court, but later summonses were issued in three cases, and, after a lengthy hearing, one conviction was obtained. The vendor has given notice of appeal, and the two further cases have therefore been adjourned to await the result of the appeal. With respect to the one sample of Vinegar found adulterated, a dispute arose as to the purchase by the Inspector's Agent, and, after hearing the particulars, the Committee decided that no summons be issued. One sample of Camphorated Oil was found to be deficient in camphor to the extent of merely 51/3°/0. This could very easily have happened by evaporation, and the Committee, taking this view of the matter, a caution only was administered to the vendor. 31 APPENDIX I.—Legal Proceedings taken under Food and Drugs Acts.

The greatest difficulty in dealing with these premises arises during the summer, when the question of the irregular removal of offal sometimes becomes acute, and necessitates incessant visitation of these places. Early in the year a circular letter was sent by order of the Public Health Committee to occupies of fried fish shops, calling attention to the necessity of great care being exercised in the storage of offal, and the frequent removal of the same. This letter has had a good effect, but constant supervision is nevertheless required. It is satisfactory to note that no complaints have been received as the results of inspection by other authorities. 54 APPENDIX R. (A) Sanitary Labour Accounts. No. of Weeks.

MR. CANNING'S EARLY LIFE.

Death has fixed an indelible stamp on the charac-
ter of our lamented Statesman. The British nation,
with one consenting voice, now proclaims him as the
author of her prosperity : Europe from her heart
thanks him for breaking the holy knot of slavery,
and Spanish America will for ever acknowledge him
as the promoter of human happiness, and the cham-
pion of popular and rational freedom.
Every incident respecting so great a man is be-
come the object of public curiosity. Envy will be
buried in his grave, and his mighty talents will as-
sume their just dimensions.
A few traits of his early life are not sufficiently
known. Some mistakes, likewise, respecting his
boyhood, I can correct, having been his contem-
porary both at school and at Oxford. When Mr.
Canning was about eight years old, he was placed
at Hyde-abbey School, Winchester; by his uncle,
Mr. Stratford Canning, an eminent merchant in
London, the father of our Ambassador at Constan-
tinople. Under the judicious management of his
preceptor, the Rev. Charles Richards, Mr. Canning
continued for. six or seven years, during which time
he uniformly displayed a superiority of talent among
his competitors. His compositions at an early age
were distinguished by an extraordinary vigour of
mind. I well remember that his prize-poem on the
Altar-piece in Winchester Cathedral, the subject of
which picture was the Resurrection of Lazarus, by
West, was recited by him at the public exhibition in
Hyde Abbey School. At another literary perform-
ance, Mr. Canning displayed those powers of elocu-
tion which afterwards so often arrested the attention
of the House of Commons. A considerable selec-
tion from the Greek play of Orestes, by Euripides,
was exhibited by the students; and Mr. Canning,
at this time, with surprising judgment and sensibi-
lity, portrayed the madness of the matricide in all the
horrors of conscious guilt. I likewise recollect that
Mr. Canning once gave a signal proof of the tena-
ciousness of memory, by reciting, as a voluntary
exercise after the vacation, the whole of Gray's
poems. Several litttle pieces of Mr. Canning's
poetry, which afterwards received the public appro-
bation, were at first produced at Hyde Abbey
School.. Clearly visible in his boyish years was that
amiable and affectionate temper, which followed him
through life, and endeared him to so many friends.
When Mr. Canning had obtained the first rank at
Hyde Abbey School, with the reputation of being
an excellent scholar, he was removed to Eton,
where he was soon noticed for his brilliant abilities.
In due time he resided at Oxford, at Christ Church,
and, pursuing the same splendid career, contracted a
great intimacy with the present Lord Liverpool.
Through the Whole tenour of his political life,
Mr. Canning was not backward in acknowledging
his gratitude and affection for the Rev. Charles
Richards, the preceptor of his youth. Having always
revered this my old schoolmaster, I have kept, up
my acquaintance with him for the last forty years,
and have frequently heard him declare that Mr. Can-
ning was in the habit of sending him his printed
speeches. It has likewise been affirmed by many,
that Mr. Canning publicly confessed that he felt the
greatest obligations to Mr. Richards for the first
expansion of his splendid talents. I have also been
credibly informed, that Mr. Canning had earnestly
solicited Lord Liverpool for some church preferment
for his old preceptor, but was not successful in his
application. This circumstance I mention, that no
imputation of neglect towards his preceptor might
spread a blot over this bright luminary of the nation,
which is now set in the awful darkness of death.
However, his glory will continue to increase by the
effects of his benevolent and wise policy, if it should
be followed by his successor. From this history of
Mr. Canning's early life, which can be confirmed by
many living witnesses now in high stations, the
following truth may be deduced :—A good school and
university education was the basis of Mr. Canning's
unrivalled pre-eminence, both as an orator and a
statesman.—Tintes. CONTFAIPORANEUS.

LAMENT FOR THE DEPARTED.

WRITTEN ON THE DEATH OF THE RIGHT HON. G. CANNING

Mourn, England ! mourn and weep—for he is gone !
He who so lately was thy proudest boast,
Is coldly stretched upon the bed of death !
A Monarch's pray'rs were offer'd up for him—.
O'er him an anxious people watch'd and pray'd—
And oh! if human skill could aught avail—
If earthly honours, influence, or wealth--
If anguish's' friendship, or devoted love,
Could turn aside the destined shaft of death....-
CANNING would still have lived, his country's pride !
But now he rests from all the cares of State
His painful hours of intellectual toil, -
His manly struggles for the people's rights, •
Ilia firm attachment to a patriot King,
And his rich eloquence in Freedom's cause
Areall acknowledged by the nation's tears.
Mourn, England ! mourn and weep—for he is gone !
Where is the envy that pursued his path,
From early manhood to exalted pow'r?
Where are the poison'd shafts of slander now ?
Oh ! they were poured upon him while he lived—
Let them be buried in the great man's grave !
The stifled voice of calumny is hush'd—
The tongue of-falsehood silenced in its shame—
And trembling hatred pauses o'er his death.
Has he, then, triumph'd o'er his deadliest foes ?
Ev'n those who lately sought to wound his fame—
Ev'n they lament that he is now no more !
Such is the fate of man. If genius live
In his capacious mind, and noble deeds .
Crown him with greatness in his country's eyes,
Then jealous foes insult his envied name—
Yet will they follow to his tomb in tears.
This truth did CANNINO's wounded spirit feel.—
Mourn, England ! mourn and weep—for he is gone !
His private virtues and his public worth
Are now by all remembered and confessed.
Oh ! he was true and " faithful unto death"
In his loved Country's cause !—Ev'n at the last,
When Nature lay exhausted in the strife,
And Reason trembled on her native throne,—
Ev'n then the dying Statesman's loyal heart
Breathed its warm pray'r for England and her King !
'Twas in the sigh of his departing soul—
The last expression of his closing eyes,
Ere his immortal spirit fled from earth !
Angels of Peace will hover o'er his tomb—
And Truth will bless the memory of him
Who died a mental martyr in her cause.
Mourn, England ! mourn—for he is gone for ever !
W. HERSEE.

TO THE EDITOR OF THE SUN.
Sir—ln reply to your report of the case of Atkinson v.
Bachelor, relative to porter, ale, spirits, &c..being sold in
unlicensed eating-houses, I, as a Licensed Victualler, pay-
ing heavy duties to Government for that license, must I4eg
leave to complain that cook-shops and eating-houses having
no license to pay, contrive to supplant the actual Licensed
Victualler ; and,
Sir, it is a well-known fact in the trade,
that through
.the unjust competition of these non-licensed
victuallers, the actual publican is obliged to serve the cook-
shops with porter, ale, spirits, &c. and give up half bis
profitseven in those articles, to the very man who is actually
taking from him, by means of the said unjust competition,
all the profits of victualling the public in his own licensed
house. This it is which compels publicans in many cases
to keep their houses open after 'eleven o'clock at night,
since it deprives them of making a living in the, day time.
But, Sir, I should advise all publicans to avoid this evil
for the future, and since they have all the heavy expenses
of the duties, &c., it is but fair they should have the larger
profits to cover them ; for the future, therefore, (since the
deadmlaiik likewise

that, instead of theLNicv,c.ietntc;, the eating-houses supply the

When the English and French were disputing
as to their respective rights to certain territories in America,
VourantE happily remarked that they were quite agreed
upon only one point, viz. that the natives had no right at
all to the iandi iti queetios. •

FISH-MARKET, BILLINGSGATE.

There was a very limited supply of fish at the market
this morning, less, indeed, than on any day during the
week ; the stock principally consisted of Soles and Salmon.
The following were the prices :

About 30 vessels of Oysters were at market, chiefly of a
common description.—lt is perhaps not generally known
that a bushel of Oysters at Billingsgate is eight pecks,
being double the quantity contained in an ordinary mea-
sure. We mention this in consequence of the numerous
impositions that are practised upon the unwary stranger
at Billingsgate.

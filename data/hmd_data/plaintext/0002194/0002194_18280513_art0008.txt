On the motion of the Noble Lord the petition was re-

subject.
A similar petition was presented by the Duke of
ATHOL, from the central division of the county of Perth.
The Nobie Duke presented a petition from the same place

Similar petitions were presented from Colchester and

The Earl of LON4DALE presented a petition from

APer same observations from the Bishop of Ossonv
Lad Lord Curnrw, the petition was laid on tire table.
Lord SHAFTESBURY msved the third reading of the
Isle of Man Corn Bill.

Lori MALMESEURY, before the third reading of this
Bil:, begged to observe that within the last three months rot
less than 23,000 sacks of flour had been imported, into Eng-
land from the Isle cf Man ; and wheat had been carried
there to the amount of 20,000 qra. upon which the duty
had net been paid; that the velue of this could not be less
than '70,C50. to Sk),0001. ; and that if the duty consistent
with that imposed lest y.-ar bad been paid, it would
have amounted to the sum of 40,0001.,—the whole_
of this duty had been evaded, and the present Bill was.
intended to correct the abuse. The Noble Lord's view of
the subject was, that there ought to be, on the present oc-
casion, a prohibition instead of a dots'. A prohibition
was intended, and if so, a short Act of that nature ought to
be pasted until the Corn Bill' in progress in the other House,
had passed intwa law. 'The duty consistent with that
pawed last year neght • at' all- *manta in be I Is. ; and the,
Nab& -Laid was quite inaiou:s to know GA whit'grOunitt.
this flour. was to be received from she Tale of Man, on,
paying a duty of Ilia Lordship 6;so thought that this
Bid ought to have beeil passed in March lest,, because it
was notorious at that time that traffic was going on then.
en the whole the -Noli!e Lord thought that a prohibitory
act slicuA be pas:;ed, or a duty ecual to last yeae's laid

The Da!te of WELLINGTON could assure his Nch!e
Friend that he had merely heard of this traffic by accident,
and that the moment he heard of it, he requested that a
praper measure might be adopted. With rtypect to the:
diffirer,ce between the ss. and l la. duty _alluded'
to by the Noble Lord, this grain had been in the warebcnse
for. nearly a year, which with the charge of carrying it to
the Lie of Ilan, would make it nearly as much as the duty
imposed last year. At all events tke Noble Duke thought it
would be better to pass this Bill as it was, than send it back
to the Commons to have otherproviaicria, which would take
up considerable adclitimal time. For his own ptrt be was
no party to the mistake that had taken Owe, by which this
trade bad been permitted hr go on. All be could say or
knew war, that the .moment he heard of it be desired
mean.; to be adopted for a remedy.
The Bill, with several others, was then read a third time.

FITZWILLIAM presented petitions from the In-
habitants of PontefraBt, Yorkshire, praying for the abolition.
of Slavery. _ . .

The Duke of RICHMOND. presented petitions from
varicus parts of ._uffoilk wgaitut the importation of foreign
grain. Aloo, petitions from several parishes near Tun-
bridge Wells, anti from the Freeboklers and Commissioners

Dr. Ramage and the surgical class of the Windmill-street
llitalical School, Westminster, praying for the removal of

Lord CLIFi..:EN presented a petition Zrom the Roman
CaCcelics of a parish in Yorkshire, praying for the remo-
val of their disabilities.

Lord DARNLEY presenkd a petition signed by about a

of the bartkcrs, merchants, and respectable. people in that
town, in favour of the Penryn Disfranchisement BilL, He
bad been toll by those who sent him the petite that a
petition was scree time ::go presented to them for signature,
deprecating the introduction of the ;iglu GI representation
to the town of 'Manchester, They stated that they had
qsigned that petition tkecay.se they thought that they must

While' Strangers were excluded, we undei•stood that
Lord TErtrxitrort,i moved an amendment, to limit the
operation of the Bill to four years, to which
Lord WHARNCLIFFE at first objected, but ulti-
mately withdrew his opposition, from a fear of hazarding'
the safety of the Bill.
Lord WHARNCLIFFE stated, that after the discus-

he should move the postponement of the consideratiou of
the Night Poaching Bill to Friday next.
On the motion of the LORD CHANCELLOR, the Sale

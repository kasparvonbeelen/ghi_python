[FRO:4 TliE YAlitEg (Morni,l';) CaRONIcr,P..II

" September 3, 1814:

" We yesterday evening received infdrthatiOri,
ivhich will with great difficulty obtain credit,
considering the rigour of the blockade of the ports
of the United States, and the pOwerfUl naval force
employed to prevent all egress. It is said that the
Constitution, and another large American frigate,
are at sea. The Leviathan, 74, convoying the
Jamaica fleet, re-captured a vessel which had been
boarded by them the day before."
"It was again reported, yesterday, that the
British Plenipotentiaries from Ghent had arrived
in England. We believe that this rumour is un-.
founded ; but we are told, that on an application
to a Public Office, to transmit some letters of im-
portance so one of them (from the Chronicle Of-
fice we suppose), the bearer was informed that it
would be more prudent to retain them, as it was
probable that the Commissioner would he in Lon-
don before the time would allow these communi-
cations to reach Ghent."

" We rejoice to learn, that orders were issued
by Government, on Wednesday, for the raising
the blockade of the ports of Norway."
We need make no apology for the abuse we
erroneously vented against the character of the
British Government on this score. Though it
happened not to be so cruel and unjust as we as-
serted on this occasion, our vituperations may be
placed to the old account for the infamous attack
upon Copenhagen!!!

A FFAIR.OF HONOUR.--In consequence of some
trifling dispute at a dance, the previous evening,
on Sunday morning, at an early hour, Michael
Sheehan, of Clough, a common farmer, and Mi-
chael Donnelly, of 'he saute occupation, met
near the village of Croagh, to settle their dispute
in an honourable manner—the seconds having placed
the combatants on the ground, both struck at
each other with loaded sticks, when the fotmer
received a wound in the temple front Donnelly,
which unfortunately proved mortal. The follc,v-
log day, Jon N CON, EA-.1. a Coroner, held an in-
tiost on the body of Sheehan ; several witnesses
Were examined, ny which it appeared that the de-
ceased had sent the challenge. Verdict—Died •
front a blow of a.stick, received from Donnelly.—
.(Limerick Paper.)
SOLOMON AND THE CAT.-The following curi-
ous circiontance maybe relied on as a fact, which
occurred during the late lire at Bankside:—.ln
One of the. houses that a illeated .Is ileet of
fire, the firemen perceived a cat sitting on some
bags which were in the midst of the flames ; the
cat cried " ink ! mew !" most bitterly, finding
her escape impossible. One of the firemen who
saw and heard hei-, cried out to Solomon, a Jew,
who assisted them to work at the engine, " So-
lomon, you hear the cat calls out, Jew ! Jew !"
Solomon looked up and perceived the perilous
situation of the unfortunate cut, who cried out •
again, " mew ! new 1" Solomon im)st emphati-
cally cried, " you shall not be disappointed in
the Jew, if, at the risk of my life, I can save
you." He threw up a rope, to which there was
a hook attached, which fortunately stuck in the
sack, and with a quick jerk, he pulled the sack
from the midst of the flames, and also the cat,
whose hair was all singed from the fire. During
an hour afterwards whilst he worked at the engine,
the cat never quitted him, hut held fast on his
shoulder, or sat near him, on the engine ; and he
afterwards brought the cat home to his own house,
No. 5, Little Drury-lane.

Smuggling bas got to such a pitch in the article
of tea, that it seems necessary to diminish the
temptation by reducing the duty. It is said, that
not fewer than eight vessels were seized by the
Custom•honse during the last week.

A bookseller has hecu arrested at Basle, be-
cause he sent to one of his colleagues, at Mul-
hausen, a parcel of books and caricatures against
a great Monarch, which was opened at St. Louis.
The bookseller of Mulhausen is also apprehended,
and has been sent to Colmar for trial.

The deprivation of Dr. BROWNE, of Cambridge,
is appealed from by the Doctor, and will there-
fore, probably, come before the Loan CHANCEL-
Lon for -ultimate decision. The grounds of ac-
ci,sa.tion against Dr. B. were two-fold, viz. for
mismaaageineot of the revenue of that Society,
and a disregard of that moral conduct which ongla
to characterize the presiding guardian of a colle-
giate body.

A few -da3s ago, about half-past one p. in. a
person was seen to ascend a pole erected on the
top of the spire of St. Thomas's Church, in this
town, and about three yards higher than the vane,
where he sat for 'a few minutes, and waved his
hat, to the astonishment and dread of a number
of spectators.—(Liverpool Courier, Aug. 31.)
A person, with warrants, arrived at the Old
Ship, Prighton, a few days ago, in quest of
.Mrs.
Rogers; Dr. Bowen, &c. in consequence of the
suspicions which had arisen on the Coroner's In-
quest on the new-horn infant that was found in
the river Thames, on the 22d ult. near to Strand-
on-the-Green, Kew-bridge. The visit, however,
was an ineffectual one, for Mrs. Rogers, Dr.
Bowen, Airs. Bowen, their muhato servant, &c.
embarked in the Eliza packet. Captain LIND, on
Tuesday se'nnight, and had a speedy passage to
France. The party arrived at the Old 'Ship about
ten o'clock in the morning of Tuesday, and sailed
on the same evening.
A melancholy accident happened on Ft iday even-
ing, in the parish of Fenwick (Scotland) :---A
far Mer having gone out at an: o'clock, to draw •
some lime, part-of the kiln gave way, and he was':
thrown among the ashes. Immediate assistance
was procured, .and the unhappy titan was beard
several times calling for relief, lnr above an hour;
but although every exertion tas used, it was near
nine o'clock before the lime and ashes could be
removed, when the body was found in a shocking
state.

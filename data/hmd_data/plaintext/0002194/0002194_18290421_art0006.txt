GENERAL ORDER.

Horse Guards, April 4, 1829.
The Quarter-Master-General having represented to the
General Commanding-in-Chief that questions have arisen
respecting the distribution of allowance, which, under his
Majesty's warrant, dated August 25, 1827, had been
granted under the head of " Commuted Allowance for
Carriage of Baggage for Regiments on a March in Great
Britain," his Lordship has been pleased to command that
the distributio❑ of this allowance to individual officers,
and for regimental stores in Great Britain, shall be exactly
the same as has been regulated and detailed in the same
warrant for individual officers, and for regimental stores
in Ireland ; and that the overplus of such weight for
which such commuted allowance is intended to provide
shall he considered as applicable to baggage of the troops
or companies, and for such purpose exclusively ; it being
also most clearly to be understood, that in no case shall
the charge against the public be greater than the sum spe-
cified in his Majesty's warrant, above alluded to.
By Command of the Right Honourable
The General Commanding-in-Chief,
HERBERT TAYLOR, Adjutant-Gen.

On Sunday night between eight and nine
o'clock, as a lady named PHILLIPS was coming to town
by the Clapham stage, one of those thieves who infest that
road got up behind the vehicle, and with a sharp instru-
ment cut through her clothes, and wounded her on her
left thigh. The ruffian faded in getting possession of Mrs.
PHILLIPS' pocket, and before she could give an alarm he
jumped down and escaped.
AN ORIGINAL ANECDOTE.—LateIy an Irish
recruit arrived at the depot. A common soldier seeing
the raw fellow, exclaimed—." Well, Paddy, how do the
'tatoes taste in Ireland ?"—E Ab, jewel, (said the recruit),
as I can't give you a taste of the 'tatoc, here's a taste of
the stalk," and with his thorn stick knocked down the sol-
dier, to the great amusement of the bystanders.— Western
Times.

Immense damage is done to the fruit trees at
Salisbury, and various other parts of the country, by the
late heavy storm of hail, thundee, and lightning.—Hants

name and description of office, to sue for and re-
cover the same from such person, with double costs

Westminster, by action of debt, in which action it
shall be sufficient for such receiver to declare as for

the action may, at the discretion of any Judge of
such Court, be held to special bail in such compe-
tent sum as the Judge shall order; and the Court

sion for such sum as upon the report shall appear
to be due.

the purposes of this Act, or that the deceased died
possessed of money had and received for the pur-
poses of this Act, Whereby an action accrued to the
plaintiff to demand and have the sisme from such
executors or administrators ; and the like action
may be brought • against any executors or adminis-
trators of executors or administrators; and in ali
such actions the defendant or defendants may plead
in like manner and avail themselves of the like
matters in defence as in any action founded upon
simple contracts of the original testator or• intestate;
and the Court. may refer the account in dispute to
be audited by any officer or person, and may pro-
ceed upon the report of such referee in like manner

for; and if such Overseers shall pay to the Receiver
the amount mentioned in the warrant, before the
same shall be levied as aforesaid, they may after-
wards proceed to levy the same, in order to reim-
burse themselves that amount ; and the Overseers,
at the time of making any payment to the Receiver,
shall deliver to him a note in writing, signed by them,
specifying the amount so paid, which note shall be
kept by the Receiver, as a voucher for his receipt of
that particular amount ; and the receipt of the Re-
ceiver, specifying the amount pail to him by the
Overseers, shall be a sufficient discharge to the
Overseers for such amount, and shall be allowed as
such in passing their accounts with their respective
parishes, townships, precincts or places.
And be it enacted, that in case the amount order-
ed by such warrant as aforesaid to be levied by the
Overseers in any parish, township, precinct or place
in the metropolitan district, shall not be paid to the
Receiver within the time specified for that purpose
in the warrant, the Justices appointed under this
Act, or any two of them, upon complaint thereof
made to them by the Receiver, may issue their war-
rant for levying the amount, or so much thereof as may
be in arrear, by the distress and sale of the goods of all
or any of the said Overseers ; and in case the goods of
all the overseers shall not be sufficient to pay the same
the arrears thereof should be added to the amount of
the levy which shall be directed to be made in
such parish, township, precinct or place for the
police rate in the half year then next ensuing, and
shall be collected by the like methods; and such
arrears shall be apportioned according to the
same proportions as the original rate, or as near
thereto as circumstances will admit ; and the said
Justices, or any two of them, in case of any default
or neglect, or the apprehension of any default or
neglect, of any Overseer or Overseers, or in any
other case in which one of his Majesty's principal
Secretaries of State shall so direct, may appoint two
or more persons to act as Overseers of the Poor
within any parish, township, precinct or place in the
Metropolitan Police District, for the purpose of
levying the police rate under this Act ; and the pet-
sons so appointed shall proceed in the same manner

and shall. have the same powers, remedies, and
privileges, and 'shall be subject to the same regula-
tions and penalties, with reference to the levying
of such police rahe, as if they had been appointed
Overseers of thehoor by virtue of any law or laws
now in force.
Provided always, and be it enacted, tint if any
person from whom any sum•of money shall be dt.
minded on account of any police rate to be levied
under this Act as aforesaid, shall think himself

aggrieved on the ground that such sum is not accord-
ing to to the pound rate specified in the warrant of
the Justices, or is not according to the valuation of
his property which may for the time being be acted
upon in making the rate for the relief of the poor in
the parish, township, precinct, or place in which his
property may be situated, such person may, within
ten days after such demand, appeal to any two br
the Justices of the Peace appointed to act at any
14 the Police Offices now established in Middlesex
and Surrey, provided that the person so intended to
appeal shall give to the Overseers of the poor of
such parish, township, precinct or place, a notice in
writing of such appeal, and of the ground thereof,
and at which of the said Polite offices the same is to
be beard,five days at least before the hearing thereof;
and any two d the Justices at such office are hereby
authorised and required, within the tcn days bere
inbefore mentioned, or at some adjournment tbereot,
to examine into the matter of the appeal, although
the case may have arisen in a county different from
that in which the said Justices may then be sitting;
and they may for that purpose bear the parties, and
summon and examine upon oath any witnesses, and
give such relief, or make such order in the premises
as to them shall seem just, and their decision there-
on slutli be final and conclusive.

And whereas it is expedient to provide for those

eases in which the valuation of property acted upon
in making the poor-rate, may be inadequate end un-
fair with reference to the police-rote under this Act ;
be it therefore enacted, that if any two of the
Justices to be appointed tinder this Act shall be
dissatisfied with the valuation of property rateable
for the relief of the poor which may be acted upon
for the time bring in any parish, township, precinct,
or place, whether parochial or extra-parochial, in
the Metropolitan police district, the said Justices,
with the approbation of one of his Majesty's princi-
pal Secretaries of State, tliay, by warrant under
their hands, appoint two or more proper per-
sons to be assessors, for the purpose of asses-
sing the fair annual value of such property,• and
rating the same to the police-rate to he levied
under this Act ; and such assessors shall, within
forty days after the delivery to them of the warrant
of their appointment, make, sign, and return to the
said Justices an assessment for the parish, township,
precinct or place named in such warrant, and the
assessment shall be fairly written in a book, and
ahull specify in different columns the names of the
respective inhabitants or occupiers of any property
rateable to the relief of the poor, the fair annual
value of such property, and the amount of police
rate charged in respect of such property on the in-
habitants or occupiers thereof, and when the pre-
mises shall be unoccupied, the fair annual value
thereof to let ; and the said assessors shall be allow-
ed for their trouble and expences such remuneration
as one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State
shall direct. and the same shall be paid out of the '
amount tit the police rate which shall be collected
after such assessment.
And be it enacted, that it shall be lawful for any
-Assessor appointed under this Act, or any other
person having an order under the hands of any two
of the Justices appointed under this Act, to inspect
•any rate made or to be made for the relief of the
poor, and also any assessment for the house tax, in
any such parish, township, precinct or place within
the metropolitan police district as shall be named in
such order, and to take copies or extracts from such
rate and assessment without payment of any fee or
reward, and if any person having the custody of any
such rate or assessment shall wilfully neglect or re-
fuse to permit any such assessor or other person to
inspect the same, or to take copies or extracts
from the same, within two days after such order
shall have been produced and shown to him, or a
copy thereof left. at his usual place of abode, he
shall, on conviction thereof before any two Justices
of the Peace, forfeit and pay for every such offence
such sum, not exceeding ten pounds, as they shall
think meet.,
And be it enacted, that where the value of the
iateable property in any parish, township, precinct
or place in the metropolitan police district shall have
been assessed by any assessors as aforesaid, and such
tasessment shall be allowed by the Justices ap-
pointed under this Act, or any two of them, public
.notice of the assessment so allowed, and of die place
where the same may he inspected, shall Le given in
the Church or Chapel of the parish, township, pre-
ciiict or pine to which such assessment shall relate,
upon the Sunday next, or next but ore, after the
same shall have been so allowed; and the overseers
of the poor, or any other person in whose custody
such assessment may be, shall permit every inha-
bitant or occupier of property included in such as-
sessment to inspect the same, and to make any ex-
tracts therefrom, without-payment of any fee or re-
ward : and if any overseer or other person shall
willfully neglect or refuse to permit any such inha-
bitant or occupier to inspect such assesment, or to
make any extract therefrom, he shall, on conviction
thereof brfore any two Justices of the Peace, forfeit
an.l pay for every such offence, such sum, not ex-
ceedingfive pounds, as the Justices shall think meet.
And be it en,:cted, that every assessment of pro-
perly made by assessors appointed tinder this Act
shah bind and conclude all parties named therein,
hilless the same shall be disputed by the giving a
notice of appeal, and also entering into a recogni-
zance as hereinafter particularly mentioned ; and in
case such assessment 'shall be appealed against as to
certain particulars, it shall nevertheless be binding
and conclusive as to all other particulars; and the
amount of police rate charged in respect of such
parts of the assessment as shall not be appealed
against, may be levied as if no such appeal had been
made, and the Overseers of the Poor shall proceed
to levy
the
amount in the same manner, and shall
have the same powers, remedies, and privileges as
for levying money for the relief of the poor, and
shall pay over such amount to the Receiver to be
appointed under this Act, or in default thereof shall
be proceeded against in the manner hereinbefore
mentioned in that behalf; and the proceedings for
levy;ng the Pblice Rate shall be stayed only with
respect to those parts of the assessment which shall
be disputed, by giving a notice of appeal, arid also
entering into a recognizance, as is hereinafter par-
ticularly mentioned.
And be it enacted, that if any person shall think.
himself aggrieved by any assessment made by asses-
sors appointed under this Act, on the ground that
such assessment includes any property for which he
is not legally rateable, or that it assesses his rateable
property beyond its fair annual value, or that any
person or persons is or are omitted "out of such as-
sessment, or that the property of any person or per-
sons is assessed below its fair annual value, the per-
son so aggrieved may appeal to the next Court of
General or Quarter Sessions which shall be holden
for the county in which the cause of appeal shall
have arisen,' not less twenty-one days after the pub-
lication of such assessment in the Church or Chapel
as hereinbefore mentioned : provided that the person
so intending- to appeal shall give to the Receiver to
he appointed under this Act a notice in writing of
such appeal, and of the cause and matter thereof,
Within seven days after such publication of the as-
sessment, and within ten clear days at the least be-
fore such Sessions, and shall also, within three days
after his notice of appeal, enter into a recognizance
before some Justice of the Peace of the county, with
two sufficient sureties, -conditioned to try. "'such ap-
peal at the said Sessions, and to abide the order of
the Court thereupon, and to pay such costs as shall

shall also give a like notice of appeal to the person
or persons so interested in the event of such ap-
peal as aforesaid, and shall enter into a like-recog-
nizance within the times hereinbefore respectively
mentioned; and the person or persons so interested
shall, if he or they shall desire it, be heard 'upon the
appeal; and the Justices of the recce at such Ses-
sions, or some adjournment thereof, upon due proof
of the notice having been given, and of the recog-
nizances having been entered into as aforesaid, shall
hear and determine the matter of appeal in a sum:.
mary manner) and shall make 'such order theteiM,
with or without cost's to either party, as the said
Justices shall think proper; and in case the said
Justices shall think the appellant entitled to relief,
they shall order the assessment to be amended in
such manner as may he necessary for giving him
relief; and in case he shall have appealed on the
ground that any person or persons is or are omitted
nut of the assessment; the said itnstfees may order
the name or haet of such person or persons to be
inset ied in the assessment, and to be therein rated
at such amount as they shall deem just ; and in case
the appellant shall have appealed on the ground that
the property of any person or persons is assessed
below its fair annual value, the said Justices may
Order the amount at which such person or persons
is or are rated in the assessment, to be altered in
such manner as they shall deem just ; and the pro-
per officer of the Court shall in each of the cases
aforesaid forthwith amend the assessment accord-
ingly, but the assessment shall not be quashed or
altered with respect to any other persons named
therein; and the determination of the Justices at
any such Sessions or adjournment shall be final and
conclusive.

And whereas it is expedient to provide for
those precincts and places in the Metropolitan
Police District in which no rate is made for
the relief of the poor, or in which property
may be deemed not to be rateable thereto; be it
therefore enacted, that the respective inhabitants
and occupiers of all messuages, lands, tenements,
nod hereditaments in any precinct or place, whether
parochial or extra-parochial, in the Metropolitan
Police District, although such messuages, lands, te-
nements, and hereditaments may not be rated to
the relief of the poor, or may be deemed not to
be rateable thereto, shall nevertheless be liable to
contribute to the police rate under this Act as if the
property so inhabited or occupied were rateable and
rated to the relief of the poor; and any two of the
Justices appointed under this Act may by warrant
under their hands, nominate assessors to assess the
fair annual value of all such property, and to rate
the same to the police rate under this Act ; and
such assessor shall have the like powers and privi-
leges, and shall proceed in the like manner as has
been hereinbefore-menticned with reference to as-
sessors; and all provisions hereinbefore contained
with regard to the allowance, notification, and in-
spection of anv assessments made by assessors appoint-
ed under this'Act, and also with regard to the binding
and conclusive effect of such assessments, and the
grounds of appeal against the same, and the notice
and recognizance preparatory to the appeal, and the
proceedings of the Justices relative to the appeal,
shall apply and be enforced with regard to any as-
sessments which shall be made under this Act in
any precincts or places not rated or deemed not to
be rateable to the relief of the poor, as fully and
effectually as if those provisions were here repeated
and expressly re-enacted with regard to assessments
in such precincts and places; and any two of the
Justices appointed under this Act shall nominate
one or more person or persons for levying the
amount of police rate in any such precinct or place,
who shall proceed in the same manner, and shall
have the same powers, remedies, and privileges,
and shall be subject to the same regulations and
penalties, with reference to the levying of such po-
lice rate, as if he or they were an overseer or over-
seers of the poer in a precinct or place rated to the
relief of the poor, and shall pay over the amount
of such police rate to the receiver to be appointed
under this Act, or in default thereof shall be pro-
ceeded against in the same manner as overseers
are by this Act to be proceeded against for non-
payment cf the police rate.
And whereas circumstances may occur which may
render it expedient that the provisions of this Act
should extend to other places within a certain di -
tance of the metropolis, in addition to the places
which are enumerated in the Schedule to this Act;
be it therefore enacted, that it shall be lawful for his
Msjesty from time to time by the advice of his Privy
Council, to order that any parishes, townships, pre-
cincts, and places in the counties of Middlesex,
Surrey, Hertford, Essex, and Kent, of which any
part shall be situate within twelve miles of Charing-
cross, in the city of Westminster, shall, after a cer-
tain day be named in such order, be added to and
form part of the 111et:opolitan Police District, and
be placed under the charge of a Police ft be ap-
pointed under this Act ; and all provisions herein-
before contained with regard to the discontinuance of
the night watch and night police appointed previously
to or independently of this Act, the cessation of their
powers, the cessation of the powers for levying
watch rotes, the giving up cf watch-houses, watch-
boxes, arms, accoutrements, and other necessaries, to-
gether with the penalties for neglect or refusal in
that behalf, and the exception as to any watch-rate
previously made, and also all provisions hereinbefore
contained with regard to tl.e levying of the polices
rate, the amount of such rate, the payment thereof
to the receiver, the remuneration to overseers, the
proceedings against overseers for default, the addi-
tion of arrears to the next levy, the appointment of
persons to act as overseers, the appeal against the
police-rate to the Justices at the police-offices, and
all provisions with regard to the assessment of the
annual value of rateable property, and the rating of
the same to the police-rate by assessors appointed
under this Act, and with regard to the powers and
duties of such assessors, as well as all other matters
whatsoever previous to, concomitant with, or conse-
quent or contingent upon, such assessment, shall
apply and be enforced in every parish, township,
precinct, and place which shall, by order in Council,
be added to the metropolitan police district, as fully
and effectually as if such parish, township, precinct
or place, had been originally included in such district
by virtue of this Act.
And for the more effectual prosecution of offences
punishable upon summary conviction, by virtue of
this Act, be it enacted, that where any person shall
be charged on the oath of a credible witness with
any such offence before any Justice of the Peace,
the Justice may summon the person charged to ap-
pear before any two Justices of the Peace, at a
time and place to be named in such summons; and
if the person charged shall not appear accordingly,
then (upon proof of the due service of the sum-
mons by delivering a copy thereof to such person,
or by delivering a copy to the wife or servant, or
some adult inmate of the family of such person at
his usual place of abode) the Justices before whom
lie ought to have appeared, may either proceed to
hear and determine the case ex-parte, or may issue
their warrant for apprehending such person and
bringiog him before them ; provided always, that
• the prosecution for any offence punishable upon sum-
' mary conviction by virtue of this Act, shall be corn-
, menced within three calendar months after the corn-
, mission of the offence, and not otherwise.

And be it enacted, that every sum which by any
Justices of the Peace shall be adjudged to be paid for
any offence against this Act, shall be paid to the re-
ceiver appointed under this Act, to be by him added
to and applied'as part of the police rate; and no
person, although rated or liable to be rated to the
police rate under this Act, shall by reason thereof, or
by reason of the application of any penalty to the
use of such rate, be deemed to be an incompetent
witness before any Court of Justice or Justices of
the Peace, in any proceeding whatever for any
offence 'agaiust this Act, or in any matter relating to
the police rate, or in any other matter mentioned in
this Act : and no Justice of the Peace shall be dis-
abled from acting in the execution of this Act by

reason of lti-$ being rated or liable to be rated to the
police rate.
And be it enacted, that the Sustices of the Peace

by whom any 'person shall be convicted and ad-
judged to pay any sum Of money for ally offence
against this Act, May adjudge That such person Shall
pay the same either immediately or within such pe-
riod as they shall think fit; and that in default, of

slim shall hot exceed len pounds, and for any term
not exceeding six calendar months in any other.
case, the imprisonment to cease in each of the cases
aforesaid upon payment of the sum due.
And be it enacted, that the Justices before whom
any person shall be summarily convicted of any
offence against this Act tray cause the convittion to
be drawn up in the following form of words, or in
any other form of words to the same effect, as the.
case may require; that is to say--
" Be it remembered, that on the

of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace, for the said
county, for that the said A. B. did (specify the of-
fence, and the time and place when and where the
same was committed, as the case may be) ; and we
the said Justices adjudged the said A. B. for his
said offence to forfeit and pay the sum of

and year first above mentioned."
And be it enacted, that no conviction, order, war-
rant or other matter, made or purporting to be made
by virtue of this Act, shall be quashed for want of
form, or be removed by certiorari or otherwise into
any of his Majesty's Courts of Record at West-
minster; and no warrant of commitment shall be
held void by reason of any defect therein, provided
that it be therein alleged that the party has been
convicted, and there be a good and. valid conviction
to sustain the same; and where any distress shall be
made for levying any money by virtue of this Act,
the distress itself shall not be deemed unlawful, nor
the party making the same be deensed a trespasser
on account of any defect or want of form in the
summons, conviction, warrant of distress, or other
proceedings relating thereto; nor shall the party dis-
training be deemed a trespasser, ab initio, on ac-
count of any irregularity afterwards committed by
him; but the person aggrieved by such irregularity
may recover full satisfaction for the special damage,
if any, in an action upon the case.
And for the protection of persons acting in the
execution of this Act, be it enacted, that all actions
and prosecutions to be commenced against any per-
son for any thing done in pursuance of this Act,
shall be laid and tried in the county where the fact

The Ministerial changes resulting from the
opposition given by certain persons to the Roman Catho-
lic Relief Bill, will be fewer, and of less importance, than
was anticipated even by the parties themselves. The
whole of what is called the LONSDALE party, wko, it will
be remembered, tendered their resignation (which tender
was received, but sot acted upon), will quietly, and with-
out remark, resume their functions. The important de-
partment of the Woods and Forests, and the confidential
office of JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL (the first held by
the son, the second by the son-in-law of the Earl of Loris-
DALE), with some other minor appointments, are to re-
main with the pre:,ent possessors.—Morning Chronicle.

Fashionable gossip revives the report, and
with increased confidence, that the explanation to be given
in the House of Lords immediately after the Easter Re-
cess, of the circumstances which led to the recal of a late
popular Vicznor, will necessarily bring before the public
the domestic affairs of a Noble MauQv's and his MAR
CHIONESS, as it is affirmed, without circumlocution—tbat
the refusal of a place on the Iri-h Pension List to the
Noble Lady in question, was the real dignus Vindice

In some of the anti-Catholic prints an insi-
nuation has been thrown ot.t that Sir WALTER SCOTT'S
conversion to the principles so admirably sustained in the
Edinburgh petition in favour of emancipation, was very
sudden. We contradicted this some time ago from good
authority ; but as no authority is so good as the distin-
guished writer's own words, we beg leave to quote the
.following passage from his Life of Cumberland, vol. iii.,
p. 221, of his Miscellaneous Prose Works, written, as
appears by the advertisement, antecedent to 1825. Speak-
ing of the character of Major O'Flaherty, he says—" It
could only have been drawn by one who, like Cumnan-
Lawn, had enjoyed repeated opportunities of forming a true
estimate of the Irish Gentleman ; and the Austrian cockade
in his hat might serve to remind 'the British Administra-
tion that they had sacrificed the services of this noble and
martial race to unjust restrictions and' political prejudices•"

" Most Excellent Sir,—lt is expedient that the
war hi ‘thich our respective Republics hare un-
happily engaged should be brought to a speedy con-
clusion : the welfare and happiness of both countries
require it, and the Government of Colombia most
earnestly desires ir, in order that all animosity be-
tween two sister nations, friends and allies, may en-

tirely disappear, and that concord and good under-
standing may be re-established. For this purpose,
inasmuch as it is impossible to come to any under-
standing during hostilities, I have commissioned
Colonel D. F. O'Leary to arrange and definitively
conclude an armistice, which will be the beginning
of the reconciliation and the preliminary of peace.

I trust that the good qualities which adorn Culonel
O'Leary, and which are not unknown to your Ex-

him the esteem and goodwill of yeur Excellency ;

" Sir,—The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Peru
has the honour to reply to the note of the Commis-
sioner of General Bolivar, dated Quito, August 31,
and accompanied by a copy 'of his credentials, for
the purpose of arranging an armistice which is to he
the preliminary of peace. The GovernMent of
Peru loves peace as sincerely as it abhOrs the war
in which the nation it presides unfortunately finds
itself engaged, and therefore cannot but admit the
mission of Colonel O'Leary. His Excellency the
Vice-President of Peru, desirous of accelerating the
good effects of the mission, and of preventing any
obstacles from occurring after its commencement,
wishes to know, previously to sending the safe con-
duct. and passports to the CoMmiiiioner, what are
the principal bases upon which the negociatiOn is to
be commenced; which data, 'although not always
'requisite, yet must be alloWed to be in the present
case, in consequence of the peCuliar circumstances
of this unfortunate misunderstanding:
" The underwritten cordially returns the senti-
ments of esteem with which Colonel O'Leary sub-
scribes himself his attentive servant,

" MANUEL DEL RIO,
" Minister of Foreign Affair!."

" REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA,

" COMMISSLON OF THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA TO
THE GOVERNMENT OF PERU..

" TO THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF PERU.

" Sir,—The Commissioner of his Excellency the
Liberator, President of Colombia, has had the ho-
nour of receiving the note of the Minister of Fo-
reign Affairs of Peru, dated the 30th of September
last, in which, after signifying the love of peace and
abhorrence of war which animate his Government,
and its desire of accelerating the good effects'of the
mission with which the underwritten is intrusted,
wishes previously to know what are the bases upon
which the negotiation is to be entered into.
" The undersigned observes with sorrow a mani-
fest contradiction between the desire of peace which
the said note expresses, and the means of obtaining.
it proposed by Mr. Rio. The great distance be-
tween Lima and this city makes the communication
difficult. Nearly two months. have elapsed from the
time the underwritten solicited a safe conduct, to
the day on which' he received the reply. Two more
will elapse in fresh replies, and perhaps during that
interval blood will be shed which ought to be spared;
but the Government of Peru, in whose power it is
to avoid these evils, is alone responsible for the
result.

" The undersigned, participating in the sincere
desires of peace which guide this Government,
hastens to remove the new difficulties created by
the Government of Peru, in exacting a condition
which Mr. Rio confesses is not always necessary,
and which is, in fact, very unusual. His Excel-
lency the Liberator President has not imposed upon
the undersigned any restrictions, nor has he confined
him by any basis as conditions sine qua non. His
wishes for peace are as cordial as the powers are
ample which he has granted to his commissioner.
" To re-establish a good understanding between
Peru and Colombia, the President of the latter Re-
public only requires what is just. Strict justice will,
then be the basis upon which the negotiation for
peace is to be commenced.
• " The 'undersigned, notwithstanding the note to
which he is now replying, and the exalted discourses
which the Editors of Peru attribute to their Chief
Magistrates make him fear that the happy epoch of a
sincere reconciliation is yet distant, still repeats his
request that the Gocernmerst of Peru will send him
the necessary safe conduct for himself and his suite
to proceed to Callao in a ship of -war of their na-
tion, or that it will send to this city a Commissioner
fully authorised to arrange and definitively conclude
an armistice. For this purpose, and to accelerate
the neetiations, •the undersigned has the honour to
transmit to Mr. Rio a blank safe conduct ; but if the
Government of Peru refuse to accept these frank
proposal, the undersigned most solemnly protests
that that Government is and shall be responsible for
all the evils that may occur in case the differences
between Colombia and Pent are left to the decision
of the sword.

" The undersigned takes the liberty of pointing
out to the Minister of Foreign Affairs an irregula-
rity which he has committed, in addressing the note
to which the undrrwritten is now replying, to the
Commissioner of his Excellency General Bolivar.
Always disposed to excuse faults which may have
been involuntary committed, the undersigned is not
inclined to consider in the light of a fresh insult to
the Colombian nation the motives of this complaint,
and he therefore rather attributes it to a doubt as to
the title his Excellency the President Liberator
might have received since the people confided to
him the unlimited command of the Republic.
" The annexed decree will inform the Minister of
Foreign Affairs that his Excellency has preserved

the deikninll.liers- which the law and the voice of
tie ijeeN%bave cianfei'red lip; and the un-
dersigned is under the necessity ecdichiring that he
will not, in future, receive any communication in
whiCh they, are not set forth whenever allusion is
made to the Chief of Colombia.

" The undersigned, in concluding tliis note, feels
a real satisfaction in repeating to Mr. Rio the senti-
ments of the most distinguished esteem and consi-
deration with which he has the honour to be his
very attentive servant,
" DANIEL F. O'LEARY." .

" Soldiers ! I come to place myself at your head,
to share the dangers and the glory of the campaign
to which you are provoked. The sworn enemy of
Peruvian independence ; the violator of our na-
tional rights—he who cannot hear you called vir-
tuous without being furious with anger,—the only
man who proclaims despotism in the continent of
America—General Bolivar has dared to 'declare war
against us; his presence on the frontiers being to
serve as a signal for the combat. You will conquer
the arrogant slaves who accompany him in so fra-
tricidal an enterprise; you will revenge the out-
rages offered to your honour, the insults heaped
upon the Republic, and will build the prosperity of
two friendly and sister nations.
" Soldiers 1 Such are your sublime destinies—in
you the country places these precious hopes; show
yoUrselves worthy of so great a trust; comply with
the wishes of your fellow-citizens, which are the
expression of the law and the measure of your duty.
" Soldier; ! Valour distinguishes freemen from
the wretches who drag on their existence in slavery.
But the strength of the Republican phalanx con-
sists in discipline, morality, and concord. These
are the guarantee of victory, and the terror of our
enemies; without discipline there is no order—
without order there is no morality, and without
morality there is none of that unity of sentiment
which ought to make you present yourselves ge-
nerously resolved to conquer or to perish for the
happiness of your country, and for the preservation
of your integrity and independence. Companions !
war to those who seek their own aggrandizement
in our humiliation ! Peace and friendship to the
Colombian nation, which is our friend, sister,
and ally.

" REPUBLIC OF PERU.
" LEGATION NEAR THE GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA,

BIJONAVENTURA, AUGUST 14, 1828.

" TO THE HON. MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF THE

REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA.

" Sir,—The undersigned has seen with the
deepest sorrow the proclamation of his Excellency
the President of Colombia, in which he declares war
against Peru. Every man of sense had foreseen this
development : the desires of his Excellency the
Liberator were very well known, and had not
escaped the penetration of the Government of Peru.
Therefore the underwritten, by express instructions
he has received for this event, finds himself under
the necessity of declaring, that his Government was
persuaded that nothing could be gained by friendly
and conciliatory measures, and that its only motive
for sending an envoy was to hasten this fatal dis-
covery, and show to the world "that it omitted no
means to preserve peace, and prevent the scandal of
two nations, governed upon the same principles,
and with similar institutions, and which have only
just thrown off the heavy yOke which for three cen-
turies oppressed them, soaking the soil of America
with tile blood of her sons.
" The underwritten is at the same time commanded
to declare, that the Government of Colombia will
be held responsible for all the expenses, all the evils
that may be caused to that of Peru, by the necessity
i►► which it is placed of repelling an unjust aggres-
sion to preserve its rights uninjured, and the security
of its territory inviolable.
" The undersigned has the honour to repeat to
the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of
Colombia, the sentiments of his most distinguished
regard.
" JOSE VILLA, Minister Plenipotentiary of Peru."

(From the Gaceta de Colombia of Jan. 11.)

" PERU.
" PROCLAMATION.

c' JOSE DE LA ALVA AGUERO, PRESIDENT OF THE PERU-
VIAN REPUBLIC, &C.

" Peruvians—The treason of General la Fuente
opened the gates of our country to the dictatorship
of the Liberator of Colombia. The army, in which
our hopes were fixed, enrolled itself in the ranks of
the stranger. Peru fell. My, enemies gained a
transient triumph by representing me as a traitor;
but they soon blotted this stain from my name with
their own infamy. Torre Tagle, Berindoaga, Gal-
diano, . and innumerable • others, changed the tri-
coloured cockade for the bloody cockade, and Peru
would still have been Spain's if the genius of 801 -
Var had not opposed itself to it.
Peruvians—Those men who then endeavoured to
sell the country to the common enemy, are the very
same who have now engaged you in an iniquitous
struggle with a warlike nation. The war you are
lining against Colombia is impolitic, and will cover
you with ignominy. The personal complaints of Gen.
Lamar are not just causes for war. He blinds you: do
not confide in his hypocritical discourses. Sheath
your parricidal swords. Peruvians,. from Europe I
have heard your cries : Ihave flown to save you. The
Government which oppresses you is an usurper,
because it does not emanate from the people—it is
a tyrant, because it is opposed to their will. Do
not obey it. Your legitimate President will soon
be with you. The same who six years ago opposed
and triumphed over the attacks of that crowd of
wretches sold to Spain, tears himself from his re-
pose, resolved to give your country peace and proper
government.

A Meeting of the Friends of Civil and Re-
ligious Liberty in Kerry will take place in a few days in
Tralee, for the purpose of promoting, the collection of sub-
scriptions throughout this county for the great Liberator
of Ireland. Dublin has set an example worthy the imi-
tation of all Ireland ; Cork has taken its station next to
the Metropolis ; and Kerry, we are satisfied, will come
forward with that promptitude and fidelity which have
ever characterised it.— Tralee Mercury.

FREE TRADE TO THE EAST.—A public
meeting of the bankers, merchants, traders, &e. of the
city of Bristol, was held on Tuesday last, for the purpose
of petitioning Parliament against the renewal of the
East India Company's charter. JonN CAVE, Esq. was
'called to the chair, and several able speeches were made
with a view to prove that the abolition of the monopoly
wotdd produce material benefit to commerce. The sub-
stance of one of the resolutions agreed to was, that the
partial opening of the trade (though clogged with vexa-
tious restrictions) has already raised the amount of our
exports from 1 millions to nearly 4 millions annually,
while our imports have increased in a corresponding ratio.
It was resolved that a petition to the House of Commons
should be forth With prepared and signed, praying that the
House would direct its attention to the serious disad-
vantages which the British public, and the commercial in-
terests
in particular, have been subjected to by the exclu-
sive privileges of the East India Company.
SUBTERRANEAN HORTICULTUEE.--A re-
markable instance of tenacious and profligate, vegation in a
potato occurred lately at the village of Redding. The Gig
Pit there, the property of his Grace the Duke of HAMIL-
TON, is 35 fathoms in depth. In the latter end of last
August, one of the boys whp work in it had takeu.below a
quantity of the produce of a neighbotiting field. These he
carried into one of the levels, nearly two hundred fathoms
from the bottom of the shaft : here, by chance, two pota-
toes fell amongst a small quantity of the t'latey clay, called
blaze, and'iti a short time their blanched shoots were no-
ticed about two inches: above the surface. Two weeks
after their being thus planted,. and on the pay-Saturday,
they were dug up, when upwards of a dozen full-sized
potatoes were found. A like quantity was thus every week
for two months the regale of the workmen, who took care
to 'replant- the two original parent potatoes every tin.e
they had eased them of their produce.—Scotsman.

RIPE STRAWBERRIES.—There was, on Tuesna,s
exhibited in the window of Mr. Greenslade, at the Grlo
Carrefour, a beautiful plate of ripe strawberries, gathere
the morning in the garden of Mr. Carey, of Rozel,
pects to continue gathering till nearly the end of this trlo%
This fruit was grown in the open ground, without os'4l.
received any extraordinary care or protection. This es
`too
ordinary production must, of course, be attributed iertiot
measure to the nature of the plant ; but we apprehend of
it is owing in a great degree to the genial character of
climate.—Guernsey Record.

antiquarian lore, for architectural and picturesque "

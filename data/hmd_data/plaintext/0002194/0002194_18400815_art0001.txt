l"telcious remedy, and one which does not produce the

From Bransby Cooper, Esq., F.R.S., one of the Council of
the Royal College of Surgeons, London ; Surgeon to Guy's
Hospital, and Lecturer on Anatomy, &c.
" Mr. Bransby Cooer presents his compliments to Mr. Geo.
IVranks, and has greatp pleasure in bearing testimony to the effi-
'eany of his Solution of Copaiba in Gonorrhcea, for which dis-
ea4e Mr. Cooper has prescribed the Solution it ten or twelve
eases with perfect success.
" New-street, April 13, 1835."
From Alexander Tweedie, Esq., Surgeon to the Metropolitan
hree Hospital, Carey-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields.
"My Dear Sir,—l hay,: notes of six cases, in which I have
ad% inistered your preparation of Copaiba, for the cure of Go-
/torn, asa, in all of which the disease has been subdued in a shorter
Period of time than according to the ordinary plans hitherto
made ns e of. Besides those cases of which 1 have taken notes,
I have tri;ed it in seve:al instances at the Greville- treet Hos-
pital, and a.'n quite satisfied that it possesses a control over the
'urgent symptoms of Gonorrhoea, relieving the discharge and
mitigating the scalding in making water, that I have not ob-
served in tite ustwl methods of exhibiting Copaiba. In one in-
stance only did it disagree with the stomach ; but in this it
seemed to depend rather on the method of exhibition than on
the remedy itself, for on diluting it with a larger quantity of
water, the objection was at once obviated, and the patient got
well in ten days from the time that he commenced taking the
Medicine. I have not had a case in which the discharge con-
tinued longer than ten days after commencing this treatment.
" I am, dear Sir, your's very truly,
(Signed) " ALEXANDER TWEEDIE."

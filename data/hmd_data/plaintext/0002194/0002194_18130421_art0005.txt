PARIS, APRIL 13.---Prince Schwartzenberg had

Empe:•or, and delivering him a letter from his

BaLtzu, APRIL:..;.--Our town is filled with
troops. During the last three days, five brilliant
battalions have arrived from different directions.

Aritll. 15.—His Majesty the Emperor
set off from St. Cloud at one o'clock in the morn!.
Ing; lie is going to take the command of the
ertiLies. To the itninenee adminietrative labours
.whieb bate uninterruptedly occupied his Majesty's
thoughts, since the epoch of his arrival until that
of his departure,- are going to succeed warlike
•tvorks, and those grand military combinations
which COUIIII3IId victory, atul decide. the fate of
'Empires. That indefatigable activity which only
reposes by changing objects ; that force of mind
ul‘vitys the same under every- circumstance, in
council equally as in field of battle ; that noble
audacity which eo reverse can shake, and which
commands events, leaves uo doubt as to the issue
of this new campaign.
Emboldened by the unforeseen calamity which
strata the French army at the commencement of
`lust winter ; encouraged by the defection of the
?Tessier' Guveroment, keg aceustornea to jest
,with the tuost solemn treaties—to change with
fortuue—our enemies have spread through a part
,of Germany, less with the hope of making solid
iind glorious conquests there, than to sow, in the
midst of, those people, the seeds of discord and
anarchy. . •
C.f all the strong places occupied by the French,
none, except' ?Ulan, have fallen before them.
Tiles upon the Vistula, es upon the Etbe and the
(,)/ters they have no point of support; and
.the
further they advance, with the more difficulty and
:danger will their retreat be accompanied.
All-the intelligence we receive from Germany,
•lepresents the.situation of the French armire in•
,This
a manner as to inspire its with confillenec.
,This hews cannot surprise us—we, who two
months ago sent forth from the. walls of Paris
.setlicienetroopS to form a formidable army, whe-
ther considered in respect to discipline or skilful-
.ness in manoeuvres. We know that the-divisions
arrived from Italy are fell of order, and composed
ief sc.ldiers..tried in several campaigns. • Artillery,
wttlutmitioo, provision,. of every sort, abound in
ihst. French 'senile* I and when they shall find
therneelves eleetrified by the presence of their So-
ya:reign, .there is nothing .ivhich they cannot
undertake, nothing which they cannot execute.
In the interior, abundance, tranquility, an en-
tire sainission from the citizens to the laws,
which can alone guarantee their persons and pro.
pertics ; with armies filled with honour amid cou-
'eat;e, commanded by the first Captain of the age,
•fed by neiv and amineious battalions, daily organ-
ised under our eyes ; how knurly reasons for hope,.
bow many for security ! ' It' our enemies have not
been able to' accomplish their projects, when a
tieeouring climate rendered courage and skill un-.
necessry, can they how expect fresh success,
when the'seasonis about to. allow our brave men
to display their forces, and resume their accirstom-
ed periorify.? We do not. seek by vain conjec-
tlirefi anticipate events; but every timing leads
us tei.pl'e,i4urle that their hopes will he deceived,
their .pride confounded.

Dzi,Aß:rcals or IWONAPARTE FROM rots.

ByON4PAHTE, who soiecently ran away from
one army, has set out,t6 take tie command of an-
other. His reputation and'his power at stake, he
finds it absolutely neeeslary to take the field hefine
his preparations .eariby possi:Llllity be completed,
in order to stattr. the tideoffublic opinion in Ger-
many, under the influenCe of whit)* the whole
Germanic people would soon be in • arms. lie
took his'departure from Paris on Thursday last at
011i:o'clock in the morning, and the next day
.passed through Metz, on his wly to Mayence.

, To collect his forces, and attempt to strike an
immediate blow, which may have the et et of
again raising his military reputation, and repress-
ing the patriotic spirit of the German people, will
probably be his first phjects. lie must either play
a desperate game, and run all hazards,in aiming
at something decisive, or his militaryeeputation
and his power' sink to rise no more. The mo-
ment is an anxious one, but every fair ground of
hope is on the side of the allias He brings into
the field raw troops, not yet even half formed,
soldiers, without; any confidence in, themselves,
whilst his few remaining veterans have lost all
confidence in' him. The troops of the allies,. on ,
the contrary, come into the field veteran and well
disciplined, with all the confidence of victory, each
man feeling the justice of the cause in which he is
fighting, and the Prussian and:German soldiers
feeling, as they must; that to them .defeat will be.
worse than death, plunging them in its effects into
hopeless slavery. .
The tyrant leads on his slaves against legions
united in the common bond of resistance to oppres-
sion.
.Let us hope the cause of justice may at
length triumph, and the Standard of virtue wave
triumphant. For once he is unable to clime his
own time or his own ground ; be is traced into
the field, to avoid a greater.shock to his power,
before his preparations are complete, and he is
compelled to take up the ground -left him by
his adversary. He. thus fights under every dis-
•advantage. Nothing can retrieve his fortunes but
some decisive blow struck without delay. That
failing him, he may return to Parr, but his power
and. induenac in 'Europe exist no longer. That
sentence which' be has fulminated against MO..
MitChe may then be pionoupced upon himself, and
all Europe will re-echo the micosue sound, that
BUONAPARTehas ceased to reign. ,
The Paris Papers contain two statements of the
situatlon'of the armies in the North, on the fi.tb.
and the 10th of April. The defeat and death 'of
Aloaatin, at Lunebourg, 'are acknowledged, but
hic force is diminished to 1000 omen,. 800 of whom
urc stated to he Saxons. DAvousT is asserted to
leVe afterwards occupied Lunebourg, but to have
subsequently made a move (a retreat) towards
debourg. The action with Geetutee is also men.
tioned, but in tenua that leave little doubt of his
having been defeated.
Many boasts arc made of the state of the French
• armies, in the Journal de Pettis, but most them
obvioualy untrue. The greatest sti estis laid upon
the French garrisons in the rear of the Russians
still holding out. This, in the event of any
great disaster happening to the Itussien arms
.might be productive of unpleasant consequences ;
but we cannot see the probability of .those
events happenieg, which could alone, under this
_Situation of
.liffairs, be of any advantage to the
'French. The Ressian ,Oener?ds have proved
themselves fully equal to the task. of ebping with
the leader of the French armies and his Mllrshals,
• '
whom they have aleady defeated, and the utmost
r'eliatice may be placed, upon their skillau4eience,
:lined by the bravery.and discie!ine of their troops,
by the.desperation of the Prussians), (for let it be
recollected, that il-BUQNAPAATH has a desperate
game to play, the Prussians must he equally des-
petate), by the exasperated; population of the
North of Germany, and by 0 powerful ‘vediitt
force, headed by an able General, Such:are the
odds with which tinktyrant of Trance has.now to
contend, unaided bit. his former coadjtitors, &stud
and deception, for neither will at this mordent
Aver his purpoie. .

We may thus confidently hope,' that.bislyranny
is at length waning to its eNtinetion,. d that the
day star of deliverance will sheds permanent lustre
over Europe.

The report we mentioned yesterday, from the
American raper 4 of. the capture of the Castor,
there is uo &Alb; is
.untrue, the •CastOr being sta.
dotted in the Mediterranean. •

Last night's Gazette contains.• the dispatches
from' Sir JOIIN ALLTIIRAY, at Alicont, the substance

01 ...hich Nye give on Monday ; the pill c
diipatch from the First Lieutenant of the Java,
relative to the capture of that frigate.

Nine waggons, loaded with gold dust, bats, ajna
silver bullion, worth upwards of ball a ihillion,.
Strived this forenoon at the Hank from Ports-
mouth. This va!uable cargo was brought by the_
President frigate from the Cape of Good Hope,
to which it had been conveyed at different times
from the East India Company's possessions in
India.

The Morning Chronicle has this day thought
proper to notice what we said of its splenetic ef-
fusions yesterday ; but in so brief a manner that
we have little to say in answer. It Wisely avoids
all the topics upon which it had so rashly com-
mitted itself, , and confines )tself, so far as the Sins
is cmiderned, merely to the subject of Guada-
loupe, which Island it yesterday said we laid offer-
ed to Sweden, though, to use its own words, " it
is not yet our own," We maintained that it was
our own by the right of conquest, and the
Chronicle has not presumed to contradict us,
but ,shrinks from the assertion. Here then we
shall let this matter rest. lint we beg leave
to draw the attention of the public, in general,
to what appeared in that Paper on Monday. Ad-
verting to the Society which has been recently
formed for the purpose of promoting Christ;anity
. among the Jews, the Chronicle had the following
passage, referring to the ceremony of laying the
foundation, for the erection of an Episcopal
Chapel for this object
" This, we venture to think; is beginning at the
wrong end. Before the Jews are. offered the re-
ligion of the land, they should be allowed the fair
privileges of the ConstitutiOn ; and all the unjust
and disgraceful political restrictions should be re-
moved. They might then give the Christians =edit
for good intentions."

The pithlie need pot' be reminded of the stre-
nnotts and repeated cthni which the. Morning
Chronicle has made to remove all restrictions upon
the Papists, and by the above extract, we find
that Jt thinks the Jews also ought to be admitted
to every privilege pOssessed by the Members of
the Established Church. , What then has become
of the boasted attachment of the Morning Chronicle
to the good old Constitution of this country, or
what would become of that Constitution if Papists,
Jews, and the followers of everyother religion were
to be admitted without restraint, and without giving
any pledge, to all its privileges ? Mahontetans,tmi
qven.slatt-t.teArot*ca to. JakepTaatet Its e4tr- '
crable rites, would, according to the opinions
the Morning Chronicle, have a full claim to a seat
in Parliament, or to any privilege at present wisely
,confined to the Members of our Establishment in
Church and State. This doctrine of the Morning
Chronicle may be a goad specimen of modern libe-
rality, but we hope and trust that our Rider's will
prove themselves such bigots to the principles of
our ancestors as to guard' the Constitution which
their wisdom and vulotir bequeathed to us, from
Papists and Jews, as well as flout every other de-
scription of people who . will not enter into those
securities
.which its preservation essentially and
absolutely, demands.

were considerably crippled in their masts and rig-

cargoes, itr order tbat they might refit. More

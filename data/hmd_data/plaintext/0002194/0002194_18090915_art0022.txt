'All these great maritime operations gave to the
place A:chi:tear:l'er of importance and activity,' far be

scarcely.koown to Europeans, 'even by name, and
the'intereSt tie took in theist:elle, was only equalled

The population of' the 'Colony, was to us a new
subjed'of astonishment-and contemplation. Perhaps'
there never was a more worthy object of study, pre-
staitedlo-the philosopher;—ne=ver was the influence
of social institutions proved in :a-manner morestrik-
ts and honoutrable to the distant couutfy in question.
Here we frinnd nnited,-: like one family; those ban-
' ditti, who had sulong been the terror of their mother
country : repelled from European society, and sent off
to the extremity of the globe; placed from the very
hit& of their exile, in a state between the certainty
of chastisement, and the hope of -a better fate ; in-
cessantly subjeCted to an • inspection, asinflexibleas
it is active, they lm' been compelled -to abandon
their anti-stcial manners ; and the majority of them,
having expiated their crimes, by al hard. period of
slavery,• they, have been restored to the:rank which
they held among their Obliged to inte-
rest themselves in the
justice, tor the purpose of preserving
Which they have acqtaired ; while they behold them-
Selves 'in the situation of husbands and lathers, they
have the most interesting and powerful motives for
becoming good members-of the community in which
they exist. . .
The same revolution,--effeaed by the same means,
has taken- place amongst 'the women-; and: those
who were wretched .prostitutes, have imperceptibly
been brought to a regular, Mode of life; and now
form intelligent and laborious motherS of familieS.
—But it is not merely in -the.moral eliaratter- of the
women, that theSe important alteiationS -are dis-
coVerable, but also their physical Cdridition, the
results of which are' worthy the consideration, both

Of the legislator and the philosopher. For example,
every 'body knows that the ,cominot-rwomen of great
capitals are in general unfruitful ; at PeterSbUrgh
'and Madrid, at- Paris and' London; pregnancy is a
sort of phenomenon .amongst persons of that de-
scription ; though we are unable to assign any other
cause than a sort'ofinsnsceptibility of conception : the

,these, problems are, resolved,. by
; what taJtes, the. singular establishment that
we are- describing... After residing a year or two at
, Port , Jackson, most of. the. Eughsb prosntutes be-
come 'remarkably fruitful ; and wilat,, in my ,op-inion,

While we were refleeting on these numerous and.
Interesting subieCts, 'all the-officers and principal ci-
tizens of the colony were wire ittiu in their
dulties. tow:v.ls us. Oar numerous sick were receir.

-ed.Oie mode of treat,nent aith the greafest. tender
ness; and whatever we were in need 0f that tile
Pace' could furnish, was put at our disposal. The
Governor-General gave us an'unliinitcd credit on
the public treasury, and our Commodore was fur-
nished willsl,4al printed checks, to till up with an 7
stint that he Might Wish • for ; and these checksi-
Wit hoot any whet security than the signatuie'of the.
French Commandant, were accepted by theinha--
bitants, with-a confidence highly honourable to did
Government of .our country. Okir tact Provisions,
spirits, and -biscuits were' exhausted, but by means'
of
.these checks we obtained fresh supplies ; and se'
veral times the magfizines of the colony were opened
to supply us with articles which our agents could not:
procure.--thus,. by this generous relief, we were
enabled to re-clothe our crews, who were in want ot,
every thing, repair our ships, purchase one, instead

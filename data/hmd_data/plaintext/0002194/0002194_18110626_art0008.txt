(From The Baltiolore Federal R. publican.)

NEW-YORK, MAY never have palliated
the cruelty and injustice of impressitig -Americans.
We ttust.our feelings are :as much alive to the ho-
neut. of our country, -and ttis4 susceptible of genuine
: sympathy with the- sufferers as the beat of our poli•
tical opponents; and %te will not scruple boldly to
claim a more earnest concern than Mr. Madison and
his counsellors ever felt for the happiness and safety
of our seafaring fellow citizens.. We never wished.
to see-Ahern beggared and driven. into foreigit ser-
. • vice, by the'imposition of embargoes and other re-
stratots- upon their calling. We reprobate their
• being kidnapped into gun- bdats. We. have loudly,
and without' ceasing,- condemned the apathy with
which they are left by the Execu!ive so pine in
French dunge:,ns. 'We believe mot of those wlto
are pressed into the British navy owe their fate, or
at least the pro'taetion .if.their detentionfas well to
• a calculating neglett of the- hest and most obvious:.
means of releaiing .them, as to the little degree of
'effect, which must necessarily attend the measures
of a teeble, blustering, versatile, and •insincere Ad,
ministration, such as unfortunately lords it over us•
at present. But' we also know, from daily pe:--
rusal of the 'public papers from all !he sea•ports,
that there never was a period when the evil was so
-diMinished, and had we 'men at the head of
.our
affairs who knew hoW to command respect. by their
juStice,-- and by- a royderate but firm attitude. to-
wards_ Great Britain', the impressment of an Ame-
rican seaman, by that nation, would be as rare as
the escape of their brethren from the prisons of
France, . •

: Ii is useless to multiply the instances in which
they are treated by the French, worse than the. Al-
gerines:ireat the captives whom they reduce- to
slavery. Federalists take nO plAillfe, in state...a-
tag the public mind by recitals of unavenged dis-
grace winch the Executive calmly pockets.—Hence
the tragedy 1 stely aided in France with three sea-
men, wlio condemned and shot merely for
hying pre,ent, though without taking a part; in ,
the re-capture of their vessel by their mess-mates,
has beet, sutfered to pass with scarcely any extraor-
dinary notice. But the Deihocrats, who. have not
thought prober even .to record it in their Papers,
what would they out have said, and licit,. had only
one of the three been tried by a British Court-. Ma-
rtial, under ppimilai circurnstabces, condemned and
soot ?'. All "Washiligt.)n would have been in &bustle
for the space of a twelvemonth at least-! The
tunny Societies, from one exriernity of the Conti-
nent to the other, would have lilted up their hatchets,

in Philadelphia, dated the 22d:
• " There was dgreat noise here yesterday, occa-
sioned by tne assertion in the Baltimore Federal Re-
publican, respecting the frigate President—but we
uw know, by a letter- from the Secretary, of the
i\lavy, that Commodore RQOERS, of the President,
nad.nrders only to .go in search of the 13ritIsh fri-
gate, and 'demand the Man impre.istai, but not to,
tise.force. We, understanci tliat Capt. GRAMM, of

the cat so, roughly, that she wits soon compelled to,

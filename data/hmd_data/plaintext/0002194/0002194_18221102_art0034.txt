`torture tried upon the Spaniards, whose revolu-
tion has been such as to provoke no hostility,
and excite no fear, but among the besotted ama-
teurs of slavery and superstition. It would be,
in most cases, ungenerous to remind this
party (chiefly composed of emigrants) of the
obligations which' they are under to the British
Government, which gave them an asylum, a
home, for years, and ultimately, by a prodigal
expenditure of English wealth, and, what is still
more precious, of English blood, restored them to
their native hearths ;â€”but it may be mentioned at
a moment when they vent their ungrateful spleen
upon the British Government, because it will not,
to please their bigotted and fanatical humour, con-
sent to burst the ties of peace in Europe, and ap-
prove the irruption of northern hordes upon the
Spaniards, for the great and beneficent purpose
of placing the Inquisition once more upon the
Spanish Throne, and the foot of despotism upon
the necks of the people.

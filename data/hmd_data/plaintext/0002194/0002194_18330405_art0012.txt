Sir HENRY WILLOUGHBY presented a petition
from the beer sellers of Newcastle-under-Lrne, praying
to be put upon equ dity with the publicans. Also a peti-
tion from the Methodists of the new connexion, at New-
castle, complaining of the grievances to which
Dissenters were subject, in being obliged to sub-
mit to a marriage service of which they did not
approve, of having to pay pot r rates for their places
of worship, and of the defective state of the system
of registration of births and marriages, &c. The peti-
tioners prayed the House to remove those grievances. He
bad great pleasure in seconding the prayer of the petition,
and hoped that the Hon. and Learned Gentleman opposite
still held the opinions upon this subject that he once had.
The SOLICITOR-GENERAL said that being appealed
to he was ready to say that he thought it most unjust that
Dissenters should be compelled to contribute to the erection
of churches they did not frequent, whilst they maintained
their own placets-of worship. He concurred in thinking
also that their system of registration ought to be
amended, and hoped the Committee now sitting on
th tt subject would be attended with good results. As a
friend of the established church, lie could not but desire
to see the Dissenters relieved of these and the other
grievances which they so justly complained of.
Mr. R. TODD presented a similar petition from cer-
tain Unitarians.
Mr. BAILLIE presented a petition from Bristol, in
favour of the emaneip ition of the Jews.
Mr. DAVENPORT presented petitions from different
parishes in Staffordshire, for the better observance of the
Sabbath, and against beer shops. Also a petition from
Burslem against slavery. The Hon. Member also gave
notice of a motion for a Bill to repeal a certain portion of
the assesse4 taxes, but in so low a tone of voice, as nut to
be distinctly audible in the gallery.
The SOLICITOR GENERAL presented a petition
from Banff in favour of the proper observance of the
Sabbath, but against the Sabbath Observance Bill brought
;(1 by Sir. Andrew Agnew. The Honourable and
Learned Gentleman stated that' he most heartily
concui red in the sentiments expressed in the petition,
and beggeJ to enter his protest against the Bill intro-
duced into the House, and which now stood for a second
reading.—(Hear.) He did not consider that Bill as a
measure for the better observance of the Sabbath, but a
Bill for putting an mid to all innocent recreation.—(Hear.)
He would also take that opportunity of casting off the
reproach that had been made against his country—( Hear)—
that the Bill bad originated there; it had done no such
thing.—(Cheers.) He looked upon the Bill which bad
been introduced with absolute abhorrence, considering it
totally inconsistent with the true spirit of Christianity,
and be trusted that it would never I.e permitted to be read
a second time in that House.—(Hear, hear.)
Mr. SINCLAIR made a few observations, which were
inaudible in the gallery.
Mr. O'CONNELL hoped that so atrocious a Bill would
never go so far as a Committee ; it was subversive of all
religious feeling, and be trusted the House would get rid
of it as soon as possible, and adopt a far hiss objectionable •
it:leisure in its place.
Lord ASHLEY deprecated the use of the word atro-
cious, which had been applied by the Hon. and Learned
Member for Dublin to the Bill introduced by the Hon.
Baronet, who was not then present. He admitted that
the Bill went too far, and he was in hopes that a
leas objectionable measure would be introduced, but
be felt certain tbat the Noble Baronet who had introduced
the 8,11 had been actuated by the bent of motives.
Mr. O'CONNELL believed that the Hon. Baronet, •in
introducing his Bill, had been actuated by the bent of
motives, but he was equally convinced, if it was carried
into a law it would be productive of the worst effect.
The SOLICITOR.GENERAL was sure that the most
pure and upright motives had actuated the Hon. Baronet
in introducing the Bill, but at the same time that he
gave him credit for his motives, be could not but
think that be had committed a great mistake. All
that the law could do, was to take care that
there was no outward violation of the Sabbath, but that

estate tax ; from Ilminster, for the better observance of

Union of Yeovil, for the repeal of taxes on knowledge.

ZOHRAB THE HOSTAGE.—A third edition
of this o ork, by the author of " Hajji Baba," revised and
corrected by the author, with illustrative notes now first
added, will be published by Mr. BENTLEY, New Bur-
lington.street (successor to HENRY COLBURN), on Satur-
day next. " The best novel that has appeared for several
years past."— Quarterly Review. Agents for Scotland,
Alessi!. BELL and BRADFUTE, Edinburgh ; for Ireland,
Mr. JOHN CUMMING, Dublin. Orders, which should be
given immediately to prevent disappointment, received by
all booksellers throughout the United Kingdom.
" The Sketch Book of Fashion ' is a very
entertaining work. ' The Pavilion' lays open the back of
the puppet-show, and discovers the intrigues of a Court.
The scene is laid at Brighton, at the period when no fewer
than ' three professed imitators of the Royal Patron am-
bled along the Steyne, three prince regents in coat, wig,
black stock, and cane,—who sneezed whenever it was ru-
moured that his Royal Highness had a cold, and kept
their beds whenever Sir HENRY HALFORD visited the
Pavilion.' They were doubtless also (though Mrs. GORE
does not mention the particular) all three provided with
Marchionesses. 'My Place in the Country 'is extremely
clever and amusing. The Intrigante ' shows the way up
the back staircase of the world, and is a story of great
power. "--Examiner.

FINE ARTS.

FINDEN'S ILLUSTRATIONS to BYRO?

PART XIII.

The Thirteenth Part has just appeared, and
is graced by a very pleasing portrait of Moore,
the poet, engraved by Finden, from a painting
by Sir T. Lawrence, in the possession of Mr.
Murray. The face presents no indication of
superior genius, except in the eye, which is rest-
less, sparkling, and full-orbed. In other respects
the author of " Lalla Rookh" possesses just
such a countenance as one may meet with every
half-hour in the Strand. The remaining illus-
trations are landscapes, of which the " Swiss
Cottage at Martigny" is the most skilfully and
elaborately executed.

. . . _ .
Mr. TREiLOVE then 'rose to call die attention
of the Commissioners to this claim. lu 'Arr.
Carrol was laSt examined, a. question hat)
put to him which he.declined to answer ; he .now
wished, with the permission of the Commissioners,
-to repeat that question.—The CommtsstOALus
directed that the whole of Mr. Carrot's former
examination should be read over to hitn.'7l,.This
having been done, he was, sworn, and
LOVE put
,the following-question.:—On a fo` Paler

that of ex-parte Symes, in which.-an -Attorney

claim arose out. of transactions connected—with
bribery-at. an election. • On- being queStiOned'.ou
this head, he declined to ansWer,:and.of course
his claim was rejected. But there the-. caso.was
different—the Attorney refused to answer a`s to
the deht immediately before the Coinrassioneys ;
here Mr. Carrol had given a full account; and he
contended there was 'TM ground '.foi going, into
other transactions. Mr. carrot had clainis.dis-

now 'a right to prove, but should. the Commis•

sidered it a question of so. much importance,.,that
he should take the opinion of the Lord Chancel-

that Mr. Carrol should answer the question:—
Mr. CARROL declined doing so, anrd declared his

MAJOR ANnn.E.--The peach tree taken from
the grave, of the unfortunate Major ANDRE,k at
Tappan, and now arrived in England ,to be 'pre-
sented to
,his MAJESTY, is one of the two tat
were planted over the remains of that unfortu-
nate gentleman. The other, we understand, is
in the possession of Mr. JOHN FRASER, of -the
Ilermitage nursery, Rarnsgate, and is in a very
flourishing state. • Mr. F, in the course of
,his
botanical researches, in. the year 1816, visited
the grave of Major.ANnaE, at Tappan, and'ob-
wined the above tree, together with some tufts of

are objects of great curiosity and veneration, to

evinced towards the unfikunate Greeks more indulgence than
ttat of any other European state, and accordingly in the Vene-
' tinn eominions many of their most learned men took up their
. ree,iCence and published their works. The Greek printing-press
of Venic&supplied for a long time the whole of Greece, and we
observe that most of the modern Greek books now dispersed
over Europe bear the stamp of Venice, Unhappily for the
credit of. Greek genius, most of them are translations. About
. ti e middle of the last century, a celebrated school was
established on .Alount Athos, by Eugenius Bulgari, v.ito
was subsequently promoted to the archiepiscopal dignity,
y the Empress Catherine. This able and learned man
• translated Virgil into Homeric verse ; but as he preferred
. • he ancient to the, modern language for expressing his
. i eras, he rather retarded than promoted the literature of
•his country. After this time there appeared numerous works
t e all subjects of education ; books on grammar, on history,
/91emical divinity, &c. Subsequently, Vienna superseded Ve-
nice as the residence of the learned Greeks, and the seat of
Oreeic printing. Now we observe that a considerable number
of lio nanie works are publishing at Paris. Besides schools
fur teaching the higher branches of literature and science es-
, toilislied at -Constantinople, Janina, Smyrna, Cydonia, &c.
g ett numbers of secondary and elementary schools have been
erred in all parts of Greece. The learned Greeks who reside
• at Vi naa, Parisv or other cities of the Continent, form, by their
. tr tritatTons of literary and philosophical works, and by the
lAblication of their own acquirements, a kind of connecting
link between the literati of Europe and their less improved,
'brethren of the'Turkish empire. They become, as it were, .the
conductors of the electric fire of knowledge and genius. Our
stutfuf ete; the names of Coral; Codrika, Koumas, Ecor.omos,
Capttinaki' as, and several others, at present, able and sue-
ceuiftil laboarers in the vineyard of Grecian literature—as pro-
winters of education, and contributors to science and letters.—
Grtick students are found in many of the Universities both of
Germany and Besides the schools established in the dif-
ferent cities of Turkey, which' we have before mentioned, a
-celebrated seat -of' learning, superintended by 14 professors,

in the grecian Archipelago, ,is provided with some institution
for edu4taon. Instead; therefore, of being surprised that the
Greeks are so backward in the race of improvement, we should
• be surprised that they have made so much progress amid the
vexations, insults, and outrages of their Turkish masters.
Nothing can better evince the efforts which they have made,
or display to greater advantage the spirit with which they are
animated, than -to compare them with their masters, or with
the Albanians.- Arabs, and other tribes who compose parts of
t',e same Empire, and who are subject to the same oppressions."
The atilt ?a. of the memoir, after stating these and many other
• Bets, enters into a wall-argued &fence of his country against
the several chargeaof fanaticism, bigotry, flcc.,,that have been
brou4ht against ' them, and thus concludes:—" The picture
which 1 hire drawn demonstrates that the Greeks have not
fallen so low as certain travellersbave been pleased to aver ; and
that if placed in favourable: circumstances, they are capable of
'risingto the rank of their ancestors. But, in addition to the
• nnmerotts domestic obstacles which impede their progress, we
twat now mention the policy of Christian Europe. The Chief
of a colossal Government, who has now fallen, hinted to the
Divan-that it ought to double its distrust towards the Greeks.
• lib counsels were superfluous for any thing short of the total
extermination of our race. It is difficult to inflict upon any
people a mere calaniitous lot than that of which our nation has
been the prey for so many ages. It now pants after improve-
- -anent;it now endeavours to find consolation in the cultivation of

letiers. Europe ought to congratulate and assist— not calum-
' niate, us: Nothing about us evinces a barbarous people, or a
> race unworthy of a happier destiny."

THE SOI-DISANTE PRINCESS OF CUMBERLAND.
—An Evening Paper says, " We gave yesterday
a copy
.of tfie,placard announcing this personage
to be in quod. In addition to that, we havebeen•
furnished-withthe following further particulars
—That it is not :her intention to conform to the
practice usual with persons under arrest for debt,
namely, 'to give bail. She will, therefore, have
to remain.in durance vile' until the 6th of No-
vember.
•It is not known whether she will re-'
main at her present residence or be removed
to one of • the usual places of destination
.appropriated for the reception of debtors.—
Immediately on the commencement of the
Term her case will be brought before the
Court of King's Bench. Arrangements will be
made for that purpose. The claims on the Go-
vernnient for:the payment of 15,0001. said to be
bequeathed her, by his late Majesty, together
with that on the estate of the late Duke of Kent
for 10,0001. are to be placed in the hands of
- Trustees for the purpose, on their recovery, of
liquidating her debts. Several thousand circu-
lars are distributing amongst the principal fami-
lies, acquainting them with the nature of her
claims and situation ; and the placards announc-
ing her captivity have been sent to all parts of the
kingdom for distribution.—A late Sheriff yester-
day waited upon Lord Shimouth, and remon-
strated with him upon the conduct of the Go-
vernment towards the Princess."

PARIS, OCT. 9.—A Royal Ordonance, of the
6th of this month, directs the Chamber of Peers,
and that of the Deputies, to ``assemble on Mon.
day the sth of November.

Yesterday morning, a foreigner of clistinc-1
tion, who, from his oriental, costume, appeared!,
to be a Chinese, was presented to the King,
by a Captain of the Royal Navy.
The Journal de Lyons states that a telegraphic
dispatch of the 2d countermanded the march of
the 60th regiment of the line, which had arrived
at Lyons on its route to join the sanitary cordon,
on the coasts of the Mediterranean. All appre-
hensions having ceased, this regiment will take
up its quarters at Toulouse.
A private. letter from Saragossa of the 22d
September states that " up to that'day no symp-
tom of contagion had manifested itself in that
town, nor in the province of Arragon. The au-
thorities are constantly on the alert. The su-
perior Junta of health has just interdicted all
communication between Catalonia and Arragon,
and the Municipality has ordered that all mer-
chants who have been since the 15th of 'August
last, holders of goods susceptible of being impreg-
nated with pestilential miasmata shall remove
them to the Chartreuse outside the town, in order
that they 'may go through the process of purifica-
tion ; those who do not strictly conform to this
order will be liable to heavy pains and penalties,
and even the punishment of death, authorised by
the Royal Decree of the 11th of October, 1804.
Besides these rigorous measures one of theAlcaldes,
D. Mlanuel Colleta ,has deemed it expedient to give
out of his own pocket
,the sum of 60,000 rials
(about 4001.) to be offered in rewards, each" or
1000 rials' at least, to such persons as shall dis-
cover and give information of the introduction of
goods coming from infected countries.

VIENNA,. SEPT. 28.—A„ courier arrived Iron;
,••
Petersburgh yesterday' but nothing has::: trans-.
pired respecting the contents .of his dispatches.
It is generally believed that. peace will be
maintained between Russia and the Porte ; and
it is thought these powers will soon form a defi-
nitive arrangement. What is most consolatory to
us is that the extraocdinary leVies have been dis-
continued, and that many regimehts haVe been
disbanded, with the exceptlon of.their permanent
staffs• - .

News of a very disagreeable nature has been re-
cived at Constantinople from Belgrade. Every
thing leads to the apprehension that an insurrec-
tion will soon break out in Servia, where a spirit
of discontent has long existed.

The Austrian Observer gives this day the
translation of the' Bull fulmlnated by the Pope
against the Carbonari. This Bull, which is of
great length, contains numerous quotations from
the sacred writings, in which obedience to law-
ful Sovereigns is recommended es a precept of
the divine law. His Holiness afterwards ob-
serves, that Popes Clement XII. and Benedict
XIV., by their briefs of the years 17f38 and
1751, had condemned .and proscribed the secret
society of Fr.eerniks ons,p{ WltiAjbat ittbe Cra,.
bonari is only a ramification. Follosving the
example of his august pred,!cessors, the So-
vereign Pontiff pronounces- the same condem-
nation and prohibition of these new sec.-
taries, fulminating the pain of excommunication
against all persons who shall become affiliated
members of the Carbonari, or who shall not im-
mediately withdraw from the association. his
Holiness moreover subjects to the same pain
every ecclesiastic or layman who shall not give
information to his Bishop against all persons
I whom lie knows to belong to the proscribed
sect. No Catholic, lastly, can, without a mani-
fest contravention of the injunctions of this bull,

MAYENC-E SEPT. 28.—1 t seems quite certain
that Prussia has presented to the Central Corn-
miision of the N'avigation of the Rhine a plan
which leads us to hope that every thing will
soon be finally, arranged with respect to the na-
vigation of this river throughout its whole extent.
All'the members of the Central COMMISSic/11 have
•
sent copies of the Note of Prussia to their res-
pective Courts,- apd as, -soon as they receive
answers, the plan will be communicated to the
public.
MADRID, SEPT. 27.--Eight clays have not yet
elapsed.since the returmof their Majesties to the
-capital, and we already feel the beneficial effects
of the presence of a father in the midst of his
family. This state of security and confidence, to
which we are kittle,accotomed, annoys the dis-
affected, whose hopes are founded on the preva-
lence of. disorder., These artisans of discord
wish above all things to gain over to their cause
-the military, who are constantly the object of
their flattery. To the brave. soldiers, they are
continually repeating, is Spain indebted for her
constitutional system, and on them do the friends
of liberty place their utmost reliance.
These maneuvies have lost much of the effect
they produced in the beginning of the Revolu-
tion ; if the Spanish -Soldiers then followed,- too
blindly. the steps of wtne of their leaders, it is
,easy to, perceive they will now willingly march
in the true path of duty.; a proof of which was
given in the zeal with which they recently
i seconded-the energy of the. Political Chief, when
'`the factious wished to prostitute to a seditious
character the-honours due alone to true heroes.

The Revolutionists thought that the honour-
able conduct maintained by the troops on the
18th gave them an opportunity of sowing discord
between the Regiments of the Line and the Na-
tional Guards; and :::cordingly reported that the
latter had boasted they alone had restored order,
and they alone deserved to be rewarded. The
disaffected might have succeeded in disturbing
the good humour subsisting between these two
descriptions of forces, if a frank explanation had
not taken place between the Officers, which has
removed all alleged causes of offence.
It is affirmed that the King has promoted Bri-
gadier Don Jose Martinez, Political Chief of
Madrid, to the rank of Major-General. Don
Joachim Albista is appointed, by the King, Poli-
tical Chief,pro tempore, of the province of La
Mancha.

e learn from Marseilles, under date the 3d
instant, that the labourer who was removed to
the Lazaretto, on suspicion of being infected with
the yellow fever, is quite recovered, and that
not a single patient remained in the Lazaretto at
that period.
News from Catalonia, dated the Ist of this
mouth, mention that the contagion has manifested
itself in the village of Garcia. A Lazaretto has
been established at Figueras, for the reception of
persons suspected of having come from Barcelona,
not one of whom has yet been taken ill. The
Bulletin published respecting the state of health
at Barcelona, from the 2Gth to the 28th of Sep-
tember, reports as follows :

LONDON,
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1821.

• :We most heartily rejoice in the prosperous
result of the Quarter's Revenue, as presented in •
the Official Statement in a preceding part of our
Paper. The increase on the Quarter .ended Oc-
tober 10, as compared with the correSpondiug
Quarter of last year, amounts to the very .large
sum of 837,26-1/. There is still, it is true,. a
falling off in the Revenue of the: whole .year end' •
ing 10th October, as compared with the yetir':
ending 10th October, 1820, of 115,608/. ; bot
still the immense improvement which has taken
place in the last three months, must, if it continue
progressive, after every allowance has been made
for the extraordinary expenditure occasioned. Of
the Coronation, speedily place the finances of the.
country in a highly flourishing condition.'
financial point of view, therefore, the preseo
state of the revenue is a; matter of unmixed exul'
tation, and has already produced a very favenv-
able. impression on the funds. In the whole
.
year there is an increase in the Custom's, the
StaMps; the AsSessed Taxes, and the LP'
Taxes ; and: a decrease in. the Excise, the rest:.
Office, *and the Miscellaneous. IQ the* c,„artei
there is an increase iu the Customs, the EXciset
the Stamps, the Assessed Taxes,* and the Lar'a
Taxes ; and a decrease in the Post-Office and tbe,
Miscellaneous only. It is true that the principal
part of the increase, viz. 597,2051. is on the Excise"
Which of course was the branch of the revenue nwst
certain to be increased by the manner in which the
Coronation was. celebrated. throughout the king,'
dorn ; but still only a part of the vast addition w
has actually taken place can have arisen frers
,j:
Ithat extraordinary circumstance.; and as there
also a great improvement on some other branches
which could not have been affected by the Ceria;
nation, it is obvious that the prosperity of Geri
'revenue has been advancing from the influence n
causes wholly unconnected with the nat,„
celebrations of that splendid ceremonv.---Inna.
financial point of view, therefore, there is reas;
to rejoice at the solid and important advantages
,
which the Revenue haS obtained.* We are ferry •
to say, however, that we are by no means 50 cer:
tain that the improvement of the Revenue Is,
proof .of any substantial: improvement in !II:
domestic affairs of the country. At a "1-
when the Agricultural Interests are nekn°`"
!edged to be sinking under the pressure of over:
whelming. difficulties, it is very possible that coif
.portion of the people may have been expendi%

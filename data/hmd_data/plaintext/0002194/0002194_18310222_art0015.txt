DUTIES ON COTTON.
jeje, lle, CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER begged
foN, before the Noble Marquis (Chacdos) opposite brought
,dalotrdtihis motion respecting the West Indian sugar duties,
eto_
to y.state the arrangements which Ministers ha I
tije'e) with respect to the duty on cotton. He had de-
sai,%n a former occa,ion to state those arrangements,
Manchester
the result of a conference with a ,teputtion of
ail cotton-manufacturers on the subject. He had
had that conference since he last addressed the House, and
01tri.eorne to a settlement quite satisfactory to these gent'e-
..re His plan was this :—He proposed to substitute for
duPt,. present 6 per cent. ad ralorem duty on printed calicoes,
With' °t of ld. per pound on all imports of raw cotton,
fro nut he
ntutstoy drawback export duty—exeer ing, of course,
operation of the tax, the cotton of our East Indian
aind Other4B possessions. He meant also, for reasons which
duty.')"' state on another occasion, to allow the drawback
gill operate for three months.
tow R. PEEL was understood to ask the Noble Lord
„," meant to make good the loss to the revenue from
the
reduction of duty on printed calicoes?
ths CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said that
heZnount of the East India duty was so trifling, as to
lists:l'ost beneath consideration. The amount of the other
es,orii‘._vould not make up the loss in question ; but the
pti4,_"‘t of that duty, together with that of the duty on
1'17: calicoes, would make it up.
tie he of CHANDOS was sorry to learn that
J'ancellor of the Exchequer had stated that it was
litii°'"ilde for him to extend any hope of relief to the West
U
inistiterest. He could assure the House that the dis-
tsyer:,
and
which that interest was now suffering was very
Opoott.,. that it was owing to the heavy duty imposed
r.taavin.s't sugar as a war tax, which ought to have been
rots, ° when the war ceased. He therefore now came
trS4rd to ask the Government publicly, to take the
sfreZvshgar duties into their consideration, with a view
ilrastd,
nig them. Such a measure might evidently be
lesser as it was quite clear to the must unreflecting ob-
Qaa the finance plan of Government fur the year

!testiose'erument as had formerly joined with him in ad_
he allult.he claims of the West India body to relief (and
71,t,Leiparticularly to the Vice-President of the Board
;.vese, an to consider what their former opinions had
etltie_a stand by them at present. The Right Hon.
",htstid`n n had said, that though he was no planter, he
'erest at all times he ready to support the West India in-
-snfl had then put it to the House whether the

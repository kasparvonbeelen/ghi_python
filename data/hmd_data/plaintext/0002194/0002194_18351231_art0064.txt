to the amount of little more than a million sterling. The

vious year.

29. The Message of the President of the United State 3
at the opening of Congress, on the 7th of this, month, was
published in this Journal. The President entered at
great length into the history of the dispute between France
and the United States, and intimated his determination not
to accede to the condition required by France before the
indemnity should be paid. He announced at the same
time the extraordinary fact that the National Debt had
beet► paid off, and that as there were no further use for the
offices of Commissioners of Loans and Sinking Funds, they
ought to be abolished ; he added that the country was in
the highest state of prosperity, and at peace with all the
world ; that the naval force in existence, not being ade-
quate for the protection of their commerce, ought to be
increased, and that measures must be adopted to prevent
the circulation of anti-slavery tracts, or, as he describes
them, "incendiary publications, intended to instigate the
slaves to insurrection."

The difference in the price of the British and Foreign
Funds at the beginning and end of the year is very trifling,
and does not require any particular notice.:

ME. GRATTAN'S NEW WORK.—The new novel
from the pen of the distinguished aukhor of " Highways
and Byways," is entitled " Agnes ae Mansfeldt." Mr.
Grattan has been most happy in the selection of the histo-
rical epoch that he has so vividly illustrated. It is perhaps
the best proof of
.the mental powers which Mr. Grattan
posse,sses, that even when he digresses from his story, his
matter is still attractive. His reflections on national policy
—his views of society—his descriptions of scenery—his
portraiture of human passions and feelings, are all the
creations of a master-mind. The volumes must become
very popular.

The Jersey farmers are petitioning the States for a
prohibition of French produce, and for other measures to
protect the agriculture of the country. They especially
complain that the exportation to England of potatoes, which
are the principal agricultural produce of the country, is now
at an end, owing to the extensive cultivation of the root.—

TIIE UNKNOWN AUTHOR OF MY AUNT PONTY-
rooL.—Rumour has been busy in the coteries of literary
gossips with the name of the author of this work, and the
gentleman himself appears really anxious by,, the preface for
the preservation of the anonymous. It is a clever produc-
tion, and one in which the excellencies are very numerous.
The author is not military, but nevertheless his descriptions
of battles are spirit-stirring, and his reflections upon them
such as would suggest themselves to a cultivated and en-
thusiastic mind. The work abounds with admirably drawn
characters, and we would particularly direct the attention
of our readers to one of the happiest of the author's crea-
tions—my Aunt Pontypool.
